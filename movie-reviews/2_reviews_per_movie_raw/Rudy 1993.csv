"comickoz","10","33","35","28 December 2001"," A terrific inspiring movie
","This is a movie for everyone who ever felt like the little person, overlooked by those who were bigger or more popular. ""Rudy"" had kind of a lame title for a sports movie, and i remember the first time I saw a preview of it, I was totally moved and involved by the scenes and then guffawed aloud at the end when the announcer intoned, ""RUDY."" That set the rest of the theater laughing too, so imagine my surprise when i saw it a couple months later and it was a 10 out of 10 in my book. I'm not even a sports fan but this movie got me. It shows the power of faith to get by with any frustration in life, the performances are great and it's a shame that Sean Astin had to wait eight years to get another great break with ""Lord of the Rings."" His is a worldclass performance in this film, see it as it is one of the most inspiring films you'll ever see."
"gwenivere_pendragon","8","51","56","24 May 2004"," Better that I expected
","To be completely honest, I was actually impressed with this film. It is sweet, but there is an honesty and a strong sense of realism at the heart of this film, which to me, provides the base of its appeal. ""Rudy"", unlike the majority of films about athletes, paints a picture of the real everyman (basically, the jock who isn't a jock) and it does so in a way that is plausible from start to finish. Working hard, eating, breathing and sleeping the game does not mean that you will wind up the star quarterback. Rudy's struggles are genuine: his family is poor and has never sent anyone to college, his grades are sub-par (largely the result of an undiagnosed learning disorder), he can't afford his junior college let alone Notre Dame and Rudy is, at best,only a moderate athlete. It is in the way that he overcomes these obstacles (not to mention the beautiful performance by Sean Astin) which provides the refreshing realism which is at core of this film. ""Rudy"" is what sports are really all about."

","I found the movie to be inspirational, a little cliched and always interesting.  Sean Astin made me believe in the character he played and I also enjoyed Charles S. Dutton.  You know how the movie will end, unless you were born yesterday, but its still satisfying and I wasn't ashamed to shed a tear...."
"LebowskiT1000","8","58","67","19 November 2002"," Inspirational Movie
","This is a great film about going for your dreams and never giving up.  No matter who tells you that you can't do it, no matter how unlikely the chances are, no matter what, make sure you go for your dreams and do everything that you can make them come true.<br/><br/>Sean Astin delivers one of his best performances to date.  He plays the character of Rudy Ruettiger perfectly!  He was an excellent choice for the role and he deserves a great deal of credit for his work (as does the true life Rudy).  The rest of the cast was quite good as well; Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty, Lili Taylor, Charles Dutton, Robert Prosky, and Vince Vaughn (in one of his first roles).  All of the supporting cast was excellent.<br/><br/>If you like inspirational movies, or just movies about football (although there is much more to this movie than just football), then I highly recommend you see this film.  I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"jgil-1","10","65","80","22 February 2004"," Better than ""Rocky""
","This movie was dubbed a football version of ""Rocky"" except for one exception --it is an actual true story!!  If you can watch ""Rudy"" and not have a lump in your throat during several scenes, especially the ending, then you are a hard to please critic!!  This movie deserved much better than the 7.1 than the ""critics"" gave it.  Sean Austin did a magnificent job playing overachieving Rudy and for those who ridiculed the fact that he only played a few seconds at the end of a lopsided game missed the whole point of the story.  Rudy's dream was to play football at Notre Dame and earn everyone's respect (including his doubting family).  With his lack of talent for both academics and athletics, the mere fact that he was even admitted into Notre Dame after struggling so hard to get good grades at Holy Cross (the Junior College Rudy went to in an attempt to prove himself worthy of Notre Dame since he had been out of High School for several years and made poor grades in High School.)  He overcame his learning problems that had held him back in High School and this was a monumental achievement in itself.  The scene where he was finally admitted into Notre Dame on his final attempt (he had been rejected 3 earlier times) was uplifting indeed.  Rudy overcame reading difficulties thru hard work much the same way he overcame his lack of size to make the Notre Dame's football team --thru a gut-busting, never quit attitude.  His teammates were so impressed with his attitude that they forced the coach (Dan Devine, a real jerk in the movie) to dress him for the final game.  The final scene where the entire stadium was hollering ""Rudy, Rudy, Rudy"" in an effort to get him into the game at the end was spine-tingling!  Rudy busting thru the line to sack the quarterback at the end of the game and get carried off the field with the stadium going nuts chanting his name---Well, movies don't get any better than this.  And all this really happened!!  Amazing how one of the best stories ever told in movies involve an ""average Joe"" who achieved his dream thru hard work----a Horatio Alger story indeed--10 out of 10 definitely ---For some of you ""critics"" that rated it worse than a ""7"" --you should take a class in movie critic reviews --you definitely would flunk my class if you gave this one a worse score than that!!"
"Casa2000","Null","27","31","13 February 2000"," A Celluloid Heart
","One of the most wonderful things a film can do is be so moving and triumphant that it makes you cry. You aren't crying because Bambi mother's was killed or because Jack Dawson went down with the ship; instead you are identifying with the power of the human spirit. Rudy is an ordinary man, you could even argue that he is less than ordinary in regards to his physical tributes and academic capacity, but he achieves an extraordinary feat. He leads with his heart, even when he doesn't fully understand why he is putting himself through such perils. He seeks to prove himself to others, to all those who doubted him and he thrives to achieve his goal for those few who believed in him. And eventually, when he tested in his darkest moment, his epipany comes: he needs to do this for himself.<br/><br/>Sean Astin is brilliant in his role as Notre Dame's most famous would-be underachiever. He plays Rudy with such dedication and determination that it is impossible not to be impressed by his perseverance, inspired by his courage, and touched by his passion for the game. <br/><br/>The story is wonderfully told by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. Jerry Goldsmith's score and Oliver Wood's cinematography truly capture the power and beauty of the story. This film is an incredible achievement. It touches its viewers right where it counts: in the heart. And the film has its own emotional centre, its own eloquent theme which everyone can identify with. We all have dreams, but we don't all strive to attain them because sometimes our work ethnic does not live up to our aspirations. As a result, Rudy is an inspiration to anyone who thought they couldn't hang in there or don't think they have the potential to even try. You can do anything you but your heart and mind to, it is just a question of maintaining that integrity for the entire journey. <br/><br/>Every single time I watch ""Rudy"", tears race down my face. This film makes me want to strive for all that I thought I can be and attain the most seemingly intangible achievements in life. It is important to have things in life which help you to realize your dreams and persuade you to act on them. ""Rudy"" is mine."

","Rudy is a story that pulls at every heart string and emotions you possibly could have. Why? Well it doesn't have to do with the actors, though they are all great. It doesn't have to do with the filming, it isn't what draws us in. It is one thing. The one major fact.<br/><br/>The True Story. To watch and see how Rudy overcomes every obstacle he faces. To see how Rudy truly triumphs, even if it isn't the best possible success for someone, for Rudy it is everything.<br/><br/>This movie is a story that teaches a lesson. It is about football, but it is about believing. Never giving up. Always giving it your all.<br/><br/>Rudy is a movie that gives us something to believe in. Believe."
"Agent10","8","43","53","8 June 2002"," Today's spoiled athletes should take notes
","One of my favorite football movies of all time, this film follows in the long tradition of great sports movies which can uplift the spirit through means other than winning the big game and getting the girl or some other typical Hollywood convention. The music, cinematography and acting was excellent in this film, especially considering the terrible film choices Sean Astin had before embarking on this movie. While this was really an homage to Notre Dame football, a person could really look at Rudy and see a little of themselves inside the relatively small man. Charles Dutton had one of the greatest speeches in the history of sports cinema, and he should have gained more notoriety for his performance in this film."
"samone832003","10","13","14","27 September 2006"," Absolutely Fantastic!
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was in middle school some years back. Back then they showed every student this movie in the seventh grade, but I really fell in love with it. I remember just being in awe and really getting into it.Especially seeing as I'm a girl and girls don't like football or sports movies. But its one really transcends genders. The music really plays a key part and can move you to tears. The acting was spot on and its impossible not to identify with Rudy.Its the type of movie that when someone says they don't really care for it, you're like""That's blasphemy!"" How could you not like it? Plus there are some great appearances by some movie stars, before they made it big. Every time I watch this movie or hear the music, I'am inspired."
"Cause9isFine","Null","46","61","15 June 2004"," Rudy
","If this movie doesn't get you motivated, then something is wrong with you. This movie proves that good things happen to people who work hard and don't except the circumstances they are dealt. I've seen this movie more than 30 times in my life, and i still cant get through the end of this movie without getting tears in my eyes. Another thing this movie teaches you is to listen to the people in your life who believe in you and want you to succeed, don't listen to the people who want you to fail and constantly remind you that your going to fail. ""The best revenge is success."" One of my favorite quotes comes from this movie as well, when the coach dan devine tells rudy and the rest of the team that ""Nobody, and i mean nobody, comes into our house and pushes us around."""
"don_the_bomb","10","42","56","27 May 2002"," The Most Inspiring Movie Ever!!!!
","RUDY is the greatest football movie of all time. Wait, did I say 'football movie'? I meant movie. Period. Between the gut-wrenching acting by Sean Astin, tear-jerking moments of the climax, the miraculous true story of a short man fighting to make his lifelong dreams come true, you'll be rooting for Rudy throughout the film. Rudy's dream is a selfless act of triumph that can do nothing but good for the entire human race. You can't help but ride right along with Rudy for the roller-coaster of emotions that ensues, leading up to the greatest moment of his life, a moment that will resonate in the very fiber of your being. This movie shows that dreams really can come true. If you put your mind (and body) to it, and if you have a big enough heart, you too can accomplish anything! After watching this movie, I was inspired to try just that much harder at everything I do, in hopes of one day becoming half the man that Rudy is. This movie is genuine, heart-felt emotion that will touch the inner depths of your soul. From the biggest person to the smallest, one and all will be reaching for the tissues after enjoying, nay, living, every moment of this film. Warning: don't watch the movie alone. You'll want the extra arms in the room for when you're hugging each other in celebration, and an extra voice erupting with cheers for the single greatest movie hero of all time: RUDY."
"bob the moo","Null","10","12","3 November 2003"," Too sentimental but a good look at the American Dream
","Every since he was a boy, Rudy Ruettiger has dreamed that he would play football for Notre Dame college.  However his grades are low in high school and he misses out  ending up at his dad's steel mill.  When his closest friend is killed on the job, Rudy sets out to follow his dream and enlists at Holy Cross college to get his grades and takes on jobs within Notre Dame to make his dream come true.<br/><br/>I taped this as I thought it would be the traditional sports movie where the underdog comes through to win the big game at the key moment.  Happily this film aspires to be more than that and is very obvious that it has no desire to be a football film, in fact the game isn't really shown until the final few moments of the film.  Of more interest is the look at Rudy's dream and how it is very difficult to reach, he has to work very hard to get his dream, it isn't something that he is entitled too or has dropped in his lap  it is an American Dream build on work and persistence.  The story is inspiring but is also mixed in reality  Rudy's dream amounts to one tackle and 8 seconds of game time.  This took away a little from his story, but also it made it a better ending  his appearance is in a game already won with only seconds left, but it's HIS dream.<br/><br/>The film is way too sentimental and mawkish at times, but it's strong theme still makes it work and be enjoyable.  The cast do a good job on the whole but it is Astin's movie and he does a great job in the lead, maybe only being a bit too nice at times.  Favreau is OK in a small role, as is Beatty but Taylor has almost nothing to do and barely shows her face.  Dutton is good as always.  However the film does rest of Astin's abilities and he does it well.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good sports movie except it isn't really a sports movie. Despite it being sentimental and slightly predictable it is still a good story of chasing a dream and fair comment on the fact that the `American Dream' is not just something that happens, it is something to be worked on and chased, and even then  not everyone's dream will result in them being rich etc, but, it says, in America, if you work hard and persevere, then anything is possible."
"e-m-hobo","9","4","4","28 October 2019"," I'm pretty sure I felt a tear in my eye...
","This is what we Europeans like to call an American movie, which means it's about hopes and dreams and it leaves you crying. Sometimes it isn't so much about winning with your team, although winning doesn't hurt either, but it's about being on the team, being able to walk out there... And that's what this movie is about.<br/><br/>It's also about finding your path, your brothers, your other brothers, and being an inspiration to all that don't believe and knowing that they do want to believe. I really enjoyed this movie. And I'm really glad I watched it at home, alone, so no one saw my crying.<br/><br/>Now I'm going to play my guitar to let it all out. I'm sure my neighbors will like that at this hour. (Spoiler alert.)"
"mycannonball","10","4","4","7 August 2008"," Good Again and Again
","There aren't a lot of movies that I watch more than once, and there are very few that I watch many times. This is one of those movies that I have seen almost a dozen times over the years, and I never get sick of it.<br/><br/>""Rudy"" is the classic underdog story. Rudy, played with strength and vulnerability by Sean Astin, is an underdog in football because of his small size, and he's an underdog in school because he has to work twice as hard to get the good grades. He'is a hard worker with a big heart whose had his share of pain in life, so an audience member I celebrate when he does & feel sad when he does.<br/><br/>This film has all the right pieces  a great story inspired by a true one, beautiful directing, a fantastic musical score, great football scenes, and emotional punch. This is definitely my favorite sports movies, and it is one of my top 10 all-around movies. It is inspirational and moving, AND it is entertaining!"
"Sam Mamish","Null","4","4","15 May 2000"," Excellent work
","What can I say? I've seen the movie three times, and each time I was moved by the story of the kid who wouldn't let his dream die.<br/><br/>Even though I grew up Protestant in Texas and loved the Longhorns, I reveled in the history and the tradition of Notre Dame football. While I was in junior high and high school, I read lots of books on the history of college football, and naturally Notre Dame was a prominent part of each book. I can only imagine how strong a pull Notre Dame would have had for a football-loving boy in a Catholic family in the Midwest in the '50s and '60s. I thought the filmmakers did a reasonable job of showing enough about the conflicts in Rudy's life without getting mired in a lot of subplots that in my opinion would've detracted from the storyline.<br/><br/>I like the fact that they spent so much time actually developing the story of how he struggled to get to become a Notre Dame student. A lot of filmmakers might've opted to focus on the actual Notre Dame experience, which I think would've made the film a lot less effective.<br/><br/>Anyway, the music was wonderful, Sean Astin gave a great but understated performance, all the football sequences were real enough to make you wince, my wife who knows next to nothing about football or Notre Dame loved the movie, and it made me want to head to South Bend someday and take in a game.<br/><br/>Why do so many great sports films (Breaking Away, Hoosiers, and Rudy) take place in the upper Midwest? Just a random musing...<br/><br/>And here's a little factoid that to the best of my knowledge is still correct--Terry Gannon, who played on North Carolina State's national championship basketball team in the early '80s and now is a sports broadcaster, has the actual helmet that the real-life Daniel Reuttiger wore in the game."
"blanche-2","7","6","7","14 March 2009"," Brick walls aren't to keep you out
","Sean Astin is ""Rudy"" in this 1993 true story of Rudy Ruettiger, a short, average kid who wanted to dress for the Notre Dame football team. Rudy's story is one that is used to demonstrate the power of single-mindedness and determination in the face of all odds. His story provides a great lesson - the brick walls aren't there to keep you out, they're only there to keep out the people who don't want something badly enough.<br/><br/>Rudy grows up obsessed with Notre Dame football, but he lacks the physical prowess for the game and the grades for Notre Dame. He also comes from a family, headed by Ned Beatty, whose attitude is, know your place and stay there, and whose goals are to join the union, work a union job, and have a home and family. Rudy's girlfriend wants to get married, and the only person who understands his dream is his best friend. When tragedy strikes, Rudy realizes that he has to pursue his dream or he'll never be happy.<br/><br/>This is a very inspirational film, all the more inspirational because it's true. Sean Astin gives a very natural performance as Rudy - he doesn't ""act"" in the sense of giving an emotional, big performance, but rather behaves like a young man from a lower middle class family in Joliet, Illinois, probably much as the real Rudy acted.<br/><br/>Life can be pretty frustrating and when trying to break through a glass ceiling or a brick wall like Rudy did, it's tempting to want to give up. People today want things to happen fast, too. Rudy's compelling story says that passion and perseverance can bring you a long way. Here was a kid with no money, no family support, dyslexia, average grades, who was too wimpy for football. Watch what happens to him."

","Imagine a great painter - a master if you will. What if he or she only painted 3 or 4 works in their career but their work was adored by millions? Angelo Pizzo is like that. His first screenplay, Hoosiers, was widely acknowledged as the best sports movie ever made (because, of course.. like Rudy, it's not about sports). It took years for Rudy to follow but it was worth the wait. Years after Rudy, Pizzo wrote The Game of Their Lives (renamed to The Miracle Match). If you loved Rudy, make a point to see these other films. You will love them.<br/><br/>This film is about the human heart -- it's about character, hope and dreaming. It has a lot of good lessons to teach us. All young athletes should view this film -- if I were a coach of any sport, I would show this film to my team.

","Rudy is the most motivational movie ever made, and will continue to bring tears to movie watchers eyes for years to come. Over the years, and having watched this movie some 25-35 times now, it always screams out, ""You can do anything you want if you just put your whole heart and soul into it and truly try."" Sean Astin certainly has his most inspiring role in this movie, and he translates so perfectly what a young man chasing his only dream, to play for the University of Notre Dame, can do if he sets his mind to it. The movie also represented what that period of time was like for anyone whoever wanted to play a major college sport, but was considered too small or too light. Back then, you could still walk on and be considered.<br/><br/>Whenever I watch this movie, it puts a smile on my face, a tear in my eye, and never ceases to amaze me how much a willing heart can influence so many other people. The real Rudy truly inspires the watcher with every scene, showing us that above all, persistence can make any one of us winners."
"almagz","9","3","3","11 May 2006"," Beyond the Individual
","Rather than repeat the many parallels to Rocky etc., or concentrate on the underdog prevails theme which is obvious, Rudy's value reaches beyond himself. Football is a team sport and though Rudy may become a mediocre component of the team from a strictly athletic point of view, his dedication and doggedness actually provide the team with an intangible ingredient.<br/><br/>The inspirational speeches Rudy practices repeating early on are more or less done as a fan of Notre Dame. His efforts when actually there transcend the fan and become inspirational by example. The story may be rather simple and the ending predictable, but what's wrong with a true-life based account that makes one feel good? A movie I would recommend dragging one's children to see. They may not like or understand football, but that is not what it is really about. It is about values, and good ones at that.<br/><br/>The chances of this being shown on MTV are slim."
"budmassey","10","3","3","28 May 2001"," Inspirational in a way that only a sports movie can be.
","If you have ever struggled to achieve an impossible goal, dreamed of the almost unattainable, and then attained it, this is your movie. Sports movies are easy, because there's the built in conflict and triumph of athletic competition. But sometimes a film rises above the genre. Based on a true story, Rudy is among the best of such films, and completes the holy trinity of sports movies; Baseball - The Natural, Basketball - Hooisers, and Football - Rudy. (If you don't have them go immediately to your local video store and buy them. I'll wait here till you get back.)<br/><br/>Sean Astin's determination and sincerity are moving. He's five feet nothing, but he actually makes the team for Notre Dame football, in a time when that meant something. Rising through staggering odds, and crushing setbacks, including the death of his best friend, working in a steel mill, a detour to junior college, and the selective admissions process at Notre Dame, he dreams the impossible dream, and then lives it. <br/><br/>There are brilliant supporting actors; Ned Beatty as Rudy's dad, Jon Favreau as his mentor, Robert Prosky as the priest who helps him find his way, and Charles Dutton as the grounds keeper who opens doors for him, literally. The references to actual Notre Dame football give the story its foundation. But Sean Astin, never before or after better, or nearly as good, gives the performance of his young life.<br/><br/>All sports movies are a bit predictable, and they're usually designed to put a lump in your throat, and of course they only appeal to 49% of the population (sorry), but Rudy is inspirational in a way that only a sports movie can be. <br/><br/>It was a bit unsettling seeing Father Karras as Ara Parseghian, I kept expecting his eyes to turn yellow or something. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone who's having a crisis of faith from the obstacles that stand between us and our goals, large and small."

It is a great portrait of Notre Dame Football at its best, The brewing, underdog tensions of the film are excellently portrayed in a very real way. After their initial mistrust and hostility, the players' realizations that they are a team and not that different after all is really riveting to watch, Each of the prominent players has a distinct personality and is portrayed very well.

","There have been hundreds of movies made about sports, but few can make you cry and cheer at the same time. Rudy is more than a sports film. It's based on the true story of a man named Daniel E. ""Rudy"" Ruettiger, who went against all odds and was on the very prestigious Notre Dame football team. In real life, Rudy was only 5'6 and only 165 pounds when he played on the team. Playing football at that height and weight is not normal. Rudy had always been too small to play football and was told that many times by friends and family. After a tragic death of a close friend, Rudy becomes determined to attend Notre Dame and play on the football team. Rudy attends a community college to get good grades to have a chance at being admitted to Notre Dame. Through struggles of grades and life, Rudy attends Notre Dame and tries out for the team making it as a walk on. As a walk on, he may never dress for a game, but he gives it all he has at every single practice putting more heart into practice than most guys put into a championship game. If you know the story of Rudy, than you know how it will end. Yet, whether you have seen it or not, grab the tissues and prepare for the ending. You will not have tears of sorrow but tears of joy. In the famous 'Rudy' chant scene, you will find yourself joining in hoping for his chance. Rudy gives hope to all people out there teaching us that no matter what people tell you, you can do anything you want. Rudy will inspire you to go after your dreams."

","Okay, I admit it: I graduated from Notre Dame in 1981, just after this wonderful story actually happened.  And as a ""Domer"", this movie has a special place in my heart.  I cry every time Rudy gets that last letter from the admissions office -- I remember my own fears the day I got mine from Notre Dame.  So, I can't be objective about ""Rudy"" -- I have a personal, sentimental attachment to its heart-warming story.<br/><br/>But after talking with many, many others who have seen this terrific film -- most of whom don't know anything about Notre Dame or its legendary football teams -- I now realize that everyone who has seen ""Rudy"" has found real inspiration in its story.<br/><br/>Sean Astin does a remarkable job playing someone that overcame his limitations through sheer perseverance.  I must admit that the pacing of the film slows a bit in the middle -- a little judicious editing would have kept the story moving a bit better -- but this is a minor quibble.  Other than that, it's a great story, well crafted -- what more do you want from a movie?<br/><br/>One last note: many of my friends that have seen ""Rudy"" have commented to me that there really can't be families that are so fanatical about Fighting Irish football.  Believe me, that part of the story is as real as it gets -- trust me on that one.<br/><br/>Watch ""Rudy"" -- you'll love it.  Oh, and GO IRISH!"
"tarmcgator","8","2","2","2 April 2001"," Rudy: Entertaining, inspiring, and fictionalized
","Yes, I cry watching this movie, too. The first audio CD I ever bought was the Jerry Goldsmith score, and I play it when I need a lift. The value here, lost on some, is NOT that if you persist, you'll achieve your most cherished dreams. One has to know his limitations, as Harry Callahan once said. No, the real value of this film is that there are men and women who are part of a collective undertaking -- a sports team, a military unit, a business, a musical ensemble -- who do their jobs in an unspectacular way, who are never stars, never celebrated, and yet are all-important to the functioning and success of that group. Rudy was lucky to receive (or, perhaps, ambitious enough to seek out) the recognition denied to so many who serve well but without special distinction, who never gain notoriety. In our celebrity-mad culture, where everyone wants to be a star, it's valuable to recognize that the grunts really make everything work. The stars can't succeed alone. They are beautiful only because of the Rudys and the rest of us who make it possible for them to make the most of their talent. The film's a hokey cliche because it's so true. CHANGING THE SUBJECT: Can anyone point us to some factual info about Rudy Ruettiger? His own website perpetrates some of the myth seen in the film, but surely there must be some articles out there that give a factual background against which the film can be compared? For example, I believe I read somewhere that Ruettiger served in the Navy before entering college, and that the death of his ""best friend"" never occurred. Or, for example, Dan Devine has said it was HIS idea to let Rudy dress out in the Georgia Tech game, but that he permitted himself to be portrayed as a ""villain"" to heighten the screen drama. What other departures from the facts are depicted in the film? I don't mind a fictionalized film, but it would be nice to have some hard facts to compare it with. Any suggestions?"

","** SPOILERS INSIDE **<br/><br/>This is an excellent example of what movies are supposed to do -- uplift and inspire.  Based on the true story of Daniel 'Rudy' Reuttiger, a short, thin, talent-challenged young man who defies the odds and his family to achieve his dream of playing Notre Dame football.  Along the way, he overcomes mild dyslexia to become the first member of his family to graduate from college.<br/><br/>The performances are very good.  Sean Astin is not necessarily associated with great performances, but he aces this one.  One of the most moving scenes in the movie is when Rudy is finally accepted into Notre Dame.  Jon Favreau is great as D-Bob. Charles Dutton almost steals the movie as Fortune, the groundskeeper who looks after Rudy and gives him some final inspiration.<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is that Rudy doesn't become a football star or or win the big game -- he achieves his dreams in small ways, and he never stops believing it could happen.  Along the way, he receives help from many people, not one man against the world.  This recurrent theme reaches its zenith in the final scenes, where all of his teammates conspire to get him into the game.  Football is a team sport, and life is a team pursuit.  No man makes it by himself.<br/><br/>And one last thing, for the guy who thought that this was just a ""two-hour propaganda film for Notre Dame"": if that's all you got out of this movie, it's no big surprise that you're a Trojan fan.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","This movie looks and feels like some dramas of yesteryear.  It has the old -fashioned good feeling at the end.  There are great performances all the way around especially from Sean Astin who plays the title character.  You really want Rudy to succeed and when he does you can't help but get a tear in your eye.  This movie represents the innocence of college football and college in general.  It's a message that says having the will to succeed can pay off in the end."

","As a long time Georgia Tech fan, you would think I wouldn't like this movie since we are the focus of the climatic scene in the movie (the losing team), however, that's not the case. I found the movie well acted, inspiring and entertaining.<br/><br/>There is one glitch, however. Since the movie purports to show a ""real"" game between Tech and ND I offer this: This is a small but interesting inaccuracy. The Georgia Tech Quarterback portrayed in the movie is wearing number ""19"", a factual impossibility because NO Georgia Tech player ever wears #19. That number was worn by freshman sensation and AA Clint Castleberry who played at Tech in 1941, then went off to WWII, was shot down off the coast of N. Africa while on a bombing mission and never recovered. In his honor, the #19 was retired and is never to be worn by any Tech player."

","Let me make something very clear: I am NOT an athlete. I do not run, jog, play sports, throw crap, catch crap, tackle people, or anything like it. I do enjoy watching college football and the Texas Rangers, and I do play lousy football at thanksgiving and SuperBowl Sunday, but otherwise, no. Similarly, I have little sympathy for the sappy sports story. I am very proud to say I have never ever seen Rocky, and generally disliked Friday Night Lights. Now, let me make something else very clear: Rudy is one of my favorite movies of all time. The reason? Great acting, great story, great characters. I connected so well with Rudy, being a lil short myself and lacking the self-esteem every now and then. I also come from a big sports-loving family big into college football. Maybe that has something to do with it. This movie made me forget it was about sports- because it really wasn't! It was about RUDY RUDY RUDY!!!

"blazesnakes9","8","3","4","20 October 2013"," The littlest guy goes up against the odds
","Sports movies always have a appeal on me. In my perspective, they are categorized as inspiring, moving and emotional. Some of those sports movies that are in that category are Rocky, The Natural, Hoosiers and Breaking Away. Rudy is a exception to the rule. It's premise is so moving and so touching that we forget that we're watching a story being developed. Sean Astin plays the title character and he plays a young kid from Joliet, who dreams of becoming a Norte Dame football player. His parents, especially his father, played by Ned Beatty, are shocked and try to convince Astin's character to think about his choice. The family that he lives in isn't rich, as the father said to his son. So, Rudy, Astin's character, works his way to achieve his dream. But, there are drawbacks that comes in his way when trying to pursue his dream. His older brother of the family dies during work and Rudy goes to Holy Cross. In order for Rudy to be transfers to Notre Dame, he has to have good grades and also have to be at the top of his game. Finally, Rudy does get into Notre Dame and his dreams of success falls into failures and redemption as he fights his way toward the end. As I said before, Rudy is a exception to the rule. It does has a very nice premise to the story. It is also moving in the way Astin portrays his character. This 5 foot kid is trying real hard to pursue his dream and achieve his goal. The movie is not only about sports, but also about academics. It's a familiar ground cover that most kids fall into because kids who do play sports have to be aware of their academics as well. Ned Beatty, who plays the father, gives a very fine performance. And also, Charles S. Dutton plays a janitor, who works at Notre Dame and befriends Rudy. He too give a very good and a very strong screen presence. The reason why I said that is because Dutton explains to Rudy the meaning of success and the meaning of failure. Failure is not a option. Success is a winner. Rudy works as a moving, inspiring and very well-told true story that is based on the real Rudy Ruettiger that attended Notre Dame in 1975. The movie is also directed by David Anspaugh, who also directed Hoosiers. He does know how to make a very good sport movie, with all the right tools and all the right performances to make it exceptional. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars."

","I love the game of football. I played it throughout high school and am now playing it in college. And this movie gave me an even greater love for football, because it gave shorter guys like me hope. Knowing that someone this short could make it that far, through his hard work and dedication, made me feel like a 5 foot 9 inch guy like me could do the same if i tried. And I just truly enjoyed the storyline and how he got his chance to play. His whole life people told him that he was too short and too skinny (not strong enough, etc.). And he ignored that, and that is why this became one of the greatest underdog stories of all time. I also enjoyed the acting by Sean Astin and all the supporting actors who made this film magical. I recommend this movie to all football fans, and especially Notre Dame or underdog fans."

","This is the ultimate underdog movie. A forgotten gem that is actually the greatest sports movie of all time. The reason this rings out as such an achievement in the sports movie realm is because of how personal it is. The audience spends every moment with Rudy, and we cheer, grunt, and cry through every moment with him. We FEEL for him. We feel the thud of each fall, the sting of each injury, and the triumph of each victory. This movie is also the master of montages as Jerry Goldsmith's score rings out over the showcasing of each moment that we grow closer to Rudy because even the montages are personal to Rudy. None of this would be possible had it not been for Sean Astin giving one of the most underrated performances of all time. This all culminates in a final game that will leave the audience in tears cheering as if their team had just won the Superbowl."

","You don't have to be a Notre Dame fan, or even a football fan to like this movie, although it certainly makes it more fun to watch. This one gave me a good look at the impact that this particular school has (or had) when it comes to football in the United States. It's kind of hard to believe that all this actually happened at South Bend way back in 1975. Does that mean that it never happened anywhere else at all in history? That's kind of off-topic here, but it was good to watch nonetheless. This movie shows you what can happen when you decide you want to do something bad enough and all the (*fun stuff*) you sometimes have to go through to get there. I though Sean Astin did a stellar job in the lead role, he was a little weird here and there, but I think one of the interesting points about this movie is that in South Bend (and a lot of other US cities), football takes precedence over just about everything. I was also surprised to see Vince Vaughn's name in the credits as I definitely did not recognize him in the scrimmage scene. These players aren't professionals, even though some do make it that far, I thought Rudy did a good job shedding some light on how the sport of football rises to the top in terms on national pastimes in the nation. Also, it would have been cool to have actually been there to see the real Rudy make that sack and get carried off the field, but I'm not that old! The one thing I might have changed in this movie was to make the score within a TD or a FG vs. Georgia Tech and put Rudy in on 3rd or 4th down (even if that isn't the way it actually happened). I recommend that anyone liking a good sports story take the time to watch this and if you happen to be a fan of the Fighting Irish then you march over to your local video store and dish out the $20 to bring it home and watch it over and over and over again!"

We take the students through the definitions of these life success principles and have them write about how Rudy demonstrates these.

","This movie was dubbed a football version of ""Rocky"" except for one exception --it is an actual true story!!  If you can watch ""Rudy"" and not have a lump in your throat during several scenes, especially the ending, then you are a hard to please critic!!  This movie deserved much better than the 7.1 than the ""critics"" gave it.  Sean Austin did a magnificent job playing overachieving Rudy and for those who ridiculed the fact that he only played a few seconds at the end of a lopsided game missed the whole point of the story.  Rudy's dream was to play football at Notre Dame and earn everyone's respect (including his doubting family).  With his lack of talent for both academics and athletics, the mere fact that he was even admitted into Notre Dame after struggling so hard to get good grades at Holy Cross (the Junior College Rudy went to in an attempt to prove himself worthy of Notre Dame since he had been out of High School for several years and made poor grades in High School.)  He overcame his learning problems that had held him back in High School and this was a monumental achievement in itself.  The scene where he was finally admitted into Notre Dame on his final attempt (he had been rejected 3 earlier times) was uplifting indeed.  Rudy overcame reading difficulties thru hard work much the same way he overcame his lack of size to make the Notre Dame's football team --thru a gut-busting, never quit attitude.  His teammates were so impressed with his attitude that they forced the coach (Dan Devine, a real jerk in the movie) to dress him for the final game.  The final scene where the entire stadium was hollering ""Rudy, Rudy, Rudy"" in an effort to get him into the game at the end was spine-tingling!  Rudy busting thru the line to sack the quaterback at the end of the game and get carried off the field with the stadium going nuts chanting his name---Well, movies don't get any better than this.  And all this really happened!!  Amazing how one of the best stories ever told in movies involve an ""average Joe"" who achieved his dream thru hard work----a Horatio Alger story indeed--10 out of 10 definitely ---For some of you ""critics"" that rated it worse than a ""7"" --you should take a class in movie critic reviews --you definitely would flunk my class if you gave this one a worse score than that!!"

","It's a familiar tale - the underdog rising through sheer determination to overcome adversity and achieve success in sports, or in the case of Rudy, play one down for the fabled Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Modern film-goers are thought to be either too sophisticated and/or cynical to fall for such fare as ""Rudy.""  Nevertheless, this is a film that can be enjoyed by both sporting neophyte and armchair quarterback alike (speaking from personal experience, even football fans who spend autumn Saturdays rooting for the real-life Irish to lose will tear up by the final scene), due to a slew of excellent dramatic performances. Sean Astin is superb at conveying Rudy's undying optimism, while the rest of the cast gives superb performances. Ned Beatty is excellent as Rudy's well-meaning father, who tries to temper his son's delusions, telling him, ""Notre Dame is for rich kids, smart kids, great athletes. You're a Reuttiger.""  While the film dallies somewhat in emotional pandering, it hits harder than some of the first-stringers whose abuse Rudy willingly absorbs in practice with its core message that there is more Rudy than Joe Montana (a freshman QB on the 1975 Notre Dame team that the real-life Reuttiger ""played"" for) in all of us."

There is no unnecessary distractions or flamboyance. The focus is kept on this dogged young man who just wont quit and the film is better for it. Rudy does take some liberties with the truth but it does it for dramatic reasons. I have no problem with it, since this is an inspirational film and not a real life documentary. And as far as inspirational films go, Rudy is the gold standard. (And no, I have not forgotten Rocky) In the end you can not help but root for Rudy.

","This week I watched the biography-sport-drama Rudy (1993). The logline reads ""Rudy has always been told that he was too small to play college football. But he is determined to overcome the odds and fulfill his dream of playing for Notre Dame.""The film was highly inspirational and I enjoyed watching Rudy persist. What really set this film apart for me was the level at which Rudy had to persist. He literally had no one on his corner in the beginning and had to earn every ounce of support that he ended up with. I feel like this is an important film to watch purely because of how much Rudy had to persist to achieve his dream. Often times our heroes are shown as having to overcome and obstacle or two and then he or she acheives their goal. This isn't the case for Rudy. He continued to persist when many other should have had good sense to quit.
Overall, the movie was pretty seamless in its production values. Being based on a true story the process of development for this film seemed to be pretty extensive. However, I would like to take a moment to praise the writing team. Rudy liked a girl, but their relationship was not central nor important to the story. Instead the focus of the film was on Rudy's academic career goals and stayed on them without dragging romance into it. That's rare and I was appreciative.The cinematography was also very well done and came off as very subtle and natural. I thought the movie was really well done and I would watch this with a friend."

He is undersized, non-athletic, his academics are less than desirable and even his own family doubts him, but his heart is unmatched. This is a classic motivational film that made me feel like I should get up and do something positive. I am a die-hard football fan and the way this film incorporates more than just football and keeps it interesting is stellar. This is a great film.<br/><br/>Director David Anspaugh did great job getting the best showing from his actors, but I think the most successful thing he accomplished was not allowing the football aspect to take over the whole storyline. He maintained the focus on the struggles Rudy endured to try and achieve his dream. The cinematography was also a major hit. This film effectively had everything ""football,"" from the hard hits to the stadium shots and still never lost focus.

After graduation of high school, he couldn't go to Notre dame college since he had bad grades so his dream just fall in river. He decided to start working family job, in steel mill. After death of his best friend, Pete, he decided to get back to college, but yet again his grades were too low for this one, so he had to go to other one called Holy Cross College. After some years in Holy Cross College, he got applied to Norte Dame and his dream got real. He was good student, he was getting better and better grades, playing for football team and one pretty impressive fact is he never missed any of trainings in those 2 years of playing. But, he wasn't good enough for those guys due his psychical problems. His teammates were just too strong for him, but Rudy had a faith, he had a dream that he's going to reach one day and hearth. His teammates noticed it and they respected that. They were impressed of how he can go so hard even though he got refused many times. And before their last game, they decided to help him reaching his dream by talking on their trainer to put him in first team. Trainer wasn't alright with that decision but he made it, he put him as sub. He made his debut match against Georgia tech, whole stadium was screaming his name.

His grades are down the drain, so he cannot apply to that university as a student. The movie is the true story of what he does to prove everyone wrong and seize the day.

Watching the movie, I was actually surprised that any team used ""walk-on"" guys to make the ""real team"" prepared for the game.<br/><br/>Watching the character take the repeated hits, day after day, I found that I was rooting for him to get his chance.<br/><br/>I found that the team actually wanting him to suit up for one game a real joy.<br/><br/>It was an added bonus when they were ahead and chanted for him to actually play at the end. Personally, I found it somewhat a turn off to have the coach portrayed as someone that ""had"" to be pressured by the crowd and other coaches to play when it was assured that no matter what, they could not lose.<br/><br/>Maybe I was just thinking about my thoughts of my own HS coach who was a hard ass that I would NEVER want to run till I dropped like in the movie. That is why I told him ""not interested"" when he begged me to play ball. Yeah, and this was the same guy that acted like a DI the day before in gym class.<br/><br/>Oh well, in any case, RUDY is a film that is really good. This is coming from someone that does not especially like football movies."

","This movie is one of the greatest ever made. It is about this small boy with a dream. He wants to play football. In high school, he was the smallest player on his team, but he had the most tackles. It is a story with a lesson on ""If you have heart, you can do anything."" Rudy is a great character. Nice, Quiet, Simple. It was really motivating. The way the coach promises to let Rudy dress for one game that season, but then retires. It was really interesting how all the other players came up to the coach and asked him to let Rudy dress in their places. That seemed just awesome to me. The only thing Rudy really did wrong in the movie was to paint the helmets with Notre Dame. Only actual students are allowed to paint the helmets, and Rudy broke that rule. Rudy is a great inspiration to people everywhere and is a very powerful character. This is a great movie and I gave it a 10 out of 10."
"thing-16","9","1","1","12 June 2006"," My favorite sports movie
","So many sports movies follow a similar story, either focusing on the coaches struggles or the team as it struggles to overcome a racist world. And then there's Rudy.<br/><br/>Rudy is not about overcoming racism. It's not a coach trying to overcome his own struggles to coach an underdog team. It's about 1 player on Notre Dame colleges football team. Throughout his life, Daniel E. ""Rudy"" Ruddiger has wanted nothing less than to play football at Notre Dame. He is told all the time he'll never make it- but Rudy believes. He gives it his 110% and, though not a good football player in terms of skill, is recognized because of his spirit. He doesn't have good grades so he can't make it to Notre Dame, but his dream doesn't die. He keeps trying, making it to the team, but his family doesn't believe him. He keeps pushing, giving his all, to suit out for 1 game, just so his family will believe him.<br/><br/>I love Rudy. It breaks from the mold of sports movies, carving its own little niche. And in the end we have one of the biggest tear jerking moments in all the movies i ever saw...If you love sports or just want to see a good movie, give Rudy a chance. If someone ever said dreams don't come true, tell them about Rudy."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Sean Astin stars as Rudy. A real-life individual who battled unspeakable odds to make the Notre Dame football team in the 1970s.<br/><br/>
Rudy is an under-sized, but ferocious football player at Joliet Catholic High School. Too small to play college football, and without good grades, it seems he is destined to work at a local factory with the rest of the guys in his family. Rudy has a dream, though. He has always dreamed of playing football at nearby Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana where so many of his heroes have played or coached. Despite people he loves and trusts (especially his father) telling him to forget it, he leaves Joliet behind to pursue his dream after his best friend is killed in an accident at the factory. By leaving, he alienates almost everyone, including his long-time sweetheart who ends up with one of his brothers.<br/><br/>Rudy has to toil in a junior college for a couple of years while building up the grades he'll need for Notre Dame. During this period, he catches on as an assistant grounds keeper at Notre Dame Stadium. The head grounds keeper (superbly portrayed by Charles Dutton) sort of feels sorry for him and lets him on to the crew for minimum wage. Being around the stadium and the campus only adds fuel to Rudy's dream and his grades and work ethic get stronger.<br/><br/>
At last, Rudy is accepted to Notre Dame in a touching scene where he breaks down and thanks God. Rudy then walks on to the practice squad and takes routine beatings from the bigger, stronger scholarship players on the football team. His willingness to take these beatings, and his incredible enthusiasm rub off on the coaches and anger some of the players. Eventually, he wins everyone's respect and the players lobby coach Dan Devine to let him suit up for the last game of his senior season. Rudy is allowed to suit up, and he even makes a couple of tackles in the game against Georgia Tech! His dream is realized.<br/><br/>This is truly an inspirational film. You don't have to be a Notre Dame fan to cheer for Rudy. This is a wonderful true-life example of a person stopping at nothing to achieve their dream. It is highly emotional and marvelously acted by all. I'm not sure how many of the details of this film really happened, but Rudy was a real person. He did overcome great odds. He should be motivation for us all.<br/><br/>5 of 5 stars<br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."
"wlmlbl","10","1","1","6 December 2002"," One of the best football movies!
","This is without a doubt, one of the best football movies I have ever seen. Sean Austin does such a superb job at Rudy Rutigger, a young steel mill worker from Joliett, Illinois who aspires to attend Notre Dame, and play football. He is very undersized (5ft 7in) and 170 pounds. He makes it known that he intends to make the team. First of all, Rudy had to fight really hard just to get into Notre Dame. Rudy hires himself a tutor, and constantly applies for admission. Just when everything looks bleak, he is finally accepted. Coach Ara Parshigan sees that Rudy has a lot of heart, and wishes all his players were the same. Rudy makes the team, and is assigned to the practice squad. At first he puts up with a lot of flack from the other players who think that Rudy is making them look bad. They finally come to realize that he really wants to make the team. When Rudy fails to find his name among those that are being allowed to suit up, he is disgusted, and quits the team. He has a conversation with one of the janitors at the field, who is Rudy's good friend, and is told that he must not quit. Rudy finds out that this person was also on Notre Dame's football team, but never got to play, and quit. He points out to Rudy that ""not a week has gone by that I didn't regret my decision."" Rudy returns to practice, and is welcomed by his teammates. He goes to Coach Parshigan, and asks to be allowed to suit up for one game the next season. The coach agrees, but later on resigns. The new coach, Dan Devine, does not see Rudy the way Parshigan did. When the last home game of the season against Georgia Tech comes, the players all want to give up thier starting spots to allow Rudy to play. Rudy fulfulls the dream of a lifetime when he gets to lead the team out of the tunnel. As it turns out, Notre Dame completely dominated Georgia Tech, and the players realize that Rudy might not get to play, despite their begging Coach Devine to let him play. The offense scores one final touchdown, with time running out, and Rudy comes on the field as a special teamer. He is then told by the assistant coach to stay on the field, and on the next play, Rudy sacks the quarterback just as time runs out. This is a very moving movie, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. I just added this movie to my collection, and the DVD version is the best. The real Rudy Ruttiger does a short commentary, which eveyone should see."

Sean Astin plays a character who's been through too much; but never seems to give up, no matter what the costs. Astin accomplishes this to it's total capacity. By showing the audience that working hard, never giving up, and giving it your best shot could inspire anyone to accomplish anything. Astin is also well suited for the role for his reflection of pursuit, emotion, and talent to take in the bad and the good influences.

It is about the story.  Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger is from my hometown, I know some of his relatives (my sister is best friends with his niece and his brother teaches at my high school), and I have been to his high school many times.  It is no longer Joliet Catholic High School, like it was back then, but within the last decade, it became Joliet Catholic Academy.  Back then it was only a boys' school,  the girls went to St. Francis, but I am getting side tracked.  Like I said earlier, Rudy is about the story.  It is about a kid who desperatly wants to play football for Notre Dame, and after years of heartache and triumph, gets into Notre Dame and doesn't even suit up until the last game, due to his teammates bravery and courage.

","This is the second great movie from director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo.  The first, of course, was ""Hoosiers,"" the best sports movie of all time.  Now comes ""Rudy,"" which was based on a true story, just as ""Hoosiers"" was.<br/><br/>Both of these films capture the mystical, idyllic quality of their era and their sport.  They bring back a sense of innocence, when people played their game just for the opportunity to play.  Neither film is about the preening, glitzy athlete who loves the limelight and high dollars.  For a change, these are films that make us feel good about sports again, films that inspire us to grow and grab and succeed no matter what the cost.  You cannot watch ""Rudy"" without almost smelling the grass in the stadium ot the fresh gold paint on the helmets.  The energy of the game is alive and almost overwhelming.<br/><br/>I only wish that Anspaugh and Pizzo would collaborate on another true-sports movie.  The 1980 US hockey team is prime material for just such a film, and even though I have heard that such a film has already been done, that hockey team is a story that only the Anspaugh/Pizzo duo could effectively tackle.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: go rent ""Rudy"" and ""Hoosiers"" and watch them as many times as you can.

We have to take plenty on faith, and it doesn't quite work on that level. > But then there's the football story, and *that* works to perfection! It's impossible not to like a kid who takes on an offensive tackle twice his size and then has the nerve (not to mention naivete) to lecture the guy about not doing his best. The football practice sequences ring true, and the music is powerful. The movie is painfully predictable, yet it nonetheless draws you in.<br/><br/>This is the role of a lifetime for Sean Astin, though Charles Dutton almost steals the show.<br/><br/>Bring a hankie.

","I Believe! Yes, I do believe. I believe this is one heap of steaming, stinking poop. And it's barely an excuse that it's based on a ""true"" story. It's ridiculous to get more than mildly impressed with the achievements of poor ugly duckling Rudy. I mean, it's hard for me to let myself go gaga for someone that is so obsessed with a senseless, brutal, IQ deficient game as football. I played some football in school and never thought much more of it than as a good workout and an opportunity to vent savagely. Any hope of being mentally challenged vanishes when it becomes clear that the 300 pound illiterate coming at you is hoping to introduce you to your maker. The only ""smart"" move is to run. I was undersized, not quite as much as Rudy, but I at least had sense enough to recognize the dangers as pointless. <br/><br/>Daniel E. 'Rudy' Ruettiger, in all fairness, just doesn't have the intellectual capacity for this awareness, so maybe he can be excused. But apparently neither do the film's creators express a broader awareness in this overly sentimental Rah Rah Cheer fest. Corny musical cues, rousing poetic pep talks, fast cut game day montages are all great devices, but artistic or even social value demand more than making you ""feel good."" You should be enlightened, broadened, and even — yeah I'm gonna say it — educated; or have you forgotten that this is a COLLEGE sports story. The better filmmakers ""educate"" very subtly, indirectly. ""North Dallas Forty"" did exactly that, all the while respecting the efforts and sacrifices made by our modern day gladiators. And to a certain degree so did The Longest Yard, where at least the bone crushing, spine snapping, brain melting criminally savage violence is occurring where it's slightly more appropriate — behind prison bars. And the fact that college sports, even back in 1975, especially football, are such commercially dominated, ultimately corrupt enterprises, is never addressed. It all adds up to just a short sighted, simple minded celebration of a clichéd and hollow conception of a now somewhat disreputable athletic activity. Rudy is shamelessly manipulative; it's cynically pandering to a deluded public — that's you.<br/><br/>People who compare this film to Rocky forget that for many of us fans of that 70s classic, that film's greatest winning quality was it's comical manner, it's absurd self indulgence. I don't cheer for Rocky because he's the ""under dog,"" I cheer because the film actually acknowledges just how ridiculous the whole overblown, fantastical myth really is. I am often laughing AT it, just as it's talented director, John G. Avildsen, intended. The Rocky series immediately thereafter plummeted into a steep decline, thanks entirely to Mr. Stallone's demented control. Though Avildsen received directing credit for Rocky V, it was in name only, as he later complained publicly how Sylvester had commandeered the entire production and overrode all directorial decisions. The fabulous product speaks for itself. My point being that I'm rarely impressed with strait forward sports yarns, especially when they strive for allegorical significance. And even worse, when they're so earnestly contrive to be inspiring. <br/><br/>Rudy is not a total failure because it's a fairly decent story, and it has some clever writing and great acting, particularly from Sean Astin. But the film avoids the bigger, obvious issue of Football's dubious social value, and never bothers to question the way we all let ourselves be lessened by it. OK, yeah, maybe we really are just primitive, aggressive animals, but indulging and celebrating the destructive, inhuman aspect of our natures is just as worthless as denying it. And that, to me, is the better story."

I don't actually know much about Rudy's personal life, I am referring more to the actual finale of the movie. There are plenty of accounts of the inaccuracies of the ending game and buildup, so I won't go into it. And while I don't like some of the liberties taken with facts, I HATE the depiction of Dan Devine in this movie. This movie didn't need to have an antagonist.

","Read through these reviews and you'll find an overhwelming number of comments that reaffirm the same things - how inspiring this movie is, how perfectly played the role of Rudy is by Sean Astin, even how good the background music is. All of these things are true, in spades. It feels great to watch someone work so hard and overcome so many obstacle to reaching his (or her) goal, because when they succeed we're happy for them - even if they're not a real person, as was Rudy.<br/><br/>I've lived in Indiana for 20 years and I have to say, it gives me a good feeling to see how well and warmly Indiana and Hoosiers are regarded in movies like this. Rudy, Hoosiers, Breaking Away... all are inspiring stories of real or realistic people beating tremendous odds to accomplish something. I like the portrayal we in the Midwest get in these films - that we're basic, down-to-Earth, good people. I doubt that I will ever move away from Indiana; I love this state too much.<br/><br/>Anyhow, back to the film... so many films lose my interest halfway through but this one didn't. I stayed up and watched it to the end. And it's one of those movies that until you've seen the whole thing and had a day or two for it to 'sink in', you don't realize just how good it is. This film is a gem. <br/><br/>I'm not partial to superheroes, explosions, or disasters... I like a good story though, and it doesn't need to have cost $100 million to be good. A great plot, well-cast actors and realistic dialog will hook me in while the latest thing Batman or Star Trek are doing won't make me bat an eye.<br/><br/>I'm very glad I saw this human and enjoyable film."

","It isn't easy to get into a school for sports. Rudy is the story of a high school football aspiring to play for Notre Dame. Although Rudy isn't the best student, his motivation to play for Notre Dame leads him to take every opportunity he can in order to fulfill his dream. Once Rudy graduates from high school, he begins working his father to save up money to go to his dream school. When he raises enough money to go to Notre Dame, he speaks with the head of school who presents him with the option of attending a different school in the area to prove that he is studious enough to attend Notre Dame. Despite failing on multiple occasions to have his application approved, Rudy stays persistent and applies his last time and is finally accepted. After his application is accepted, Rudy's first ambition is to try out for the football team. Although he put in large amounts of effort during high school, the coaches think that he isn't suited to play on the team. He doesn't demonstrate the athletic ability required to make the cut, one coach convinces the others to let him on the team under the condition that he puts in the same amount of effort that he did on the first day. After making the team, he continues to put in all his effort so that the coach will put him in during a game so he can prove to his family that he made it. Even though he puts in more effort than the other members of the team, he isn't put into any of the games because of the new coach. Rudy continued to prove that he was strong enough of a player for the coach to put him in, but game after game, his name isn't on the roster. Rudy has his parents come for his last game at Notre Dame, and against all odds, Rudy is put in for one play during the last game of his senior year. Although the odds were stacked against Rudy, he made his aspirations come true through hard work and persistence. This movie shows the struggle of a high school student whose own family doesn't believe in him and how he makes it to where he wants to be. The main attribute of this movie that makes it so inspirational is Rudy's story and motivation. Not only did no one believe him, but he wasn't even given the chance to even attempt to go to Notre Dame. It was only under his own toiling that he was able to even go to visit the college. Along with this, Rudy continuously attempted to make the best out of his situations. When his initial application is denied, he agrees to go to a different college to show that he can do well enough to attend Notre Dame. Also, when he begins playing football at Notre Dame, he shows so much spirit and determination that the coaches agree to let him on the team. To me, the main concept of this story is that it's, possible for anything regardless of how bizarre it sounds. Overall, I think that Rudy was a very good movie because it shows that anything is possible if you apply yourself in attempting to achieve it. It's a shame that I won't ever play football or apply to Notre Dame. ;)"

","In the very final scene when everyone is running, all the players have their names written on their shirts. Where is ""Rudy"" on the 45 shirt.

Unless that's what happened in real life, it's a pretty big mistake for arguably one of the best football movies ever.

","No matter how small you are, how much of an outsider you might appear to be, even to your own family, if you have a dream and you really fight for it, with all that you have, ignoring all the setbacks and people that try to talk you out of it, you will reach your goal. This is essentially what the story of this movie will tell you and in a way make you believe. More than any other movie I ever watched before, Rudy is the perfect example to illustrate a quote that I heard a motivational speaker mention once: ""We are all self-made but only the successful will admit it"". Rudy truly is a self-made successful guy. Against all the odds, he became the player of the Notre Dame team when he wasn't even tall enough to reach the kitchen cabinet.

"brockwiljohnson","Null","0","0","4 December 2015"," Rudy Review
","IMDb calls Rudy a biography, a drama, and a sports film, and by combining these three different methods the film is able to draw in all types of viewers that are able to relate. The viewer is able to grasp onto a completely new idea- that through hard work and determination one can become awesome- and that is an idea that can be taken and used in the viewer's everyday life after watching. <br/><br/>My life long exposure to sports films helped me make connections in my own struggle as an athlete, and movies like Rudy drove me deeper into the wonderful game of football. But what is especially inspiring is that Rudy is a true story: Daniel Ruettiger, commonly known as ""Rudy"" (Shawn Astin), pursued his dream to play football for the University of Notre Dame, a dream that almost seems impossible to any young man that lacks the size, stature and the necessary athletic ability to perform such a task. Knowing that there is no possible chance of earning a starting position, Rudy wants to get on the field of a regular season game just once. Almost every person that comes to contact with Rudy in the film bombard him with doubt. You would think having parents giving constant reinforcement that he lacks the proper knowledge to be accepted into such a high class school would cause any man to quit. Rudy uses that negativity as a sort of fuel to keep his dreams alive. This film is determined to motivate any viewer through the heart and determination shown by Rudy. This is a perfect example of an underdog film."

","A mediocre movie with strong message. Reminds me of my lifestory as well. People around us often judge us based on our look, our performance, rather than on potential and ability. They hold us from achieving greater goals. Then there are people who each time face this kind of perception, they become more determined. And Rudy represents the fighting kind. I liked the movie for its simplicity in making. Rudy, the main character does things like an average person, but with heart full of passion. Passion drags him to Notre Dame, a place of his dreams. The movie shows the difference between people who gets and waste opportunities, and those who wait years and years to get one. The movie is based on a true story. I highly recommend this one."

","This is a movie that I could watch 100 times and never once get tired of it, it's such a great David vs. Goliath movie. Rudy was a small guy who everyone told you're never going to play for Notre Dame and for good reason, he was 5'9"" and weighed next to nothing. He had to fight just to get into Notre Dame as a student by going to Holy Cross for 2 years. Then once he got to ND he tried out for the football team as a walkon. With his absolute never giving up on any of the plays they let him participate in practice as a member of the scout team. But even with that it looked like he would never actually make it into a game. Rudy got coach Ara Parseghian to promise to let him suit up for a game for 1 game during his senior year. But during that offseason Parseghian retired and Dan Devine came in as the new head coach of ND. Devine didn't know about the deal he made with Rudy. Rudy had won himself over to the rest of the team and the rest of the team threatened to walk out if Rudy didn't get a chance to suit up for a game so Devine finally relented."

","I saw Rudy on a sunny morning as I had nothing better to do. This movie is so much more than just a kid running behind a football. It is so much more. You start off seeing this kid who is a 5 footer and does not even weigh a 150 pounds who has a larger than life dream. <br/><br/>This movie makes you believe that if you do have a dream and you want it badly enough and if you are willing to work for it hard enough there will come along unseen angels who will help you fulfill it. It might be the groundsman(Fortune), D-Bob or all the players on the Norte Dame football team, there will be people who will pull you through thick and thin. <br/><br/>The performance by Sean Austin is moving. He portrays the character of Rudy with such ease that you will begin to believe that this is how the real Rudy Ruettiger would have been. The direction and screenplay are of top notch quality. If you do truly connect to the movie the last seconds of the game when Rudy comes on the pitch and makes his tackle will indeed move you to tears. He does deserve to be carried off the field. <br/><br/>For an excellently well made movie with one of the strongest characters I've seen on screen and the sheer heart displayed by that young man I give this movie a 10/10."
"asiduodiego","8","0","0","18 March 2011"," A good movie, but rather manipulative
","Rudy is a great movie. Sean Astin is just great in the role of the underdog fighting for his ""big chance"", and at the end, (spoiler alert) guess what?: he just made it!. The movie is so well crafted that when the whole Stadium is cheering for Rudy, we, the audience, are also cheering for him. It's emotional to the core.<br/><br/>But, then, after the movie was over, I thought about the actual achievements made by the character, and... I thought it was pretty lame. It was his life dream, I guess, and he fought hard, but at the end it feels more like a ""make-a-wish"" story, rather than an ""underdog rising to the challenge"" story, as Rocky was. The great achievement of Rudy was not ""rising to the challenge"" but rather to make good friends and impress everyone with his effort and his unbreakable will... to just play football in a College Team. It's like a guy dedicating all his life to achieve a childhood fantasy, such as ""going to space"", or ""visit Europe"": it's nice, but the almost obsessive nature of the dream makes it feel a little weird.<br/><br/>And that's precisely the magic of the movie: it turns this ""child fantasy"" scenario into a full-blown drama, and it's so well done, that at the end you throw all your cynicism away and you're cheering for the character: fine, but it's also manipulative. I think there are far better examples of stories of people fighting for their dreams and hopes, rather than the story of a guy who ""just wanted to play Football"". But, for what it is, it's an excellent ""feel-good-movie"".<br/><br/>8/10"

","Rudy is one of the most motivational movies I have ever seen. The fact that it is true provides even more of an inspiration to the viewer. The most important scenes in the movie are when Rudy decides to apply to Notre Dame after his best friend dies, when Rudy finally gets accepted to Notre Dame, when Fortune tells Rudy not to quit the team, when the team players tell Dan Devine to let Rudy dress, and, finally, when the crowd chants Rudy's name and he gets to play in the game. Rudy represents a person that everyone can admire. He is a person who never gives up no matter how many people discourage him and tell him that he can't achieve his dreams. This is shown in the scene when Jamie complains to Coach Parseghian that Rudy is too serious about a practice. Parseghian responds to him basically saying that if he had any bit of the heart that Rudy has, then he would have gotten so much further than he is right now. The cinematography in the movie was very focused on the emotions in it, the sound also went along with the different emotions. We see this because there is theme music that is played softly in heart-felt scenes and then more intensely in more motivational scenes. Rudy is a film that will have anyone watching it leave the movie feeling inspired and touched by a person who never gave up on his dream."

Rudy always dreamed of attending the University of Notre Dame but everyone told him he could never do it because he was too stupid, however, they did not understand that Rudy suffered from a learning disease. People around him while he was growing up also told him he could not play football at Notre Dame because he was too small. However, Rudy worked hard and was able to make both these dreams come true.

Especially at the division 1 level it is so hard for a walk on to get on the field but Rudy does this and even though he is extremely undersized he makes a tackle which makes his story even more amazing. To me this best part of the film is when all the players stick up for Rudy just to give him the opportunity to dress. With out the players doing what they did Rudy would have never had the opportunity to do the amazing things he did and it shows the respect he had earned from the team when in most cases walk ons are treated with out respect.

","""Rudy"" is a tremendous monument to believing in ones dreams and never giving up hope. Rudy faces enormous challenges in his life from day one. He is never big enough, fast enough or smart enough to achieve what he wants. However what Rudy lacks in physical ability and talent he makes up for with an undying work ethnic and unparalleled drive to succeed. However the story behind the film can only be effective if the technical aspects allow the viewer to emotionally connect with the character. <br/><br/>The technical aspects of ""Rudy"" are almost as impressive as the story that is being told. The most impressive part of the movie in my mind is its use of the reoccurring theme music. It is played in the background of almost every scene in which an important event is about to occur, such as Rudy's first visit to Notre Dame or when the team walks in to turn in their jerseys to allow Rudy to dress. Along with the sound the movement during the football scenes was very helpful in creating a sense of reality. The scenes were full of fast paced movement and ended with huge hits. Finally the acting in ""Rudy"" was outstanding, it was emotional and complete. It drew the audience into the movie and made them connect with Rudy as another human rather than just a character.

","Rudy is an extremely moving and motivating sports film based on the true story of Daniel Ruettiger. My initial reaction is that as a viewer it is very easy to fall in love with this movie time and time again. There are many reasons behind why this movie is so well loved. The first reason being is because it is a sports film and people can easily watch and relate to this type of movie. Due to the high paced games and hard-hitting action that usually come with this type of movie people love to watch and react to these films. The second reason that so many people love this movie is because of how motivating the character of Rudy is. Rudy not only motivates the viewers of the film, but his teammates, coaches and fans who watch him practice and give his all for the team. This reason is shown especially in one of the last scenes of the film when Rudy is given the chance to get into the game against Georgia Tech in the final seconds. This is my favorite part of the film mainly because of the way that the crowd irrupts into cheers when he takes the field. Also, when he sacks the Georgia Tech quarterback, this is one of the most motivating scenes in all of sports movies. Rudy is one of the greatest sports movies of all times and is extremely inspirational."

","My pastor once said that the only time guys are willing to admit they cried is while watching the end of ""Rudy."" This is one of the better football-themed movies I have seen, mostly because it does not revolve around the tired old plot of a football team who must overcome their differences and work together to win the game. Instead, the focus here is on one person (Rudy, played nearly perfectly by Sean Astin) and how he proves he can make it to Notre Dame and play on their football team, despite what everyone said. The plot is still typical and predictable, but how well the filmmakers took a true story and turned it into something engaging and watchable is what makes this a worthwhile film. What this film teaches us is that we cannot wait around for our dreams to fall into our laps. We must work for them. Rudy had to work to get better grades, get admission to Notre Dame, get a job just to know the field better, and eventually convince the coach to let him play. It's Rudy's interactions with those he comes into contact with throughout the movie, and the effort he puts forth to everything he does, that makes this film good.

The fact that it's based (quite closely I understand) on a true story makes it all the better.  I first became aware of Rudy's story on a CBS Sunday Morning piece, and actually met Lou Holtz after the season it was filmed at Notre Dame Stadium, but before its release.  You do not have to be a football fan (which I am) or a Notre Dame fan (which I'm not) to enjoy this movie, but it would help.  Football as a metaphor for life is hardly a new concept to the movies, or to coaches, or to sportswriters, but this movie is unusually adept at making the application.  Anyone who has ever seen a movie can see where the plot is going and the emotional manipulation of the viewer is straightfoward and blatant, but far from ruining the picture somehow enhances it.  This is the sort of movie you probably thought that they stopped making about 1955."

","""Rudy"" was released to theaters in 1993. By today's Hollywood standards, that is getting on in age. For a film like this, however, time is (and will continue to be) almost a non-factor, as a movie so based in human themes and emotions will never cease to be relevant.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Rudy"" is based on the real-life story of Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin), whose entire goal in life from childhood onward was to enroll at Notre Dame and play football for the Irish. The problem? His grades aren't up to snuff coming out of high school, his short stature makes football seem like a pipe dream, and father Daniel (Ned Beatty) doesn't encourage his dreams. Through hard work and extreme determination, however, Rudy manages to put himself in position for those dreams to come true. Will he be able to take that final step and run out of the tunnel in pads? That's what the film ultimately builds up to.<br/><br/>Much like, say, ""Hoosiers"" or ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Rudy"" is a film that almost gets an ""average"" knock now because it practically invented a genre that is now basically the standard for inspirational sports films. There was no ""teacher standing on the desk"" cliche before Robin Williams, no ""measuring the basket"" scene until Hackman, and no ""power of sheer motivation"" emotional tear-jerkers before ""Rudy"". So, while watching this film now it may seem like you've seen this type before, just remember that is only because ""Rudy"" started the trend!<br/><br/>As a football fan myself, it is tough to believe I hadn't seen this one all the way through until my 32nd year on this planet. To me, Astin was always ""Samwise the Hobbit"" from Lord of the Rings! Like I said previously, I think I was a bit scared away by the ""done to death"" cliches that it seems to represent. I'm glad I finally ""caved"", however, as this is a truly special and emotional film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Rudy"" is one of the greats in both its own genre (sports) as well as of all-time.

"classicalsteve","9","1","2","18 August 2014"," Uplifting True Story About An Unlikely Working-Class Kid Who Fights His Way to Notre Dame and Its Football Team
","Part-way into the film, Daniel Ruettiger, Sr. (Ned Beatty), the father of ""Rudy"", tells the story of how his immigrant father, Rudy's grandfather, came to America and gave his family a new life. Later he decided to create a dairy farm out in the country. He bought land and about 200 cows, probably on credit. Unfortunately, according to Beatty, the cows died of disease after only a few months. Because it was the Depression, they couldn't sell the land. As a result, Rudy's grandfather disappeared, never to be seen again, and younger siblings were split up to live with other family members. We assume he left his family because of the shame of failure. Rudy's father then goes on to say that universities like Notre Dame just aren't in the cards for members of the Ruettiger family of laborers. Institutions like Notre Dame are for rich and connected people, not for those who don hard-hats at steel mills and factories.<br/><br/>The moral of Beatty's story: if you try and don't succeed, it would have been better if you hadn't tried at all. Rudy's father tells him this story at a bus station where Rudy is going to travel to South Bend, Indiana, hoping to not only enroll into Notre Dame University, but also play for their illustrious football team. Rudy decides not to take heed of his father's story and instead travels to South Bend anyway with nothing except a cheap traveling pack. Which is I think the point of ""Rudy"": that we must try and risk failure if we are to have any chance to succeed. <br/><br/>Rudy's chances of getting into Notre Dame as a student are slim at best and almost negligible in regards to joining the Fighting Irish football team. He has every disadvantage imaginable. But he has one thing in his favor: he has nothing to lose, and he knows he will have to put in 400% to achieve his goals. To give him an edge, Rudy thinks outside the box and does things other kids wouldn't have thought to do, such as befriending the grounds-keeper at the Notre Dame stadium and introducing himself to the Notre Dame coach even before he's a student. But his road is hard and arduous. In a very interesting shot about mid-way through the film, we see Rudy on the outside of the Notre Dame stadium while a game is in-progress. The shot is a bird's eye view with Rudy at ground-level to the right of the large wall of the stadium to the left. This is the seemingly impenetrable wall Rudy is trying to climb. Physically, he is right near the stadium yet he is still on the outside.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable film about a highly implausible story that is truly a great inspirational films. While the supporting cast is perfect for the film, it's the performance of Sean Astin as Rudy which takes us all the way. Every step of Astin as Rudy is completely believable. And the film never lapses into cliché sentiment but sticks with the facts of most of the true story, with one small change towards the end. If Astin and/or the script had ever once lapsed into idealistic fantasy it would have become almost satirical farce, but luckily it never does. It ranks as one of best sports films of all time."

","This is a 10 hankie movie. Every part of the movie is made to make you cry. If you look for underdog in the dictionary, you'll see the face of Rudy. Sure the movie is manipulating us. For that I'll subtract a point. But it's something I'll mostly overlook because the manipulations work so well. The fact is Rudy has become bigger than a simple movie. It is the standard for underdog sports movies. It has become a synonym to inspirational.<br/><br/>Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger (Sean Astin) is a poor student and a small physical specimen. Only he has the heart of a lion. He dreams of nothing else other than to play for Notre Dame football. Nobody believes in him other than maybe his best friend Pete. His father's (Ned Beatty) tale of how his grandfather abandoned his family for a dream is heartbreaking. The father's advise is gut wrenching. His fire is almost extinguished when Pete dies in an industrial accident. This drives him to pursue his dreams which borders on delusional.<br/><br/>The story piles on the obstacles facing Rudy. It is overkill and works beautifully. It is heartbreaking every time it happens. The music pulls at the emotional strings. They pile on more obstacles. Even though I know there are manipulations, it doesn't matter. It gets me every time."

","OK, a few scenes I liked: the scene with the walk-on tryouts where the assistant coach tells them they can expect to get pounded on by the first teamers, and nobody cares whether they get hurt or not. Also during Rudy's senior year, the background music and late autumn scenes were both breathtaking, yet with the realization that time was running out on Rudy's last season and his last chance to play. Finally, it was neat to see how the other players gradually came to appreciate Rudy for his stick-to-itiveness, to the point where each of the starters asked Coach Divine to let Rudy dress in their place. Only problem with that: in real life it never happened that way. Coach Divine had every intention to let Rudy play and was rather angry that the movie portrayed him otherwise. Still though, it added to the drama. <br/><br/>My favorite scene of all is when Fortune (Charles Dutton)encourages Rudy to go to his final practice because if he doesn't, he'll regret it for the rest of his life, ""letting them get the best of you"".<br/><br/>My only criticism is with the excessive profanity coming from Rudy's friend at Holy Cross. I try not to let a few bad words bother me, but when it's excessive and really adds nothing whatsoever to the story. I mean, really, how would this movie have been any worse without the friend's repeated use of ""G..D..""? Without those scenes, this movie is a 10.<br/><br/>Overall, very inspiring, even if you're not a football fan."

","A young man learns to let nothing stop him from realizing his ambitions in this sports drama entitled,Rudy.This is a film that gives an account of the life of Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles. It stars Sean Astin on the title role as Rudy together with Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty,Charles S. Dutton,Greta Lind,Scott Benjaminson and Lili Taylor.The screenplay was written by Angelo Pizzo and it was directed by David Anspaugh.<br/><br/>Rudy Ruettiger grows up in Joliet, Illinois; dreaming of playing college football at the University of Notre Dame. While achieving some success with his local high school team, he lacks the grades and money to attend Notre Dame, not to mention talent and physical size. Ruettiger was much smaller than an average football player, standing just 5'6"" and weighing 165 lb.Ruettiger takes a job at a local steel mill like his father Daniel, Sr.; he prepares to settle down. But when his best friend Pete is killed in an explosion there, Rudy decides to follow his dream of attending Notre Dame and playing for the Fighting Irish.He leaves for the campus, but fails to get admitted to Notre Dame. With the help of a local priest, Rudy starts at a small junior college nearby named Holy Cross, hoping to qualify for a transfer. He also manages to get a part- time job on Notre Dame's grounds keeping staff and befriends D-Bob, a graduate student at Notre Dame and a teaching assistant at his junior college. The socially-awkward D-Bob offers to tutor Rudy if he helps him meet girls. Suspecting an underlying cause to Ruettiger's previous academic problems, D-Bob has Rudy tested, and Rudy learns that he has dyslexia. Rudy learns how to overcome his disability and becomes a better student. At Christmas vacation, Rudy returns home to his family's appreciation of his report card, but is still mocked for his attempts at playing football and also dumped by his girlfriend, who starts seeing one of his brothers.During his final semester of transfer eligibility, Rudy is admitted to Notre Dame. He rushes home to tell his family. At the steel mill, his father announces it over the loudspeaker, ""Hey, you guys, my son's going to Notre Dame!"" After ""walking on"" as a non- scholarship player for the football team, Ruettiger convinces coach Ara Parseghian to give him a spot on the practice (or ""scout"") squad. An assistant coach warns the players that 35 scholarship players won't make the roster. But, Ruettiger exhibits more drive than some of his scholarship teammates.Parseghian agrees to the young man's request to suit up for one home game in his senior year so his family and friends can see him as a member of the team. However, Parseghian steps down as coach following the 1974 season. Dan Devine succeeds him in 1975 and decides against giving Ruettiger a chance to appear at a home game. Led by team captain and All-American Roland Steele, the other seniors rise to his defense and lay their jerseys on Devine's desk, each requesting that Rudy be allowed to dress in their place. Devine relents and lets Ruettiger suit up for the final home game, against Georgia Tech. At the final home game, Steele invites Ruettiger to lead the team out of the tunnel onto the playing field. As the game comes to an end, and Notre Dame is ahead, Devine sends all the seniors to the field, but refuses to let Rudy play, despite the pleas from Steele and the assistant coaches. Then, the Notre Dame bench starts a ""Rudy!"" chant that soon goes stadium wide, and the offensive team, led by tailback Jamie O'Hare, overrules Devine's call for victory formation and they score another touchdown instead. Devine finally lets Rudy enter the field with the defensive team on the final kickoff. He stays in for the final play of the game and sacks the opposing quarterback, and is carried off on the shoulders of his teammates.<br/><br/>The film,Rudy is undeniably sentimental.Sean Astin's performance as Rudy is so self-effacing,focused and low-key that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. Although it was predictable,the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse that would probably provide a tear in the viewer's eyes.It was truly an inspiring sports film about a real life underdog and a person with a endless determination that transcends sports for it is relevant to many who want to find inspiration in life."

","I love movies that glorify the positive side of human nature, especially those that use sports as a metaphor for the ""can do"" spirit.  Modern examples are Rocky, Hoosiers, and Breaking Away.  Rudy is in this mold.<br/><br/>Supposedly true, Rudy tells the story of a young working class guy who, after toiling for four years in the steel mills after high school, decides to play varsity football for the University of Notre Dame.  So what if he's small of stature and short on smarts.  Rudy, like the energizer bunny just keeps on going.<br/><br/>The movie dramatizes his four year struggle to achieve his goals.  It's a charming story and my eyes watered during the final scene.  But as the last scene fades a final text says that no other player has been carried off the field at Notre Dame since Rudy in 1975.  (Sorry for the spoiler).  I do some quick math and realize that Rudy graduated from high school in 1968, the same year I did.  I know from experience that young men who didn't go directly to college were very likely to join a rifle company in 'Nam whether they wanted to or not.  You didn't go to the mills as it seems Rudy and all his brothers did.<br/><br/>Rudy wastes virtually nothing on side plots.  His high school girlfriend, whom he almost marries, disappears completely after he leaves for South Bend.  I'm appreciative that the film-makers didn't clutter up the landscape with sub-plots and an annoying rock and roll sound track.  Thank you.  But the draft and the war in Vietnam overshadowed everything in 1968 especially for 18-year-olds.  For me it's like trying to ignore the elephant in the living room.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, and recommend it highly, but I'm still stuck with the question.  If Rudy was healthy enough to be a human tackling dummy for the Notre Dame football team how'd he stay out of the Army?"

Actually saying that it was boring is an understatement, I think it sucked. Dream big and follow your dreams and never give up, I heard. What I got was some kid who got a job somewhere and then the team let him put on a uniform. He didn't work for anything. Maybe he slept with one of the team. It seemed too much like a Make-A-Wish story. If it was, no one worked for anything, they just got it because it made others feel good. Now if it had been billed as a Make-A-Wish story, than I guess it would have been pretty good."

","I first saw this movie a few months ago in my CP (college-prep)writing class.  It's about a young college student who has had a lifelong dream to play for Notre Dame.  Well there's some problems that interfere with that. His size for example.  When he was a child, his brothers and sisters told him that he could never play for Notre Dame because he was too thin and didn't have enough muscle.  I really can't remember much about this movie, but I do remember (and laughed at) a scene in which one guy told another guy to ""wipe his ass!""  This reminded me of a chubby Native American girl who went to my school.  She told a skinny Caucasian (white) girl to wipe her butt.  After the movie was over, my CP writing teacher gave us each a worksheet to fill out about the movie and it included questions about us and what goals we would like to reach.  I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be a pretty darn good track athlete this year."

So the film nicely builds on this idea of the small guy dreaming to play professional football, and on how he compensates with his stubborn attitude and amazing resistance to the ridicule he has to take from everyone, because absolutely no one (except for one close childhood friend that dies) believed in him.
So I was preparing for the orgiastic ending, when he does the impossible and kicks some crap in the game, and the script nicely lured me to expect that, and then...27 seconds of being let to play out of pitty, when it didn't matter anymore, as Notre Dame had already won.

","A truly inspirational story of Daniel 'Rudy' Ruettiger, who's persistence and determination earned him a spot on the Notre Dame football team. But man, talk about jumping through hoops to achieve one's dream. Personally, I don't see how the under-sized Rudy managed to take the pounding he did in practice without suffering myriad broken bones and concussions. It didn't look like the practice squads let up any as Rudy took his share of hits, effectively getting right up again to come back for more. Sean Astin turns in a determined and heart warming performance as the title character, intent on acquiring a goal that virtually everyone in his inner circle 'knew' was unattainable. Such is the power of holding a desire in complete faith and assurance, to the extent of giving up everything else in order to pursue that one, seemingly impossible goal. What was impressive as well was the way the Notre Dame players offered up their own spot in the final game of the season's line-up to allow Rudy his very last chance to get into a game. even if it meant sitting the bench. Whether it happened the way it was portrayed or not, I had to feel somewhat disappointed in coach Dan Devine (Chelcie Ross) for not sharing the team's compassion and loyalty to their indefatigable teammate in that final game. It wouldn't have killed him to show some support for a guy who in turn supported Notre Dame in every way possible. Although the film is more than a couple decades old as I write this, it's nice to know that the real life 'Rudy' Ruettiger is still alive at the age of seventy one, and has served as inspiration for many others to follow. As was mentioned by various characters in the film, we could all benefit from more Rudy's in the world."

I have to admit throughout the film i just got a really creepy vibe from the character. He comes over like an obsessed fanboy.
The film is well made and well acted in honesty but the overall story and concept fell flat for me. Was it all really worth it for 10 seconds? Clearly the guy wasn't that good or he'd have played more and made a career from playing. I just find this all very American, flag flying nonsense. A film definitely made for an all American market which doesn't translate well across the Atlantic."

","There was a man who once said ""I want to be Chateaubriand or nothing"". His name was Victor Hugo. <br/><br/>Yes, even the great Hugo was a wannabe. We all want to be something, someone we idolize, a part of a dream we treasure. Yes, it all starts with a dream and I know it's a cliché, and it's been so trendy to invite everyone to believe in their dreams, that you wonder whether the real deal wouldn't be to set your mind up for realistic anticipations of the future and just try to live a ""nice"" and ""happy"" life. If only it could be that easy.<br/><br/>I guess I had the wrong idea about ""Rudy"", I thought it was going to be one of these 'feel-good' underdog stories, like a ""Rocky"" of the 90's (even the titles sound the same). I also thought it was going to overplay the height issue as a serious handicap to play football (well American football is not the football as we call it here... the one that allows pint-sized Leo Messi to be the best player in the world). So yes, I thought it was going to be an inspirational movie about a guy who -you know- believed in himself and achieved his dreams. Well, it was... but it was more than that. It doesn't take an underdog to make a good story, it still takes a good story and an endearing character.<br/><br/>And ""Rudy"", from ""Hoosiers"" director David Anspaugh, doesn't just meet with your expectations, it challenges them in a very subtle and intelligent way, one that can be summed up in one sentence: ""Dreams are what make our lives tolerable"". I can't tell who said that and when, but the line was immediately printed in my mind. Yet the film isn't about dreaming. It isn't even about fulfilling your dreams, it's about the will, the decision, the spirit, the energy and ultimately, the journey. The dream in itself is crazy but is handled in a realistic way (the film is based on Rudy Ruettiger's true story) it's not about a small guy who wants to be the star of Notre Dame football team, but who wants to play at least one game. And personally, I prefer dreams that start with ""I wish if I could only one time"" rather than ""I want to be this or that"".<br/><br/>""Rocky"" wasn't about becoming the heavyweight champion but about going the distance, and in ""Rudy"" Sean Astin gives an extraordinary performance, as Oscar worthy of a nomination as was Sly in 1977, like Rocky, he's not just an underdog in the game, but in his own family or circle of friends where his dreams are swept off by the brush of reality, except for one true friend who believes in him (like others will do). After finishing college, Rudy almost renounces and joins his Dad (Ned Beatty) and brothers in the steel mill, until a tragic event ""derails"" his path of life for good. No need to spoil it.<br/><br/>Paraphrasing Hugo, Rudy wants to be a ""Fighting Irish at least once or nothing"" and the whole film is a harrowing odyssey where we follow each step that gets him closer to his dream: getting the sponsors, having good grades in prep school, joining Notre Dame, then the practice team... but said like this, it doesn't do justice to how exhilarating it is, when Rudy's happy, we share his joy when he's disappointed, we share his bitterness and when he cries, we shed a few tears. In fact, there's something communicative about Rudy's energy, just see how slowly the magic operates and some start to believe he's got the heart of a true fighter, if not the body. Look at how the players get progressively impressed by his fearless energy. <br/><br/>Yet it's still about the journey, the realization, sometimes you dream of reaching the top of the mountain, and maybe you can't make it. But instead of staring at the unreachable summit, the film invites you to look down and contemplate the beautiful landscape and see what you've done. Of course, some climbers fall and there's a poignant scene where Ned Beatty tells his son the story of his grandfather who lost everything because he chased a stupid dream. And over the course of his journey, even Rudy himself thought of quitting... and it made me think.<br/><br/>Then I realized that the moment where Rudy was in the game, the film could have stopped right there. I didn't care if he'd win or get an ankle broken, he had just made it. And the film could have even ended right after what I think was the best 'pep talk' ever, one from Fortune the groundskeeper (Charles S. Dutton), his speech wasn't about ""getting hit and keeping moving"" but about valuing the hits and the movement. I guess what the film tries to say is that there's a thin line between dreaming and chasing a dream. Dreaming is nothing if you don't start to chase the dream.<br/><br/>Because when there's something that eats you deep inside, you know you just got to chase it. Because for a dream-chaser (I didn't say dreamer) there's nothing worse than stopping. When you stop, you settle down, you feel safe and secure... for a while. You start noticing other dream-chasers and you pity them because you know most of them won't make it. And it's true. But that also means a minority will make it. And when you'll see people achieving YOUR dreams, you're going to hate and pity yourself, and Rudy's brother for most of the film is consumed by envy and self-pity. <br/><br/>Lennon said ""Life is what happens while you're making plans"", maybe the real delight of life is the stuff that happens in order to make your plans go true, even a tiny bit true. On that level, Rudy was quite a delightful film... and to use an overused expression, they don't make like them anymore."

","I know that some of this movie was messed around with. If you read an actual biography, you will find some inaccuracies, but that doesn't matter because this movie is about the personal dreams of the average guy. Rudy Ruettiger is a young guy whose family works in a steel mill and Rudy is probably doomed to that life. It's not terrible but it is dangerous (Rudy's best friend dies) and the young guy wants a better life. He is a very good high school football player with a lot of heart, but this will probably be the end of his playing days. Rudy is a disinterested student, so his chances of even getting into college are almost nil. When a group of seniors are going on a college trip to Norte Dame, he is not allowed on the bus. But he has a dream and he heads off to South Bend and tries to talk his way in. He ends up going to Holy Cross, a nearby school, and he is told that if he can get high grades, they will look at him again. Well, we all know the story. He qualifies academically. He manages to get on the scout squad at Notre Dame by showing that he is willing to nearly kill himself to impress the coaches. But they won't give him a chance to play in a game, which means he isn't actually a true member of the historical powerhouse. Until something happens. If you've never seen this, go for it."

","One of the most inspirational sports film of the past three decades is this film, Rudy. Rudy is a real-life story about a guy who was deemed unfit for college football and was able to prove his naysayers wrong. Now like most sports film, I can see from a mile away the outcome of the movie, but it doesn't really make a difference, There were still some emotional moments to be had as we see this young man's dreams come true. This film also does a good job in raising my interest in football, because these are the kind of inspirational stories I love.<br/><br/>David Anspaugh's film is about a young adult named Rudy who aspires to play football for Notre Dame. But there are many factors standing in his way such as his lack of athleticism, living in a town where everyone works for the steel mill, lack of support from his family, and not able to afford an college education. But one day when he is finally admitted to Notre Dame, Rudy proves that he has what it takes to follow his dreams.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Sean Astin, in his pre-Sam days, gives a very strong performance as Rudy. The great Ned Beatty likewise delivers a great performance as Rudy's father. Charles S. Dutton gives a great performance as Rudy's boss/mentor who believes in him. Finally, Robert Prosky makes a good appearance as the priest who helped Rudy find his way.<br/><br/>Overall, Rudy is an incredibly inspirational movie about a man who is able to follow his dreams. It is a phenomenal movie and quite sentimental. The movie is not about football, but about the themes I mentioned earlier, although this helped me raise my awareness towards the sport. From the technical standpoint, the movie works very well. I especially liked the score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. This is a very good film, and one of the best sports films of recent years. I rate this film 9/10."

How tiny? Real tiny. For all his tenacity, poor Rudy simply isn't cut out for playing ball. Indeeed, Rudy's never even granted the climactic ""happy ending"" which many sports dramas target. Instead, Rudy's last act ""victory"" merely amounts to him being granted a few paltry seconds on a football field.<br/><br/>Sports movies usually trade in ""inspirational"" messages. ""Rudy"" does this as well, but manages to blend cynicism with sentimentality. You sense this is not director David Anspaugh's intention; he's simply looking for formulaic uplift. The film co-stars Jon Favreau. Sean Astin does well with a tricky role.<br/><br/>7.5/10 – Worth one viewing."
"StevePulaski","8","0","1","1 May 2012"," Not as accomplished as an underdog should be
","Rudy is a story of the underdog who rises from modest beginnings into a brave, admirable character. Its goal is to most likely motivate young teens in our character, Rudy's, position, or just serve as cleverly gift-wrapped optimism. It is what many of its kind are; light, cheery, and comprised of great, capable actors.<br/><br/>Sean Astin plays Rudy Ruettiger, a teenager attending a heavily Catholic high school, with ambition to go to Notre Dame for college. Rudy is a great football player, despite his lack of physical proportions, but his grades are far from average, which serves as the reason for him not being able to get accepted.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, he is determined, and vows to study hard at a junior college called Holy Cross. He also manages to score a part-time job working the groundskepper at Notre Dame for the football team, the Fighting Irish. There, he is guided by Fortune (Dutton), who serves as his motivation to keep the field clean but also to not give up on his dreams. All Rudy's life he has wanted to make a tackle or even just be on the field of a football game during gametime. The film shows how far he will go to obtain that dream.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, the film is rather engaging. Sean Astin, once more, gives a wonderful performance, making this, again, another film I have seen by him where he is splendid and convincing. I have yet to see a bad film with him. Jon Favrea also does some fine work as Rudy's friend who agrees to help him with school if he can secure him a date for the school dance.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, composed by legendary Jerry Goldsmith, is entrancing, especially during some of the climatic sequences. Goldsmith has composed roughly one-hundred film scores and still knows how to dodge cloying sentimentality, yet is aware on how to capitalize on a big moment.<br/><br/>Director David Anspaugh and screenwriter Angelo Pizzo collaborated on the set of Hoosiers in their own positions, respectably, and seem to have found a way to make the genre of sports dramas function as best they can even though clichés monitor the area.<br/><br/>So why is Rudy a ""good"" film and not a great one? My main point of complaint is the ending. It feels naked and left me a tad underwhelmed. Mainly because the suspense and urgency was traded in to put emphasis on Rudy's actual dream. The nail-biting ending many sports films tend to have is that the game is on the line during the final minutes of the film. Not in Rudy's case. Its focus is something greater, but because so much was made about accomplishing Rudy's dream, I felt happy for him, but not extremely satisfied during the credits. Also, it is never truly explained how Rudy went on to pay for a college as expensive as Notre Dame's with a modest income from his family and himself.<br/><br/>I felt more could've been done, suspense could've been created, and more emotion could've been erected. This is an inspiring film, but greatly inferior to a sports drama like Remember the Titans. One is greatly ambitious, willing to tackle many different fields in its genre. The other is a textbook drama, with poignantly satisfying moments, yet a lot of empty ones.<br/><br/>Starring: Sean Astin, Jon Favrea, Ned Beatty, and Charles S. Dutton. Directed by: David Anspaugh."

","You may not necessarily have to be a football fan to like this movie, but ""Rudy"" stands the test of time as one of the best football movie ever put on celluloid. It goes beyond what ""Paper Lion"" tried to achieve in the 1960's but this one steps the ante by a mile to provide you with the quest for one's quest to be the best that he could be and to have a role model any underdog can look upon to. <br/><br/>Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger always has aspirations to play for the Notre Dame Flaming Irish. His dreams were put on hold when his friend suddenly dies, Rudy is determined more than ever to play for Notre Dame much to the dismay of his wife (Lili Taylor) and is dad (Ned Beatty). <br/><br/>Sure it's not really a football film as we are witnessed to just one game and aside from a scene in the early-goings there are no football scenes until the latter portions of the movie. <br/><br/>The acting truly defines brilliance. Sean Astin was very stunning in his role as Rudy, his performance will make you reach out for the tissue box, but there are moments where he adds some humor to his performance. Along with his early childhood role in ""The Goonies"" and later on as Sam from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, Astin has put on a resume that spans over 25 years in the movie industry. It's a shame he's been overlooked over the years, by lesser talents like Corey Feldman and Haley Joel Osement. This guy has showcased he has charm and talent which goes together like fish and chips. Charles Dutton provides a stimulating performance as the gruff but kindhearted groundskeeper. Dutton prevents his role from being a throwback role by making it a pivotal supporting role. The musical score is something to get the party going. Sure it gets repetitive at times, it succeeds in keeping the spirit of this film alive. <br/><br/>Sure it can be overlooked by other classic sports movies like ""Rocky"" or ""Raging Bull"", but ""Rudy"" is right up there with the big guns. What makes this movie a standout is the wonderful acting, the never give up message behind it the story and a character you could cheer for the whole way through."

","I was not super wild about this movie or highly motivated by this film, but all in all it was rather good and interesting. Sports films just usually do not really pump me up in that the sports scenes, or the scenes depicting the game itself being played look so fake compared to real sports. Still, this one did rather good on those points, and the actually playing of football takes a back seat to all the things the title character had to do to get on the field. The story is simple enough, a good high school football player has dreams of playing for his favorite football team, Notre Dame. So a good football player should get a scholarship, correct? Not in the case of Rudy who is very undersized. Basically, a lot of desire, but not a lot of physical talent. So he does what he can to try and first enroll at Notre Dame and then get onto the football team as a walk on. You get to see the bumps and physical pounding he endures as he basically plays kind of a practice team player, basically a guy who never sees the field, but helps the first and second and third stringers get ready for their games. So it is a bit inspiring to see this guy keep plugging away and trying his best and getting smashed. Even the regular players tell him to take it easy, but he simply tells them he has to go all out to help them prepare. Good sports movie, a genre that is not exactly a favorite, but I have a few I like of which this is one."

","Rudy (1993)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Winning drama tells the true story of ""Rudy"" Ruettiger (Sean Astin), a man without much athletic talent and even less when it comes to book smarts but he has a dream to suit up for the Notre Dame football team. Director Anspaugh also made the film HOOSIERS, which is certainly a lot better than this one but there's no question that this is yet another winning entry in a genre that can deliver the goods when they get it right. I think these sports movies remain so popular simply because I'm sure everyone has a dream but more often than not these dreams go unfulfilled so when something special comes along and someone does get to fulfill these dreams, it makes for a terrific story and that's pretty much what we've got here. This entire movie is built around everyone telling Rudy it would be impossible for him to even get into Notre Dame let alone actually make the team. What's interesting is that Rudy never dreams about actually playing but instead he just wants to wear the uniform of the team he and his father (Ned Beatty) love. The movie actually contains very little sports stuff as the entire first hour is pretty much building Rudy's relationship with various people including a brain (Jon Favreau) who helps him with his grades and a grounds keeper (Charles S. Dutton) who begins to feel for him. These relationships gets a lot of the running time and it certainly helps make the movie as it shows someone certainly needs help in following their dreams and at times needs a little push in the right direction. I also thought the relationship between Rudy and his relatives made for some nice drama. This was somewhat of a comeback for Astin who made a name for himself years earlier in various teen movies but he does a terrific job here and certainly delivers the performance of his career. The amount of passion and soul he brings to the role certainly makes you care for Rudy and want to see him succeed. The ending is where a lot of the emotion comes from but for me the highlight is when Astin reads the final letter to see if he gets into the school or not. Favreau adds some nice laughs in his supporting role and Beatty is extremely strong as the father. Dutton also gets to shine in a couple good, motivational scenes. I think the one fault with RUDY is that they spend a bit too much time at the start showing how no one believes in the guy. I think there was a bit too much of this as the point is made very clearly and after a while it just seems like we're being hit over the head with the stuff. Jerry Goldsmith's passionate score also brings a lot of emotion to the film. While not one of the greatest sports movies ever made, this is still a very entertaining and moving film that I'm sure will remain a favorite to many people."

If memory serves the one he's listening to is the same one Pat O'Brien used in Knute Rockne - All American. <br/><br/>Astin actually makes the team when he impresses everyone with his grit and heart.

","If you don't like Rudy you have to be just a terribly cynical and rather unhappy person. It may not fit the mold of what are generally thought to be ""classic"" films. But few movies will make you feel any better. This is as uplifting and inspiring as cinema gets and if you can't see that then I feel sorry for you. How anyone could not be left with a smile on their face after watching this movie is beyond me.<br/><br/>The film's story is actually rather simple. Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger grew up in Illinois with one dream...to play football for his beloved Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Unfortunately for Rudy this was essentially an impossible dream. He's much too small to play major college football and, as one character will point out, he possesses hardly a speck of athletic ability. And while he's not much of a football player Rudy isn't much of a student either. He doesn't have the grades to get into community college much less Notre Dame. But what Rudy does have is a seemingly limitless supply of heart and determination. He is going to play football at Notre Dame and nobody will ever convince him otherwise.<br/><br/>As we follow Rudy's journey and see all the obstacles put up in his way it is almost unfathomable that he could ultimately succeed. But this is a movie about living the dream. The writer and director are never shy about tugging on the viewer's heartstrings as Rudy's story unfolds. They knew that in order for the movie to ultimately work those watching were going to have to fall in love with their main character. And sure enough, thanks in no small part to a wonderful performance from Sean Astin, Rudy is a character you embrace wholeheartedly. There are more than a few times during the film when you might find yourself with a lump in the throat. And then there's that final scene which, inevitable though it may be, packs such a tremendous emotional wallop. It's a scene which proves that yes it is OK for even the toughest of tough guys to shed a tear when watching a movie. Rare is the movie which makes you want to stand up and cheer even as you wipe the tears from your eyes. This is one of those movies. It may never make any of those lists of all-time greatest movies. But when you need a pick-me-up, when you need a little inspiration, maybe when you need to have a little bit of faith restored you can't do any better than to sit down and spend two hours in the company of this lovable underdog. All together now...RUDY! RUDY! RUDY!"

Rudy had no talent, no natural ability, and subsequently almost nobody who believed in his impossible dream. Rudy had more than that. He had heart and an unquenchable determination.

","I must begin by saying Rudy is in my top 5 of all time but the ending ruins it for me as a true American football fan. Only the soundtrack saved the director from total humiliation. First of all, Rudy sacks the QB on the last play of the game and the cheap actor they picked to play Devine just turns and smiles that smile I've hated for so many years. Why are they just standing there and not going to middle of the field. Its the end of the game! Also, notice as Rudy is carried off the field...check out the fans in the stands. Great direction you idiot!! The fans act like its a halftime shooting! Which it was! They should have been jumping, screaming, clapping. What a disaster. I've held this in for the 50..yes 50 times I've watched this film. Only the real Rudy kneeling and the fact his siblings all went to college save your directory idiot butt! VERY POOR JOB. Guess some directors don't study their craft."

","Sports figures seem to have taken the place of saints in our culture, figures of veneration and inspiration who show us by example that nothing in life is impossible, that we can achieve transcendence by pure will. Witness ""Rudy"", a moving film based on a true story of a runt who won't take no for an answer in chasing his dream.<br/><br/>Daniel ""Rudy"" Ruettiger (Sean Astin) lacks the grades, the size, and the social status to realize his dream of playing for the fabled University of Notre Dame's football program. What he has is heart, lots of it, enough to save up tuition, attend a community college, transfer to Notre Dame, and work on Notre Dame's practice squad, the human tackling dummies which the Blue-and-Gold scrimmage against between the big games.<br/><br/>""Having dreams is what makes life tolerable"", one of Rudy's friends tells him early on, when encouragement is otherwise sparse.<br/><br/>Calling ""Rudy"" corny is missing the point. Sure, it plays with your heartstrings, but the script makes its points deftly and manipulates by subtle degrees. What makes ""Rudy"" more than tolerable is the broad, muted palette of cinematographer Oliver Wood; a serene yet surging Jerry Goldsmith score; and winning performances across the board, particularly by Astin as the slow-but-doughty title character.<br/><br/>People who argue ""Rudy"" is a recruitment ad for Notre Dame ignore an important point: The school doesn't come off too swell for much of the film. It's an imposing, elitist place, where with the exception of one priest (Robert Prosky) who tells Rudy the admissions board is ""a tricky bunch of squirrels"", no one has much time for Rudy. Touchdown Jesus looms in the background of some scenes, a stiff, unwelcoming presence to contrast with Rudy shuffling off slump-shouldered in the foreground.<br/><br/>All this is to set up ""Rudy's"" great trump card, that Rudy the reject is going to accomplish something important before the film is over, that Rudy, like the stone the builders rejected, will become the cornerstone of the Fighting Irish football program. Maybe that's a bit far-fetched, but the Rudy story probably gets more play now than any Notre Dame legend short of the Gipper.<br/><br/>Speaking of George Gipp, his attributed dying words to Knute Rockne are recited by Astin, and there's also a marvelous sequence where a subdued choral version of the Notre Dame Victory March is sung over violent images from scrimmages where Rudy is pummeled and pounded into the turf. Director David Anspaugh uses such tools sparingly but effectively: We never see an actual play in a football game until very near the end, which maximizes its impact.<br/><br/>""Rudy"" starts slow, remains a tad ponderous, and gets more than a little free with the facts (Example: There was no older brother ""Frank"" ragging on Rudy about his Notre dream.) Astin's perfect coif amid otherwise direly authentic '70s hairdos always grates, but ""Rudy"" is a winner, another in a long line of sports movies that present a case for man's transcendence in an otherwise dreary plane of existence."

","We saw that a reviewer said that RUDY was....""Better Than ROCKY!"", well it's really hard to say that. I mean, it's hard to compete with a Moose & Squirrel! Seriously though......<br/><br/>It's extremely difficult to not like RUDY. After all, it contains all the elements that make for a good story. We have an underdog kid, from a Blue Collar background. This little guy dares to think and dream big.<br/><br/>It starts out when Rudy is a young kid, but always a guy to try to keep up with the older guys. His love of Notre Dame Fotball comes about quite naturally, as his Dad, Daniel Ruttiger, Sr., proclaims that, ""We only watch one team in this house! Right Rudy!"" Young Rudy takes it all very seriously by reading, studying and even listening to old recordings of the Great Notre Dame Coach, Knute Rockne.<br/><br/>The story jumps forth abruptly to a scene where in Rudy and his friend, Pete, are at their last football practice as Seniors at Joliet Catholic High School*, Joliet Illinois. In it we learn that Rudy, though small for football, demonstrates a bull dog tenacity that has not gone un-noticed nor unappreciated by his coaches.<br/><br/>After being discouraged by just about everybody,including a teacher-priest, we move on to see he now settles into a job at the Steel Mill where father works and his girlfriend(since childhood)plan to marry and buy a house in the town.<br/><br/>A sudden and bitter blow comes to Rudy. His best friend, Pete,is killed in an industrial accident at the plant. Realizing that time is running out, Rudy sets out to go and enter Notre Dame, sudden like. He has not applied and is in need of remedial work. He is befriended by Father Callahan (Robert Prosky giving his usual great performance.).The good Father gets him into the nearby Holy Cross Junior College, also run by the Holy Cross Order.<br/><br/>Well, all of this is just the beginning. The story goes on to chronicle his struggles and the friends made along the way. Jon Favreau (D-Bob, Tutor and friend) and Charles Dutton (Fortune, N.D.Stadium Maintainence Supervisor and friend) are particularly effective and enjoyable in their roles.<br/><br/>Well can you tell what happens next? In order to get a chance at the football team, he'll need to make good enough grades and be accepted by the N.D. Admissions Office. How will he do in this quest? Well, we all kinda know that there will be success, but just how it is accomplished, that'll have to remain unwritten here.<br/><br/>One thing that we must keep in mind. RUDY is a biopic. It, like all of the others must follow a certain formula. Just like so many of the great biographies in the past, you are sure to have the following elements. The story will open some years earlier. The subject of the story will show some traits that serve as a foreshadowing of future events.<br/><br/>Hence, the young Lou Gerhig in PRIDE OF THE YANKEES breaks a store window with a long drive hit off the kids' sandlot baseball field. He also has a favourite baseball card of 'rookie' George Herman Ruth, who will be a team mate as Babe Ruth when Lou reaches adulthood. Knute Rockne plays a game of pick-up tackle football and immediately displays his prowess a left end (his position in NOTRE DAME'S routing of ARMY with the forward pass. Then or now, a biopic is a biopic.<br/><br/>One thing more. RUDY benefits from some really fine cinematography. The Camera really captures the spirit and the mood.Also the sets are just about perfect from the old neighborhood, Joliet Catholic High and especially the beautiful and magnificent Campus of Notre Dame. <br/><br/>See the film.Rent it or better yet, buy it soon! It's a keeper, guaranteed, so help me Lord! <br/><br/>* The scenes set at Joliet Catholic High School, the Football Field and the Funeral at the Church, were all filmed at the old campus of St.Rita High School, located near 63rd Street & Western Avenue on the Southwest Side of Chicago. I can vouch for it, being an Alumnus of the joint."

","Sean Astin in RUDY, a brilliant role for a brilliant actor.<br/><br/>The tag line for RUDY is: ""if anyone ever says to you dreams don't<br/><br/>come true, you tell them about Rudy.""  That's just what I've done<br/><br/>since seeing RUDY when I was in high school.  In fact, people<br/><br/>don't even have to mention the possibility of a dream not coming<br/><br/>true; at the mere mention of dreams alone I tell them all about<br/><br/>Rudy Ruettiger, and how he dreamed of going to prestigious Notre<br/><br/>Dame University to play football, but was small and not particularly<br/><br/>bright and from a blue collar family, but he didn't give up and he<br/><br/>kept trying, and you know what... I'm going to stop there, because I<br/><br/>didn't warn you folks for spoilers, and I don't want to get blocked.<br/><br/>But let's just say dreams do come true.  They did for Rudy, anyway. <br/><br/>Another great reason to watch RUDY is to see the first movie Jon<br/><br/>Favreau and Vince Vaughn were in together.  Favreau has a<br/><br/>sizeable part (pun intended) as D-Bob, Rudy's faithful college<br/><br/>buddy, and boy is he chunky in this one.  I really have to give<br/><br/>Favreau props for shedding all that weight some time between<br/><br/>RUDY and SWINGERS.  I'm not exaggerating, Favreau must have<br/><br/>weighed a deuce and a half back when RUDY was made.  Vince<br/><br/>Vaughn plays a football team mate, but it's a very small part.  Back<br/><br/>to Favreau, though... he was HUGE.  I'm very interested to find out<br/><br/>how he lost the weight."

","this is the ""rocky"" of football.  i always feel great after watching this movie.  not arcane or esoteric, just a straight-ahead little movie with a great message that the whole family can watch and enjoy.  we need more movies like this.  i wish i could feel as strongly about anything as rudy felt about his goals, i would wish that for everyone."
