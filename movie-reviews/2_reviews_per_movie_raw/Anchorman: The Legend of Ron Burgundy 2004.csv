"MaxJSteele","10","202","287","23 January 2006"," This absurd comedy had to convince me...and somehow it did
","When Anchorman came into theaters, I avoided it like a dead sewer rat. When it came onto HBO, I pretended it didn't exist. In fact, I would not have even LOOKED at it had my remote control not stuck on the stupid channel. So I watched a few minutes. I didn't laugh. I wasn't surprised.<br/><br/>Then one day, surfing the premium movie channels, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the offerings. So I turned on Anchorman, about 5 minutes in. For the next hour and a half, I proceeded to laugh hysterically. Scene after scene, line after line, I found new reasons to laugh. By the end, I could hardly breathe.<br/><br/>Unconvinced that I had stumbled upon a a re-watchable movie, I tested and retested it over and over. And over. Result confirmed.<br/><br/>Anchorman tells a simple story: acclaimed (and consequently arrogant) news anchor Ron Burgundy is forced to adapt when an attractive new female member of the Channel 4 news team (Applegate) begins changing the way he and his quirky news team work. That's it. This story is predictable, prescription-esquire, boring. But Anchorman does not draw it's strength from story. It draws from the hilarious situations. It draws from randomness. It draws from brief--but memorable--cameos. It draws from those 100 or so unforgettable one-liners.<br/><br/>That is, if you're looking for cinema, for a fine work of craftsmanship, a eloquent script, and an Oscar nomination, go watch a FILM. If you find randomness hilarious, then watch this MOVIE."

","In a year packed with comedies that were all a bit stupid and silly (and all seemed to feature Ben Stiller), Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy reigns supreme above them all. This is a movie that is well aware of its own stupidity, and best of all, it is able to embrace it skillfully so that it is exactly as silly and immature as it wants to be. It is such a great comedy; I'd consider it the Naked Gun of our generation.<br/><br/>As apposed to many, many, other comedies, Anchorman actually gets better as it moves along. Most of the time a comedy like this will use up all the laughs in the first hour and then try to take a serious, lovey-dovey turn in the last act. There are more laughs in the last half hour than in the first half hour, which usually is never the case. It's as if there was some mathematical comedic formula that spread the laughs out in a way that it was consistently funny. Or, maybe they just got lucky. I dunno.<br/><br/>I loved all the characters in the movie, every role no matter how small had a great moment or two. Will Ferrel of course, the star of the movie who is just perfect as Ron. He's so so funny 'cause he's such a lovable idiot. Even Christina Appelgate, who was in a role that quite honestly anyone could have done, is able to make it her own and provide some laughs. There is a scene that has a lot of cameos that was hilarious as well. It was one of those moments that takes you completely by surprise.<br/><br/>So, what else can I say except that I loved Anchorman! It's the best ""stupid"" comedy I've seen in years. This is Will Ferrel at his best and it will be hard to top.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10"

","This summer I've seen several intentionally stupid funny movies, and enjoyed them. Adam McKay's ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is no exception. Seems that my taste for high concept cinema has been influenced by the summer-- well not really. This movie written by McKay and it's star Will Ferrell is an outrageous and completely over the top comedy. Applaud Will Ferrell as the mind bendingly stupid and self absorbed, San Diego newscaster, Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions. Ferrell creates a great deadpan sense with his cohabiting dog, Baxter, and the fact that his character Ron Burgundy will read ANYTHING on the teleprompter, his tragic flaw, well at least one of several, is priceless. Ferrell also never crosses the line of being a complete jerk which is an amazing accomplishment. In fact, Ferrell gives Ron a muted charm-- he really does grow on you. <br/><br/>Basically, ""Anchorman"" is an extended sitcom. Ron is informed by his station manager, Ed (a funny Fred Willard), that he will have a co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone (a hot Christina Applegate). Turns out that Veronica was a woman whom was immune to Ron's vast charm at a wild news crew party. Veronica is beautiful, ambitious, and smart. She too has aspirations of being a Network Anchor. The Boys Club news crew which include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and the dumb as a post weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) all make their play for Veronica. However, she falls for Ron in spite of himself. Ron eventually woos her affections in a totally wacky jazz flute display. The screen writing is so skewed in a good way, and it has absolutely no shame. There is a classic scene with Ron's dog Baxter, and a bridge that according to my bud, John, shatters a fundamental script writing rule. In another memorable scene Ron gives an erroneous translation of the name San Diego to Veronica that is hilarious. ""Anchorman"" also benefits from cameos of talented actors, most notably Vince Vaughn as Wes Mantooth, the rival station anchor. Christina Applegate looks great, and truly has a talent for comedy. <br/><br/>""Anchorman"" is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. ""Anchorman"" is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next. For now, ""Anchorman"" is just great fun, and very funny stuff."

","Halloween came and went and I was Ron Burgundy, and then I realized I haven't reviewed one of the funniest movies ever made, Anchorman. With the second movie just around the corner there is no better time to review this movie. Anchorman launched Will Ferrell's career and basically jump started Steve Carell's career. Anchorman is the story of a 1960s Anchorman, Ron Burgundy who struggles with the changing times and the threat of a female anchor. This movie is hysterical from beginning to end and is brilliant in its writing and performances. <br/><br/>Will Ferrell was on SNL but when he left Anchorman took Hollywood by storm. The witty lines and catchphrases of Ron Burgundy made him a pop culture icon. Ron is a brilliant character who is played perfectly by Will Ferrell. His relationships with all other characters are unique and funny in different ways. His main relationship is his with Veronica Corningstone but my favorite is his relationship with Baxter. Baxter is Ron's dog and the very first scene we see with him he barks and Ron apparently speaks dogs and its very funny. Then the shot with Baxter in the pajamas is my favorite in the entire movie. Baxter is the greatest dog in any movie, there I said it. I would name my dog Baxter if I had one.<br/><br/>A comedy has to be memorable and quotable. This movie is one of the most quotable movies I have ever seen. I know scenes word for word just because they are funny. The sky rocket in flight scene to when Ron yells ""cannonball"" I could go off on every funny quote but then it wouldn't be a review. The writing in this movie was fantastic. The scenes were well put together and you can tell when Ferrell is improvising. Her says things like ""by the beard of Zeus."" Nobody wrote that, it was on the top of his head, but it works. Ferrell has a talent for improve, witty comments. He is the clear star of the movie but there is just enough room for the spotlight to be shared. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Fred Willard are also very funny but Steve Carell shines bright in this movie. Fred Willard is a lot of weird people in a lot of weird movies but his running gag with his phone calls about his son never gets old. Carell plays Brick, just from his name you know he is funny. In his opening scene he says ""years later a doctor will tell me I'm mentally retarded."" Perfect. His comedy is well placed and more subtle than anything. ""Brick where did you get the hand grenade?"" ""I don't know."" He says, need I say more. We all know that scene. It's the best scene.<br/><br/>The best scene in this movie is one I see on TV all the time. It's the battle of the news teams. Basically, its complete anarchy and nonstop laughs. There are a million cameos in this movie, including Ben Stiller, Seth Rogan, Vince Vaughn, Fred Armisen, Jack Black, and even Danny Trejo. I like it when comedies have cameos, especially with big name stars, because they can be so effective in such a small time. Stiller has one or two lines but it adds so much to the scene and makes it that much funnier. <br/><br/>Comedies tend to drag on a little bit in the middle to get a hold of the story and build up to a hilarious climax and ending. This movie kind of does that after Ron's interaction with Jack Black. The movie takes a dive and isn't as funny as the rest but the movie can't be 100% funny. The story was ridiculous but it had a meaning. It showed the change in American society and how women were becoming a bigger part of it. The movie did need to portray that message and it did. I usually don't like that in comedies, but I can look past it for this movie. <br/><br/>Overall, Anchorman was a riot of laughs. Every time I watch this movie, I laugh. I laugh at the same things I've laughed at millions of times before. If this movie is on TV I sit and watch it. I can jump in at any moment and enjoy it. I can watch this movie over and over. I watched it twice in a month and still enjoyed it. I can watch it alone but its better with other people. For that, Anchorman gets the WillyT Comedic Crest and the WillyT Seal of Approval. Go see this movie if you haven't, and you stay classy."
"MildInconvenienceMan","8","4","4","16 October 2012"," Puts a hilarious view on a textbook love story to create something amazing.
","This film is on of my favourite films of all time, it is brilliantly light hearted and due to its light hearted nature, every line is essentially 'quotable' and most people would know what the quote was from if you name one.<br/><br/>Although the storyline is not all that complex this film makes up for it with its characters who are all amazingly funny and you will find yourself laughing for hours at the amazingly synthetic conversations that you cant help but smile at. Although in retrospect this is a text book love story it is in the characters that we therefore get the real story and the comedy.<br/><br/>I watched this film a few years ago and thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever seen, however once I had expanded my movie knowledge just a little bit then I found it was a little outdated and was not as funny as I remember but it still none the less does deliver in terms of comedy.<br/><br/>This film also does look into the issue of womens rights and how this was opposed but accepted due to womens strife, which is something you really don't think about on face value with this film, as it just seems like a pure and pointless comedy film, but actually it does have a meaning although a little biased that can be seen as a relatively accurate portrayal.<br/><br/>This film has really great acting with my favourites going to the channel four news team, and even more in particular to Ferrel for creating such an iconic character, and Carrell for creating the most amazingly stupid character I've ever seen, it is needless to say that anyone would find a character to relate to in amongst this group.<br/><br/>All in all I really enjoyed this film, puts a hilarious view on a textbook love story to create something amazing."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","18","26","4 September 2008"," The Legend Of Ron Burgandy and Veronica Cornerstone
","I had been avoiding myself from watching 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' for a long time because I thought that it would be another one of those wannabe non-funny comedies. I liked Ferrell a lot in comedies like 'Legally Blonde' and 'Stranger Than Fiction' where he really downplays the humour but I saw some of his Saturday Night Live sketches and many were plain awful. Anyway, I later found out that the cast also included Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd and Steve Carell and so I was curious to how Ferrell works with these talented comedy actors.<br/><br/>So that's that and now, after having seen it, I must add that 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a laugh riot. It superbly spoofs the 70s. Adam McKay brings together an excellent comedic cast playing colourful characters. Ferrell and Applegate are at the centre of the film and both are stupendous! But the supporting cast that includes David Koechner as a 'macho' wannabe who's actually a closet homosexual, Paul Rudd as a virgin stud, Steven Carell as a mentally stunted weatherman and Fred Willard as the laid back boss equally stand out with their gags and superb comic timing. Just when I was thinking that it would be funny if Vince Vaughn was part of the cast, he appears on screen as the 'deadly' rival. There are also notable cameos by a psychopathic Tim Robbins, a Hispanic Ben Stiller, an armless Luke Wilson and Jack Black as a cruel junkie.<br/><br/>I'd recommend to watch the movie with English subtitles as there are some hilarious lines between Burgundy's dog and a bear which is spoken in animal language. There are so many more laugh-out-loud moments that it's hard for me to single out a particular scene. Which one shall I say? The scene where he plays the flute to impress Veronica, Veronica screaming 'Ron!' (in typical 70's melodramatic style) when he gets fired, the entire bear awakening sequence, the battle between the anchormen, Veronica challenging Ed with her three strengths: screwing, fighting and news-reading ....there's just too many.<br/><br/>While being an out-and-out comedy, it does bring forth some serious issues like gender equality (which was still a problem in the 70s). Though the undertone is serious, it's all presented in a comedic way but it never makes fun of the issue. For example, Veronica is continuously harassed by her male co-workers but she stays strong without succumbing to their rudeness.<br/><br/>'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a joyride all the way. Whether one likes the film or not, I'm sure they at least would have a good laugh."

","I was never as excited about this movie as my boyfriend was, mostly because I chalk Will Ferrell's humor up to the level of fratboy hijinx, sex jokes, and toilet humor. But I was willing to chill on the couch and watch the hour and a half comedy. I liked him okay on SNL, and I was mildly amused my Old School. I thought it would be a nice way to relax on a Monday night.<br/><br/>And relax I did...almost to the point of falling asleep. Not only were the jokes not funny, there were so few of them. Long periods of boring-ness separated the gags, which included, and I still cannot believe this, Will Farrell and Christina Applegate riding around on animated unicorns, Paul Rudd spraying on cologne that contained chunks of raw meat (panther), Luke Wilson getting his arm chopped off (not even worthy of the Monty Python memory it conjures up), and Will Farrell ACTUALLY EATING A PIECE OF FECES.<br/><br/>Have we come to this? Is this what's supposed to make us laugh now? Even the most quotable line from the movie, which the men in my life will not stop repeating, is ""you smell like big foot's dick."" Even that just isn't funny. (note: watch Napoleon Dynamite if you want some real quotable material.) The only redeeming qualities of the movie are Steven Carell and Jack Black's brief scene with Baxter, the dog. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. ""Biker...Punted...Baxter"" Save your time and your money on this one. I sure am glad I didn't have to pay to see it..."
"Buddy-51","7","55","94","3 September 2005"," more a pleasant parody than a biting satire
","""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970's, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America's television newsrooms.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays a Ted Baxter-type anchorman (is it mere coincidence that his dog is named Baxter?) - vain, narcissistic, none too gifted in the brains department - who has worked for years as the sole news dispenser at a top-rated San Diego station. All is going well for Ron Burgundy until the station manager decides the newscast needs a bit more ""diversity"" and hires a female reporter named Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) to come on board. Cornerstone is a brainy, blow-dried blonde with a driving ambition to be the first female anchor on network news. Since most of the men who work at the station, including Burgundy, are dyed-in-the-wool misogynists, Ms. Cornerstone faces an uphill battle of sexist comments, schoolboy pranks, and subtle (and not so subtle) undermining as she climbs her way to the top (though she is not above pulling a few dirty tricks herself to get what she wants). Things really get dicey when Burgundy and Cornerstone begin dating and quickly fall in love, a situation rife with potential disaster as Cornerstone begins to encroach on Burgundy's professional territory.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" is a light-hearted, enjoyable little comedy that, unlike a full-throated satire (say, like ""Network""), often goes for the easy laugh instead of the incisive barb. The movie is at its best when it is parodying the corny graphics and the tendency to over hype the trivial (""Panda Watch: Day 46"") that define modern newscasts - and at its worst when it is indulging in silly, often scatological jokes and slapstick throw away bits. Like most mainstream comedies, the humor in ""Anchorman"" ranges from the mildly funny to the downright hilarious, the latter including a clever ""West Side Story"" parody involving a rumble between rival news teams, and a conversation between a dog and a bear that ends the movie on a ludicrous but knee-slapping high note.<br/><br/>Ferrell (who co-wrote the film) is his usual manic self, unctuous but likable, and Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, and Fred Willard do fine work in supporting roles. Moreover, writer/director Adam McKay provides a smattering of guest appearances from such well known stars as Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and even Ben Stiller, many of who are not listed in the official credits.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" goes down easily - a bit too easily, perhaps, for a film that, with a little more courage, might have become a scathing satire on an industry that could do with a little merciless skewering right about now. Still, ""Anchorman"" is fun while it lasts - and these days we'll settle for what we can get when it comes to laughs."

","The most devoted cineastes and the average hoi polloi moviegoers both need to kick back and laugh, without probing or analysis, at a goofball, outrageously funny comedy with zero depth. And that's exactly what director Adam McKay (also co-writer with star Will Ferrell) provides in ""Anchorman."" A very warm summer day, like today, was perfect for the quick gags and physical comedy of this nutty flick. Maybe it's even more of a relief for us folks who are still arguing with each other about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Control Room,"" documentaries that make us confront a difficult present and a tenuous future.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is TV news anchor Ron Burgundy in 1970s San Diego. This is Pre-B.W. (Barbara Walters), a dark age when men reported the news almost exclusively. Burgundy, shallow and self-absorbed without redemption, chases skirts and is so genuinely stupid he reads ANYTHING on the teleprompter. His news crew consists of adulators and one misfit, Brick Tamland, played with unremitting mental blankness by Steve Carrell. Burgundy's dog is a delight, a pooch who can bark in a few languages.<br/><br/>The ""Men's Club"" is jolted by the station honcho's decision to add a woman to the newsroom, largely to appease the network satraps. He says it's necessary in the interests of ""diversity,"" a word one staff member doesn't even understand. Enter pretty but tough Veronica Corningstone, Christina Applegate. Applegate makes what really is a tough comedic role work completely.<br/><br/>A misadventure by Burgundy results in Veronica's pinch-hitting chance to anchor the evening news. Veronica scores big time. She and Ron are already lovers and she expects him to be thrilled that his absence was her big break. No way and the rest of the film is Ron's Revenge and Veronica's Counterattack.<br/><br/>A subplot is the rivalry between Ron and his crew and the mobile news gatherers of competing stations. This ends in a donnybrook reminiscent of the silent film era having no rhyme or reason. The other stations' combatants are led by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. Robbins, one of the most intelligent and versatile personalities in film and stage today, should be watched closely. He almost loses his composure acting the zany script. Even Jack Black makes it into the flick as a dedicated junkie.<br/><br/>Don't miss the outtakes as the end credits role, especially Ferrell's last comment on what the movie really is.<br/><br/>Pure summer fun-laugh, be happy.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Oneiric","3","62","109","17 July 2004"," Wow, that was bad (very slight spoiler).
","My expectations were low. I've liked Will Ferrell's brand of soft-edged mania well enough in the past, but not enough to go see a movie just because he's in it. I went because I remember San Diego in the 1970's, and even the network news in that sleepy city in that era.<br/><br/>As I say, my expectations were low, and I was still very disappointed. I realize it's the 14-year-old inside this was aimed at, not my 41-year-old outside -- but I know a lot of teenagers, and none of them are stupid enough to enjoy this. The script was atrocious, even when you're not bothering to score for plot. Most of the jokes and set pieces were lame -- even ""Afternoon Delight"" fell flat. <br/><br/>The performances were no better. Will Farrell was not much more than present. I've seen him show more heart in SNL sketches, or even as the cop on the trail in the Jay and Silent Bob movie. Fred Willard, so brilliant in Best in Show, looked sad and tired. Most strangely, the comedy casting at the center was deeply flawed. Two of the three sidekicks were worthless: just...not...funny. Not even for one second. Steve Carell was funny, or at least absurd, for about five seconds. <br/><br/>You know you're watching a bad movie when the senseless cameos and animal dialogs are the only things you can summon up as enjoyable memories. Waste no money or time on this turkey!"
"byght","7","84","154","12 July 2004"," Consistent and thorough silliness keep this above-average comedy afloat
","I went to ""Anchorman"" expecting another super-mainstream, lowest-common-denominator, SNL-derived romp. Now, these aren't the worst movies in the world, to be sure. ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Old School"" are pretty agreeable ways to while away the time. But usually about an hour in to these affairs, I've had enough of the broadness and predictability, which starts to get downright oppressive. It's not just that they're lowbrow--it's that they're so overwhelmingly, disappointingly conventional.<br/><br/>Luckily, this isn't what ""Anchorman"" is. ""Anchorman"" is a refreshingly off-kilter outing from an unlikely source--Will Ferrell, the current reigning lord of middle-of-the-road fratboy Sandlerism. The film has a lot more in common with Mel Brooks and Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker than anything in the SNL family tree. It prizes out-and-out silliness and absurdity over bathroom humor and penis jokes (though there's plenty of the latter, don't worry), and pulls it off admirably. In essence, the key to this stuff is never letting off of the goofiness even for a second--the audience should never be allowed to take anything seriously.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" achieves this with exceedingly silly and bizarre dialogue complemented by killer comic performances from Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn and Steve Carrel. You'd have to be lobotomized to maintain a straight face through lines like ""It's made with bits of real panther. So you know it's good."" and ""I'm riding a big, furry tractor!"" The direction and pacing are also pretty solid at times, and the requisite celeb cameos are very nicely done (especially in one particular scene which I wouldn't dream of ruining).<br/><br/>The film's not without its flaws, certainly. Chief among them is the wasting of one of the best comic character actors in the biz: Fred Willard. If ever there was someone born to play a smarmy local TV newsman, Willard is it. But he's inexplicably cast here as a dull station suit, while David Koechner plods through the sportscaster role that was clearly meant for him--passable but certainly not as inspired as Willard would have been. Also, I think that the story would have benefited if Vaughn and his cronies, the closest thing to villains in this lightheaded romp, had a little more face time.<br/><br/>But these are comparatively minor problems--the point is that Ferrel has given us something that's really funny in a way that's appreciably different from the endless SNL movie-mill. It's not Monty Python, but it is a healthy departure from what has become the comic mainstream. Most importantly, the laughs are frequent, long, and deep--check it out and you won't be disappointed."

","As I sit and watch Anchorman for what must be the 1000th time, I can't help but ask myself; WHY? Well, the answer is simple. This movie freaking rocks! It boasts an unbelievable amount of one-liners that I am spouting constantly. It could quite possibly become the most often quoted movie ever. Will Ferrell's over-the-top performance, along with other cast members equally daring acts, makes you wonder how much of the movie was scripted, and how much was ad-lib. All of the characters support each other so well, that it is nearly impossible not to have a favorite line from each one. <br/><br/>I am not a fan of all of Ferrell's movies (especially Kicking and Screaming), but this one will be near the top of my list for years to come, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Because, as we all know, 'Sixty percent of the time, it works every time!'"
"nycritic","8","30","51","18 July 2005"," Beauty and the Self-Absorbed Anchorman
","I came unto this movie only for the scene in the trailer that showed Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) leaping into each other's arms, right on top of a conference table, as Ferrell yelled, ""Let's make a baby!"" Which is essentially saying I decided to give it a chance out of vague curiosity, not expecting an even remotely good collection of skits straight out of Saturday Night Live. And, I'll say this: I was proved wrong.<br/><br/>The story that THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY tells is simple, but deceptive: while having Ron Burgundy (San Diego's Channel 4's main anchorman) as its main character, it's actually the story of how Veronica Corningstone came unto this TV station and on the way to becoming the first female news anchor confronted massive opposition from her male co-workers who wouldn't even assign her a decent office on her first day of work, much less give her the chance to report the news. That she is quoted as being an ice queen after she aggressively rebukes the sexual advances of Burgundy's clique (recalling in a much lesser way Faye Dunaway's emasculating Diana Christensen) is part of her charm, and it's this charm the reason Burgundy eventually falls for her, and part of what belies her true nature once she decides to climb her own ladder to success. <br/><br/>Applegate is great in her role because she never tries to make her character too harsh even when her own mean streak comes out late in the movie and gets Ron Burgundy fired from the office. While still not having a breakout role, her interpretation has the right element of spunk and humanity, and her chemistry is very palpable with Ferrell whenever they're on camera together which is often. Ferrell, on the other hand, let's loose, but because he's so good, his role doesn't become something that belongs strictly on Saturday Night Live and I think he has the potential to do with his career what Tom Hanks has done with his own which is transcend broad comedy and move into power-acting. His Ron Burgundy is, quite simply, a deluded clown, but a likable one, much like the Ted Baxter was on THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.<br/><br/>Much credit has to go to the writers who devised the hilarious jokes. The names of the characters alone are exaggerated, as is the scene where the news anchors from rival stations collide in a bloodbath (which features cameos from Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Tim Robbins), and another great moment when Burgundy encounters an angry biker (Jack Black) on his way to work, and who kicks his dog into the bay. We can see the dog is clearly a doll, but the temerity of the scene which recalls a similar scene in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY stands. <br/><br/>I think the essence of the movie can be summed up in one scene, though: who can recall growing up in the 70s and seeing the credits roll as the news program came to an end and the two anchors were seen chit-chatting amicably? There's a great inter-cutting between what a television (in Any Home, USA) is showing to the open verbal war that both anchors (Applegate and Ferrell) are engaging in. It makes one think of what actually happens once the newscast is over."

This really goes to show that these actors cannot be funny people, because if they were they could have nailed this film even though it has no plot. The only saviour of this film was Steve Carell as Brick who's complete randomness is admittedly hilarious but unfortunately not enough to make this a good film. Instead you are subject to poor, cringe worthy gags, and sparse prolonged periods of nothing. Apart from that, I was disappointed in my friends for telling me to watch it, I really did try to like this film and find it funny, but I just couldn't. You need the brain of a very dull 10 year old that finds fart noises funny to find this film even mildly amusing. Everyone I know either loves it, or hates it. So if you like plot-less stupid films, with very very few moments of any comedy value at all, watch it. If not, buy something else. But if it is on TV, its worth watching 10 minutes of it just for the jaw dropping amazement of how poor it is."

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is easily one of the funniest movies of the 21st century. The star studded comedy cast along with the great role play by actors such as Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, and Paul Rudd makes the film a great comedy for the generation of young adults and many adults who like 'stupid funny' movies. By describing it as 'stupid funny' I am summarizing how the film does not have anyone serious parts in it and makes jokes that can be inappropriate. The actors in this movie capture the audience with their satirical interpretation of late 1900's news crews. In this film actor Will Ferrell supported by actors previously listed as well as stars Vince Vaughen, Christina Applegate and many others go through the battle of separate news stations battling to be the top station in San Diego, California. This film wins the audience through its witty humor and classic one- liners that never seem to get old. Along with that the main characters of the film play extreme stereotypes that never break character. There is a stereotypical cowboy named Champ, a dummy named Brick, an overconfident ladies man named Brain, and of course a cocky lead anchor named Ron Burgundy. This odd combination of characters blends effectively by the randomness of the film. These characters begin the film as the most successful anchor crew in all of San Diego. They constantly gloat of their success to all the other all male crews. Their perfect reality slowly fades as an inspired young woman, Veronica Corningstone, is forced into their crew by the news station. The supporting news crew men all try to stun the beautiful lady at first, but of course they all fail. Ron Burgundy though succeeds in capturing the heart of Veronica but soon screws up ending their relationship harshly. ***(Next few lines are a spoiler)Ron cannot handle this woman sharing his role in the office and eventually goes crazy to the point where he is fired and goes into a solemn state. Eventually through comedic happenings he loses his friends and his beloved dog. After a long time of struggling Ron works to recapture his job and Veronica, and gets the chance by saving her from two grizzly bears during a news report at the zoo. *** As anyone can tell this story line and the characters are extremely random and 'out there', which I believe makes the movie all the more funny. You can never anticipate what happens next in the film because it ranges from a fight of different news crews in an alleyway to shopping for new suits. The one- liners that I mentioned earlier really bring out a lot of the comedy in the film. Some examples of these are following the news crew fight in the alleyway where the used axes and weapons, Ron Burgundy just says ""Well that escalated quickly."" Or another time Brian Fantana is talking about his 'illegal' cologne that he says ""They've done studies, you know. 60 percent of the time, it works every time."" He says this when referring to picking up woman while wearing the cologne. Just small things like that they say with their smug facial expressions make this movie a must- see. I would extremely recommend it to anyone searching for a good laugh."

","Don't really know how to describe this but what a waste of time. Ferrell has surprised me with good parts in Austin Powers movies and the hilarious Zoolander. This would have been a great part for the late, great Phil Hartman, who I would have love to have seen in this role. Just imagining what he would have been able to do with it makes it all the more sadder that he is no more.<br/><br/>Ron Burgundy, the anchor man Ferrell is portraying is in Ferrell's own words, kind of dumb. That would not make the movie dumb in itself but Ferrell makes the awful mistake by letting the character too aware that he is dumb. He should have been oblivious to the fact most of the time. Christina Applegate's character is even worse because we know by now that there has to be a virtually straight man/woman to comment on the dumbness of Burgundy but she ends up looking much more ridiculous than Burgundy at the end. The only one who sort of goes unscathed is Steve Carell, who may be playing the most stupid character in the movie but does it with such a straight face that he plows right over Ferrell in every scene he's in. He is fast becoming the absolute no. 1 comic actor today.<br/><br/>Then of course you have the usual cameos by Ferrell's cronies like Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller but they don't amount to much. They are there absolutely for show.<br/><br/>The one scene that did crack me up was when Ferrell and Applegate throw insults at each other during the closing credits and look like they have a professional conversation. That was a brilliant little scene and I wished that ""Anchorman"" could have had that kind of edge right through it all.<br/><br/>The end is sort of a cross between the end of ""Animal House"" and the awful last scene of that Adam Sandler favorite ""Anger Management"". I heard that this film was in part inspired by a true event concerning the first female anchor. It must have been a very small part."
"azjazz","1","61","126","10 July 2004"," Amazing!
","I just looked at the votes that people have already cast for this movie on imdb.com, and I am amazed at how many gave this movie a 10! There must be some hard-core Will Ferrell fans out there.<br/><br/>Let me state first that I'm not familiar with Will Ferrell, but I am assuming that he is one of a long line of Saturday Night Live comedians trying to make it in the movie world. I'm not sure if Ron Burgundy is a character from SNL that was brought to the big screen, but it certainly has that flavor to it.<br/><br/>Well, many of the reasons that I totally detested this movie fall in line with many of the reasons that I stopped watching SNL decades ago. The characters in ""Anchorman"" (and SNL) have been dumbed down to such a low level that they are annoying and straining for laughs constantly. The majority of the attempted humor in this movie was derived from characters acting just plain stupid in normal situations. That can be used effectively if it isn't overdone in a movie, but it just never ends in this movie.<br/><br/>A few positive things about this movie: There really wasn't much of the ""potty"" humor that seems to be required in just about every Hollywood comedy these days. Also, Christina Applegate does a decent job as a more talented reporter, and actually is much funnier than most of the characters when she plays it ""straight"" against the stupidity of the other characters. This is actually a totally opposite character from her days as Kelly Bundy on ""Married ... with Children"", she she does it quite well. Also, she seems to be becoming even more attractive as time passes by - she looks quite stunning in many of the shots. A final positive note: The theater was almost entirely empty on the opening weekend Friday night.<br/><br/>If I went to this movie by myself (which really wouldn't have happened), I would have walked out within the first 20 minutes. Since I was with a friend (her suggested movie, of course), I roughed it.<br/><br/>I will state that judging by the votes already on imdb, many people do seem to like this type of humor. So, if you think that the previews of this movie were hilarious, you will probably enjoy the movie - the previews capture the soul of the movie pretty well, without showing you all the things you would think are ""funny stuff"".<br/><br/>However, if you aren't sure whether you will like this movie based upon what you see in the previews, you should stay away - this movie gets very tiring and predictable fast.<br/><br/>My rating: 1 (... Only because '0' wasn't an option)"

","I don't know how other user comments can say that Will Ferrill is a genius. A genius at what? This movie? This was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. Funny? There are some funny moments in it, but not many. The intentional jokes are pushed too hard and come off limp. I don't know how a person's arm being cut off, a dog being kicked off a bridge, a woman (played by the poor Christina Applegate) being called a dirty bitch, can be funny. They could have done many funny things with this movie about an anchorman, but they failed to do so.

I simply felt cheated when I left the theater.<br/><br/>Laughing is something you shouldn't have to work at, but here the humor was hard to uncover. Ferrell's humor reminds me of the old sports adage ""You can't win by just throwing your jockstrap out on the field (or floor), you must actually play the game."" Ferrell walks into a scene and looks or says something stupid and we're expected to laugh? How about this line; ""I love lamp, I love carpet...""."

Surprised was I to find out that ""Anchorman"" is not only overrated, it's downright unwatchable.<br/><br/>Ron Burgandy (Will Ferrell) is Ron Burgandy, San Diego's most famous news reporter with an ego to match. Everything seems to be perfect for Ron, until a new reporter, a beautiful female(!) named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) threatens his seat of power.<br/><br/>I've seen a few of Will Ferrell's movies, and I have to admit that I am not a fan. He can be funny, like in ""Elf"" or ""Old School."" But here he's so obnoxious that it's torture to watch him ""be funny."" All he does is yell and scream a lot and act like a guy with a big ego. It isn't funny.<br/><br/>Everyone here is extremely stupid. That's not inherently a bad thing; being dumb can be funny. Take a look at ""Borat;"" they don't get any dumber than that guy. But what makes ""Borat"" funny and ""Anchroman"" a trial is how it plays dumb. ""Borat"" intelligently rips apart the dumbest parts of American culture. ""Anchorman"" plays dumb by acting like middle schoolers. What I mean is that ""Anchorman"" thinks its being funny by being crude. Crude does not necessarily equal funny. It has to be clever, which ""Anchorman"" is definitely not.<br/><br/>My God, this is an awful movie.

Anyone of these roles could have been played by one of the other actors. And the reason that you saw a ""star"" of Christina Applegate's stature in this movie is obviously because no other actress with a shred of dignity would have accepted this script.<br/><br/>I laughed out loud one time during this film, and oddly enough, I was the only one. When the announcer is paid off by Ron and he says, ""That was Ron Burgundy and Tits McGee!"" I guffawed out loud only to be stared at by those who sat in stone silence around me.

None of the actors seemed to be at the top of their game, with the possible exception of Christina Applegate who has never had an abundance of acting talent or range. I wasn't expecting a great film, but I was hoping for a few of the actors to pull it from the abyss of sub-mediocrity in which it found itself.

"mstomaso","4","27","56","7 January 2007"," Over-rated lampoon treatment of the 1970s
","While a few aspects of this film were amusing - especially the casting of most of Hollywood's big name comic actors in the role of competing anchormen, the talking dog scenes, etc. This film does not, in my opinion, deliver any worthwhile insights and is not really funny when stripped of it's extremely superficial 1970s paint job.<br/><br/>Note that the film's IMDb rating averages around 5 for people who actually lived through the 70s and around 7 for those who did not. <br/><br/>The film was probably written for the same crowd that enjoyed ""That 70s Show"", and uses the same absurd and extremely inaccurate symbols, style and politics to create a totally fantasized (and incidentally perverse) ""sense of the times"". Essentially, this is a view of 70s culture through the lens of 70s TV cameras, 00s conservative social and political regressivism, and the knowledgeable sensibilities of comedy writers who were, for the most part, preadolescent during the subject period.<br/><br/>The film is about a lot of amazingly stupid people, most of whom are not very likable, who happen to be in the TV news industry. Some of the news broadcast scenes are actually funny. Ron Burgundy - played by Ferrell- is the head idiot. Burgundy is a cross between a 1970s porn star and Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. His character exhibits just about a much depth as these two stereotypes - though perhaps less than Baxter in Ted Knight's better moments on MTM. His dog, ****__Baxter__****, is the most intelligent character in the film and, IMO, steals the show.<br/><br/>Burgundy is struggling to save his career as he is confronted with an only slightly more intelligent stereotype of a 1970s career-woman (complete with the usual inaccurate stereotype female dilemma which people of today's generation seem to believe to be characteristic of the period - she has to decide between an uncontrollable sexual attraction and her certain knowledge that the guy she's attracted to is an imbecile and a cad who wants to ruin her career almost as much as he wants to slither into her undergarments). The plot could have provided a vehicle for comedic analysis of 1970s sexual politics, but - perhaps wisely - the writers avoided any intelligent analysis (only those who lived through the 70s would have gotten it, and most of us would not have gone to see this film anyway).<br/><br/>As far as media critique goes - well, there really isn't any. The film simply doesn't carry that much weight and systematically misses every opportunity to accomplish anything besides half-hearted chuckles and giggles.<br/><br/>The cinematography is standard for the genre - and very average. the writing is OK, though drastically inhibited by its apparently improvised overall direction and the lack of defined themes and depth. The cast does a good job, considering limitations of the material. Steve Carrell is, as always, very entertaining. And the cameos, though merely exploitive of star-power, are amusing. Baxter, however, steals the show. And I would have been much more entertained by the film had he been a more prominent character. I would enjoy a sequel featuring Baxter as a 1970s canine Zen superhero."

","Many critics gave 'Anchorman' good marks, but we watched it last night on DVD and couldn't believe how bad it is. It is clearly aimed at broad comedy but most of the situations, dialog and acting simply were embarrassing to watch. Will Ferrell who plays the fictional 1970s title character, anchorman Ron Burgundy, has been funny in many skits I have seen him in, especially on SNL, where other people wrote for him. As I watched him here, I had the feeling he was trying to be another Steve Martin, but just came across as foolish, and not funny.<br/><br/>One of the worst was the conversation he was having in the newsroom with Christina Applegate who plays the new reporter Veronica Corningstone. We see something poking out inside his pants, and Veronica mentions to him that he has a very large erection, and he promptly parades around the newsroom with this ""erection"" prominently displayed. That MIGHT have seemed funny on paper, and high school boys watching the movie MIGHT have laughed at it, but the three of us watching the movie just though it was stupid. There are many other scenes that shot for a comedic reaction but just didn't work for us.<br/><br/>Fred Willard playing the boss Ed Harken was the only ray of light here. Willard is always funny, and he underplays his role quite appropriately. He is bringing in the dreaded 'woman' on the news team, and the guys don't like it one bit. Burgundy feels threatened, but is immediately smitten when he meets Victoria. Against all reason, she also falls for the dopey and incompetent Burgundy, and they have what seems to be an attempt at a comedic bedroom scene but just seemed absurd to us. When Burgundy has an altercation on the freeway and is then late for the evening news broadcast, Veronica steps in and does great, fulfilling her dream to become an on-air anchor.<br/><br/>Later there is a very silly scene at the zoo, covering the birth of a new Panda, when various news team members end up in a bear pit. There is a silly scene of four rival news teams fighting in an alley, 'West Side Story' style, but one man played by Luke Wilson in a 'cameo' gets his arm cut off and we see the nub but he just looks at it and shrugs. Later, at the zoo, his other arm is cut off.<br/><br/>The very best rating I can give this movie is a ""3"", and only because I have seen some even worse movies I rate ""1"" or ""2"". I cannot imagine how well-known critics can give it a favorable rating. I don't really care about Will Farrell, but I love Christina Applegate as an actress. Her role here was a waste of her talent.

It just wasn't very funny. Some of the attempts at humor were obnoxious, and though there were a few laugh out loud funny jokes (although I can't even recall what those are now) for the most part, the humor was very cliché and nothing new. The movie wasn't that long either but did actually drag in certain places.<br/><br/>Ferrell was pretty good, Applegate wasn't bad (though, to me, she seemed to be trying not to laugh at times), but this movie, while harmless enough was almost desperately trying to engage the audience in laughter-nothing was all that funny, and nothing was terribly original. I also never believed I was watching media people, and though the movie may have tried at humor it didn't try at much else. And I REALLY could have done without that scene of the dog being thrown into the water.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to take a movie seriously when one gets the feeling the cast isn't taking it seriously. Although I know people who like this movie, for me it's definitely below average and a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting some believability and at least an attempt at a story. I was also expecting a high degree of wit and fun. Instead what I got was a bunch of tired jokes, none very original. There were some positives-the movie wasn't overlong, the direction was good, the story was actually A good one (and would have made an excellent movie if more time had gone into the dialog, and the story had been taken at all Seriously).

","""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" stars comedian Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy, a San Diego news anchor who has a big moustache. Why does he have a big moustache? Because big moustaches are funny. Why is his name Burgundy? Because Burgundy sounds ridiculous. Who works with Ron? How about a weatherman. Make that a ""legally retarded"" weatherman who likes lamps. Who else? A sportscaster called Champion. Make his surname Kind. Champion Kind. The dumber the name the better.<br/><br/>The rest of ""Anchorman"" proceeds along similarly improvisational lines, its cast and crew essentially making ridiculous stuff up as they go along. The film was so loose and improvisational that an entirely new film (""Wake Up Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie"") was assembled from its unused footage. As Farrell and his fellow troupe of comedians embrace absurd non-sequiturs, in which different stupid lines, words and jokes are randomly offered up for each take, the film's director, Adam McKay, found himself confused as to what comedic material to include in his final film.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"", whose anarchic tone is undermined by its formulaic plot, works best in its giddily nonsensical sequences, in which characters randomly break into song, combat, walk about with erections or kick dogs off bridges. Elsewhere it works thanks to a long parade of recognisable faces (Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Danny Trejo, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell), most of whom pop up, say wacky stuff and then disappear. The film was a sleeper hit and has become a cult favourite with certain people. Its title - ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" - recalls the titles of famous picturesque novels of the eighteenth and ninth century (""The Adventures of Roderick Random"", ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"", ""The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle"", ""The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha""), all of which were downright ridiculous. Ferrell's no Dickens, though. While those novels aim at satire, Ferrell's films salivate over ultra ridiculousness. His characters are big goof-balls, macho men completely unaware of how moronic they really are. ""Anchorman's"" plot (it's set in the 1970s, when feminism marched into the newsroom) itself deals with a group of men (and a predominately male oriented profession) being ""shown up"" by a single hard-working, dedicated woman.<br/><br/>In this regard, all the men in the film are posturing, peacocking, competitive idiots who ooze a testosterone infused vapidity. Into their midsts steps Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). She's part of the rising tide of women's liberation, her presence highlighting a blustering, clueless masculinity, and various male misconceptions about women (""Why don't you go back to your home on whore island!"", various hilarious deleted jokes about the way men misunderstand menstruation etc). The film's director, Adam McKay, is responsible for the only other political Ferrell flick thus far, ""The Other Guys"", though both are more interested in broad jokes than satire. Whether one finds this type of humour intolerable or funny depends largely on one's blood alcohol levels.<br/><br/>7.9/10 - Worth two viewings. See ""Everything Must Go"" and ""The Other Guys""."

Personally I liked the ""Brick"" character, but all of the main cast did a pretty good job hamming it up. However once it hit about the 60th percentile of hilarity, it would back off and spin its wheels, never really breaking through. The fight scene for example was zany and with a clever start but by the end it was just ridiculous with no real closing punch. That description works for the movie as well. The skit was over and so the movie just kind of petered out.<br/><br/>The cat show set the stage for a great punch line that never came. The escape from the bear scene was funny, but not a rolling in the aisles funny. The pattern is one of an-orgasmic humorous interruptus, and on to the next vignette.<br/><br/>However it's fun if one's expectations are not excessive."
"flickershows","7","2","2","20 July 2004"," The Funny Idiots Of TV News
","Will Ferrell and company seem to be 2 decades late in satirizing the leisure-suit era of over-blown TV personalities. Then again, the biggest change from that time to this is that now the ego-twit types in the news game are not just local, they're national. So either 'Anchorman' is way late for the party or it's very timely. Look, I don't really care which. Is it funny? Will it show you a silly, good time? Sure, and I think silliness is the best you can expect from such a soft-boiled egg. This parody is not trying to hurt anybody for real, just poke them gently in the rib cage. But even though this one drives in the slow lane when it should be speeding down the humour highway, the movie made me laugh...sometimes in spite of myself.<br/><br/>What surprised me was that it gets funnier as it goes along, especially when the cartoon violence escalates. It's hard to take anything seriously, but an old-fashioned rumble is so stupidly violent that it's just too funny for words. The movie sports plenty of cameos, most of them unveiled in this one scene. In fact, everybody Ferrell ever met seems to be in this flick. His rumble opponents are rival anchors from 3 different stations and they happen to be recognizable movie stars too. I enjoyed this one idiotic scene so much, that it made every limp moment that came before seem funnier.<br/><br/>So what's the story then? Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a sensationally arrogant and dumb San Diego news anchor. His goofy co-stars (including Paul Rudd & the scarily dim Steve Carrell) are also his only friends until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives to spike their testosterone punch. Soon she's sharing Burgundy's desk and his bed. But the men resent this woman (the first female anchor ever, apparently) and humorous trouble brews. Fred Willard plays the boss and straight man, which is a bit of a disappointment. He's too hilarious to be so serious.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is so popular right now, his script could have been a fiery turd and the flick would STILL make a huge profit. He & rookie director Adam McKay (a colleague from Ferrell's SNL days) co-authored the screenplay, which was probably left wide open for hours worth of improvs. A stronger director might have held out for even better jokes. An experienced director might have tightened things up and paced the movie better. The abundant flaws don't do serious damage. I may not remember much about 'Anchorman' in 3 months, but lots of chuckles were yanked outta me this afternoon. If you want to laugh at foolishness by the Will Ferrell troupe, this fake news story might be the ticket. Or it might not..."

","This is what happens when you get famous. When people starts to know your name. If you have seen Night at the Roxbury and Old School, you have to see this movie. And feel the disappointment! How can they do this to their fans? Such a great talent running for nothing but the money. The movie is pretty much made just to make money, with the name of Will. Such a great actor. Plot is OK, but the humor is terrible. If the best part of the movie is a scene where you kick the dog down from the bridge, the humor cant be really good. If you haven't seen any of these movies, go see Night at the Roxbury instead. Then you can enjoy great moments with Will."

","I cannot believe people rate this at 6.6 out of ten. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Will Ferrell is totally miscast. I was asking how he got this part about the time his credit rolled in as one of the writers. Why would Christina Applegate fall for a guy with no looks and no personality? I thought this movie had potential due to the subject matter, but it wasn't a spoof, it wasn't a comedy, it was just trash. Most of the scenes appeared to be impromptu ad libs without a script. The characters were not characters outside of Applegate. I did not laugh once, or even crack a smile. Blockbuster owes me five bucks for watching this drivel. Ferrel is the latest in a line of no talent SNL alumni who have no talent, but are nonetheless rich for the schlock they put out. Nothing was funny. This movie was STUPID! As for the box label WARNING LOTS OF SEX, etc., they put that on the BOX so YOU WOULD RENT IT and for no other reason. .5 out of ten"

","I want to just say, I watched this film at the suggestion of someone I thought had better taste than he does. I can't tell you how shocked I was when I realized that this is what he considers a comedy. Unsophisticated, low comedy, and dumb, with a really good cast - Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughan, Fred Willard -- but they were all let down by a really rotten script.<br/><br/>There were a couple of funny things - my favorite was everyone singing Afternoon Delight in harmony. If only the rest of the film had been like that.<br/><br/>So you might ask, so what do you consider funny? Well, ""What about Bob?"", both ""La Cage aux Folles"" and ""Birdcage"" for different reasons, lots of comedies in the '80s like ""Money Pit,"" ""Night Shift,"" Billy Wilder, Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges. I even liked ""Starsky and Hutch."" Low comedy like ""Anchorman"" just isn't my thing."

","This is a simple exercise in humor by going out of bounds. Well, this has energy.<br/><br/>It does have what I call folding, being a show about a show and show business. But that element is mundane, of the ""Zoolander"" variety.<br/><br/>I've been studying bounds recently. You might call them norms or conventions...<br/><br/>Much of humor comes from understanding where those bounds are at that moment and with that particular audience  and then stepping just over them. So much humor can be seen this way just by allowing different boundaries to think about.<br/><br/>If the distance of the step is tiny, the humor is considered sophisticated and is often missed by the less sharp or attuned. If the stepping over is a big step, the humor is considered broad, crass.<br/><br/>We like the small steps because it shows more skill, even intelligence and it points out the humor in ""real"" life. So we remember it. Sometimes it changes us.<br/><br/>This is broad and crass. Purveyors of this sort of thing make up for that weakness by shooting in many directions, and at least all the big ones: sex, status, life, religion...<br/><br/>When that's your formula, you can only accomplish so much. It all boils down to whether it has energy and whether the overall rhythm of the thing has a groove.

"christian123","5","23","49","12 March 2005"," There are some funny moments but its still an average comedy
","Anchorman has some funny moments but their not a lot of them and in the end the film is a disappointment. It's the 70s and Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the quintessential television anchorman for a San Diego television station, but his world is turned upside down when an ambitious female reporter (Christina Applegate) infiltrates his territory when she tries to become the network's first female anchorperson. Will this be a battle of the sexes turn into all-out war or will love conquer all? The plot sounds really funny and I was really looking forward to watching this film since Will Ferrell is in it. But it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Anchorman feels and looks like an SNL skit that's extended to a feature film. The jokes are either hit or miss but the ones that are funny are usually very funny. I still enjoyed Anchorman since it has some of the funniest lines I have heard in awhile but it was a little disappointing. Will Ferrell did an awesome job and of course he is the best part about Anchorman. I think they should have casted someone else instead of Christina Applegate since she was kind of boring. The supporting cast is great including Fred Willard, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner. Out of all of them I would say that Steve Carell was the funniest and he makes up for the awful Sleepover. Adam McKay directs and he does a good job. He also writes for SNL so that's probably why the comparisons to SNL and Anchorman are so easy to find. The films running time is only 94 minutes so unless you find the premise really irritating you can easily survive though the film. There's also a lot of cameos and some scenes that are very funny and defiantly worth watching. Rating 6/10 not the funniest movie of the year but its worth checking out now that its out on video."
"gelman@attglobal.net","1","18","37","25 January 2005"," WARNING -- Not for Adults
","I can imagine if I were 22 years old and drunk -- very drunk -- I might find this movie a little bit amusing. But I'm not 22 and I was unfortunately quite sober when I rented and watched ""Anchorman."" Not all the way through, I'll admit. It was so bad that I did something I NEVER do. I turned it off after about an hour. Couldn't stomach any more. I leave open the faint possibility that this may not be the worst movie ever made but it is certainly up there (down there?) with the worst of the worst. ""Anchorman"" is, of course, supposed to be a satire. But it is feeble. Let me spell that out: f - e - e - b - l - e. And did I forget gross? The film's premise is that an exceptionally pretty young female is seeking to become an anchor at a San Diego TV station in the era when newsrooms were men only. That would seem to have real possibilities. But it is squandered on an especially juvenile script and presented in a manner that would make ""Animal House"" seem the height of sophisticated humor. The movies need to add another rating to the system warning adults to stay away. NA35 might do it."
"Rob_Taylor","5","15","30","3 September 2006"," Run away! Run as fast as you can!
","First off, I was told this was one of Will Ferrel's better movies. If so, all I can wonder is, how does he keep getting parts? Everyone (and I really mean everyone) in this film is funnier than he is. He's like that annoying guy who shows up at parties and repeatedly tells boring anecdotes that everyone else smiles politely at whilst secretly wishing he'd go away.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes are sheer torture...non-funny gags that rely almost entirely on a stereotypical 70's male vs. female routine that gets old so fast it's almost frightening. In fact, the movie has something of a split-personality. the first half is where they try to be funny using words and simple gags. It fails pretty abysmally. The last half things seem to go a bit whacko....fights to the death among news-crews, severed limbs, feces eating....you get the idea. It's almost as if the crew realised it wasn't funny and grew increasingly desperate to salvage something from the movie.<br/><br/>Every cameo role that turns up in this movie - and there are lots - steals any scene that they are in. In fact, it's only the procession of well-known faces that keeps the interest, if only to see how utterly they bury Ferrel's supposed comic genius.<br/><br/>Ironically, it's only the desperation of the second half of the film that saves it in any way at all. You watch only to see how bad it will get - and trust me it gets pretty awful - before the end.<br/><br/>I'm still utterly amazed by how completely devoid of comic talent Wil Ferrel can be, but I'm sure that won't stop him from making more dire pieces of celluloid garbage in the future.<br/><br/>Recommended viewing only for prisoners undergoing psychological torture."
"og_ymra","1","15","30","12 July 2004"," Worst movie ever, well almost.
","Doesn't even qualify as a bad SNL sketch because you only have to sit through about 5 minutes of a bad sketch. However, in this case, you have to sit through 2 hours of waiting for a punchline or even a funny moment. I'm a big Ferrell fan, but, this is way off the mark and could of spent those 2 hours on a better movie. The character of Ron Burgundy is poorly developed and his rival/love interest of Christina Applegate is played as well as possible given the material she has to work with. Cameos by Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and others can't save this dying movie. I really feel misled by so many of the people who interview the actors for this film and not a one of them confronted any of the actors on the poorly written script. Definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
"ithearod","6","12","23","14 November 2006"," maybe if they actually WROTE this movie...
","...instead of just continually improvising lines, then picking what they thought were the funniest, and editing them together. You don't believe me? Watch the credits.<br/><br/>Ms. Applegate has growed up so nice, and can actually act! She shows a nice range of complex emotions. They are highlighted all the more because she is in contrast to the rest of the cast, which consists of entirely one-dimensional, one-joke characters.<br/><br/>The entire movie plays out in typical skit-humor fashion. With such a big send-up for the promo's and all, you wouldn't think that would be the case, but it is. The plot has that greasy, ""made-for-TV movie"" feel to it. The ultra-feeble attempt at creating some kind of thread throughout the movie (the boring though highly in-context ""panda birth"") has Ben Stiller's fingerprints all over it. Using it as the climax, and then not even having the balls to actually USE the damn thing, is so weak. (It turns into the BEAR PIT GAG?!?! OMG, just awful, tedious, unfunny - like watching an ""I Love Lucy"" episode at 2 AM because you can't sleep.) The weatherman character Brick, played as an autistic who has no ability to discern any kind of emotion or intuition, is mildly funny (""Loud noises!""), and there are a few set pieces that work well, like the first (and ONLY the first) meeting with the rival news team. But on the whole, there seemed to be too much of the awkwardly-progressing ""romantic-comedy"" story in the film, and not enough of what it ought to have been about, Ron Burgundy and his sexist, buffoon comrades.<br/><br/>I like Will Ferrel and think he has a good comic talent, but there's just something about the SNL alums that keep them from making ""movies"". Maybe ""The Blues Brothers"" set the bar too high, or ""Wayne's World"" set it too low. The funny thing is, this isn't even an SNL character flic, but it fails just as badly as if it were! This movie is not to be avoided at all costs, but there's lots more funny movies being made that are satisfying at levels that you want and need them to be. If I'm going to sit down for 90 minutes, there better be more offered to me than just a few stale characters delivering a few funny lines and making a few funny situations. I can get that mediocre level of satisfaction from TV if I want it, thanks. The Coen Brothers or Billy Bob Thorton can deliver funny films, that are at the same time satisfying film experiences. Why can't Will Ferrel and co.?"

","Very few laughs; sparse here and there, nothing substantial that can create any potential euphoric effect where you can just let yourself go. The only time I truly laugh was when Ferrell tries to convince Applegate that he wants to date her ""professionally"", but he has a huge erection at the same time. After that point, the movie is going down the drain and into the sewers.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is soooooo disappointing in this movie. Not that I ever expected much out of him, but after Elf and Old boy, there was some light at the end of the tunnel. He comes back with a pathetic performance in a miserable movie. This is as bad as ""A Night at the Roxbury"". Ferrell is just the new flavor of the day in the comedy business. He seems to be taking advantage of it and wants to cash on it. I guess it is economically defendable. But artistically, thanks for the warning... For Applegate, well, unfortunately, there isn't much to say about her career so far. She is equal to herself in this movie  enough said.<br/><br/>It just makes me sad to think about the waste of time and resources put into this type of creation.

This movie sort of reminds me of WKRP in Cincinnati...The movie version. It was very easy to convince my girlfriend to turn the movie off and she is more of a movie nut then myself.

At least I laughed at somethings.

By the end we could expect to be so hysterical that we'd be falling out of our seats, rolling around the floor like fish out of water.<br/><br/>So we sat there, popped some corn, cracked open sodas and nestled in for what we expected to be nothing special but, hey, have a laugh, enjoy it for what it is -- just a silly little comedy. I didn't expect Shakespeare, Scorsese or Spielberg. I expected to be mildly amused every once in a while.

Two, I will never get that 90 minutes back.<br/><br/>Some movies are so dreadful they're almost worth seeing to witness how bad a movie could be. ""Anchorman"" does not even fall into that dubious category.<br/><br/>***Spoilers*** It's my firm belief that no one who sees more than one movie every five years could possibly have found the rumble scene -- with A-list actors making cameos -- the slightest bit funny. A dog getting kicked off the side of a bridge? Ron Burgundy arguing with the clubowner who's trying to make him eat cat doo-doo? Baxter the little dog talking to the grizzly bear at the zoo? Here's an example, it was shown in subtitles.... Baxter:On my journey I met one of your kind. His name was Katow-jo. We became friends. Bear: Katow-jo is my cousin. From now on, you will be known as Baxter, Friend to Bears. Go in peace. Baxter: I will spread tales of your compassion.<br/><br/>It's one big drawn-out improv sketch -- all entirely too long and all completely humor-free. ""Anchorman"" was the comedic version of your local Halloween haunted house. A bunch of people dress in scary outfits, make scary noises and jump out from every corner and yell BOO! We're startled, taken aback for minute, but not really frightened. In ""Anchorman"", a bunch of actors provide the audience with comedy's version of BOO! They shock us with some loud noise or a crude joke or a cat-poop reference, and some really clever dialogue from a dog.

I can't say anything good about this movie and I'm sure it'll be 9 or 10 years from until I get around to watching the sequel, if I ever do watch it. I don't know if anything I said counts as a spoiler, but it's better to check the box and be wrong than not check it, be wrong, and blacklisted for life. Hopefully this was helpful and will save someone else from making a huge mistake."

","Humor is so subjective, and what is mildly amusing is a laugh riot to another; so it is with this scattered mess, a slap-shot collection of often hilarious sight gags. I laughed often and frequently at the silliness, was aware that we're not dealing with literary wit, but material seemingly dreamed up while the guys sat around a table and played ""Can you top this?"" <br/><br/>Every viewer will have favorites: San Francisco Chron Critic LaSalle, for instance, seemed to miss what I thought was a manically nuts performance from Paul Rudd as a second-fiddle newsman: as with all the humor in this zany romp, to each his own. All of the main characters are obviously enjoying the charade--even the dog Baxter, who often speaks with subtitles and mercifully never urinates on a fire hydrant; on the same topic, this is an intelligent comedy, not needing to be riddled with flatulent jokes and the other cheap instant gags that usually flood this kind of outrÃ© humor--there is an inspired nuttiness, the kind you find in Airplane, and I enjoyed it. The humor is EXTREMELY broad, but once in a while in this daft world, a person just needs a good laugh. Ron Burgundy delivers!"

","Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Steve Carell, David Koechner, Paul Rudd and Fred Willard star in this 2004 comedy. This film takes place in the 70's in San Diego, California where we meet news anchor, Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his co-anchors, Brick Hanland (Carell), Chimp Kind (Koechner) and Brian Fantana (Rudd). Soon, newswoman, Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) gets a job with them and Ron and her fall for each other. Soon, they go head to head competing for an anchor position which causes Ron to lose his job. He eventually get his job back and makes peace with Veronica. Willard plays Ron's boss, Ed Harkin. This is one of Will's best, he and the cast are great and I recommend this."

","As a rule I don't like Will Ferrell, it fact I don't find him funny at all, so I was really surprised by how funny I actually liked this film. Maybe the context of this film, the 70s setting allowing the sexist jokes to be satirical rather than tasteless, made it for me. Maybe Ferrell is just funnier in this. In fact I kind of forgot it was actually Ferrell as I found his performance truly brilliant- and hilarious. Having said that I think Steve Carell, who I normally hate even more, stole the show. His character and the way he played it was really funny. Maybe it just fitted in with the ludicrousness of the film's setting. The whole set-up was an interesting one, which led to some interesting dialogue about sexism, not too serious, but enough to be noticed. Finally, after Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, and others popped up for cameos I was gone. I really enjoyed it."

"TheNorthernMonkee","6","3","4","7 May 2005"," slow starting and dumb, but occasionally hilarious
","SPOILERS Will Ferrell has been a bit of a Hollywood golden child over the last few years. Progressing from his regular stint on ""Saturday Night Live"" Ferrell released 2003 feel good Christmas hit ""Elf"". Brilliant at improvisation, Ferrell has a face for comedy and after ""Elf"", his next big hit was going to be ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"". Slow to start though, ""Anchorman"" is an incredibly inconsistent film. Occasionally very, very funny, and occasionally woeful, this film is not perhaps the Ferrell gem it really should have been.<br/><br/>Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his crack news team are number one in San Diego. When ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives on the scene and wants to be an anchor, things begin to slowly go wrong. After an incident involving a burrito and a Jack Black cameo, Burgundy's career begins to go disastrously downhill.<br/><br/>Supported by more American comedians than you can think of, Ferrell is his usual self in his guise as the obsessive news anchor. With solid performances by Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Vince Vaughn, Ferrell is also helped by cameos from stars including Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and even Tim Robbins. Everyone named blatantly enjoys themselves as well. With countless improvisation parts, the film exploits talents that some of these stars are naturally gifted at.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for ""Anchorman"", irrelevant of how good the cast is, at times it just isn't funny. Starting slowly, it possesses one or two good jokes for the first thirty minutes. Almost torturous to watch, you find yourself reaching for the control but never being able to turn over. Like a Howard Stern radio show, you continue to watch the film, not because you particularly enjoy it, but because you want to see what random comment will come next.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is the key thing about this film. As it progresses, it does gradually become funnier and funnier. If you compare this advance though with the ever growing randomness of events, there is a distinct similarity. The scene involving Jack Black for example is well thought up and conceived, but how the scene progresses is just so obscure, that you find yourself unable to stop laughing.<br/><br/>As the film approaches it's conclusion, this complete randomness gets even worse. In a scene involving bears towards the end, you wonder how the film will solve a problem, and just as you begin to construct a rudimentary idea in your brain involving stones and rope, along comes a conclusion which you would never have been able to predict in a million years. As a result, you DO find yourself laughing, but the question should really be whether you laugh at the jokes, or laugh at the complete disregard for sensible plot development. The story is random, but it can be funny.<br/><br/>""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" should have been Will Ferrell's biggest film to date. Starring the comedian in a role he is brilliant at, he is also helped by an able and experienced cast. Ultimately though, for long periods the film just isn't that funny. Getting increasingly random as it progresses, there are moments when you do find yourself falling off your chair in laughter, but ultimately these are just a bit too short in number for the film to be worth the effort. If you want to watch Ferrell at work, your better off with ""Elf""."
"MovieTrey","4","3","4","3 August 2004"," Too slow and not that well written.
","Anchorman received many good reviews from other critics.  I have no idea why though. The movie lacks the substance that any good movie should have.  As well as a decent plot or strong character development. There are many guest appearances from many big name actors, such as Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black and Luke Wilson, but after one or two scenes they're never seen again.  The main story is it's the 1970's, and Christina Applegate's character becomes the first anchorwoman on television and Will Ferrall and his friends feel threatened by her arrival.  Meanwhile, Will Ferrall develops a romantic relationship with Applegate's character. Anchorman does have its moments, but for the most part it's filled with cheap laughs and antics.  I thought Will Ferrall did a much better job in Zoolander.  Overall I gave the movie 4 out of 10 stars."

","Wil Ferrell passing as both a writer and a movie star is the only funny thing about this movie. If that man ever had an amusing thought it would die lonely. I love a good spoof movie - you can't beat the original Airplane - because they usually involve a large amount of gags. This movie makes absolutely no effort to be funny. It just assumes that we all think a boring white bread man with bad hair is amusing no matter what he does. Obviously with all the good reviews a lot of people do think he's funny which means this is one of those times in life when I wonder if I'm not living in some parallel universe - the same feeling usually arises around election time.

","I watched this alleged comedy last night (0r as much of it as I could bear) due to its mighty reputation. As a comedy it is poor but there is something more sinister hidden in the subtext that no one is mentioning.<br/><br/>Anchorman, along with all other Judd Apatow films I have had the misfortune to see (40 year Old Virgin, Knocked up) buys into the feminist narrative unquestioningly (this is Hollywood AKA Liberaltown after all). All the men are depicted as incompetent morons, while the women are sexy, smart and capable of anything. Now it used to be the case in sex comedies that both sexes were evenly matched, usually equally screwy. This was the case from Grant/Hepburn to Moore/Minelli. Now, since the rise of femo-fascism, even mild criticism of females is forbidden, while caricaturing of males as gross stereotypes has gotten worse. The gulf between the two is not conducive to comedy.<br/><br/>The moron men present themselves in front of this successful woman and are one by one, ritually humiliated. Yet, despite being surrounded by these male losers, the 'comedy' needs the smart sexy woman to fall in love with one of them, always unbelievably implausible. Then it falls apart due, naturally, to him being a jerk.<br/><br/>The real story here is not 'Anchorman' at all but 'Anchorwoman'. It is a fiction of how a woman must break into a 'man's world', come up against 'sexism' and emerge triumphant. We are told, that there was a time in cable news when only men read the news. This is a fantasy which only exists in Liberals imagination. In reality women were reading the news long before cable TV and cable news broadcasters included women readers from the start.<br/><br/>One particularly objectionable scene is when Applegate takes over the anchor for the first time. She is surrounded by a braying pack of men, pulling down their pants, snorting their derision and generally trying to put her off. In what sort of parallel universe would that happen? In reality it is a man's natural instinct to try and help an attractive female.<br/><br/>Men, never forget that Hollywood hates you."

Every time the audience laughed which wasn't often we would look at each other and wonder why. The 70's outfits and sets were mildly humorous for the first 2 minutes but that's it. The acting was terrible, Christina Applehead's performance is worth of a Razzy award. Had the acting been over-the top (like Ben Stiller in everything lately) the movie could have been funny. I like Will Ferrell too. Elf, and Old School and SNL were really because of him, but this one was just too bad to be saved. And what happened to Tim Robbins? Didn't he win an Acadamy Award? How did he get sucked into this S**t-bomb? I guess that's what happens when you forget you're an actor and start thinking you're a politician.

You may be thinking that I am one of those people who just cannot enjoy a slapstick-type goofy comedy, but you would be wrong. I love Old School and Road Trip, I even liked Dodgeball (except for the Velveeta ending) so I am open to a movie that was made specifically for laughter without thinking. This movie missed its mark completely. Will Ferrell and the cast try hard to make the audience laugh and succeeded a couple of times, but for the most part the jokes fell flat. There really is not a plot to the story, it revolves around a station of all men anchors not wanting to release power to a new female anchor. All of the guys are creepy, sexist and completely full of themselves. Steve Carell, who was funny in Bruce Almighty, really had nowhere to go with his character. He is a dim bulb who just makes random statements or repeats what another character says. I think the best part of this movie was Vince Vaughan as a rival station anchor. So, my advice with this film is, don't see it at the theater, don't rent it or buy it on pay per view, wait a couple of years until it is on USA or TBS every other Saturday morning."

The absurdity reaches new highs (or lows; depends on how you look at it) with the God-UGLY clothing and hirsute stylings of the ME decade in all its tacky splendor and inspired cameos of some of film's funniest comedians but it clearly shows Ferrell – who co-wrote with director Adam McKay - at the top of his game in making dumb guys an art form with his ridiculous self-important cluelessness and aggressively idiotic displays of ardor and emotion (one of the best lines: ""I'm in a glass case of emotion!"")

The fact that they seemed to be obviously so made me think the real joke would come later, but alas, no, they didn't. Brick's introductory scene first worried me (I got the feeling it was intended to be a laugh-out-loud moment, with the exception that I didn't even smile), but the scene with the jazz flute performance was when the alarm bells really went off (and signalled my first break), as it got sillier and sillier.<br/><br/>By comparison, '40 Year Old Virgin' took a simple premise, and created believable characters that drew sympathy from the viewers, which made their predicaments all the funnier.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film works best for a US audience, which recalls newscasting from the 70's, and perceives the satire within.

Most of the time Will Ferrel was just screaming like a five year old. As for the jokes that were funny, they were played out too long and eventually it just wasn't funny anymore. The plot was thin, and the acting was horribly cheesy. I guess they were aiming for that since it was supposed to take place in the 70s/80s.

The audience was laughing so hard at times in fact everyone missed a lot of the jokes....but i digress.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" of this film, was a new co-anchor woman comes into the news room of the hit San Diego news team in the 70's and shows woman can report too damnitt. Appelgate was convincing, and actually got me to laugh a few times as well.<br/><br/>Ferrel was of course perfect, and you could tell the majority of the film was from Mckay just letting the cameras roll, (I heard the entire film ran almost 4 hrs uncut, for the special DVD..but who knows)<br/><br/>The movie however was simply stolen by Steve Carrel, who I never found this funny. He plays a man who self confesses within the first 5 min of the film, ""I'm basically mentally retarded."" Every one of his lines was just so random and ridiculous that you were forced to laugh, plain and simple. His dead pan delivery just shows if he's given a role, he'll play it to the fullest.<br/><br/>The only down beat (still funny however) was the cameo induced fight sequence, reminiscent of West Side Story.

This film is a textbook example of how to make a really, really bad movie. As an actor, comedic or otherwise, Will Farrell is an excellent example of....NOT! The only redeeming feature of this dismal failure is Christina Applegate's performance. Unfortunately, throwing herself on a live hand grenade would have been a better career move for her than agreeing to perform in this Will Farrell debacle. From the outset, I sat wondering when the ""this-is-how-to-end-an-acting-career"" trailer would end and the real movie would begin. I have never seen such horrid acting (and I use the term, acting, very loosely) from all of the major cast members.

","I just saw this film last night and I was pretty disappointed. I love Will Ferrell and I've enjoyed almost everything else he's previously done (off the top of my head); this film was just sorely lacking, in every department, so much so that I almost can't put my finger on it because I don't have that many and I don't feel like using my toes today. I think the story had a lot of promise, but it felt like they stopped writing it after the outline; as if an outline for the movie was presented to the studio, but when it came time to flesh it out with a screenplay, everyone called in sick that day. <br/><br/>The shining stars of the production (if there were any), would have to be Christina Applegate and Fred Willard; their acting and dialogue was well done and acceptable, and Fred Willard is great as always, even though he didn't have much of anything to work with. Unfortunately, they just seemed to be flailing about on a high wire with no net, and the end result is simply UGLY.<br/><br/>There's just nothing really funny at all about the movie; it bored the crap out of me, but I didn't turn it off because I kept hoping it would get better, and I kept praying that Will Ferrell would have made a better movie than what I was watching ... but then it was over, and it never got any better, and suddenly I was at the place that all moviegoers hate to be at: the place when you realize you've just lost 90 to 120 minutes of your life that you'll never get back, and there's nothing you can do about it.

","So many comedy movies I have seen over the years just don't seem to be able to get it absolutely right. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a rare exception. It's silly yet smart, touching yet cringing. It's not just the lines that will have you in stitches but the the casts' delivery and spot on comedic performances that will have you fighting to breathe. Will Ferrell is at his absolute best in this film. He knows the character of Ron Burgundy like the back of his hand and you believe every second of his performance even during the scenes where you are finding some sub plots to be a little far fetched (but that just adds to the outrageous hilarious nature the film is going for.) Christina Applegate is a standout too, She isn't just reciting the script while trying to seem convincing (much like her character could have turned out had she been in the wrong hands) she brings heart, integrity and a hell of a lot of hilarity to her performance. And the comedic/romantic/sexual chemistry between her and Ferrell is very enjoyable and works exceedingly well. Supporting cast is perfect as usual, but what else would you expect from Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd, who in their career have proved that these kinds of movies are what they do best. Some great cameos too. This movie will not disappoint."
"onepotato2","2","6","12","29 February 2008"," I support the Will Ferrell backlash
","As I watched this very pointless, unfunny movie, my mouth was hanging open over how little Ferrell and I agree on what is funny. Ferrell can support a movie and get laughs in someone else's (Zoolander) but he ruins his own with his lazy, one-note shtick. Talladega Nights was stupid... Frank the Tank was stupid... Bewitched was stupid AND a trainwreck... Elf was mawkish Xmas leftovers... I can't even begin to describe how utterly free of laughs I found the previews for Blades of Glory and Semi-Pro. I enjoy a stupid comedy every now and then, but Ferrell's career is just dissembling into nonsense. Being a puerile character can be funny; making puerile movies is not.<br/><br/>As Will Ferrell has no other stock to sell, we get his next self-impressed buffoon. There's nothing else in Ferrell's head. The movies big concept is that Anchormen never take off their anchorman jackets and never ease up on the sanctimonious speaking style. Isn't that funny? Shakes the Clown called - He'd like his idea back. When you're stealing fifteen year old concepts from Bob Goldwaithe you're in trouble. Any comedy I like eventually mocks sentimentality. Here and in Adam Sandler movies, sentiment is embraced as a way to provide a handful of utterly conventional plot-points. Get the girl. Win the fight. Do we really need any more carbon copies of that movie with new jokes? And I'm being generous when I describe this movie as having jokes or a plot. There is no reason to watch this for ninety minutes since each scene is just a disconnected, failed stab at being funny and providing lines for the Ferrell cult to parrot. The movie is utter nonsense by the twenty minute mark. After what seems like hours of failed improvised comedy, we get to a remarkable, unfunny Anchorman gangfight where an entire modern crop of unfunny actors have cameos (Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller) cause that's been original for, what, twenty years? What I would give for Vaughan, Stiller, Wilson, Ferrell, Rudd and the last ten years of their shitty, shitty movies to be erased from history. A final act with a sub-titled dog is supposed to be free-wheeling but it's just the most painfully insipid idea that should have been rejected in this mess. God, this movie is crap. It actually made me wince in pain.<br/><br/>Ferrell has replaced Ben Stiller as Hollywoods resident 'irritating prick' presumably until the next desperate TV funny-man who's willing to do anything for a buck dethrones him. I feel very confident that the rest of Will Ferrell's career will be at least as stupid as what we've already seen. At this point, I would pay studios nine bucks NOT to watch each of the rest of his movies. I would prefer to have someone beat me with a pillowcase full of batteries for 2 hours, than sit through another miserably unfunny Ferrell vehicle. Kudos to Ferrell for figuring out how to parlay his extraordinarily limited talent into a paycheck, but I'm perfectly willing to sit down with him and discuss the terms of his immediate retirement. Paul Rudd used to be an actor before losing faith in himself and becoming the weakest, least funny member of both the Ferrell & Apatow meathead teams. He's the new Peter Lawford.<br/><br/>The lowest form of comedy involves people trying too hard to be funny. Comedies which involve a self-impressed jackass (an anchorman, a nascar drive, a male model, a basketball player, a ping-pong champ, a dodge-ball captain, ad nauseum) taking himself too seriously are now officially DEAD!"

","If you are a fan of Will Ferrell than you are in for a treat. Anchorman is Ferrell at his absolute best and absolute funniest.<br/><br/>Ferrell is Ron Burgundy; an Anchorman in the 70's who is enjoying his life on top of the pile. In an era plagued with feminism, Ron's manly news team are the celebrities of the news room, leaving other channels traipsing behind. These members of the cast are played by other popular current comedy actors in Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson. We are also treated to a Tim Robbins cameo although this feels a tad out of place.<br/><br/>Ron's news team are put under threat with the appointment of Veronica Corningstone. A woman, yes a woman, hell bent on becoming the first female anchor. A feat she achieves when Ron is involved in an unfortunate burrito incident with Jack Black.<br/><br/>This sets up the tale of love and betrayal although done in a way that only makes fun of itself and the opposing characters. Not one area of this film takes itself seriously and it also pokes fun at the serious issues of chauvinistic work places and feminism of the late 70's.<br/><br/>It works because the cast perform brilliantly. Ferrell was made to be Ron Burgundy and he delivers all his lines, and I am sure most were improvised, with perfection. Carell is also ace as a dim witted weather reporter who has one of the lowest IQ's known to man and Paul Rudd plays a sports reporting ladies man who enjoys wearing the smell of panther, much to the dismay of others.<br/><br/>This film will have you in stitches. It had me laughing out loud on several occasions although there is a slight lull in the middle where the jokes start to run thin. I cannot blame the writers for struggling they did fit so many brilliant lines into one film. Lines that will have you and your mates imitating and giggling at over a beer down the pub. That though is the problem with this film.<br/><br/>This was not the first time I have seen this film. As a matter of fact I have seen it a few times and during the first time I shut it off. I found it stupid and moronic humour. That's where I thank my friends for reciting so many brilliant lines down the boozer. I was intrigued and that's what made it so funny when I finally heard them spoken from the horse's mouth.<br/><br/>I am telling you now, give this movie a chance. Watch it then watch it again and repeat the hilarious lines for your own amusement, they never tire. However, do not watch this expecting a good story. If you are a fan of Ferrell it is worth it, if you cannot stand him it is not. You will want to tear your eyes out. I didn't and, if you are like me you will never tire of hearing someone question their own name. I'm Ron Burgundy?"

His best comic impersonation has been a dead-on portrait of James Lipton, the interviewer-host of ""Inside the Actors Studio."" But the ""Anchorman"" film reveals the limitations of Ferrell in both screen writing and in acting. From start to finish, the film was shallow and the comic moments were uninspired.<br/><br/>The one breath of fresh air in this lackluster film was the performance of Christina Applegate. Her comic timing was superb and, above all, she was the only performer who was convincing as a TV newscaster. But her character was not well developed in a script that was obviously intended as a star vehicle for Ferrell as Ron Bugundy. <br/><br/>Lost in this mess of a film was the important point that in the 1970s there were significant female journalists in the media, such as Jessica Savitch, who paved the way for women news anchors. Ironically, the most competent scene in the film was when the four male newscasters sang a popular love song from the 1970s.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","5","3","5","22 January 2013"," Absolutely not as funny as its reputation would suggest
","Are there funny moments in Anchorman? Sure there are? Does it make me laugh from beginning to end? No, certainly not. Like Airplane it bombards the viewer with so many gags, hoping that they'll all work. Unlike Airplane, it fails. Most of the scattershot attempts at humor are just terrible. What's the deal with the gang suddenly singing 'Afternoon Delight'? Is this supposed to be hilarious? It's nothing. It slows down the movie. The narration is completely unnecessary and the hype, within the movie, around Ron Burgandy is distracting. He's not really a great character and exists in his own world of surreal nonsense instead of being more reality-based like the lesser characters (much like Jim Carrey with Ace Ventura). Had there been a more human element to Burgandy it might have made for a slightly better movie.<br/><br/>The thin story, so weak it cannot stand on its own two legs, has a woman arrive at a male-dominated newsroom in 1970s San Diego determined to prove she can be just as good. The men react with horror. They clash. The material is so thin it is 2-dimensional. If you need any more proof check out the utterly terrible 'lost' Anchorman movie Wake Up, Ron Burgandy, a so-called movie assembled from deleted scenes and plots. Much of Anchorman should have been deleted too, but then the running time would barely exceed 70 minutes. Adam McKay and Will Ferrell simply did not have enough mileage for a feature length movie with this anorexic premise.<br/><br/>For all his screaming and attention-seeking it's somewhat ironic that Will Ferrell's never became a superstar, while supporting actor Steve Carrell went on to much bigger and better things. He's clearly the best actor of the bunch and the movie would be substantially even less funny without him.<br/><br/>It is sporadically funny. It is not as funny as the mass hysteria would lead you to believe. It is not a classic."
"thetrackelite","10","3","5","19 May 2010"," What I like about Anchorman
","This movie is one of my all time favorites. Every scene has unexpected lines and unlimited laughs. I have watched this movie well over 25 times and still have not gotten tired of it. One of the best parts about this film is the ""quotability"" of it. Almost every line in the movie can be quoted and be funny. The three reasons I like this film are because of the entertainment aspect, the acting/actors, and the story. Entertainment- this movie is funny the entire way through the movie. Every scene keeps me laughing through the next. There are many unexpected jokes as well that happen throughout. Acting- the acting in the movie is AWESOME! How the directors managed to get any shots without the actors laughing is unbelievable. The actors say things that are completely random and funny. They keep the audience engaged throughout the movie. I remember the first time I watched this movie I was always thinking, ""what are they going to do next?"" Each time I was surprised by what they did and laughed because of it. Storyline- the storyline in this movie was not important the first time I watched it. Every time I watch this movie I understand more of the movie and more of why they do what they do. The story gets a little sidetracked at times, but is for comedic effects and works well."

","Really, I think it would be difficult to create an entirely random edit of this film which was much worse.<br/><br/>Throughout, a cast of reasonable comic actors deliver lines in a deadpan style similar to that of 40 year old virgin or Dodgeball. However, not one of these lines hit the target. The pregnant pauses usually designed to balance an absurdity become awkward silences.<br/><br/>Characters make sudden change of heart decisions which are entirely irrational, even within a comic framework. Christina Applegate's 'Veronica' is entirely inconsistent and cannot decide if she is a new woman or old bimbo.<br/><br/>Somebody gave up on this movie early on and raced to get it out of the way.

Will Farrell isn't funny and the film sucked more than a specialist in the world's oldest profession. The one star rating, like so many other people here, is for Steve Carell - the only smirk raised during this drawn-out, torturous experience.<br/><br/>Apart from him, this is a lame, predictable, juvenile, half-baked, under-rehearsed, over-acted,pathetic excuse for a film and to suggest that this was meant to be funny is an insult to those who actually make some kind of effort, not just rest on their laurels while laughing at how easy the movie going public are to make part with their money.

This sad and pathetic aesthetic sin of a film, which I viewed in fits and starts working my tax books while babysitting my little boy, provides ample proof of the dumbing down of our anti-intellectual society, and to such an extent as to make one weep.
Will Ferrel is just a guy with no shame. He's not funny. He comes from the new breed of comic, whose product is based on prehistoric facial mugging and mooning, body language and Schtick of a purely physical nature. Tina what's her name, for example, has one claim to fame, and it's that permanent smirk you see in every photo.

","I don't know what exactly it was that even possessed me to pick up a copy of 'Anchorman'. Maybe it was the great reception it is known to have, its importance in pop culture and reference. Or maybe it was the fact that is only cost 50p in the second hand DVD store. It was probably a mix of those factors, but even for such a low price, I still consider this a monumental waste of my money. I have not turned a movie off half way through due to lack of quality since 'lawnmower man 2'.<br/><br/>The biggest failure was labeling this boring, turgid, waste as a 'comedy', as nothing truly funny ever happened. In fact the only thing that elicited a laugh at any point before I turned it off in annoyance was a dog wearing pajamas. The first and last funny thing before I firmly planted my finger on 'eject'.<br/><br/>From the moment the movie starts, everything looks plain bad, and that isn't just mentioning Will Ferrell's ugly misshapen teeth, pitted face, creepy mustache and chest hair that is so off-putting, your teeth zing with utter disgust. Everything about the movie seems low quality. While I understand the movie was filmed with 70's quality cameras to give it a retro feel, it just comes off as dated, and as for the 'comedy', well that was never funny, no matter which era you live in.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the main character, Ron Burgundy, perving on a new female news anchor, while his group of truly detestable, unfunny, unlikable friends sit back impressed. Whether its Ron standing on someone's dinner playing a flute, men making sexual actions in front of a woman, or a disgusting smelling cologne, simply nothing that's meant to be funny, is actually funny. If the jokes had been written and executed well, it might have been just about enjoyable, but every character's trope was so obvious, none of it worked. The idiot one was an idiot, the pervy one perved, the 'playa' one played. Nothing quirky, or out of the ordinary occurred. <br/><br/>While my family had been asking me to turn the movie off for about twenty minutes, the ting that finally motivated me to do so was a cringy moment where Ron attempts to sing a 'touching' song about love to his co-workers, who have never felt it. I truly have no clue what else happened, because I shut it off then, and moved onto something actually enjoyable.<br/><br/>Totally unfunny, boring, and generally an abysmal piece of cinema, 'anchorman' if not worth 50p in a second hand shop, and it isn't worth getting for free. If someone offered me 50p to take the film off their hands, I'd probably turn it down. <br/><br/>avoid this movie at all costs, as it is not a comedy, it is simply Will Ferrell making a fool of himself in the most stilted and unenjoyable way for... well I guess the time it takes depends on how quickly you switch off the movie, because you sure won't make it to the end I can tell you that much. I find it hard to think of enough adjectives that describe how poor this film is, but certainly 'abysmal', 'terrible', 'pathetic', and 'rubbish' come to mind. there are many more that I am sure are not allowed to be typed into this website, so let me say this...<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THIS BORING TERRIBLE MOVIE, AND DON'T WATCH IT FOR FREE, ANYWHERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. <br/><br/>how it got a sequel is beyond me..."

","I'm sure the people in this film had a great time. I mean they could see the funny side of recording for posterity a series of lame jokes in context of the thinnest of plots. If you close eyes and try to imagine the funny bits you will also be sadly disappointed. Fundamentally, Will Ferrell is not a funny person and just about all his films have the same story line jammed pack with banal unfunny script and the same character - himself. When he does interviews he's not funny as he's continues to play the same character. The set scenes, the fight scene, at the zoo etc are turgid and without any comedic imagination let alone wit. The thought that his could be homage to the early days of TV news presenters is just as ludicrous as any other explanation for the film. I strongly recommend Ferrell and Costner make a few movies together ( if they haven't already) - now that would be funny."

","To be honest, I am not a huge fan of Will Ferrell, he's too over the top and ridiculous in my opinion. Obviously you still get the over the top attitude in this film, but what makes it all the better is how it knows how ridiculous it is. This film I find to be a satire on the comedies, because of the exaggerated scenes, such as when Ron plays the flute or when Ron and Veronica have sex. I loved how the film did not take itself seriously and went over the top, knowing how stupid it all is. It doesn't hurt that the supporting actors are HYSTERICAL. Steve Carell's character is easily the funniest performance, and Paul Rudd was amusing to have as well. I adore Vince Vaughn as the opposing News Anchor, and the scene with him and the other News Channels all fighting, in a direct spoof of West Side Story, had me crying I was laughing so hard. Overall this film was definitely worth watching. It's certainly not perfect by any means, but it's refreshing to have a comedy that not only knows how stupid it is, but uses that to its advantage. An easy 7/10 for me."

I wouldn't watch it a second time, but I couldn't help but bust out laughing several times during the film, even though I struggeld through some of the drier parts of the film (the big gang-fight scene for example was not at all funny).<br/><br/>If you and your friends wanna sit down with a couple different movies and need a warm-up on DVD night, I'd recommend it.

It's like a joke with no clear punchline, it might be funny but you still wonder what the big point was.<br/><br/>This movie rests heavily on the shoulders of Will Ferrell. He's in almost every scene in the movie and i think he carries it quite well. Ferrell is one of those comedy actors that has the ability to be at least somewhat funny even when the material is not. Many Saturday Night Live-skits were saved by him in my opinion. Here he is the centerpiece but he also has good help from the standard supporting actors for movies like this one, people like Vince Vaughn and Steve Carell. Aside from Will Ferrell most responsibility lies on Christina Applegate. She has comic timing enough but her character is quite poorly written which doesn't really allow her to deliver.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" is a movie that is sometimes very funny but most of the time not spectacularly so. Rather i was sitting there watching, often with a smile and an occasional laugh. It's not boring but it's not great. It's the most funny when well-known actors show up in cameos.

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a very strange comedy. It feels almost like an experimental comedy: improvisation, talking directly to the camera in places, and some truly strange humor. <br/><br/>Nothing much happens in the movie, but this isn't a bad thing. The basic idea is that a chauvinistic news room in the 1970s has to deal with a female with her sights set on becoming an anchor. Ron (played by Will Ferrell) falls in love with the woman (Christina Applegate), the rest (Paul Rudd, Steve Carell & David Koechner) all attempt to bed her but fail, in hilarious ways, naturally. With such a simple plot, it falls on the actors shoulders to make it entertaining.<br/><br/>The actors seem to be having a great time. Much of the lines are improvised (stick around after the credits to see different versions of the stuff that made it). They all go over the top, but it doesn't matter. It just adds to the sense of fun that the movie produces. Will Ferrell is perfect for Ron Burgundy. He manages to get away with saying, ""I'm going to punch you in the ovary. Right next to the baby maker"" without seeming offensive. Comedy legend Fred Willard shows up, and there are a lot of cameos (notably Jack Black, Luke Wilson & Ben Stiller) that all add to this feeling a bit like an SNL party. The fact that it is directed by Adam McKay, one of SNL's writers & directors, should illustrate what kind of film it is.<br/><br/>Anchorman's main problem is that it takes the audience half an hour to work out what they are doing. Either that, or it doesn't hit its stride until then. There are some extraordinarily funny parts, including the disclaimer at the beginning (""The following is based on actual events. Only the names, locations and events have been changed""), a bizarre animated sequence and a dog that can speak Spanish. However, the jokes are not consistent, and some are far too obvious. <br/><br/>Anchorman is a funny movie. If the jokes were only more consistent it would score higher.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of *****"

","The Legend of Ron Burgandy (2004): Anchorman is routinely funny and many a times I laughed out loud. Will Ferrell carries the movie on his broad shoulders, nailing the character perfectly. He becomes Ron: the shallow-but-photogenic anchorman whose back-stage pettiness contradicts his on-screen friendliness. And, even though Ron is a chauvinist, Ferrell brings out his likeability. Christina Applegate is an effective foil. The comedic centerpiece of Anchorman is a no-holds-barred rumble between San Diego's various anchor teams. With cameos by Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, and Luke Wilson, this is as funny and memorable a scene as any in Anchorman. Anchorman is a very funny motion picture, but it also has a good sense of the time (the 1970s) and how the medium of TV news was changing. Like Network and Broadcast News, the film turns a satirical eye towards the behind-the-scenes goings-on at a station. Great entertainment."

","Review:
'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is a comedy film directed by Adam McKay.
Adam McKay kills it in his directorial debut with Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. He really thrived bringing what could have been a very dumb SNL skit type of comedy and made it something more. There were no jokes that didn't hit, and it go all go all the time.
It's the 1970s, and San Diego super-sexist anchorman Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the top dog in local TV, but that's all about to change when ambitious reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives as a new employee at his station.
This is the first movie which brought Will Ferrell and Adam McKay together for brilliant comedic performances of both parts. Will Ferrell was unbelievably funny as the lead Ron Burgundy. As well as masterful comedic and quotable lines, and a once-in-a-lifetime legendary comedic cast with Steve Carrell, Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, David Koecher and Christina Applegate, great acting by everyone in the film for a comedy movie, every joke hit for me.
People still quote lines from this film today, well over a decade later, which is a pretty good indicator whether a film is good or not. It's childish, offensive & in many parts just straight up ridiculous, but there's no denying the genuine laughs this movie delivers. Many say this is where Will Ferrell peaked & they might just be right.
Overall, this movie has tons of laughs and it's very memorable. It Will Ferrell at his best being partnered up with Adam McKay. I can recommend this movie to anybody who loves a good, funny comedy movie.
4/5"

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a comedy movie that premiered in 2004. The movie is written by Adam McKay and written by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. The movie stars Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and David Koechner. The movie is about a news anchor in San Diego and his misadventures in the 1970s.<br/><br/>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a fantastic movie. This movie has many well executed comedy scenes where the movie plays to its strengths incredibly well. The casting of the stars and even supporting cast make the movie's line deliveries perfect. This movie has some of the greatest line delivery by Will Ferrell playing Ron Burgundy. Ron Burgundy's rival, Wes Mantooth played by Vince Vaughn, does such an excellent job in every scene that these are classics in my eyes. The movie depends a lot on the cast and the cast absolutely delivers in all of their lines. It makes for an enjoyable experience if the audience only wants to watch character driven comedy.<br/><br/>The downside I have to the movie is its tendency to meander. There is not much of an overarching story in this movie at all. The movie suffers from a lack of focus as the movie focuses on gags that the cast plays. It makes for an experience where the characters have events that do not lead to any substantial conclusion. This is likely not a problem for most audiences but anybody expecting a story to go along with the comedy will not find it here. This movie turns its actors and actresses loose with the script and lets them have fun.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy'.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","A great cast works this script about life in the seventies where sexism and misogyny were still in the network news. The location is San Diego, California where Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) has to share his anchor role with a woman (Christina Applegate). Ron is not the brightest bulb in the bunch. He makes serious errors which lead to his firing. The cast is first rate with Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell and others who even make cameos. It's a fun film overall despite some of the vulgarity and profanity but still worthwhile."

","I love this movie, from going and watching it when it first came out in theaters, to buying it first thing as it was released on dvd. One of the most quotable comedy films of the 2000s in my opinion. Will Ferrell was so funny with some of his phrases and did a little improv in the film too which was fun. Same goes for the rest of the all-star cast.<br/><br/>One big thing about this film is, that I ended up acquiring a very dear friend to me that played in it. And still friends with her this very day. Her name is Darcy Donavan and she played ""Sherry""/""Hot Blonde"" in this film.<br/><br/>That scene of the movie she was in tagged the line that has been ranked as one of the top phrases from the film where Will said, ""Well...hello...you pointed to your boobies.""<br/><br/>A funny story too one that Darcy has shared many times is they wanted her to say something to him to throw him off and use as a blooper. And she did, but Will being Will fired something right back, haha."

","Silly, childish comedies like 'Anchorman' are always divisive. There are a lot of people who hate these types of films, while for others they turn out to be real guilty pleasures. For this one, I'm the latter. 'Anchorman' did crack me up on more than one occasion and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. It's one of those that's just so stupid you must be dead inside if you don't crack a smile.<br/><br/>The ridiculous plot and goofy characters mean that the laughs come thick and fast and, unlike a lot of other comedies of its kind, it never runs out of stupid situations and jokes. Will Ferrell was the sole reason I decided to give this movie a chance and he didn't disappoint, he was hilarious throughout as the anchor. For entertainment value, 'Anchorman' is great, but those who can bear silly humour and cheap gags should probably look elsewhere."

","Okay, so I thought this was going to be at least good enough to watch, considering how it had lots of good reviews. The trailer meant the movie looked alright to watch due to the mood (I didn't think anything was particularly funny in the trailer, though). However, it was not that good. The characters say lots of phrases and get into lots of situations, but they frequently felt kind of rushed and forced. Most importantly, a lot of those weren't that funny, some due to falling flat, but simply due to not being funny. There WERE occasional, much funnier responses, phrases, or situations, such as when Ron says something is an optical illusion, but that may probably be the only hilarious part of the movie. There are others that were reasonably funny, but there weren't enough of them.<br/><br/>The reason I'm not being too harsh on the review is that the movie wasn't awful. It really wasn't. It was just disappointing, and probably not worth watching, except for a few funny scenes. The occasional funny jokes, as well as the characters saved this movie from being any worse, but they didn't make it great.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>Some funny jokes</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good character development</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Slightly funny for many parts</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Most of the jokes weren't that funny and felt really forced</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The jokes frequently fell flat, worsening the quality of the jokes</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, I rate this a 5. This had me grinning a fair amount of the movie but not actually laughing. But some jokes had me laughing. Just some. But not that enjoyable.<br/><br/>It has its moments, but for a movie with all these cameos and stars, it should be much funnier. The jokes may be consistent, but I felt they were generally very slightly funny. However, I felt that they weren't funny enough to make the movie worth watching, as they only had me grinning, and I forced myself to laugh most of the time. There were some LOL moments, though (but only 1 or 2).<br/><br/>It had its moments, but it was overall disappointing and not worth my time. 4"

","A famous news presenter is threaten by the arrival of a young and ambitious journalist, who wants to be an anchorman as well. Things get even more complicated when they get romantically involved. I stumbled on this movie by chance and I just watched it firstly because I have heard of it and secondly because there were too many famous actors playing. The story is good and entertaining, but there are too many silly scenes that makes it all, well, silly. The whole point is to make the movie funny, but, for me, the performances were enough to make the audience laugh without the exaggerating scenes of western like fights and bear attack. I guess at one points it points out at the exaggerations of fame and TV productions and the place of the women back in the 70's, but the way that all these are presented, makes me think that maybe I am trying to get more out of it than there actually is. So 3 out of 10."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","1","1","10 February 2014"," Decent film, with generally good acting from the leads, but it did get a bit silly at times
","Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the lead Anchor for Channel 4 news in San Diego. His 3 co-workers/buddies are weather reporter Brick Tamland (Carell), field operative Brian Fantana (Rudd)and sports reporter Champ Kind (Koechner). Burgundy is at the top of his game and with Channel 4 news winning in the war of the ratings (much to the annoyance of Wes Mantooth) (Vaughan) who is the lead anchorman of a rival news company who are number 2 in the ratings war. Burgundy's boss Ed Harken (Willard) thinks Burgundy is the bee's knees, his colleagues all worship him and see him as the leader of the group which sets up a kind of 4 way 'bromance' between the leads. Things couldn't be better for Burgundy, but Harken decides that the network needs to make some changes and to have some 'diversity'. Therefore, he employs a new reporter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate)which causes upset amongst the employees of a male dominated work environment.<br/><br/>This is very much Ferrell's film and I must say that he did produce the goods in this film. I've not always enjoyed his performances in some of his other films (such as The Other Guys and Step Brothers) as a lot of the time he plays obnoxious or annoying characters, but here he actually plays a likable character. Burgundy, to me, was a character that was full of bravado but when it mattered he showed that he was a caring person. This to me is what made me enjoy this film as not only was it a generally funny film, but the characters were all likable. Carell plays a socially awkward character who isn't too dissimilar to the character that he played in the 40 year old virgin. Rudd & Koechner see themselves as a pair of 'Cassanova's, but they also show that they aren't particularly good at attracting the opposite sex (the scene where the 3 men try to pick up Corningstone clearly highlight this point).<br/><br/>Another good aspect to this film is the chemistry between Burgundy and Corningstone. Whilst, their romance was a little contrived and not entirely believable, I felt that they were great together (whether they were loved up or fighting each other, they were great fun to watch). There is also the moment where Burgundy gets fired for saying 'Go **** yourself San Diego' live on air. Up till this point, I found Burgundy to be likable, but I didn't have any reason to really care for him. However, when you actually see how much his job means to him and how low he sinks when he loses his job you can't help but warm to his character. Although 'technically' it was his own fault that he lost his job, he was, in effect, set up by Corningstone (she added the 'Go **** yourself San Diego onto the end of the autocue knowing that Burgundy reads whatever is on the autocue). This particular juncture of the film was well written and showed Burgundy's vulnerability. To go from being King of the World one minute to the scum of society clearly took its toll on him (as indeed it would for anyone). After this point, the rest of the film does become somewhat predictable but that didn't bother me too much as I enjoyed the film on the whole.<br/><br/>There were a couple of scenes in this film that I didn't think were great; the scene where all the news companies have a battle royale. I thought it was mildly amusing when it was just Mantooth and co and Burgundy and co, but it got silly when a load of different TV crews joined in the fight. It might have worked better if we'd have seen the feuds with these other companies as well. I think that would have made it funnier. Secondly, the idea of a dog and a bear talking to each other by barking and growling and then the dog happening to meet this bear's cousin whilst he was on his travels. WTF? There's funny and then there's dumb. I know that we're not supposed to take these sorts of films seriously, but I seriously suspect the person who came up with this idea had been sniffing glue or smoking something that they ought not to have been smoking.<br/><br/>Anchorman; The Legend of Ron Burgundy is a hit as far as I'm concerned and particular praise should go to Ferrell & Applegate who really carried this film. It was generally funny, with only the odd bit of stupidity that spoiled it."

"AlsExGal","8","1","1","24 October 2010"," Quite good for its genre...
","...that genre being ""manly men behaving stupidly"". Its charm is in the fact that it is not pretending to be anything other than what it is - it does not try to get you to do anything other than laugh. The film is also responsible for giving Steve Carell his breakthrough role as Brick, the news weatherman who can hardly assemble a coherent sentence.<br/><br/>The film centers around Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), a local news anchorman in San Diego at an unspecified time. From the fashions and music, it could be anytime between 1968 and 1975. Ron is basically a lecherous yet likable leisure suit Larry who is mainly a face - he has no real journalistic talents or instincts. He simply reads the news that others report. The trouble begins when the station manager hires a new newswoman, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who at first is given only fluff pieces to do. The big step forward for Veronica is that she is working as a reporter at all. This was considered women's lib in 1970 - just being admitted to the club. This did not exempt you from all kinds of hazing and sexual harassment, which was considered the price of admission. A romance develops between Ron and Veronica that ends quite abruptly when Ron is late to the set and Veronica goes on in his place. She does so well that she and Ron become co-anchors and the war begins - Veronica against every other man in the newsroom, all who feel threatened by a woman anchoring the news. However, Veronica plays it smart and takes advantage of the fact that Ron will say anything that comes across the teleprompter without even thinking about it.<br/><br/>Normally I don't like these kinds of films at all, but for some reason this one just gets funnier every time I watch it. Especially funny is the conclusion, with actual investigative reporter Bill Kurtis discussing the destinies of everyone at the station."

"dominicpearson","9","1","1","28 April 2010"," ""Im Ron Burgundy. Go f*** yourself San Diego""
","Let me start by saying that I am not Will Ferrells biggest fan. I have enjoyed many of his films but, like Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey before him, it always feels like he is playing the same character over and over. The problem that I have with him is that this particular character was perfected in Anchorman - if he ever plays a better role than Ron Burgundy I will be (pleasantly) surprised.<br/><br/>Lets not beat around the bush. This is Ferrells film. He wrote and starred and it is clear that it plays to his strengths as a comedian. There is not a scene he is in where he isn't perfect. He will not be winning any best actor awards for these types of performance and rightly so but for the roles he plays, his performance as Ron Burgundy is second to none.<br/><br/>This film is so, so funny. From start to finish the humour comes thick and fast. There are some really off the wall moments (the gang fight springs instantly to mind) and some stupidly childish moments (Sex Panther anyone?!) and these sit along some great one liners (the teleprompter scene to which the subject refers and the reaction of Ron to it are priceless) and set pieces. There is no way that I can even start to bookmark the comedy in the film. It is a potent mixture that comes together effectively to create a wild ride that ensures you are never bored. It is as far from high brow as you can get but at the same time sufficiently above dick and fart jokes as to let it stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>Ferrell is supported by a stellar cast, a who's who of film comedians in the 2000's. Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell (who has limited focus but steals the scenes he is in) are the most obvious but Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan and Luke Wilson pop up to add to the fun. They are clearly enjoying themselves and their performances bar none are brilliant.<br/><br/>I cannot give high enough praise to Anchorman. It is never going to win Oscars but as a pure, balls out, hilarious film you are going to struggle to find anything better. The highest praise that I can give is that I have now watched Anchorman at least 5 times now and am not even close to tiring of it."

","My first reaction to the film Anchorman when I saw it, I thought this movie was lame and boring but then after I saw the entire film it was really funny. The impression that the film had on me was it's stupidity and , at the same time it was really hilarious. The theme that really jumps out of it was how guys express their manliness.<br/><br/>The movie is really cool and funny as the character's lines are really random, especially Brick's dialogues. The major characters are Ron Burgandy, which was played by Will Ferell, Veronica Corningstone played by Christina Applegate, Brian Fantana played by Paul Rudd, Brick Tamland played by Steve Carell and Champ Kind is played by David Koecher. The movie is about four anchorman that are number one rated on T.V. news. They are very manly in every way. They need to be well dressed, need to have an eloquent speech; from their mind it is eloquent but on reality it is stupid, and the most important thing for them is their hair. Everything is going quite well until they got mixed up by a woman and their boss put her as Ron Burgandy's co-anchor. From that point, their manliness went down and messed up.<br/><br/>Some background scenes were really unrealistic. Just like how the dog got kicked by some guy that Ron Burgandy had an argument on the road, went down on the river and is still alive. It is really crazy. The scene shots are simple but well framed. The cinematography did look quite well for a movie of 70s. The camera angles, the backgrounds scenes and how the director cut the film and changed the background eagerly after the scene was made were really nice and well filmed.<br/><br/>All the actors and actresses gave out their best performance just to make this movie really funny. In this movie you'll notice that everything is exaggerated. The lines were delivered and acted very exaggerated.<br/><br/>The film really got me laughing. It is stupid and hilarious. I would definitely going to recommend this movie to my family and friends so, they could have a laugh from it. Comedic films are really good movies because through this people would really have a time to stop thinking about the dilemmas that they are currently facing but just to have their time to smile and just to relax."

","'Anchorman', set in San Diego, tells the story of lead anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as he struggles to come to terms with the concept of sexual equality within the work place when Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins his local network. The film is very much a parody of 1970's local news anchors with an array of increasingly garish suits and facial hair indicating a strong emphasis on appearance, no matter how terrible the news. For instance in one scene involving a fight between several news teams there is just one rule, 'No touching of hair or face'. It also seems to indicate that the 1970's was a rather dull decade for news reporting with water skiing squirrels and a pregnant panda two of the biggest leads!<br/><br/>If you like your comedies big on character development and complex narrative, Anchorman is not for you. Whilst it does touch upon themes of gender inequality in a profession that was just coming to terms with the concept of women as 'anchorwomen', you do get the impression this is merely a sideshow for the gags and hence for the most part the film has almost zero depth. When Burgundy replies 'that doesn't make sense' in relation to one of the movies most quoted lines about the Sex Panter cologne '60% of the time it works every time' you know where he's coming from as must of the hundred or so one liners in this film ('Saint Damien's Beard!', Great Odin's Raven') will leave you scratching your head at the sheer absurdity of it all. Yet at the same time they are so off the cuff as to be equally brilliant and instantly remind you of classics such as 'Airplane!' or 'The Naked Gun' that were packed with so many verbal gags that a lack of story was irrelevant.<br/><br/>In fact, when the film begins and the credits reveal that this film was written by Will Ferrell himself you begin to wonder how much of the film was improvised as they went along. Whilst the humour can be crude('Why don't you go back to your home on Whore Island', 'Mr Burgundy you have a massive erection')it never steps over the line into gross out comedy. It is a testament to Ferrell that despite the fact that Ron Burgundy is one of the most self centred, sexist characters in film you find yourself strangely warming to him. Equally excellent is his co star Christina Applegate as his rival for lead anchor. There are also strong performances from the rest of Burgundy's team, for instance Paul Rudd as reporter in the field Brian Fantana and the intellectually challenged Brick Tamland played by Steve Carrell ('years later doctors will tell me I have an IQ of 48').<br/><br/>Whilst it is refreshing to see a comedy that provides consistent laughs throughout its duration it is perhaps fair to say in the main these are moderate rather than side-splitting. Also, whilst the fight scene between rival news crews is amusing it does seem little more than a who's who with cameos from Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller etc. It is perhaps fair to say that the material is at its funniest when it is closer to the bone in parodying the 'anchorman' of the 1970's. Despite this, this is still one of the best comedies of recent years and if you watch it without asking too many probing questions it appears nothing but a much of people having fun? And what's wrong with that? For in the main, as Ron Burgundy says 'it goes down smooth'."

Farrell is certainly hilarious in his role as a arrogant Anchorman. The actors are playing his fellow field reports are certainly having an great time, especially Carell playing the dumbest in the bunch. It is one of those movies, where the cast & crew seems to be having an great time. Fred Willard appears in a supporting as the News Director. Although the original version of the movie tested so badly, McKay had to re-shoot the movie for a second time. Basically removing the original sub-plot involving bank thieves. That version could be seen in ""Wake Up, Ron Burgundy"" on the two-disc set of ""Anchorman"". Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit-parts or cameos, which most of them are uncredited. ""Anchorman"" certainly went on to have an huge cult following on DVD and TV, if you haven't seen this. Don't miss, one of the most craziest and surprisingly original comedy of the decade.

The times are changing though and after Burgundy is unable to go on-air one night, reporter Veronica Corningstone (Applegate, in her best work since ""Married....With Children) fills in so well that she's given a co-anchor role, a first for a woman.

See it to find out.<br/><br/>OK, with some funny scenes but nothing extremely memorable, the highlights being Burgundy doing vocal warm-ups (make sure you see the extras disc), the news team fights (with cameos from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller amongst others) and most scenes with Brick (played by Steve Carell).

Yes, the film is funny at certain points (The only part where I truly laughed was the fight scene with all the anchormen). The Mental problems with Brick were also detractors.

"MartinHafer","6","1","1","7 December 2008"," It's got a few laughs but don't expect a whole lot more
","To me, the Ron Burgundy story feels a lot like a Saturday Night Live sketch that lasts a bit too long--though it certainly has its funny moments. If you are expecting a film as hilarious as TALLADEGA NIGHTS, this one just isn't up to it, but it is an amiable time-passer.<br/><br/>Will Farrell stars as the title character--a very popular fictional anchorman in San Diego in the 1970s. Ron is consistently #1 in the ratings and on top of his game when a new female reporter (Christina Applegate) arrives at the station. She is competent and pretty but in the sexist 70s world of this film, that just isn't enough. Ron and the rest of the staff just want to sleep with her and won't give her a chance at any serious news stories. With all the double-entendres and sexist remarks, this aspect of the story seemed to go on forever--plus the relationship between the two characters just seemed flat and unconvincing--even for such a slight comedy. Their interactions or the sexist remarks might have been really funny one or two or even three times, but after a while it was all like beating the proverbial dead horse--it just stopped being funny. What were funny, though, were the strange random little plot twists here and there not related to the relationship between Farrell and Applegate. I loved the fight scene between the various reporters from the local stations as well as the scenes with the dog--they were so weird and funny that they made the film worth seeing. So in other words, when the plot was ignored, the film soared!<br/><br/>Overall, a reasonably funny but not especially inspired comedy that is about the same quality level as SEMI-PRO--both decent Will Farrell comedies, but certainly not as memorable as TALLADEGA NIGHTS or STRANGER THAN FICTION. This was mostly because the jokes fell pretty flat after a while and there wasn't enough to sustain an entire full-length film."

","You won't get an argument out of me that ""Anchorman"" is just a stupid movie. It just delivers stupidity with a barbaric yet ingenious sense of creativity that makes it the best comedy that a mind from ""Saturday Night Live"" has ever come up with.<br/><br/>SNL writer/director Adam McKay didn't have to do much for this film, only assemble an incredible ensemble filled with some of the best improvising minds in Hollywood. Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd and Steve Carrell are just the highlights for what is a tremendously talented cast that sells you crap like it's gold and you buy right into it.<br/><br/>Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, easily his best and most unique character of all time, an anchorman for a San Diego news affiliate in the 1970s who thinks he's the biggest thing ever/God's gift to women. He's remarkably stupid with an odd set of talents and an air like he's really smart and awesome. Carrell and Rudd are two of the other reporters: one a retarded weatherman and the other an over-cocky ladies man/field reporter that makes Burgundy look smart. Carrell's performance is golden although clearly written by someone with the decency of a ten-year-old. Rounding out the cast is on-the-rise female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who balances out the ridiculous humor a bit and I also am partial to the immaculate Fred Willard who is the news director.<br/><br/>Still, in all its shear ridiculousness, ""Anchorman"" shines. Its characters and random sequences never dreamed of before because they are so utterly preposterous work despite your inclinations for them to be horrible. That said, ""Anchorman"" is not going to work for everyone and amidst the trash that followed it it won't appear as totally original in the future. But nevertheless, the trials and tribulations of the lovable Ron Burgundy really work better than what happens to most stupid comedy protagonists when it comes to getting you to care. It's really Ferrell's best comedic persona and the only one he could revisit with any success."
"HelloTexas11","8","1","1","8 December 2007"," one of Ferrell's funniest
","Will Ferrell has played a number of different personality types during his amazingly busy career on television and in films, but the kind of character on display in 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is the one that most people associate with him and the one that seems to suit him best. The character is usually a celebrity of sorts, vain, boastful, utterly convinced of his sexual prowess, and not very intelligent. The old saying, ""a mile wide and an inch deep"" would apply. In 'Anchorman,' all of these characteristics are brought forth and the film is almost a perfect vehicle for Ferrell and his wildly inventive comedic style. Since so many news anchors, particularly local ones, are suspected of being very similar to Ron Burgundy, it's not a stretch to accept such an absurd characterization. What seems to have gone unnoticed by many people, including the critics, is how similar the Ron Burgundy persona is to Chevy Chase's, back in his TV and film heyday. To say Ferrell is channeling Chase would almost be an understatement; the two are practically identical at times, with very similar delivery, choice of material and dialogue, and senses of the absurd. One can easily picture 'Anchorman' being made thirty years earlier with Chevy Chase in the title role. As with most screwball comedies of this nature, the 'plot' is really nothing more than an excuse to hang funny scenes on. Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is hired by a San Diego TV station back in the '70's and hopes to become the first 'anchorwoman.' This causes much consternation among the 'boy's club' in place at the station, which consists of Ron Burgundy, reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and sportscaster 'Champ Kind' (David Koechner). They and the rest of the supporting cast each have their moments, but it's fair to say this was Carell's breakout role and he steals several scenes that he's in, his mentally-challenged character providing some of the film's most inspired lunacy. 'Anchorman' was written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay, and much of the dialogue has since passed into the modern lexicon, with such terms and phrases as ""jazz flute"" and ""I love lamp"" instantly recognizable as being from the film. Will Ferrell, like most comedians, has his devotees and his detractors; if you count yourself among the former, you will find 'Anchorman' a laugh-out-loud experience almost from start to finish."
"elshikh4","7","1","1","24 August 2007"," Supremacy Of The Stupidity !
","(Will Ferrell) is determined to be the typical stupid, and honestly he can do it with great intelligence and genuine originality. In (The Legend of Ron Burgundy), he plays a TV announcer from the late 1970s, who is so stupid in a brilliant way, with a bit of sarcastic criticism too. Though, unfortunately, the script wasn't as brilliant.<br/><br/>It had no more than 3 real events only: (Veronica Corningstone) came to the station, (Burgundy) gone fired, and (Burgundy) rescued (Veronica) in the zoo. So the rest was a flood of separated sketches; some were outstanding, sharp and clever, and some weren't. Therefore, that number of separated sketches, along with the absence of the drama flow caused some kind of low satisfaction, let alone when the drama doesn't exist basically: (Veronica) forgets about (Burgundy)'s declaration of their sex life on air so easily!, (Burgundy) comes back to the station at the end so easily also!!, and what a truth when you know that the editing deleted another more and more sketches which made an enough material that created a whole new movie gone strait to video as (Wake Up, Ron Burgundy: The Lost Movie - 2004)!<br/><br/>But despite of that, let me tell you what a wonderful substance they made in what seemed as another meaningless comedy. That was done through the unseen character of the station boss's disturbed son who developed from porn movies maniac, to drug addicted, to a killer; as the perfect result for all what this very station was presenting as the top of paltriness (a fashion show of cats?!), simply because the absence of seriousness in the media is a pure example of the culture's flatness, so the falsification of the consciousness raising; that's one excellent serious thing to say in a movie like this, especially when they consolidated it at the end in a short wicked satire: the non-enlightenment of the media men with their stupidity make them so qualified for helping some specific leaders (Steve Carell, the dullest of them all, became a counselor for president George W. Bush!). Moreover, the basic matter of the movie which's based on the stupidity of the male-partiality in certain age at the American media history (there was no reason or whatsoever for keeping the women away from this work!).<br/><br/>There are a lot of marvelous scenes: The group's romantic song, that language between the title's character and his dog, although (Steve Martin) had one with his dog in (The Jerk), back in 1979, but (Ferrell) made it like a smart conversation between two intellectual men!, the flute's jazz show, the sex scene in a fantastic cartoon musical! But on the other hand, you'll find some of the worst bad tasting: throwing the dog over the bridge, the dog defecates in the refrigerator, and couple of obscene lines.<br/><br/>As for the acting, (Ferrell) was hilarious but with some overacting at parts. (Applegate) did a wonderful job, so all the guest stars, BUT (Steve Carell) stole the show, proving that he is a true unique talent, enjoying us in many wonderful scenes, which made me wonder.. was it the writing of (Ferrell), or the improvisation of (Carell)?? Well.. maybe both!<br/><br/>I think the most beautiful thing in here is not only the talent of (Will Ferrell), as a writer and comedian, but also the movie's assertion about the fact that being a star is a matter which has no relevant with being intelligent. So it's simple as well as logical to have an announcer like (Burgundy) who made it to the top of success and fame with this horrific condition of dangerous stupidity before his deep ignorance."

","I saw anchorman a day after i had seen dodgeball, which i also rate as being a very decent comedy, but for me anchorman was superior due to one thing, Will Ferrel he was perfect for this role as an up-himself anchorman in the 70's, he is the biggest thing to hit the comedic world for a long time. The outline of the plot is simple set in a 70's America (specifically san diego), it all revolves around sexism in that period. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy an extremely popular anchorman on channel 4 news, he is accompanied by his crew of fellow anchors played by Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David koechner. But their lives and their jobs are flipped upside down by the arrival of a stunning blonde Veronica corningstone played by Christina Applegate, who dreams of someday becoming an anchor. This angers the news team as they believe that men are far superior to women, one quote for example being 'It's anchorMAN not anchorLADY'. Veronica adds competition to Ron's place as anchor and throughout the film they become competitors for a top anchor place at 'the network'. I felt that this was a very decent comedy and also felt that the cast seemed to seamlessly bounce off each other with great comedic value. This film confirms Ferrell to be one of the TOP comedians in this day and age, and also shows that Applegate is a fine actress and can and i hope will play many leading roles although my only qualm about this film was that i believe the script for Applegate did not display her acting talents to the full as it was not sufficient enough for example it was made out that it was 'her dream' to become an anchor yet it did not show that from the script. But nevertheless this film is great and i deeply recommend it as a insanely funny film full of cameos from talented comedians and actors for example the likes of Vince Vaughn, Ben stiller and Tim Robbins. From me Dan i give it 4/5 ****"

","I'm surprised that this movie got such negative reviews. Initially, I had not desire whatsoever to watch ""Anchorman"" in theaters; I thought I might watch it once it hit DVD, but I wasn't sure if I'd even do that much. My friend convinced me to watch it with her (my first time, her second), and even as we were going into the theater people were warning me away from the movie. Needless to say, I was nervous about what was to come.<br/><br/>I needn't have been. The first few seconds of the movie did, to be honest, have me nervous and fidgeting--it was neither funny nor remotely enjoyable. My friend wouldn't let me leave, though, and I thank her for that. The rest of the movie was truly hilarious.<br/><br/>Granted, it didn't make a whole lot of sense. It was the most unrealistic that I'd seen in ages. I still loved it. I loved it so much that I convinced my sister--who didn't even plan on watching it once it was on DVD--to go with me to see it again. She loved it as well. And you know how the commercials said that you'd be quoting this movie all summer? Well, in the case of my friends and me, they were absolutely right.<br/><br/>I think you should give the movie a chance. I did, and I adored it.

"aldrude","Null","1","1","1 August 2004"," good for teevee nuts
","Although Anchorman is a comedy, the premise is true- the first woman anchor trying to make her mark in a field dominated by men. Ferrell got the idea after hearing the story of Jessica Savitch, a blonde female anchor who went through the same issues (albeit with less humor) in the '70's. For those who have seen clips of Savitch, occasionally Christina Applegate looks almost exactly like her in certain parts of the movie. That's surely intentional. This is fascinating for those who know their history of television news. For those who don't, they could care less. Nevertheless, funny and worth a look, although the best gags have been played over and over in the trailers. A rental absolutely, for teevee nuts worth a theatre visit and a DVD purchase (rumoured several hours of outtakes, when it does happen.) Thank you, and stay classy."
"Bob Pr.","6","1","1","1 August 2004"," Sound premise; humor level 5th-7th grade
","I enjoyed Will Ferrill's ""Elf"" a little more than ""Anchorman.""<br/><br/>The story is based on a very sound premise: the difficulty in accepting cultural change, specifically women becoming broadcast anchors, giving the news, being primary hosts.  I hate to admit that when I first heard a female voice (Susan Stanburg) doing the anchor job on NPR (National Public Radio), it was shocking, unsettling, too foreign to me. But I adapted fairly quickly and appreciated her talent and that paved the way for more easily accepting women in many anchor or special expert positions.  Now, all I can do is shake my head in wonder at why that was such an initial problem for me.<br/><br/>
So the story is based on a very significant cultural change our country has gone through and if it was difficult for me, it must have been FAR more difficult for males in the broadcasting industry whose careers were threatened.  (I'm sure that men and women have gone/are going  through similar transitions in many professions -- law, medicine, teaching, clergy, police, the military, etc. -- with more still yet to come.)<br/><br/>
""Anchorman"" parodies this with what is, in essence a series of skits.  To me, the level of humor seemed around the 5th - 7th grade level, quite far from what could be characterized as dry or sophisticated. <br/><br/>
I think seeing the film is worthwhile to reinforce memories of that significant cultural change. Each of us will find some gags that are funny and some too juvenile."

But Wil Farell did a great job at role playing and he made the gross stuff turn into funny stuff. This movie was not one of those movies that could actually be realistic.

","(Spoilers) Anyone who watches Saturday Night Live knows that when Will Ferrell donned a mustache, his voice would drop an octave lower and he would put on an ultra cheesy/70's porn star/Malboro Man type of persona that was often hilarious.  Stick in a 5 minute sketch and it's gold, but stretch it over 90 minutes, and you're going to have big gaps of non-laughter, and Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy has too many.  It's the same old trap the ex-SNLer's keep falling into.  There are plenty of chuckle-worthy moments, but there's no real gut-buster bit here--and this movie is really nothing more than a series of bits.  Ferrell offers no surprises as Burgundy, like I said, if you've watched SNL, you know what this guy is going to say sometimes before he says it.  Steve Carell steals most of the laughs as deranged weatherman Brick Tamland, but his character is mostly hit-and-miss as well.  There's also an endless series of cameos (we're talking every other scene) by the same 3 or 4 guys who seem to adore sharing screen time with each other (Stiller, Vaughn, one of the Wilson brothers). Do yourself a favor and just rent SNL: The Best Of Will Ferrell instead."

Within the first 15 minutes, half the audience had walked out, but they were mostly teenagers. I think this movie tries to capture the cheesy feel of the 70's just as it does with the wardrobe and hair. It succeeds, but I think it alienates people who are used to watching more modern day movies.<br/><br/>Some of the writing is fantastically funny.

","Yeah, Will Farrell is funny. The problem is finding him a vehicle to convey that humor. For the most part, he has had co-starring and support roles. In them, you can see the humor, but you wonder if he could carry a film by himself. Well, he kind of can. Of course in this film, he does surround himself with some comedic talent, the cast is loaded. Moreover, there are cameos from some of his buddies, Stiller, Wilson, Vaughn, etc.. However, the film does start to falter and almost collapse towards the last thirty minutes. The story, which was somewhat<br/><br/>secondary to begin with, seems to have no real closer. Will this film make you laugh? Yes, it will, some of the one-liners are very funny. Is this a well crafted comedy? No, not even close. So in the end, I give it a mixed review. If you love Farrell and you want to see insanity, go see it!

Zoolander had the gas fight, Anchorman has the brawl.

","Anchorman is a good concept that wears a little thin over 90 minutes. Spoliers included.  The opening credits are among the movie's funniest moments when Ron Burgundy is ""practicing"" by saying certain phrases such as ""The human torch was denied a bank loan.""  This was a very funny moment, but unfortunately, the plot got in the way of the comedy.  This often happens with comedy.  The first half hour or so of the movie is great, but then the plot starts to take over, and that plot is usually uninteresting.  The comedy moments get further and further apart, and the movie starts to drag. Old School comes to mind as another example.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell gives an excellent performance as Ron Burgundy.  Steve Carell continues to shine.  Paul Rudd is surprising in this type of role.  I think they tried to create a real character with Christina Applegate, and failed. She just wasn't very interesting.  I give Ferrell and Adam McKay credit for trying to create plot and characters, but I think this movie would have been better if it was pure slapstick, with Applegate simply being the butt of all the jokes.<br/><br/>The now well known cameos provide few funny moments.  Vince Vaughn is one of my favorites, but his improvization does not work here, and he has one funny line in the whole movie.  Surprisingly, Luke Wilson provides the funniest cameo."

Problems arose when a beautiful woman, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is brought in for diversity and the gang notices she becomes a nuisance at the news station.<br/><br/>The plot consists of problems in the life of Ron, but it started off with joy as Ron and Veronica went to pleasure town. With fame, however, come problems. Ron angers a biker which makes the biker harm Ron's `miniature Buddha covered in hair' which results in Burgundy being late for his job. This resulted in Veronica Corningstone filling in for Burgundy which results in a boost in ratings. Ron's life falls apart as he looses his job only to reunite with his fellow workers in the end. With a movie like this, all that matters is the how many laughs the movie can get from the audience, and if there was a meter counting them it would go through the roof!<br/><br/>
The film is quotable gold. I have never heard so many one-liners in a movie, nor seen so many scenes that consisted of just flat-out goofy humor. The film tries to make sure Will Ferrell gets as much as the jokes in, but Steve Carrell was brilliant with his absurd comments throughout the film. He almost stole the movie, but Will Fearrell just had it going. Will Ferrell really catches the anchorman charm of many of the 1970s celebrities before on TV before cable. Some of the scenes were just idiotic that resulted in a cheap laugh. The news station battle royal with every weapon imaginable that took place in an alley had gold written all over it. The cameos, however, were hit-and-miss.<br/><br/>Despite a flawed plot, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy pulls through with it's hilarious, over-the-top humor.

That is, until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a woman and aspiring news anchor, joins the news station and threatens to dethrone Ron Burgundy.<br/><br/>Corningstone is inevitably promoted and what ensures afterwards is a war of wits (sort of) between the two anchors as they try to sabotage each others' reputations through various pranks and nonsense.<br/><br/>Anchorman began as a promising film, but quickly turned into just another series of unconnected SNL-type sketches. The SNL enthusiasts will enjoy this film, as well as hardcore fans of other Ferrell movies like ""Old School"" and ""Elf"".<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue is amusing, but a lot of the film's jokes are recycled, clichÃ©d, and just plain unoriginal. Am I supposed to laugh when someone gets hit in the crotch or in the head?<br/><br/>For me, the only thing saving this film was the climactic battle royal between all of the local news teams, which featured a ton of cameos: Tim Robbins (sporting an awesome afro), Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Stephen Root, Vince Vaughn, and Missi Pyle. Jack Black also makes an appearance, but I'd rather not tell you in what context as that will seriously ruin the hilarity between him and Ferrell's character. The recognizable Danny Trejo also has a spot in the film as a bartender.<br/><br/>Starts out just fine, but gets dry and bland as the film progresses. See this film for the cameos, but don't expect anything more.<br/><br/>Score: 78.3% (Story and Subject: 85%; Entertainment: 80%; Script: 70%; Soundtrack: 75%; Acting: 75%; Set and Design: 85%; Sequences: na)"

","this movie was hilarious from top to bottom the only time i felt uneasy about any of the scenes were the ones where the baby said something and the little girl said something to him. The cameos were good but no where near the best part of the film. Just because you try to psycho analyze a picture you think you sound smart but movies like this aren't meant to be over analyzed. Hell comedies unless dark or black aren't meant to be analyzed. most comedies especially this kind a slapstick comedy are quick short snappy bits that make you laugh they throw it in your face if its not funny you don't laugh. You said everyone else laughed, so why didn't you, I know why because your a tight a$$. Your probably the kind of person who found White Chicks hilarious. If you think your some kind of expert critic just look at what ebert and ropper gave it let me just say they gave it two thumbs up. And who ever said Will Ferrel was a great actor he is very funny but he has always done movies and skits like this if you have ever liked him you should like this movie."
"Al_Q_Bobson","5","1","1","11 July 2004"," Mild and one-joke but sometimes funny diversion
","Will Ferrell is a funny man, no doubt. ""Elf"" was a sweet and very funny Christmas-time treat. And yet ""Anchorman"" is much less than spectacular. Ferrell plays the legendary (and legendarily stupid) San Diego news anchorman Ron Burgundy, who is a brainless, narcissistic womanizer who loves the ladies - just not in the workplace. When Ron learns a woman named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) will be reading the news with him, he's horrified - but not horrified enough not to sleep with her, of course. An on-air slip-up causes Ron to lose his job, whereupon Veronica becomes the station's lead anchor. But you probably know already that everything will turn out fine for old Ronnie. <br/><br/>There are a couple of good laughs here, mostly supplied by the energetic and brilliantly straight-faced Ferrell. And a lot of the mindless laughs come from Steve Carrell as a mentally slow weatherman with Ron's station - just as they did in ""Bruce Almighty"" where Steve Carrell gave a hilarious blithering on-air announcement (the movie's high point) as Jim Carrey's rival news anchor. (Do I sense a pattern here?) There are a lot of other talented people here as well, notably Fred Willard as the station manager and Vince Vaughn as a rival station's anchor. (There are also cameos from Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller, who's becoming a tiresome presence in the movies these days.)<br/><br/>Yet ""Anchorman"" is still too mild and meandering to be success. The direction here is even slacker than that of ""Starsky & Hutch"", which is saying something. The plot is very bland, and the film's premise is basically one joke stretched too thin, even though it's a fairly short film. It's one of those movies that could have made a good quick sketch but that feels to small to work as a full movie. And Ferrell's bumbling, over-the-top personality manages to get a few good laughs, but eventually grows a little stale.<br/><br/>As far as light '70s-set comedies go, I preferred ""Starsky & Hutch"". Maybe that's because of the good vibes that come from the excellent teaming of Stiller and Owen Wilson. They worked well as a motley crew, which is one of the main reasons ""Starsky & Hutch"" was a good but mild romp. Will Ferrell in ""Anchorman"", though, pretty much has to carry the movie, and though he does well for a while, I think he really needs to find his Owen Wilson in order to be as marvelous as Ron Burgundy's hairdo. <br/><br/>C+ (5/10)"

","Just coming out of this movie, I would have to say it is a little overrated(7.4 as of currently) although I always thought the scales were kind of screwed up on this site. The problem is that a good percentage of the people that vote either choose a 1 or a 10 which should be reserved for very special movies be it good or bad. Apparently 30 percent of the people who voted thought this was right up there with the greatest movies they have ever seen. I see this extreme rating as a lack of interest in the pole and a good deal of 10's and 1's should be thrown out in my opinion. On another note, the movie had a good number of popular faces giving cameos which can always add a lot to a movie(although ben stiller seems to be taking any job offered to him and is running out of personalities to present). Will Ferrell is a respected comedian and I know he has made a lot of fans from his days on SNL and all of his supporting roles in other movies but...For me its hard to see him in a lead role because I quickly become habituated to his humor. Its for this reason that I liked him in short skits, but if you are like me, you are going to have a problem enjoying this movie as much as the rest of the audience in the theater. I would give it a 5.8 in the comedy genre but you have to see it to really know how you will feel"

Some of the comments here about the movie and how 'bad' it was, or whatever made me more frustrated than an Amish electrician, but everyone has their own options. <br/><br/>The random moments in the movie were great for laughs and actually advanced the story.

"ClassicRockFan1","Null","1","1","11 July 2004"," Plenty of fun, but wait for rental
","All of you know about this movie. That's right, I went to see a Will Ferrell movie on the big screen. Now I'm never much for seeing comedies in the theaters because usually they're just as good at home on your TV. This one is no different, but I had good company and it was fun to watch. The movie surrounds a news anchorman named Ron Burgundy and he's a typical ""I love myself and you should two"" kinda guy from before the days of sexual harassment suits. What made this movie was not so much Will Ferrell, but his interactions with everyone else. The movie plays like a very long SNL skit, but a somewhat decent one (in other words, kinda like SNL of oh...5 years ago). I laughed frequently and almost died from choking on some Sprite that went down the wrong pipe as they say. So if you're going to see this movie and Jack Black is on the screen, do not take a sip of your soda. Before I give my rating of this movie, let me tell you some of the comedies I feel are better than this movie and what rating I would give them. Monty Python and the Holy Grail - 4 stars, Spaceballs - 4 stars, Young Frankenstein (no this is not a horror film you idiots who do reviews on IMDb) - 3 stars, UHF - 3 stars, Dumb and Dumber - 4 stars, South Park Movie - 3 stars, Animal House - 3 1/2 stars, Zoolander - 3 stars, Austin Powers 1&2 (not 3) - 3 stars. As far as comedies go, I enjoyed all of the above more than Anchorman, but it does beat out anything in the American Pie Trilogy, and upon thinking about it further, I think I liked it more than ""Old School"" and ""Elf."" I'm giving this movie 2 1/2 stars which is a decent review coming from me. My suggestion would be to wait until it's on video and then see it. I bet it'd be a lot funnier with a few drinks in your belly. Perhaps Scotch?"
"gcrokus","Null","1","1","11 July 2004"," Winning Effort
","`Anchorman' is a pretty darned funny movie and Will Ferrell has a winning release here, for the reasons that it is pretty smart stuff and will be a box office smash to boot.  Cut from the same mold as `The Naked Gun' series and `Airplane' we are reminded of Leslie Nielsen efforts when he was at the top of his game.  But perhaps the casting of Fred Willard more contemporarily ties `Anchorman' to the sarcastic treats `Best Of Show' and `A Mighty Wind', successful parodies which may have influenced Ferrell in lampooning the worst of the 70's.  <br/><br/>	Focusing on a TV news team of the era, Ferrell (as Ron Burgundy, a local anchorman on evening broadcasts) looks, dresses and acts the part of a familiar subject (let's face it, Ted Knight was an original); a no-nothing hedonistically sexist talking head.  His teammates support the theme that TV news people have characters the thickness of a playing card and all the social skills of college frat pledges.  <br/><br/>	Of the supporting cast, standouts include Paul Rudd as supporting newsperson Brian Fontana, Fred Willard as their boss Ed Harken and unbilled cameos by three Hollywood regulars.  Vince Vaughn reveals a wonderful laugh to us and contributes well as the second banana (therefore arch enemy of Ron Burgundy) in San Diego newscaster ratings.  Vaughn also got a chance to appear in two movies very recently where a fairly important, if not the main, character could not articulate a metaphor, was ignorant of common idioms and/or makes up historical references (see also Ben Stiller in Dodgeball). <br/><br/>	There was one item that became distinctly more noticeable and almost unbearable as the movie went on  this is the worst sound track in memory. As if the 70's weren't unmemorable enough, the tunes  all the vapid hits of that era  were chosen for the movie.   `Afternoon Delight' could be the worst tune of the second part of the 20th century; if you like rock that has an edge, this is not the soundtrack for you.  It might be argued that these were the hits then; well, no one should have to listen to 90 minutes of the following:<br/><br/>1) Legendary Anchor Ron Burgundy Welcomes You To His Album ""A Life, A Song"" 2) Ride Captain Ride -  Anchorman Medley 3) Sunshine -  Anchorman Medley 4) Treat Her Like A Lady -  Anchorman Medley 5) Groovy Situation -  Anchorman Medley 6) Carry On My Wayward Son - Anchorman Medley 7) Grazing in the Grass - Anchorman Medley 8) Cherry, Cherry - Anchorman Medley 9) Who's That Lady -Anchorman Medley 10) Shannon 11) Use Me -Anchorman Medley 12) Help Yourself -Anchorman Medley 13) She's Gone -Anchorman Medley 14) Afternoon Delight 15) Ron Burgundy's Sign Off<br/><br/>		(Source: http://music.ign.com/articles/522/522968p1.html)<br/><br/>	Christina Applegate (as Veronica Corningstone, a serious challenge to the all-male broadcasting station staff) generated just the right amount of lib-ness to her role and is a perfect choice as Will Ferrell's in-house competition.  She shows us smart, sexy and talented; Fred Willard has no choice but to make her the lead on the occasion of Burgundy's inability to make an appearance for the nightly news and she runs with it.<br/><br/>
	The news team is composed of a sports anchor (Champ Kind, played by David Koechner); Brian Fontana (Paul Rudd) - Rudd has appeared in 200 Cigarettes and The Cider House Rules and is far funnier than any of the other news team members; and Steve Carrel (playing Brick Tamland).  Anyone living in the Seventies knew a Brian Fontana, something of a disco ladies man.<br/><br/>	So we witness the penetration of the news team by a woman, tension and finally all-out war between the local news stations and a somewhat tepid romantic angle between two unlikely lovers.  There are even two great lines that one can steal in the bargain.  And if you squeak out a few laughs like Vince Vaughn you will have covered the value of your ticket. <br/><br/>
	Rating: Three Stars."

","Anchorman, the comedy about female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) coming to a San Diego news program, and stealing the main anchor spot from the pompus 5 time local emmy winner anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell),   starts of with plenty of laughs, but towards the end, it gets to a point with the style of comedy is gets redundant, especially Steve Carell's character, who while giving some good laughs, just gets tedious. Will Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy, along with his collleagues, played by (discluding Carell), David Koechner, and Paul Rudd. And cameos by Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn (who actually has a pretty important role) keep the film from getting boring. For what it's worth, I got some good laughs, but I doubt I'll see this movie more than twice. I might have enjoyed this more, if I hadn't rented Old School the night before I saw this.

","To be brief, I love Will Ferrell's comedy, I love the stunts and cameos he's made as Ron Burgundy leading up to the release of this movie, and I very much enjoy what we all like to call ""stupid funny"" comedies.  However, Anchorman was a total disappointment.  It has two or three hilarious scenes and that is it.  For the rest of the movie I was pinching myself to see if I was really awake or if it was just a bad dream.  I can't believe Will Ferrell actually wrote this...I kinda refuse to believe that, actually.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you to go or not to go watch it, I don't care, but I must tell you I don't really recommend it.  Even if I hadn't had such high expectations for this movie, I'd still think it was bad."

","Anchorman seems a lot like a bunch of sketch comedies thrown together, which makes sense because it's written by SNL alumni.  As long as you're willing to forget this things are great.  Will Ferrell and Stever Carell make the movie.  Much of what they do is improv (as you see from the unchosen clips shown at the end of the movie), and they pull it off flawlessly.  In fact, the parts that are clearly improv (the prank calls and the insults) are funnier than the rest of the movie.  This movie is also full of great cameos, such as Jack Black (in a few seconds of footage dog lovers won't forget), Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller, and, believe it or not, Tim Robbins.  I highly reccommend this one."

The jokes were consistently funny, and a certain scene featuring a dog and some bears was one of the funniest ever. The cast is great. The jokes are almost always dead on. There are plenty of cameos. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is amazing as Ron Burgundy, and Christina Applegate is adorable, but the real star is Steve Carell of Daily Show fame. His innocent yet ultimately mentally retarded character often steals scenes, as does Burgandy's dog Baxter.

I often wonder, with some comedies, how the actors can be unaware that the movie is really not that funny. There were a few minor laughs, so it was not entirely a waste of time. The best part of the film was Ron Burgundy's dog, Baxter. He was, by far the most interesting character. Overall, the movie was good spirited. I watched it on a night when the temperature was close to zero degrees Fahrenheit and I didn't want to go outside. It was fine under those conditions, otherwise, there are lots of better things to do."
"jotix100","7","4","9","7 August 2005"," Bad hair day in San Diego
","The curse for some of our photogenic news anchors appears to be having a bad hair day, or not being suitably clothed with the right pastel colors in front of the camera. Or so, it seems to be the message of this, sometimes funny, spoof about the folks that deliver the news on television, especially in California.<br/><br/>Director Adam McKay, with the help of the star of this film, Will Ferrell, have come out with a screen play that tries to make fun out of some of the local Southern California's anchors. They treat the news as entertainment, or so it appears to be the case. One never sees any crisis in their broadcasts, and being caught without makeup, or heaven forbid hair spray, will send them into a frenzy.<br/><br/>The battle for ratings is at the core of most of these broadcasts. The more ridiculous the items being given coverage in their thirty minutes format, the better. In fact, the greatest single item of interest for the many networks in the area seem to be the coverage of the birth of a baby panda in the San Diego zoo, where one anchor woman, by accident, is sent by a rival anchor into the pit where some grizzly bears are housed. But never fear, Ron Burgundy, anchor extraordinaire, comes to her rescue and the resulting footage beats the competition and the baby panda takes second seat to the sensational feat accomplished by the anchorman.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments in the film, which falls into the gross genre. The sexual jokes at the station, at the expense of the young woman who is hired, are tasteless, at best. The sequence of the fighting anchors in a free for all leaves one of them with only one arm, but before the film ends, he'll lose the other one as well.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell, the funny man of the hour, has some good opportunities where to shine; after all, this is a vehicle tailor made for him! Christina Applegate shows she can keep herself going. Paul Rudd is totally wasted; Fred Willard ditto. In some cameos we see by Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller, among others.<br/><br/>The best way to approach this movie is to watch it without any expectations, as it will probably appear better with that type of viewing attitude."

Instead of just saying "" that cologne has a distinct smell , he says "" its quite pungent."" he also has many other funny lines he uses that I've never heard before in my life, like when he's standing out in the sun and trying to quench his thirst he yells out ""milk was a bad choice."" He's helped by 3 news team accomplices throughout the movie named champ, brick, and brian. they all have their own unique personalities, especially brick, who is mentally retarded. Ron gets his #1 anchor in sandiego status challenged when the beautiful Christina applegate known in the movie as veronica corningstone comes to sandiego to be an anchorwoman.

Ferrell has such a huge and uncommon talent for playing an over-the-top caricature with such nuance that it's hysterically believable. I think his caricatures are hysterical not on their own but because with his talent he can bring so much to them. In ""Anchorman"" Ferrell looks like ""I don't know about this; let me give it a try and see if I can get something out of it."" He doesn't.<br/><br/>So, aggravated at the huge let-down I made the decision to not be suckered into yet another POS that I would've ended up kicking myself for wondering why I couldn't take the hint early on and get out.

This is terribly disappointing for anyone who takes movies seriously. The actions of the characters don't make any sense. If comedy is supposed to be extreme drama, this film is a mere melodrama about a protagonist whom I couldn't care for. At no stage, I felt a sympathy for the main character. If you are able to relate to any of the characters in this film, you should definitely see a psychiatrist. <br/><br/>The female character started off with some pride, then I lost respect for her too as she had no justification other than the writer's dumb and selfish intentions to accept the protagonist. Unrealistic, sexist and racist sickness."

","The best thing I can say about Anchorman is that it was shot in focus for at least the first 50 minutes of the movie. After that I couldn't tell you as I'd left to go do something less mind-numbingly idiotic than watch the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not even speaking from the point of view of a high-brow aficionado. Although my two favourite genres are technological thrillers and sci fi, I do enjoy silliness in the from of movies like American Pie. I've even been known to willingly watch and laugh at Beavis and Butthead. But Anchorman is so bad that I actually cringed with sympathy for the embarrassment the people who made it must feel.<br/><br/>This is without doubt the very worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. And yes, I HAVE seen ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"""

","If I was Leonard Maltin and preparing a critique of this movie for my movie guide pocketbook, I would give it the BOMB rating. This is perhaps the worst comedy I have ever seen. I smell a rat - Blockbuster keeps running it's trailer over and over on their in-store monitors. Sounds like they're trying to scam us into renting this dreadfully stupid movie - hey, it worked on me - I should have known better - films by modern day SNL Alumnus' are usually for 12 year olds. I think a lot of 12 year olds would find their intelligence insulted.<br/><br/>Having worked in the broadcasting industry, I thought the premise of a stiff, pompous Southern California anchorman in the pre-cable news 1970s to be an interesting one and expected to watch an interesting story. And it starts off interesting, then unravels into such moronic dribble, that I spent the rest of the film debating whether or not to keep watching or turn it off.<br/><br/>The plot is extremely weak - a bunch of 3rd graders could come up a stronger plot - and the plot resolution at the end took little to no brainpower. Most of the characters in the film are unlikable. Christina Applegate and Fred Williard are the only actors in the film worth watching.<br/><br/>For real comic insight into the world of a 1970s featherweight anchorman, look for the hilarious Ted Baxter character on reruns of Mary Tyler Moore - a sitcom made during the 1970s."

","At this point in his movie career I think everything is boiled down to one simple question. Do you find Will Ferrell funny? For those who feel he helped revive the increasingly unpopular Saturday Night Live, you will probably enjoy this film. For those who are skipping Christmas this year because of the movie Elf, I suggest you bypass this one.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Ron Burgundy, a hot-shot anchor for the local news station. When his boss brings in a young female reporter named Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) the sparks fly between her and Burgundy and they are soon dating quite happily. However, when things take a turn for the worse for Ron, Veronica is given the chance to shine in his position. Of course this relic from the days when women never left the kitchen is quite offended by the whole thing. The rest of the movie is Burgundy trying to regain his stature against Veronica and a rival group of newsmen.<br/><br/>Perhaps his movie was just poorly cast, but not a single character seemed the least bit believable. Where as Ben Stiller (who has a small role in Anchorman) gave us a very funny performance as a super macho man in Dodgeball, Ferrel's arrogant character was rarely worth a smirk. And poor Steve Carell, who kept me in stitches many nights on the Daily Show, is given a role who's insignificance is only outdone by it's poorly written lines.<br/><br/>I'd love to see Ferrel attempt another role besides an overacted slapstick comedy hero. Even if he fails, the attempt would be refreshing and prove that there really are people that belong in movies like this."

Some scenes in this movie are very, very funny. Many other fall flat. I have come to the conclusion that Ferrell is funny in short spurts, but it's too much to expect that his over-the-top yelling of his lines would be funny throughout an entire film.<br/><br/>I have been lamenting the marathon sketches on SNL for years and, at times, this movie plays like a 90 minute SNL sketch.

","I'm sorry if I offend anyone with this review, but your mentality will be offended if you watch it. I like comedy movies as much as the next guy, but the ad hype for this movie is overkill for the quality of the film itself. It is very poorly written with little or no true comedy. I don't even think I smiled while watching this film. The main character Ron Burgundy's makeup must have been done by a member of the hair club for men. The supporting cast includes several look-alikes including a Sonny Bono, J.R. Ewing, and Rainman. The story line was poor with no objectives, and the humour dry and old. The cameo appearances of several other comedians were also written into the film just as poorly as the main theme. Out of a scale of 1 to 10, it doesn't make a 0.5. Don't waste your money on a ticket. It probably won't even make the rental shelves or as a premier on TV."

","I really don't like commenting on movies after seeing them only once, unless they are terrible, but this is an exception. I saw Anchorman last night and can proudly say, that after one viewing, it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I mean, a movie with Will Ferrell with that hair and mustache standing in front of the camera and just making faces and saying random gibberish would be funny. Obviously this means Will Farrell steals just about every scene he is in, but to balance it out more a lot of time went into to making the other characters have very good one liners and some of the scenes where they are all together are some of the finest comedy scenes ever shot.<br/><br/>Now in a comedy movie I don't look for story development, great acting, or meaningful love scenes, but I do want very good characters and good writing talent and this is what I got with this movie. To top it off the story isn't half bad (For a comedy movie, very original), the acting is very good for a comedy, and while I'm a strong believer that comedy and romance do not work, Ferrell seems to make it funny.<br/><br/>I really don't like ruining good movies for people by telling them stuff that happens in them, so what I'll do is just do some generalization type things:<br/><br/><ul><li>I've never laughed more during a boner scene. - While Ferrell is the funniest anchor, Steve Carrell steals a few scenes from him. - Next to Chuck Norris in Dodgeball, which has nothing on this movie, Jack Black has the greatest cameo ever in a comedy movie. - You don't need to speak Spanish in order to get the best joke in the movie... You just need to think stereotypes are funny.</li></ul><br/><br/>That's it, I'm done. This is the funniest movie I've scene since Old School and I'm going to have to see it again before I say it's funniest than that movie. This is definitely Will Ferrell's best staring roll and I hope he keeps making hilarious movies... He's easily the next Adam Sandler. Perhaps someday he will make a movie that can dethrone Happy Gilmore as the funniest movie ever, but until then... Enjoy what ya got."

I absolutely love Will Ferrell, but not this character (or entire film). There were no funny moments in the film, only funny jokes here and there. <br/><br/>So, my advice to all of you Will Ferrell fans, please know that you might be unfulfilled with paying $10 for this film.

Anchorman falls flat after about twenty minutes, leaving you to ponder why you thought anything with Will Ferrell would be hilarious. Even cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins couldn't save this one. The only redeeming performance comes from Steve Carell of The Daily Show. Unfortunately for Ferrell fans, Carell nearly steals the show. Usually, I don't complain about movies I see at preview screenings because they're free.

There is a brilliant joke in every scene and cameos from everyone from Jack Black to Tim Robbins.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is at his best, and his funniest scenes are alongside his news team of David Koechner, Paul Rudd and the sensational Steve Carrell as Brick Tamland. The four of them improvise and create so much comedy that they light up every scene. They are supported brilliantly by Christina Applegate, Vince Vaughan and Fred Willard amongst others.

","Judging by some of the reviews on here, you'd think that this movie was some sort of horrible atrocity along the lines of Daddy Day Camp. In reality, it's one of the most hilarious (and most quotable) comedies of the decade.<br/><br/>Don't bother looking for a good plot line (if that's what you want, go rent ""There's Something About Mary"" instead); this movie is all about absurd dialogue and situations. For example, when Brick asks Ron Burgundy what diversity is (a concept alien to them in their male-dominated 1970s newsroom), he replies ""I could be wrong, but I believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era"". If you don't think that is funny, then this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is great as Burgundy, who is a laughably overconfident self-centered dullard (similar in many ways to the character of Ricky Bobby in ""Talladega Nights""). Steve Carell also stands out as the even dimmer Brick Tamland, who provides what are possibly the most ridiculous lines in the movie. Jack Black and Ben Stiller make cameos, as well.

"diac228","8","2","4","11 December 2006"," Not quite as ""legendary"" as some would hope, this one-liner bonanza is hit-and-miss, with too many misses
","What happens when a bunch of acting buddies take a crazy idea and stretch it to epic proportions? We get Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy. Written by the lead actor Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay, and then improvised to death by the stars throughout the film, this is really a hit-and-miss movie. Unfortunately though, we get plenty of misses amongst the few hits. This technique of improvising the same scenes over and over again is what made movies like Caddyshack and Dumb and Dumber complete classics, and what saved Talladega Nights, but unfortunately wasn't enough to carry this film far enough out of boredom every so often. The plethora of cameos and surprise appearances couldn't quite save the film, despite for the most part being very humorous. Last but not least, there just wasn't enough Steve Carell.<br/><br/>Anchorman follows the journeys of a popular San Diego news anchor whose placement at the top seemed to not have an end. Followed by his trusty crew and his news station, he remains on top of the ratings with his charm, ability to capture attention, and maybe even with his hair. Could be the hair, who knows? But, but, a rising anchorwoman was threatening his placement at the top and that thread is named Veronica. As she continues to gain support of the ratings, Ron starts losing respect, friends, and potentially, even his job. One side plot involves the constant rivalry between him and the other news stations, which escalates to epic proportions as the second act rolls around.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell has his moments indeed, he can be a very funny man, and he is one of the leaders in one-liners. Yet, underneath the one-liners lie a lot of jokes that just fall flat, including his antics with his dog, his ""guns,"" and his embarrassing way of trying to impress women. Same problem goes with the rest of the cast; they all had their moments in the spotlight, but at other moments were quite boring. McKay also failed to bring out any humorous moments with the lead female, the usually funny Christina Applegate, whose beginnings included her hilarious portrayal as Kelly in ""MarriedWith Children."" This idea wasn't meant to be a motion picture, but instead more like a Saturday Night Live skit, a recurring one at that. One would wonder if all the extra material filmed that didn't end on the final draft could have improved the movie a bit more.<br/><br/>The best performance by far was that of Steve Carell. His expressions, his dialogue, his posture, and his comic timing is absolutely brilliant, if only others followed his lead. Steve Carell was an obvious star on the rise, and it was a total shame he wasn't utilized a bit more, because he delivered some of the funnier moments in Anchorman. What kept Anchorman going was actually all the cameos and small roles by famous actors, including Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughan, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, and Fred Armisen. Best part of the movie happens with tons of cameos, as all the crews of the competing news stations join together and.dance.<br/><br/>Yet, after that amazingly funny scene, it all slows down almost to a halt. It becomes almost unbearable as the third act rolls around and we see Will Ferrell run out of improvising ideas and the writers running out of material. The climax falls kind of flat as well, with once again Carell helping a bit. The ending pulls in way too fast, and what we have ourselves is a quotable movie, but with nothing really worth watching more than once. Hey, just because you can quote it doesn't make it any good, right?<br/><br/>Bottom Line: A reunion, a party, a festival of improvising fiends with a knack of stretching an idea and not being afraid to take risks is what basically makes Anchorman a watchable film at times, but then a bore at other moments. Obviously it was fun filming in an atmosphere where anything goes, but sadly not all the fun is transferred to the screen, to the viewer. We get decent scenes, and then get boring scenes. It was a hit-and-miss film like Talladega Nights and other Frat Pack movies, but unlike Talladega Nights, it gets kind of slow. Will Farrell can do these kinds of movies for only so long before they become repetitive, and its about time to explore other ways to make people laugh. McKay deserves credit for being able to film despite not having much control over the filming, but he should have filled in the gaps in between instances of comedic gold with some material. You can get by on improvisation for only so long."

"Robert_duder","3","2","4","5 August 2005"," Yet another disappointing entry from the Will Ferrell comedy troupe
","Say what you will...to me...the movie blew!! It was typical of what today's comedies have become. Will Ferrell is THEE most over-rated ""star"" in Hollywood, not to mention overused. He ruined Bewitched, and he acts the same and overacts the same in every single film. He constantly behaves like he is still doing a 3 minute skit on SNL and that doesn't cut it in my movie watching book. Fortunately for him, most people disagree whole heartedly and love him and this film. The group that I have come to refer to as ""The Will Ferrell comedy Troup"" even though Ferrell is not always there are full force in Anchorman with the usual appearances by Ben Stiller, and a Wilson brother (Luke in this case.) The worst part of Anchorman is the sheer lack of plot. A film, unlike a comedy skit, needs a plot and this film has none.<br/><br/>Anchorman is set in the seventies, or tries to be, and centers on infamous local Anchorman Ron Burgundy. Supposedly this takes place in a time when Newsmen ruled the cities, citizens respected them and idolized them. It was a time when men reigned supreme. Ron Burgundy thinks he's got life by the throat until his world is turned upside down by the introduction of a female newscaster Veronica Corningstone. The news team jokes about it, makes fun of her and hits on her constantly. Unaware that a woman can do their job they think the only reason for her to be there is for them to bed. They all have their go but only the suave and handsome Ron gets to her and they end up having an affair to which Ron can't keep quiet about. Veronica is furious because she wants to be taken seriously as anchor. While on his way to work Ron accidentally causes a motorcycle accident with a rather angry motorist (guest star Jack Black...one of the few highlights of the film) and the motorcyclist angrily kicks Ron's beloved pet dog over the side of the bridge. Devastated Ron is late for work and Veronica offers to cover for him and reluctantly station manager Ed Harken allows it and Veronica is a bonified hit with the ratings. When Ron discovers that Veronica did HIS news, he is furious and dumps her on the spot. This sparks a horrendous feud between the two of them, each trying to do something more horrible to the other until eventually Veronica pulls a prank that gets Ron fired. Ron sinks into a bout of depression until an event arises that could put him back on top and give him everything back he loves dearly.<br/><br/>Now I won't say there is nothing redeemable about Anchorman. There are some funny spots such as the massive battle between the news stations, where guest stars Vince Vaughn (who makes several appearances and is a regular member of the Ferrell comedy troupe), Tim Robbins (surprising appearance but brief nonetheless), and Ben Stiller. Some of the insults and banter between Ferrell and Christina Applegate who plays Corningstone is funny but overdone which can't be helped with Ferrell. The rest of the cast, the news team in particular all behave like they are part of an SNL skit and it doesn't work, not for the hour and a half of movie time. There is some very small redemption in the film but for me I would never, ever sit through it again. Ferrell is unbearable and I think he causes everyone around him to be unbearable too. The whole team that has recently popped up in numerous comedies with each other should split up and try something different this was disastrous. Worse than Starsky and Hutch!! Another comedy Troupe special. 3/10"
"cherold","5","2","4","22 July 2005"," underwhelming
","Another mild comedy starring the genial, semi-talented Will Ferrel, this time playing a 70s news anchor. I heard this was a very funny movie but I can't figure out why anyone would believe that. It's sort of amusing in its extended-Saturday-Night-Live-Skit kind of way, but after 15 or 20 minutes of being reasonably amused I had seen every basic comedy idea the movie was going to present, and it just kept repeating itself. Ferrel's Ron Burgundy would be an acceptable character for a sketch but there's not enough of him to make a whole movie. The movie would have to be far funnier to sustain its one-dimensional lead. The 1970s references strike me as odd; the movie doesn't really seem to commit to a 70s period identity but throws in 70s period stuff, leading to a feeling of disinterest in its setting.<br/><br/>There were some funny moments in the movie, and I particularly liked Carrel's idiot weather guy. And Applegate was good, although her more intelligent performance clashed with Ferrel's cartoony one. Watchable if you've got nothing better to do, but that's about it."
"Superunknovvn","7","2","4","22 May 2005"," Lazy Will Ferrell flick without jokes or storyline
","I think Will Ferrell is a funny guy, I really do. The problem with ""Anchorman"" is, like many movies based on SNL spoofs, it relies solely on the charisma of its leading actor and forgets to include actual gags. From start to finish ""Anchorman"" is just lazy writing. The story never goes anywhere and there are virtually no real jokes whatsoever. The audience is supposed to laugh at the way Ferrell delivers his line (which takes the whole flick dangerously close to Adam Sandler terrain) or his tasteless looks and stupidity (haha, his suit is so 70's, haha, he thinks he's sexy, but he's really fat and hairy, haha, he thinks San Diego means ""a whale's vagina"" in German). All of this may appeal to the intellect of a 10-year old, but not necessarily to people older than that. There are cameos by the usual suspects, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jack Black, all of which make it a bit too easy on themselves lately and think anything they do and say is automatically funny and will guarantee another hit movie. Well, so far this kind of movies is fairly successful, but maybe the makers and protagonists should stop now and then and think about where Chevy Chase is today. Maybe that would teach them not to treat their success so inflationary and put more effort into their work."

","I have really enjoyed all the comedies that Will Ferrell has been in...except this one. It's been a long time since I've rented a DVD and then stopped it before it finished. In fact, I don't remember the last time that happened. But, to me, watching this movie all the way through started grating at me. It was really pretty bad and I couldn't stand watching it any longer. I think the dialogue was horrible and the Ron Burgandy character was bland and monotonous in personality. The movie really goes nowhere and I don't see how anyone with a reasonable taste in comedies would even like this. My advice to Will Ferrell is to let this character die and try again with a different movie and script."
"jdgratz","3","2","4","14 January 2005"," Ferrell is officially typecast!
","As if it is surprising news, Will Ferrell just doesn't seem like he can have the staying power we all hoped he would. With his most memorable performances being SNL skits and backup roles in films with other typecast comedians in the lead role, it doesn't seem like he can blossom as a lead himself.<br/><br/>Other famous comedians tend to eventually work their way into more prolific and demanding roles in the action and drama spectrum, this viewer doesn't foresee the possibility for Will Ferrell. This movie is a prime example.<br/><br/>After receiving the Best of Will Ferrell on SNL DVD for Christmas, I laughed my tail off to the reminiscing of every Saturday night in my college days. I am now older and looking for a bit more out of what I watch, and Anchorman delivered very little. It was almost like I was watching the 'Best Of' in a different format. Will played just another silly character with the same deliverance as his portrayal of Robert Goulet.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is the only savior. However, this is much in the sense of Ferrell in his backup roles. Carell made me laugh in this movie much as Ferrell did in Zoolander. In a backup role, you only see the highlights, and I'm afraid that Ferrell is destined to just be a highlight. It's kind of sad when the trailer is funnier than the movie."

It has some semblance of a story line, so it keeps your attention. In other words, it is bearable. If you plan to rent this movie, watch it now, because I doubt it will be on the shelves in a year or two.<br/><br/>However, when you get finished watching Anchorman, you feel like your brain is on novocaine. It is a bit like a cinematic lobotomy. If you watch it three times in a row, including extras, I suspect you might suffer permanent brain damage.<br/><br/>Watch at your own risk!<br/><br/>Addendum:<br/><br/>I've watched it five times, and must say that it does seem to get funnier the each time around.

","Inane script, clumsy, leadfooted direction, little to no flow or pacing, badly overacted by all, this is another one of those completely stale ""comedies"" meant to elevate a former SNL regular to film stardom (where unfortunately, it seems to have succeeded - go figure...). Loved most of Ferrell's work on SNL, but this is way beneath his talent. Why anyone would get sucked in by this puerile, infantile garbage is beyond me. Would have walked out after 10 minutes, but unfortunately it was the in-flight movie, and I couldn't quite bring myself to jump out of the plane.

","It's been a year of entertainment and some great movies and there has so far been a good standard in comedies. A lot of the comedies have been the usual poor Hollywood tripe but this year we have now probably seen above the average in genuinely funny comedies, far above the average in fact. There has been School Of Rock, Stuck On You, Starsky And Hutch, Scary Movie 3, Shrek 2, Shaun Of The Dead and now Anchorman, all this and I've yet to see Dodgeball that has had a positive response from critics. Anchorman is the years second appearance from Will Ferrell who appeared in a small role in Starsky And Hutch and Ferrell is one of the upcoming stars of the comedy genre. While Eddie Murphy and Steven Martin seem destined to make poor movies made primarily for young kids and are drifting into the land of the unfunny where dinosaurs like Mel Brooks, Rodney Dangerfield play table tennis with Chevy Chase and other former comical masters and box office greats. The current king of comedy Jim Carrey looks set to move away from slapstick, face contorting mugging and into more serious roles because he has the acting ability to do so. So the likes of Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, Jack Black and of course Ferrell are the new guard coming in to rescue us from boredom and tickle our funny bones. <br/><br/>Anchorman is a simple yet excellent premise set during the 70's. Ron Burgendy is a news Anchorman, the best of the best and a mans man and when Veronica comes into the office as firstly a news reporter, Ron and his team of co-horts are suddenly thrown into disarray. Ron initially falls in love with her but after the split he tries to sabotage her and the end up in a bitter feud to become the best anchor. It's all predictable but in truth the story isn't important in a film like this. This is merely a film with a character and situations that allow Ferrell to display his comic genius. Much like School Of Rock was the Jack Black show, this is the Will Ferrell show. It's all about Ferrell, he accounts for the majority of the films entertainment. If Ferrell wasn't as funny as he is the film wouldn't get by on the scripts jokes or the story it's essentially simplistic stuff, almost a blank canvass for Ferrell to work his artistry. Ferrell is unbelievably funny. I like Ferrell but I needed proof he could hold a movie in a lead role, he proves it here. I needed similar proof from Jack Black and he delivered in School Of Rock. Ferrell has excellent support from everybody's favourite former sexy-sitcom daughter, Christina Applegate who is more than adept at comedy. Also some supporting characters by Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn and a particularly funny role for Steve Carrell as the intellectually challenged weatherman Brick Tamlan.<br/><br/>Overall this is a magnificent piece of popcorn fun and Ferrell proves he has the comedy chops for the big time. ****"

You know the kind, where a studio grinds out a vehicle for Cameron Diaz or some minor blip on the American TV comedy scene that inevitably gets padded with cameos from the much funnier people they knew at acting school or have kids at the same creche.

","Will Ferrell is one of the funniest actor-writers to come from the SNL lineage.  When he was on SNL he could make a good joke great, and even keep the worst jokes at least on their feet.  The problem here is that Anchorman is that worst joke, that lame last skit of SNL (the one you know was simply filler), made to walk around dead for over 90 minutes.  There are a few good laughs, but ultimately it was an idea that should have been recognized as the dud that it was.  I had (and have) high hopes for Will in a lead role. His scenes are the highlight of both Old School and Zoolander, and he deserves center stage on another project.  If you love Ferrell I would avoid this movie, especially if you want to continue to enjoy his Robert Goulet impression (Anchorman's ""Ron"" is a modified Robert Goulet)."

","Although ""Anchorman"" lacks the inspired lunacy of, say, ""Airplane!"" (1980) or ""Hot Shots!"" (1991), I found myself laughing more than I expected and probably more than I should have.<br/><br/>This is an amiable comedy that, when it works, does so because of the earnest performances by Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Fred Willard and Steve Carell, who almost steals the film as Brick Tamland, the world's dumbest weatherman.<br/><br/>This is essentially an extended comedy sketch. Even at a mere 90 minutes, it seems stretched a bit too much. The comedy that works is the satire on TV coverage, when the film parodies the news business. The news bits and the TV station's promos are funny because, although the film is set in the 1970s, local TV stations even today resort to corny promos to win over their audiences.<br/><br/>The humor clearly is lowbrow and that's fine. There are as many hits as misses, but when the comedy hits, it's hilarious. The love scene's pretty funny, and there's a hysterically funny awkward moment when Ron offers to take Veronica on a tour of San Diego. Too bad the actual tour doesn't prove to be funny.<br/><br/>When writers Ferrell and Adam McKay, who also directed, go for broad sweeps, the comedy just isn't there. They're straining for laughs and the scenes don't work. An all-out brawl seems utterly pointless and an impromptu jazz flute scene is sporadically funny. It goes on for too long, as does an a cappella sequence by the news team. The cameos are interesting, but do we really need to see Ben Stiller in every movie?<br/><br/>Ferrell throws himself so enthusiastically into Ron Burgundy that it's tough not to like this chap. I wish they had more fun with the teleprompter or had him bungle real news. On the other hand, Fred Willard makes deadpan comedy an art form (watch his hilarious turn as Buck Laughlin in 2000's ""Best in Show""), yet the writers don't give him enough funny stuff with which to work. His one-sided phone conversations were ripe for terrific comedy, but they fall flat.<br/><br/>An intermittently funny film, ""Anchorman"" comes apart at the end in an unfunny bit set in a zoo covering ""the greatest story in the history of the world."" I realize I might be in the minority here, but I found nothing humorous here. It had the potential to be sidesplittingly uproarious but, instead, seemed awfully forced. The film called for a stronger, funnier denouement. But, by then, the writers apparently had run out of ideas."

Most people in the theater laughed, because they expected a funny film, but the the laughter was contrived not the pee your pants laughter of a funny film. Will took the money and ran.  A couple more films like this  and Will will become another Chevy Chase, or maybe Will will be just a good support actor with performance like ""Old School""  The supporting cast comedy adds nothing, and the only gem of this film is the cameos of Vince Vhaughn, Luke Wilson,  Tim Robbins, and Ben Stiller.  Unlike the supporting cast these seasoned actors know facial expressions, mannerism etc.  Charisma goes a far way, but this script should of been turned down by Will or Will will become another Burt Reynolds, Cheve Chase, and John Tavolta who excellently act but kill their careers performing in b rate movies.  Will should get a better agent, or read his own scripts,  don't kill your careers for Will can make people laugh and that is special.  Stay away 3 out of 10"

","Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a sensationally arrogant and dumb San Diego news anchor. His goofy co-stars (including Paul Rudd & the scarily dim Steve Carrell) are also his only friends until Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives to spike their testosterone punch. Soon she's sharing Burgundy's desk and his bed. But the men resent this woman (the first female anchor ever, apparently) and humorous trouble brews. Fred Willard plays the boss and straight man, which is a bit of a disappointment. He's too hilarious to be so serious. Anchorman tells a simple story: acclaimed (and consequently arrogant) news anchor Ron Burgundy is forced to adapt when an attractive new female member of the Channel 4 news team (Applegate) begins changing the way he and his quirky news team work. That's it. This story is predictable, prescription esquire, boring. But Anchorman does not draw it's strength from story. It draws from the hilarious situations. It draws from randomness. It draws from brief but memorable cameos. It draws from those 100 or so unforgettable one liners.<br/><br/>As apposed to many, many, other comedies, Anchorman actually gets better as it moves along. Most of the time a comedy like this will use up all the laughs in the first hour and then try to take a serious, lovey dovey turn in the last act. There are more laughs in the last half hour than in the first half hour, which usually is never the case. It's as if there was some mathematical comedic formula that spread the laughs out in a way that it was consistently funny. Or, maybe they just got lucky. I do not know.<br/><br/>I loved all the characters in the movie, every role no matter how small had a great moment or two. Will Ferrel of course, the star of the movie who is just perfect as Ron. He's so so funny cause he's such a lovable idiot. Even Christina Applegate, who was in a role that quite honestly anyone could have done, is able to make it her own and provide some laughs. There is a scene that has a lot of cameos that was hilarious as well. It was one of those moments that takes you completely by surprise.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. ""Anchorman"" is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next. For now, ""Anchorman"" is just great fun, and very funny stuff."

","Doing stupid comedy is not as easy as it seems. Will Ferrell proves that he is one of the best in the business at getting these tough roles done. He is Chevy Chase with a heart and a brain. The supporting cast of this farce is outstanding, and the cameos are pretty funny: I enjoyed Jack Black as a biker who loves dogs, Tim Robbins as a ruthless gang leader, and Ben Stiller as a crazed Hispanic (I really didnt buy him as a Hispanic, but he was funny, anyway). This film had tons of comedic talent, and most of it was well-used; except for Steve Carell. Not buying Steve as a complete idiot; he has too much native intelligence and sensitivity to be the idiot he tried to portray. Other than that faux pax, the film is pretty funny. Even Christina Applegate stretches her abilities and gets the role done. A must-see comedy."

It's not particularly stale after a while but it isn't quite a fascinating watch: they did well enough to hold it all up together while slipping in scenes they apparently had intended to use anyways ('Afternoon Delight', the major brawl with all the cameos, or some of the anchorman in-studio prank stuff).<br/><br/>Side-note: the fact this got such a strong cult following if anything is sad, because it really only is just another Hollywood comedy with the usual big name gang with a theme, a plot, and a few jokes to be remembered.

","Anchorman is a film co-written and directed by Adam McKay. This film just happen to come on my radar and I decided just to give it a shot. And at the end, I can say that this film was an enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>Plot: The KVWM channel hires a female news reporter much to everyone's dismay.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This is mostly a spoof on the news channels during the 70's. Although taking place during that era, mist of it is still applicable in today's world and the case is just not only for news. It is for any field of work. The title of the film is like that of a superhero, considering the films is about news anchors. I remember laughing throughout the entire film with no rest. I liked the way issues like sexual harassment, looking down upon women employees, etc.. were handled with comedy in this film. The film doesn't go below the belt, which is commendable. Also the characters have so much diversity, that you instantly fall in love with them. The 1970's was also beautifully depicted by the production design and costume team. A salute from my side to Will Ferrell and Adam McKay for succesfully introducing us to this world of Anchormen and Anchorwomen. My only issue with this film would be that sometimes the film goes over-the-top and the climax tended to cross the boundaries of reality.<br/><br/>Performances: Will Ferrell deserves a standing ovation. He was born to do the role of Ron Burgundy. Christina Applegate was also perfect as a choice for Veronica. Paul Rudd and David Koechner were also excellent in their role. A special mention to Steve Carrell. This man is so talented!!!! Vince Vaughn was also great as the rival channel reporters. It's always a treat to see Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Seth Rogen. Although they had nothing much substantial to do, they were good in what was given to them.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the fight sequence between all the channels taking place and Burgundy keeping a condition that no harm must be caused to the face and hair (considering how important are those for any person appearing in the entertainment media). I laughed so much during that fight. <br/><br/>Verdict: Although over-the-top at times, Anchorman still is quite an entertaining film. I assure you that you won't be bored. If you want to watch something light, you can watch it. It's worth your time.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8/10."

Vince Vaughn plays a rival anchorman.<br/><br/>Howard Hawks supplied the simplest definition of a good movie: Three great scenes. No bad scenes.

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy Review<br/><br/>Jokes told by newscasters and weather people are seldom funny or even slightly amusing. These jokes lack event the slightest sense of humor and often come off as dry and uninspired. One newscaster who has the necessary wit, charisma, and charm is Ron Burgundy and his band of misfit reporters who are characters in the 2004 comedic film Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The film is directed by frequent Will Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay and stars Will Ferrell as the title character. The film also includes the comedic talent of Steve Kerrell, as loose cannon, mentally challenged weather reporter Brick Tamland. Other actors who comprise Burgundy's gang of misfit news reporters are Paul Rudd as field reporter Brian Fantana, David Koechner as the sports reporter, and Christina Applegate as Burgundy's love interest, antagonist, and co-anchor: Veronica Corningstone. This film is very humorous as it parodies many aspects of news culture such as yellow journalism, signature ad-libs, competition between news channels, and the changes in the status of women in fields once dominated by of those of the male gender. Ron Burgundy's overall demeanor and attitude make him and his colleagues overall dislikable characters but there is something charming about them that make the viewer attracted to them. In my opinion, it is their overall stupidity and ignorance that attracts the viewer to like them. A time in which the overall ignorance of Ron Burgundy lies in one of the numerous quotables that are found in the movie where Ron says that San Diego was founded by Germans in 1904 and provides a mistranslation that is inappropriate for everyday conversation. This portion of the movie shows Ron's ignorance in that he does not even know the basics of his country nor does he seek out this information. Most of the comedy contained In Anchorman relies on the general portions of the movie surrounds the competing newscasters of various networks and times in an all out battle royale where humor and fun ensues. Despite the many strong and humorous portions of the film, the plot is a little underdeveloped and can sometimes seem more like a stand-up routine or comedy sketch than an actual full-length movie. However, it is my belief that those who enjoy the work of Will Ferrell are not looking for developed characters or a strong plot to string the movie together into a masterpiece. The movie does not target the more ""stuffy"" movie goers, but attracts a young male demographic that will enjoy the various innuendo and male humor that Ferrell and his cast mates provide. Those in the female demographic may be a little insulted by some of the jokes and stereotypes against women that are present in the film, but those with a strong sense of humor and an open mind will thoroughly enjoy the comedy present in the film. Overall, Anchorman takes a humorous look into the news world and if one looks into it enough some social commentary about the news can be found as well."

","I'm normally not a fan of movies employing over-the-top histrionics, but this is a well-done comedy where the campiness and histrionics serve to enhance rather than degrade the entertainment value.<br/><br/>This is a movie about a woman trying to make it as an anchor in a male- dominated industry, in a station dominated by a team of male chauvinists. Yet it doesn't try to hit you over the head with Veronica's struggle to make it in a man's world. You'd think it'd be complicated because of the love story between Veronica and her male chauvinist lover and anchor-""boss"" (who thinks she's joking about being an anchor), but the movie makes it simple and straightforward.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are incredibly non-believable, yet you enjoy them anyway. That's part of the charm of the show. Even the crude jokes aren't as offensive as you might think.<br/><br/>This is no family show, but I feel even your girlfriends will enjoy this ( as long as they know you are not a male chauvinist ;) )."
"tomgillespie2002","6","0","0","12 April 2014"," A consistently funny oddity
","Will Ferrell is a very funny man. He has the ability to squeeze comedy gold out of the raising of an eyebrow or a silly accent, and usually steals whatever film he appears in, regardless of how long he's in it for. Somehow, his movies tend to be bad, relying on juvenile behaviour and frat-house antics for laughs, which would be fine if any real thought was put into it. Anchorman is a sort of different, mixing childish humour with first-class improvisation from some of the most talented comedy performers working at the moment, and featuring one of Ferrell's most inspired creations. Based on real-life anchorman Harold Greene, who had a talent for sharp suits and a formidable 70's 'tache, Ron Burgundy is an egotistical, chauvinistic and narcissistic ass, but boy can he read the news.<br/><br/>In the male-dominated workspace of 70's 'action news', Burgundy and his troupe are the cream of the crop in San Diego. Burgundy delivers the news, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the lecherous field reporter, 'Champ' Kind (David Koechner) is the loud-mouthed sexist sports reporter, and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) is an innocent with an IQ of 48, delivering the weather and being led astray by the groups antics. Everything seems harmonious until the arrival of the beautiful and ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). Ron falls for her and she for him, until the word 'diversity' is introduced into the newsroom, and Ron finds himself with a new co-anchor.<br/><br/>Ron thinks that 'diversity' is an old wooden ship used in the Civil War era, a joke no doubt the product of multiple takes and the actors playing around with their lines. Due to this heavy reliance of improvisation, the film is scattershot and random, and by playing with the rules of random, as many jokes fall flat as they cause you to burst out in fits of laughter. So for every spontaneous accapella version of 'Afternoon Delight' or Burgundy wailing over the loss of his beloved dog Baxter, we have Koecher trying to squeeze laughs out of an unfunny character or an extended joke about Fanatana wearing Sex Panther, a rare and banned after shave which just happens to smell awful.<br/><br/>Anchorman's main success comes from, surprisingly, Christina Applegate. It was one of the first modern comedies to really put some thought into its female character, and rather than her playing the role of whiny other half trying to get her man to behave and grow up, she is vital in bringing to life this dark era of male-dominated office spaces, and she accepts Ron for the buffoon that he is. In the ten years since its release, it has garnered a huge cult following, and led to the release of it's sequel, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues earlier this year. Though I don't share the hype surrounding this film, it's still a consistently funny oddity, and most probably Ferrell's best comedy work.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

Make sure to keep an inhaler with you, because you may stop breathing at times. <br/><br/>All the characters are personable, and it's pretty difficult to pick which one you liked best.

"donuthaters12","6","0","0","8 January 2014"," The Writers Are Too In Love With Their Work
","Will Ferrell is part of a group of comedians that include Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and Ben Stiller, and each have their own comedy films where they shine. I have yet to see all of Will Ferrell's films, but from the ones I have seen, it is either Anchorman or Blades of Glory where he shines. Though it's his best, it isn't a perfect film.<br/><br/>The film is written by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. Anchorman's issues derives from the lack of a great story. The complications of the film doesn't really arise until halfway through the film. So the first half of the film introduces it's characters and the atmosphere of the working environment, which would be fine if the script has funnier lines and much more interesting moments. The film also relies on improvisations from actors, in particular Will Ferrell, and sometimes they just don't land. The film does improve during the second half with segments that are exciting and crazy. I did also enjoy the film's shine on the social balance of the era, with the battle against women and men in the workplace, and the film also gives off a message on the importance of acceptance and respect of diversity in the workplace and community.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Adam McKay. This is McKay's first film, and I think he did a decent job for a comedic director. Using the era of the 70s allowed him to create a beautiful design of the era with costumes and production design that has the audience believe that these people are within the decade. Though McKay captures the 70s workplace well, he doesn't seem to have a complete vision of how the screenplay would unfold, with the first half being draggy and tiresome and the second half fueled by immaturity and physical comedy. The second half is miles funnier than the first half, as I have a tendency to appreciate childish humor. There are segments of the film where McKay keeps the camera too long on Ferrell and he just rambles on, giving me the impression that both McKay and Ferrell are too in love with their own work that everything that comes out of them are pure gold. If only the film is consistent and gives a bit more of characters like Brian Fantana and Brick Tamland screen time, then the film would be almost perfect.<br/><br/>Thomas E. Ackerman is the film's cinematographer and he does a decent job in capturing the characters doing their funny moments. There isn't really a lot about the Anchorman's photography that makes it stand out but it does capture the image of the 1970's very well with saturated colors that pop off with each shot.<br/><br/>Alex Wurman did the musical score for the film and it is quite effective. Wurman's score does make you feel like that Ferrell and Co. are a legit news team, and the score hits the spots it wants to get a reaction from us. The use of Afternoon Delight is amazing, and it became something that is stapled on the film when people reminisce about the film. Though I do wish that there was something more from the score, but that's just me nitpicking.<br/><br/>The film is led by Will Ferrell and I think he did a so-so job in the role, though I do enjoy his commitment to the role as you can really tell that he is in character. Ferrell tends to ramble on improvised lines and at most times it gets a bit tiresome and needed more from it to be funny. Ferrell does improve in the second half as he gets placed in situations where he ends up acting petty and childish, which had me cracking up a few times. David Koechner is a bit of a let down, who is given lines that are not hilarious and felt over done. The gems of the film are Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana and Steve Carell as Brick Tamland, as they play characters that are random, inappropriate and at times flamboyant. Christina Applegate was good as Veronica Corningstone but it sometimes feels that Ferrell and McKay didn't write enough great lines and funny scenarios for her. Though she is attractive, it doesn't distract the audience and it has concentrating on her intentions in the film. The film does include a number of cameos that had me laughing and without them, a certain fight scene would not be as effective if it weren't for these appearances.<br/><br/>Anchorman does have funny moments and it does have a great view of the workplace of the decade, but the film does take a while to kick in and the writers are to precious of their own work that they find it hard to let go of scenes that just seem unnecessary or at least needs another rewrite. I would still watch this film again though, due to it's extremely funny moments that flows well in the second half."

","Personally I think this is a overrated comedy. It has it's moments although very few, but it just lacks when it comes to the comedic value. The jokes are just immature, immature jokes are alright if it's funny. But I wasn't amused or even found it to be funny. It seemed like the whole cast was trying really hard to be funny, but it falls flat. This is basically the movie that boosted Will Ferrell's career with his continuous man-child trademark. Maybe I am missing something, but it just seemed like this movie mashed bunch of random skits together. While having the core of the story for the sake of just being there, because they needed a story. Now this can also work in a way where it can be entertaining, but not in this one. Personally my favorite scene is the cat poop scene which was added into the deleted scenes. There really isn't any unexpected things going on in this flick and just comes off very predictable and quickly becomes tiresome. It's not a awful movie, but it's a very overrated one.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

","In typical Will Ferrell fashion, Anchorman combines childish and over-the-top humor with very crude and profane humor and delivers some really funny scenes. Where the film fails to deliver, however, is in anything remotely resembling a well developing plot. A anchorman is on top of the world, gets intimidated when his girlfriend becomes his co-anchor, gets fired for being an idiot, hits rock bottom, and then gets rehired after saving the day. There, that's the entire movie. The other 90 of the 94 minutes is the humor I was referring to. If you don't mind it, you'll find some laughs and probably find the film a worthwhile watch. If not, you'll likely wish you could get back that hour and a half. Personally, I find myself somewhere in the middle, but leaning more towards finding the laughs worthwhile. It's a good movie to watch and laugh at with friends, that's about it."

","Set during a period when men were men and women were ... just there, THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY looks at the lives of a crack local television news team headed by the eponymous hero (Will Ferrell). While spending their lives covering stories of astonishing banality, they believe they are the best at their various jobs: even Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who can barely string two words together without the aid of an autocue. Their lives are thrown into chaos with the arrival of Vanessa Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who proves herself much superior in terms of television technique, while remaining strangely impervious to the team's sexist (and cringingly obvious) attempts to get her into bed. The scenario here is a familiar one, reminiscent of SWITCHING CHANNELS (1988), or more famously HIS GIRL Friday (1941) in which the newsroom becomes the arena for an analysis of sexual politics. Both director Adam McKay and Ferrell (who co-wrote the script) are concerned to show limited the opportunities for women are in professions historically deemed ""male"" (such as the media). But the film never takes itself too seriously, with joke after joke piling on top of one another, both visual and verbal. As Burgundy, Ferrell is both repellent yet attractive; we understand how his personality is determined by his television image - nothing exists underneath. By the end, however, even he has dimly become aware of the importance of changing his world-view so that he and Vanessa can work together harmoniously in the future."

The man is, quite simply, as adept at this style of comedy as anyone ever has been, and his strong and silly performance, alongside a terrific supporting cast, have made Anchorman a classic in my mind. It has provided me and my friends more quotable lines and good times than any other Ferrell flick, and we typically enjoy them all. The upcoming sequel seems to me, at least, to be Ferrell's way of doing justice to what he believes to be his finest film.<br/><br/>Just as important to making the film work is the rest of the Channel 5 News Team. Brick, Champ and Brian are pivotal in playing off of each other, taking advantage of somewhat predictable quirks and eccentricities with skill. Paul Rudd quickly became a comedy/dramatic comedy staple at the box office, and his work here, alongside Steve Carrell's slow-but-sweet portrayal of weatherman Brick Tamlan and the underrated Champ Kind (played by the also underrated David Koechner) round out the film, give it an identity with memorable characters and classic scenes.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is stand-up as well, including Alicia Silverstone, who holds up strong as Ferrell's counterpart and vying anchorwoman Veronica Corningstone.

","A former girlfriend once introduced me to ANCHORMAN years ago, swearing it was the funniest movie ever. At the time, I wasn't impressed. It was the usual Will Ferrell routine: over-reactions, loudness, absurdity, and a lead character will an obnoxious level of self- confidence. I must have mentally blocked the movie because, for the longest time, I couldn't remember anything from the movie except ""I love lamp"" because I had friends who'd quote it. With a new ANCHORMAN movie on the horizon and my appreciation for Will Ferrell somehow growing (I actually enjoyed 2012's THE CAMPAIGN and CASA DE MI PADRE), I decided to give this movie another shot and I actually discovered that I wasn't as harsh on it this time around. It took a few more viewings but I'm almost starting to understand why this movie has such a fan base. ANCHORMAN is set in the world of broadcast news in the 1970s. Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the #1 anchorman in San Diego, a beloved celebrity at the top of his game with the support of his Channel 4 news team: Champ Kind (David Koechner), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The times are changing and diversity is the new hot topic, so the network decides to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) as part of the team. A woman in the world of network news doesn't sit well with the Channel 4 team and her arrival sends them into a frenzy, except for Burgundy who takes a shine to the new arrival.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ANCHORMAN is stupid. I'm not going to defend it in that regard, but I will argue that it's stupid/funny. It's certainly not the work of comedic genius my girlfriend had preached it to be, but I'd be lying if I didn't get some good laughs from it. In my opinion, Ferrell's best characters are always the same character. As an actor, he's got a little range but he's only really at his best when he is playing a character with an arrogant sense of confidence and a tendency to yell his lines incoherently when he's distraught. Burgundy is all of this at Ferrell's usual extreme. He's a decent character who actually seems to have a little humanity inside as he's the only one who is not only not threatened by Corningstone's initial arrival, he sees a beautiful woman that he has more than a passing interest in. Christina Applegate holds her own pretty well against the unstoppable force of Will Ferrell. Applegate plays Veronica as confident, talented, and passionate about her career; she is determined to break into the ""men-only"" world of network news and she's not going to let a couple mental lightweights stand in her way. But she's also sympathetic and not the usual 'stone-hearted feminist' you might expect to find filling this role in a comedy. But as well as Ferrell and Applegate do in ANCHORMAN, most of the best parts are the result of some excellent supporting cast.<br/><br/>Despite Ron Burgundy's name being prominently displayed in the title of the movie, the funniest bits don't come from Burgundy's personal struggles but from the interactions with the entire Channel 4 News Team and more-so when they are face-to-face with their rivals from the other networks. The WEST SIDE STORY gang fight sequence between the different news crews makes the whole movie worth watching and provides the movie with all it's best cameo appearances (that I won't spoil here in case the person reading my comments hasn't seen the movie). David Koechner is sports anchor Champ Kind, who is just an exaggerated version of Koechner's usual characters: loud and obnoxious, usually Southern. He's all right, though he always seems to play the same person. Rudd (who I'd totally forgotten was even in the movie) is man-on-the-street Brian Fantana. Rudd's always great. Even in movie's I can barely stomach, Rudd is generally great. Fantana's the team's sexed-up self-proclaimed ladies' manin his mind anyway. And Steve Carell is weatherman Brick Tamland, a perfect opportunity to showcase Carell's talents for saying completely off-the-wall dialogue with an absolute straight face. Brick is""special""and Carell never fails to elicit laughs. It's no surprise that some of the most funniest bits are from Carell (""Yeah, there were horses and a man on fire. And I killed a guy with a trident.""). I've seen this movie a few times now and I'm enjoying more and more each time. Actually, thinking back on it now is making me want to watch it again. After avoiding the movie for so long, I've come to understand why ANCHORMAN is one of Ferrell's most popular movies. It's so dumb, it's funny."

The mass fight of rival news crews. You get the disturbing feeling that the world of 1970s TV that Anchorman was parodying isn't too different from reality. The clothes. The sexism. The bizarre idol worship of newsreaders, who in reality just have to read an autocue and look good.

You have to pace and sustain the laughs carefully, and it is critical that the characters are entertaining. Having just stock characters telling jokes isn't going to cut it!<br/><br/>And so, the film has lots of great characters, especially Steve Carell as the low-intellect Brick, who says the most inappropriate things, well, pretty much all the time!<br/><br/>Lots of fun, and one of the best comedies I have ever seen.

","I found the movie to be very disappointing, mainly due to the lack of actual humor. There are some scenes that make you smile, maybe even laugh, but they're scarce.<br/><br/>Ferrel's acting is decent, though Applegate's acting is funny and smart.

","Will Ferrell just has a knack for making people laugh. Throughout his career he has been everything from the cowbell player of the Blue Oyster Cult to an elf to even Robert Goulet. In ""Anchorman,"" Ferrell plays pompous Ron Burgundy, a four-time Emmy winning news host in San Diego. Set in the wonderful 70's (and with a fantastic soundtrack to boot), Ron has to deal with the competition of other networks and if that wasn't enough a new female journalist (Christina Applegate as the sultry Veronica Corningstone).<br/><br/>Since there is a large sex barrier in the newsroom it is tough for Veronica to get a decent subject to report on, let alone do anything without being hit on by almost all of the her male counterparts.<br/><br/>As funny as Ferrell is as Burgundy, Steve Carell steals the spotlight with his performance of weatherman Brick Tamland, who has an IQ of 48 and refers to South Dakota as the ""Middle East."" The other members of the news team include Champ Kind (David Koechner) as a cowboy sports reporter and Paul Rudd as man on the street Brian Fantana.<br/><br/>While the movie's plot is outrageous at times, it has to be expected when you walk in the theater. The comedy more than makes up for the plot lapses and the tension between the rival news teams and the star cameos in the flick just add to the fun.<br/><br/>All in all ""Anchorman"" is a great light summer comedy that one just can't help but be entertained by.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy is the perfect retro movie that Starsky and Hutch aimed to be earlier this year. Some of the laughs for me were the sight gags involving the clothes,the hair,and the insane amount of smoking. Will Farrell once again, like him or loathe him and it's easy to fell both in this film,turns in another great comedic performance that solidifies his status as a leading man in Hollywood. Burgundy is the lead anchor at Channel 4 News in San Diego and is terrified when, of all things, a woman(Christina Applegate)named Veronica Corningstone is hired at the station to be a field reporter. Burgundy and his posse, consisting of Brian Fantana(played by Paul Rudd who I found to be absolutely hilarious as it was a nice change of pace from his normal good guy roles), Champ Kind(David Koechner), and Brick Tamland(Steve Carrell who once again steals the scenes as he did in Bruce Almighty) set out to destroy Miss Corningstone. Their plans are thwarted however when Burgundy falls madly in love with her. What ensues next is pure hilarity. Anchorman lets you know from the get-go that it is pure farce and nothing to take seriously. Just 91 minutes of extreme fun and silliness. Nice touch to see fellow ""Frat Pack"" members Vince Vaughn,Ben Stiller,Jack Black,and Luke Wilson as well as Tim Robbins turn up in a Gangs of New York themed street fight between rival stations. But the movie starts and ends with Farrell, who while being the biggest jerk in the movie, actually makes you root for him when he's down on his luck. I give it a 7 out of 10. Thanks for reading my review and ""Stay Classy!"""

","With the enormous publicity that 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' has received and with Will Ferrel being the next best thing to come out of Saturday Night Live, there is no way that this movie could be horrible in any shape or form.......or could it? The story line follows a dimwitted, egotistical anchorman for the San Diego news in the mists of the seventies, who begins to fall in love and feel threaten with the new anchor 'lady' that has joined the news team. It's a classic tale of two success power driven individuals who are striving for the big network anchorman position.<br/><br/>The plot line is farely weak and so is the performance of Will Ferrel and his crew. During the commercials the random bizarre words that comes out of Ron Burgundy's mouth seems laughable. Unfortunately that's all that happens during the rest of the movie. It seems as though the movie was a big inside joke that the audience was not apart of. <br/><br/>Although the highlights of the movie included the several cameo appearances and Applegates golden blond hair was very nice, it still fell short of being an all time classic in my movie collection. I'm not giving up on Will Ferrell, but it just seems that he does a better job as a co-star rather then the leading role of the movie."

","First off, don't get me wrong, I really like Will Ferrel, but this movie is lacking somewhere. When I heard about this movie I was really excited because the character seems to be one of those that Ferrel shines in. But after the credits rolled, the easter egg at the end had played, I got up from where I was sitting and thought that I'm glad i didn't pay full 7pm ticket prices. During the movie I found myself chuckling more than busting my gut, and when I saw the previews, I had it in my mind that I would be rolling on the floor with hilarity, it was a let down for me. I can link this movie with the that of Jack Black's School Of Rock, where I thought Jack Black was going to ROCK, but then I was taken into a world of intense energy, but not the comedy I had hoped from Black. Anchorman does have some good points, many of the ad-libs that Ferrel do are very very funny, I just wish the whole movie was that funny."

That is the only thing that needs to be said about ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" The movie tells the story of Ron Burgundy (played by Ferrell) who is a newscaster in 1970's San Diego. He is the king of the news world and suddenly finds himself competing with his new female co-anchor Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).<br/><br/>The first half of the film is filled with hilarious moments by Ferrell and company. Will Ferrell does a fantastic job and I am eagerly awaiting the day that he turns his sights to dramatic portrayals a la Tom Hanks or Jim Carrey. Ferrell was funny in ""Old School,"" but in ""Anchorman"" he is hilarious. There are so many moments that I couldn't control myself. As far as Christina Applegate is concerned, she was alright. She was funny but couldn't seem to keep up with Will Ferrell. <br/><br/>Ron Burgundy is the leader of a newscast team. The other members are Brian Fanatana (Paul Rudd), Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), and Champ Kind (David Koechner). Their antics are all pretty much hit or miss. Steve Carell, however, hit the most. He had quite a few hilarious moments and really seemed to enjoy the character. Paul Rudd and David Koechner, unfortunately, were forgettable. <br/><br/>After the first half, the film kind of drifts off into a series of fairly ridiculous sequences that I found to be too over-the-top. There are a few surprising cameos that I will not spoil for you. If you can get past the brand of humor employed in the second half then you will be sure to find the charm that graced the first half. Overall I give this movie ***. It is Will Ferrell at his best and his fans will not be disappointed."

","Saw a sneak preview of this last night and there were quite a few laugh out loud moments. But even when there was a lull in the story, Will Ferrell's delivery of a line or a look on his face still brought out a laugh. I'm from Chicago, so it was great to hear Bill Kurtis, one of our 1970's Anchormen as the narrator of the film. Glad to see Adam McKay, who wrote some of Will's best SNL sketches, stretching out into feature films. I was a fan of their short film The Heat is On (about Ben Stiller's one night stand with Glenn Frey) and I was expecting much of the same bizarro humor--the film doesn't not fail to deliver on that end. The cameos are great--look especially for the scene of a street gang rumble between the various networks. Overall, Old School is the funniest of Ferrell's movies thus far, but you will have a good time."

And, when you think about it, that's not a bad way to spend 90 minutes, is it?<br/><br/>The film tells the tale of Burgundy (Ferrell) a vain, ridiculous, fictional San Diego television news personality in 1976 who's tops in the local ratings and presumably based on 70s anchor Harold Green. A billboard says it all: 'If Ron Burgundy says it - it's true.'<br/><br/>He leads a pompous, sexist group consisting of goofy sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), sleazy Geraldo Rivera-like, Brain Fantana (Paul Rudd), and moronic weatherman, Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), who rebel against the station's manager, Ed Harkin (Fred Willard) when a beautiful woman, Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) is brought in for diversity's sake.<br/><br/>Burgundy thinks diversity means an old, wooden Civil War ship, but soon falls for the blonde, curvacious former star of ""Married With Children"" - really hard.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a run-in with a burrito, Jack Black on a motorcycle and Burgundy's pet pooch on the Coronado Bridge changes the newsman's life - for the worst. With Corningstone's star on the rise and Burgundy in decline, he falls into a three-month drunken stupor (on milk, no less) before an opportunity comes along to change his fortunes.<br/><br/>Like his previous turns in ""Old School"" and ""Elf,"" as well as most of his characters on ""Saturday Night Live,"" Ferrell is hilarious in his addled simplicity and gives a very good comedic performance capturing the misogyny and ignorance of many 1970s male chauvinist pseudo-celebrities, especially those who populated local TV and radio stations.<br/><br/>The silliness of the wild leisure suits, white shoes, overstarched hair, sideburns and mustaches is only matched by the gang fight scene in which Burgundy's group goes up against the likes of other newsmen, including Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and, of all people, Tim Robbins. <br/><br/>It's totally inane, but it's a laugh riot."

Most - if not all - have yet to make it across the pond here.<br/><br/>But the basic premise I was familiar with nonetheless. Local news set up, all guys, an anchorman, sports reader, reporter & weatherman. Unfortunately that was where my recognition ended. None of the 4 characters bared even a semblance of a familiarity to anything I had ever encountered on local news, so I've not idea what they were spoofing or taking off.<br/><br/>They are 4 of the least likable characters in film history. Three of them do not have a single amusing line in the film, the weather guy has a few but by then you are so bored you've forgotten how to smile.<br/><br/>The was a tiny bit of promise in the film when the girl arrived & had no interest in any of the 4 fellers. That tiny glimmer of hope of an interesting film went when she fell for Ron - A man who had absolutely nothing going for him to offer a woman, and quite how the pair were intended as a convincing match is beyond me.<br/><br/>The two main scenes went way over my head. Neither the big fight scene nor the finale at the zoo, offered anything remotely funny or even slightly interesting.<br/><br/>I'd like to put this down to yet another example of the big differences in humour either side of the Atlantic (responsible for the likes of Jim Carrey, Ben Stiller & Adam Sandler all being considered comedians, but even allowing for that I'm surprised anyone found anything funny in this.<br/><br/>I too watched this on a plane to L.A & unfortunately, someone else just below has used my gag about wishing I walked out.<br/><br/>A very low 2/10 (that's being generous for the weatherman having a couple of scenes that could just about -at a stretch- fall into the humour bracket."

","""Anchorman"" is stupid, sexist and sleazy. And it has a lot of other great things going for it, too. Will Ferrell is a comedy genius, but he has never had the chance to realize his true potential on screen before this, a deftly-realized no-holds-barred laughfest that may well be the best thing in cinematic silliness since ""Airplane.""<br/><br/>Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, anchorman for a San Diego local news program circa the 1970s, who finds his position and his masculinity challenged when newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) breaks the glass ceiling to become his co-anchor. As sportscaster and Burgundy buddy Champ Kind (David Koechner) complains, ""It's anchorMAN, not anchorLADY, and that's a scientific fact!""<br/><br/>Koechner and Applegate are both terrific, part of a stellar supporting cast that includes Fred Willard as the station manager, Paul Rudd as a roving reporter whose idea of wooing females involves a pungent black-market cologne called ""Sex Panther,"" and Steve Carell as a brain-dead weatherman who hangs with the boys without understanding much of anything. He even has to be coached by Corningstone when he tries to make a lewd come-on. ""Would you like to come to the pants party?"" ""Are you trying to tell me there's a party in your pants, and I'm invited?""<br/><br/>There's many ruder moments, like Ron's hair-trigger reaction to Veronica's acceptance of his date, which some of us will laugh at more than others. But it's hard to imagine people getting genuinely upset with a film as goofy as this. Nothing happens quite as one expects in a script written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Like when Burgundy takes Corningstone to a bar and impresses her by playing jazz flute. Or when, during an intimate moment together, Ron and Veronica are joined by a cartoon panda (bears and pandas are a recurring motif in ""Anchorman,"" for some reason.)<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is Ferrell, who plays Burgundy like a polyester, Scotch-soaked combination of James Lipton and Robert Goulet, clearly channeling the late Ted Knight in his Ted Baxter role. He's a man in love with himself, embarrassingly unaware, yet somehow endearing. When he makes love to a woman, he declares: ""I'm storming your castle on my steed, m'lady."" When he falls out with later on, he asks her to go back to her home on Whore Island. That and throws her into a typewriter when she insults his hair.<br/><br/>There's a couple of sequences that don't work, though other people like them. One is when Burgundy and his buddies break into song, specifically ""Afternoon Delight,"" which slows things down and doesn't really add to the '70s ambiance which is otherwise kept subtle and on-target (like with an opening pool party that cleverly quotes from ""Boogie Nights"" without calling attention to itself.)<br/><br/>The other is a big brawl featuring several rival news teams, which swiftly escalates into something out of ""Gladiator."" This is a sequence a lot of other people like about this movie, but again for me it goes on too long and is too strained. At least it gets out of the way the obligatory Ferrell-film cameos from Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Anchorman"" is a comedy that 100 percent of the time works 90 percent of the time. There's a lot of great lines in this film people will throw at each other around the water coolers, but it also holds together from beginning to end, a rare achievement for films like this. Every time I watch it, there's something else I like best. Right now, what's coolest about this movie may be the fact we get to hear real TV newsman Bill Kurtis tell us: ""Ron Burgundy was the balls."" That goes double, or quadruple, for ""Anchorman."""

The film's writer was born in 1968 and apparently did little research on the subject. After all, that would make him only about 5 years old at the time he is attempting to re-create. That would be okay if he had substituted research for experience. However, in an interview on the DVD, the writer alludes to the movie's premise being based on the late TV newswoman Jessica Savitch coming to anchor in Philadelphia and the way the male news team went nuts over it. She had already been a success in Texas and was generally well accepted at KYW in Philadelphia. In fact, by the early 1970s, women in TV were more than a novelty. In Philadelphia, where the writer was born, two women - Marciarose and Trudy Haynes - were already well established at that same station for several years by the time Savitch got there - and Haynes was black. <br/><br/>What's more, women on network TV news had already become fairly commonplace - including Pauline Fredericks, Nancy Dickerson, and Barbara Walters - among many others. <br/><br/>However, all that being said - the idea that a particularly dumb male news team may possibly feel threatened by a new female on-air personality might have some comedic potential.

As a native San Diegan, I remember local newscasters like Burgandy from when I was a kid. I also remember how big that stupid panda bear story was and how long it dragged on. But insider San Diego jokes aside, Anchorman is a definite must for fans of Will.

(One wonders, however, how a show like ""That '70's Show"" can be so popular when it's supposedly based nothing but 70's attitudes and stereotypes from a particular decade in America.) On the other hand, ""Boogie Nights"" worked well because it wasn't purely about being funny; it had enough tragedy mixed in to engage the viewer.<br/><br/>Ferrall is extremely talented and funny but as is the problem with casting comics is that most often they are used to pump up weak concept and the comic's ego is usually so big that they end up telling the director what to do or both."

","Will Farrell is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedians. As much as I liked his work on Saturday Night Live, it is on the big screen where he truly belongs. His work in Old School and Elf prove that he is very much capable of making the leap from television to motion picture projects. I can now add Anchorman to that list. Anchorman is completely stupid and rather predictable, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud several times throughout. Farrell is the man of the hour here, but he is supported by some truly inspired performances, notably Steve Carell. Add in some great celebrity cameos, and you have perhaps the year's funniest movie thus far. I didn't know quite what to expect going in, but Farrell and his news team delivered."
"Quinoa1984","8","2","5","12 July 2004"," one of the funniest (albeit stupidest) films of the year
","Anchorman is a film that would hardly merit itself to be taken too seriously, so as a full-on, joke-a-minute spoof, it works a lot better. Ferrell plays the title character of Ron Burgendy, as a man who will read anything on the teleprompter, and is a (in his mind) ladies man to boot. Enter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate, in her best role since her Married with Children days), who is assigned to the local news station - soon as a co-anchor - which throws off what these 70's news people (including a great, dimwit role for Steve Correll) are used to. This leads forth into a pretty general story-line for a comedy of this sort, yet a story is the last thing to think about here.<br/><br/>Like the recent Dodgeball, Anchorman is superb at doing one thing above all, which is supplying a joke practically every thirty seconds, if not more. There are many scenes that also go down as near comic gems, some of which I would dare not spoil here. However, the film gets a boost from not only Ferrell- who gets laughs by almost anything (including gibberish and mad screaming in some scenes)- but from totally un-expected and worthy cameos. I wouldn't say Anchorman is for everyone (in general, art-film buffs, Shakespeare geeks, and character study phobes might want to steer clear), but perhaps its finest feat is that it's like one long SNL skit - and a skit that surprisingly works a helluva lot better than could be imagined from the trailer. Oh- if you do see it, stay through the credits (as Ferrell's character on SNL, James Lipton, said ""It's a delight"")!"
"mattberry05","10","2","5","15 July 2004"," Best comedy since Airplane!
","I saw this opening night, at a theater where middle schoolers come to socialize, not watch movies. I braved the crowd hoping for a performance from Will Ferrell as good as in ""Elf."" I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Ferrell is at his comedic pinnacle in ""Anchorman,"" but he is not the only bright spot (we'll get back to him later). Christina Applegate shines in her role as Veronica Corningstone, the sexy newcomer to the San Diego news scene, much to the chagrin of her new co-workers. Paul Rudd is adequate in a smaller role than expected (not to discredit him, he was just surrounded by comic gold). David Koechner also performs well, which could prompt people to think ""That guy was on SNL? When? Did I miss something?""<br/><br/>But the show-stopper was Steve Carrell. The Daily Show alum got his first real taste of the big screen in Bruce Almighty, but in Anchorman he displays perfect comedic timing as Brick Tamland, the weatherman who later finds out that he has an IQ of 48 (luckily, we are told this in the first ten minutes so that his role makes sense). Throughout the film, we are reminded of this by countless moments of innocent stupidity, a difficult thing to portray. Carrell pulled it off and added at least 20 great laughs along the way.<br/><br/>Now, to the main event: Mr. Ferrell. The ads for this movie misrepresent who Ron Burgundy is. They make him seem shallow, dumb, callous, unkind, and downright annoying. That might be because I saw only a few shots in the movie that were actually in the ads. Ferrell's Burgundy is somewhat self-absorbed, but for that matter so is Veronica. Remember, this was the Me Decade. Ferrell does have moments of his standard comic styling (odd lines, sometimes screamed while in an odd situation), but this character is entirely different than Old School's Frank the Tank or Elf's Buddy. It has the feeling that this man really existed, has horrifying as that may seem.<br/><br/>At times, Anchorman goes into fantastical scenarios, but I felt later that they were all done in a way that reminded me very much of a Monty Python skit that was made for a broader audience. <br/><br/>Whether or not Anchorman is a great movie or not, one thing is certain. You will laugh. Hard. You might have to watch it twice to get all the things you missed. I know I will.<br/><br/>So, for all these reasons and more, I consider it the greatest comedy since Airplane! and it is also on my Top 10 List of All Time, which is, to give you a bearing of my tastes:<br/><br/>1. Lord of the Rings (all of em) 2. Pulp Fiction 3. Indiana Jones (3, then 1, then 2) 4. As Good As it Gets 5. Kill Bill 6. The Godfather 7. Snatch 8. Anchorman 9. Reservoir Dogs 10. Big Fish<br/><br/>These are not my picks for the greatest ever, just my favorites."

","I'm tired of reading so called ""professional"" critics saying a movie is great & then going to see it & finding they stink. Who is paying these critics? Definitely not the newspapers they work for.<br/><br/>I went to this film thinking ""I love Will Ferrell"" It has to be funny. Boy was I wrong. From beginning to end it was painful. The script was no where near the talent Will is capable of producing. The jokes were anything but. The acting was okay but a little over the top. I was really looking forward to this & was very disappointed. The only redeeming parts of the film were the dog & the cameos.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money."
"oneguyrambling","4","3","10","30 October 2010"," A moment of silence please for the death of real comedy
","Will Ferrell has made an undeserved career using opposite humour, it's a simple formula:<br/><br/><ul><li>If everyone acts normal, act zany. - If everyone is reserved, be irrational. - If everyone is hysterical, be ignorant and placid. - If everyone is smart, act bone numbingly stupid. - If all else fails, spout carefully thought out ""improvisations"" that involve generally religious sounding stuff alongside generally female genitalia.</li></ul><br/><br/>(Also, be earnest and over-serious when the situation doesn't deserve it and take your clothes off when everyone is clad.)<br/><br/>In this case the writer (Will Ferrell – unbelievable isn't it?) starts his script by first thinking ""Where wouldn't you expect Will Ferrell to show up?""<br/><br/>A basketball player? A Nascar racer? An ice skater? A gopher breeder?<br/><br/>A newscaster? <br/><br/>In this case yes. Only then do they decide to consider other plot elements, and watching this film that part didn't take too long, as the rest of the plot is largely pointless.<br/><br/>Right Will Ferrell is a newsman, let's cast a bunch of other vaguely funny (and some unfunny) guys in supporting roles and even more as cameos and we have a film here. <br/><br/>Give them all silly names and cue the wacky improvisation. I lasted 4 minutes into re-watching this film before I checked how long was left.<br/><br/>Ron Burgundy is a legendary newscaster and everyone loves him. How do we know this? Because we are told so at the start of the film, it's an easy and lazy way to make a character appear great and important without actually showing him doing something that proves it, just tell the audience. (And if they are lazy enough it'll work.)<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes introduces the characters and their great lives as newsmen, it includes a talking kid (which I hate), and an apparently hi-lar-ious joke where some idiot excreted a squirrel, which is only topped when another guy claimed to have eaten the squirrel.<br/><br/>Hi.<br/><br/>Lar.<br/><br/>Ious.<br/><br/>The basic point of the script is how a bunch of guys react to a woman being introduced into a key role in what was previously a man's world. That's it, if the writers didn't waste their time expanding beyond this flimsy premise I don't see why I should.<br/><br/>I laughed for the first time about 20 minutes in after a joke about cologne, here is the joke: ""60% of the time it works every time."" Only one minute later the joke is effectively erased by an even more powerful anti-joke. The cologne is so potent and foul smelling that it clears the room and a woman screams ""It smells like Bigfoot's d**k."" <br/><br/>Oh boy that's good stuff.<br/><br/>I laughed again about 50 minutes in when a motorcyclist (it was Jack Black but that is irrelevant) picks up a dog and says ""Now this is happening"" as he kicks the dog off a bridge. This movie is so bad it even made unnecessary cruelty to animals more funny than it should be, I just wish they kicked Ferrell off.<br/><br/>The only good scene is the gang war between 4 different news teams, and even that only because of the stupidity of the scene. The only thing that is pleasingly stupid.<br/><br/>I normally like Paul Rudd in these screwball comedies, I loved him in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and even ""Role Models"". He seems to go just far enough into adlibbing without going overboard and treads the line between going for the joke and advancing the plot just enough. <br/><br/>I think of Steve Carell in much the same way, and even though he doesn't do much he is by far the best thing in this movie, Rudd unfortunately adds nothing.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell actually has no off-switch, which I guess is why he is so revered by many. There is no joke he won't go for, even when it must seem obvious to all that the joke sucks, his shtick works as a 4th banana in stuff like Zoolander, but I have never understood why him being an idiot for 90 minutes justified a movie.<br/><br/>The only guy worse than Ferrell in this is the guy who plays Champ Kind, the sports guy. I hate this guy, I have never laughed at anything he has done or said and I gag whenever I see him pop up again in any role in any film. He is not funny. He has never been funny. He will never be funny. I hate him. In an ideal world he never appears in another film.<br/><br/>When the best aspect of the film is the costume, hair and music, there ain't much going for it. I think most of the actors put on the wigs and 70's clothes and thought they were half way there already.<br/><br/>The finale sucks, 95% off the jokes aren't funny, Christina Applegate tries to play straight but even she occasionally stoops to sub-par ""Whose line is it anyway?"" rubbish.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 3 / 10. For a movie which is a supposed comedy to be this unfunny is just wrong. Three laughs in 90 minutes doesn't offset the 95 jokes that died on screen.

"bob the moo","Null","2","6","26 September 2004"," A silly but funny collection of sketches featuring the character of Burgundy (with a vague narrative in there somewhere)  some miss but most hit
","Before the years of cable, the local news station was the main place people got their news and, because of that, the news anchorman was king. In San Diego, the number one anchorman was Ron Burgundy. Every inch the 70's man, Ron is on the top of his game, partying and getting the ladies with his all-male news team. However things are changing and a woman is brought in to bring diversity to the channel 4 team. Unable to bed her and move on, Ron becomes fascinated with Veronica to the point where he begins to love her. However when Veronica makes it clear that her ambition is to one day be an anchor. Will their competition get in the way of Ron's first ever feeling of love?<br/><br/>After enjoying the silly humour of Dodgeball, I decided (along with an audience of 8 others) to give Anchorman a go. Immediately the film sets out its stall with a serious, very seventies narration that puts us right in the world of the Anchorman. After a few scenes out 'plot' is presented to us in the form of Ron initial rebuttal by Veronica; from this point on the film follows the vague flow of their competition and their romance  however to call it a plot is to be rather too kind to it. Instead the film is best viewed as a collection of sketches featuring one character, all strung together with one vague theme. This is because the funniest bits of the film are often the bits that are very imaginative and off the wall where often it is the actual story that creates the misses and the periods where I wasn't laughing a great deal.<br/><br/>Of course, many people will know before they see it if they will like it or not, because the cast have done so many films recently it is easy to get a handle on their sense of humour. For my money I like it and I enjoyed the film even if I did feel that it didn't have much of a story and had quite a few segments that just didn't work as well as the majority. The imaginatively silly script is great fun and gave me plenty of good laughs whether in the form of silly entire sequences (the anchor rumble) or just the silly characters all around the place. Of these, some are poorly judged and are silly without being funny (Champ) but mostly they get the mix just right (Brick is spot on). The manic humour mostly hits though  and even spills over into the end credits where a 'Smokey & The Bandit 2' moment had me laughing due to its sheer unexpected nature.<br/><br/>The cast is deep and are a major part of the film winning  everyone is pretty much 'on' and covers the fact that the central narrative is nowhere near good enough on its own. Ferrell is as funny as ever, but his character is an one-note deal and, even if he plays it well (which he does) it isn't enough to fill a film. So thank goodness then for a support cast that features inspired lunacy in both the cameos and the main cast. Koechner is a bit boring, while Rudd is simple but still fun in some ways but it is Carell who pretty much gets the biggest laugh every time he does anything. Applegate plays it pretty straight but also gets some laughs  she is always eclipsed by those around her but she did good work anyway. The cameos come thick and fast and, although they could have been distracting but actually they all work pretty well. As ever Vaughn, Stiller and Wilson all show up and are good but the cameos also include good turns from Black, Robbins, Pyle, Trejo and a funny dog.<br/><br/>The film contains scenes of rather surprising animal cruelty and also violence to women but, while this may rightly be a major issue for some viewers I was laughing at the time and chose to take it all in the spirit it was intended. Overall the film is very funny in a very manic way but some will not like the misses that mostly come from a poorly developed story. When it is funny it will take you by surprise and make you laugh hard but when it misses it does so in a very obvious manner. Mostly though this is a very funny film  but come prepared for a story so bitty that this could have been called 'Anchorman: The Best of Ron Burgundy'."
"grantss","8","1","2","25 March 2017"," Hilariously funny and wonderfully unPC
","San Diego, 1970s. Ron Burgundy is an anchorman at a local TV news station. He is very popular and a local celebrity. His news segment is Number 1 across all demographics and things are going incredibly well. However, his news team is entirely male and resembles a boys club. In the interests of diversity the station brings in a female reporter, Veronica Corningstone. While the remainder of the team are appalled at the decision, Ron is torn between a similar misogynism and his attraction to her. Initially Ron and Veronica do well, and an intimate relationship forms. However, an event splits them apart, resulting in a bitter feud between the two.<br/><br/>Hilariously funny, often in a clever and/or over-the-top sort of way. Some fantastic lines and scenes, many of which have the entered the one-liner lexicon and/or meme hall of fame. Wonderfully politically incorrect, and sure to offend the types who choose to find things to be offended by. Joke's on them: these jokes and stereotypes are satirical...<br/><br/>Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate are great in the lead roles. Well supported by Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and David Koechner. Favourite performance, for me, is from Fred Willard as Ed Harken. Faultless, understated delivery.<br/><br/>The lesser supporting roles contain some amazing names, some of whom weren't stars at the time: Chris Parnell, Vince Vaughan, Fred Armisen, Seth Rogen, Danny Trejo, Tim Robbins, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson.<br/><br/>A modern comedy classic."
"zkonedog","10","1","2","11 March 2017"," The Most Quotable Comedy Ever
","If the mark of a tremendous comedy is the ability to leave the audience quoting its funniest lines long after the end credits roll, than ""Anchorman"" is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces ever produced.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Anchorman"" is set in the 1970s TV news business, where anchormen rule the roost and women are not given the time of day. As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through. That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces. Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.<br/><br/>Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the ""sidekick"" role. In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay. ""Brick Tamland"" provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.<br/><br/>Overall, I consider ""Anchorman"" to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce. There are no intensely sexual, bodily secretion, or otherwise gross-out jokes in this film. Just well thought-out and well-acted humor for the duration."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","2","8 March 2016"," There was Rhett Butler, Rick Blaine, Rocky Balboa, Raymond Babbit and now: Ron Burgundy...
","Every once in a while, a movie character suddenly pops out and becomes an icon despite the limited chronology of his existence. Maybe not 'Forrest Gump' or 'General Maximus' instant icon but something in the same vein than Otto from ""A Fish Called Wanda"" or Spinal Tap. His name is Ron Burgundy, he's San Diego top-local anchorman, he's tall, nicely built, handsome in a funny way, and wear bright-colored suit that so scream 70's... what do you know, this is when the film is set: good old 70's when TV was the king media.<br/><br/>And Will Ferrell is the king of all kings, a man at the pinnacle of his career, charm and self-confidence. And he just doesn't throne over San Diego, where he's religiously followed by all San Dieg whatever you call them, but he's also the Captain of his winning league, the team work including sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner) whose cowboy hat tactfully hides a face-ruining baldness, and makes him look like one of Biff Tannen's sidekicks. There's also Brian Fentana, the news reporter, played by Paul Rudd, the only mustache to compete with Ron's. And there is Steve Carrel as the intellectually challenged Brick, the weatherman.<br/><br/>If Brick is here to provide the obligatory 'non sequitur' lines (and by obligatory, I don't mean they don't work), the two other sidekicks are like Burgundy's clones with something lacking. What exactly? Well, since Burgundy doesn't strike as the brightest bulb in the box, let's say he's the most confident over his talent or maybe he's the best prompter reader (which will cause him a few troubles). So we meet Ron when he's at the top, and since he can't get higher than that, we expect a little intrusion in his dream-team. His boss, played by Fred Willard, decides to add some diversity and hires a new reporter, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) which, as her name clearly indicates, is a woman. The blasphemy! The tragedy!<br/><br/>That the team is baffled by her entrance is a gag by itself, and a source of great ones, although the film is set in the 70's, it's strange to see it populated by guys who still believe men should drag their women by the hair. You think I'm exaggerating? Just watch the scene where Ron is courting the beautiful Veronica and just think whether a caveman wouldn't have come up with a better rhapsody. Still, it works by making Ron grotesquely touching. ""The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a film that, on the surface, looks very misogynistic and mean-spirited but even the most hardcore feminism can't overlook the fact that the film makes fun of these men's misogyny more than anything, and actually, it is what drives the whole narrative of the film, it's all in the conflict between Veronica and Ron.<br/><br/>But the film doesn't go for simplistic and predictable plot devices, the first pleasant surprise is that Burgundy actually puts the Ron in Veronica, they fall in love and she asks him to keep their relationship private. Guess what he does next? He screams it all over the office, and as if it wasn't enough, he shares the secret with his viewers. After all, isn't San Diego's voice of truth entitled to speak the truth? So if Ron says that he loves Veronica and she's got a nice rack, well, within his own wicked and macho sense of humor, it's still true. That's the secret of great comedic characters, they're consistent yet unpredictable, and on that level, Burgundy reminds me of Borat, another great mustached comical character of the 2000's.<br/><br/>I also mention Borat because he comes from a mockumentary and you get similar vibes from the film, with all these weird reports on pet contests and other local news items so trivial you wonder why they were taken so seriously. Well, the content might make you laugh, but it is true that these people, as eccentric as they were, existed and they were as passionate and loving their jobs as Burgundy. And Burgundy, through his childish insistence on keeping things under control, is like Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"", the worst director ever, but a great guy who loved his job more than anything, and had fun doing it, and that's the key of Burgundy's likability, and Ferrell's performance.<br/><br/>Indeed, when an actor has fun playing a character, it shows on the screen, and you can tell the whole cast had fun, even the guys who played Burgundy's archenemies obviously, those who are below on Nielsen ratings, and perhaps the highest ratios of cameos per minute, one that makes the early 2000's almost as old as the 70's. I must say I cringed a little when the arena fight went over the top, I wasn't sure the film followed the right path, but then it had the perfect punch-line, with the great ""Wow, that escalated quickly"", which became a meme to describe a situation going ridiculously out of control. When a so-so scene ends with the most memorable line, it becomes a great scene.<br/><br/>And the movie is full of many many others, and many touching ones, too. It was directed by Adam McKay, who just won an Oscar for his dense and entertaining ""Big Short"" screenplay, a mix of comedy and drama to explain the financial crisis. In ""Burgundy"", retrospectively, you have hints of his promising talent in the way he tackles the reality of journalism world with a comedic tone, for once that the caricature doesn't serve to hide some ugly truth. And when the present is so ugly and scary, news-wise, an outdated weirdo like Ron Burgundy is a pure delight."

Steve Carell's, Mentally Reatarded Brick, is so dumb it makes him hilarious and everything he says is pure comic gold. Anchorman takes place in a time in which men ruled and women were finally fighting back. Unfortunately, it appears as if they had jumped the gun in montages.

Will Ferrell is terrible, as usual, and Steve Carrell, though he has some talent, was used for a ridiculous and entirely unbelievable character.<br/><br/>The characterisation is virtually non-existent, with none of the characters passing above ludicrous caricature at any point.

The basics are still more or less the same: thin, largely inconsequential plot line, one-dimensional characters, non-sequiturs, gay jokes, and half-baked social satire. Steve Carell dominates every scene he's in as the slightly challenged reporter Brick. Though the plot, as I said, is impossible to care very much about, the film never bores thanks to an endless onslaught of dumb jokes and a great cast. Ferrell, Koechner, Carell and the incomparable Paul Rudd are perfect as a quartet of misogynist, homophobic news reporters whose lives are turned up-side-down when an ambitious woman (gasp!), played by Christina Applegate, starts working at their office.<br/><br/>Some might say that the social satire doesn't work, but I think that in a time when page after page in newspapers are devoted to the likes of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, the notion that a pregnant panda becomes a huge national event doesn't seem so absurd. Overall very entertaining in a ""I think I just got substantially dumber"" kind of way. If the steady stream of gags don't do it for you, there's always the virtual marathon of cameos to enjoy: Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo, Vince Vaughn, Fred Willard, Missi Pyle, Seth Rogen, the list goes on. 60% of the time, you'll like this movie 100% of the time."

","I'm not sure if I can believe that this film is based on real events, but it doesn't matter, it is a great satirical slapstick comedy. Basically Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell, also writing) in San Diego's top rated and award-winning news anchorman in the male dominated broadcasting world of the 1970's. This is soon to change though with the arrival of newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), who at first he falls for and is not worried about in the slightest. It is when she is revealed as the new co-anchor that Ron instantly knows her real intentions for power. Ron's news team, on location reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner) have their concerns too. When Veronica makes him Ron read a swear word live on air he is almost immediately fired, and it is only when Veronica is on location for the birth of a big story and in danger that Ron is brought back, and everything is settled eventually. Also starring Fred Willard as Ed Harken, Chris Parnell as Garth Holliday, Kathryn Hahn as Helen, Fred Armisen as Tino, Seth Rogen as Eager Cameraman, with appearances by Danny Trejo as Bartender, Luke Wilson as Frank Vitchard, Ben Stiller as Arturo Mendes, Jack Black as Motorcyclist, Missi Pyle as Zoo Keeper, Tim Robbins as Public TV News Anchor, Jerry Stiller (Ben's father) as Man in Bar and Vince Vaughn as Wes Mantooth. The film is well casted, and the spoken and performed jokes are all well done, it is a good fun comedy. Good!"

","The funny thing about Israeli theaters is that they're quite problematic when it comes to Will Ferrell. Since most of the population here is Jewish, a Christmas fare like Elf skipped our theaters; our men prefer Soccer over Football so Kicking & Screaming went straight to DVD as well, and we don't have colleges (we have universities instead; which we usually attend after serving 3 years in the army) so you imagine where I saw Old School. Thank god we at least have Blockbuster to help us catch up on that ever so delighting Ferrell flare.<br/><br/>Back to topic, this 1970's set film about the intrigue and innuendo set in the chauvinist world of Anchormen is a completer riot every true comedy lover owes himself. I guess I loved it most because it brings up important themes in a humoristic manner, and because it deals with my profession (journalism). But then again, you can't ignore those hilarious one-liners (""I'm Ron Burgundy?""; ""I love carpet""), and the mega-celeb fight scene with Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Judd Apattow."

His performance is in my opinion the funniest in the whole of the film. The way he speaks, walks and knows nothing that is going on makes me laugh. In one scene, there are a few arguing, and he joins in and shouts that he does not know what the people are shouting about. In another, he reports weather and names Michigan the Middle East.

","Will Ferrell. I have never met a single person, male or female, who has been indifferent to him. Either you love him or you hate him. And, as much as I hate to say it, it is the same situation for this film: either you love it or you hate it. I happen to be the former. This film reeks of funny. From the title, itself a mockery of a film about porn actor Ron Jeremy, to the bloopers that run during the closing credits, this flick doesn't let up.<br/><br/>I'm in the entertainment business. And, while not everything I attempt to do is entertaining, I do understand what it takes to entertain, and this film has just that. You see, sometimes the funniest part of life is its absurdity/absurdities. And just about everything in Anchorman is absurd. And hilarious. Will Ferrell is the caricature of at least one person that everyone in the broadcast industry has known at one time or another. Paul Rudd perfectly embodies that sad guy who wants and tries so desperately to be cool that he ultimately just has to latch on to someone who is cool in order to be cool. David Koechner. His character, Champ, has issues. Let's leave it at that. And Brick? Well, it's obvious that Steve Carell is one of the top comedic geniuses of our time. His timing is impeccable, his performance is hysterical. And it's all within the realm and scope of the film's limits. Which are stringent and very loose. Christina Applegate, Fred Willard, and the cast of thousands of un-billed celebrity cameos all added to the fun.<br/><br/>And what I've found to be the biggest either selling point or turnoff, depending on whether you loved it or hated it, respectively, is that most of the film is a big inside joke. It's all a dig at broadcasting. The quirks that everyone exhibit (Ron's dependence on the teleprompter and his vocal warm-ups; Brian's over-the-top, I'm-gonna-make-everything-bigger-than-it-really-is attitude; Champ's catch-phrase, ""Whammy!""; Brick's quaint nicknames for areas of the country) are all done in jest toward members of the broadcasting community. If you're a broadcaster, and you saw this film, then you loved it. I'm willing to bet money on it (well, if I had any).<br/><br/>Adam McKay, this being his debut, does a good job at being the kind of director that actors love. He's a director that lets you go to the edge of what is possible for a scene, look over that edge, dangle your legs over it, fish off of it, then let you find your way back again. Yet all the while he knows what he wants and is determined to fashion his film out of what he's given by the genius he has working for him. In short: McKay does a good job for his first time out.<br/><br/>Outrageous? Yes. Irreverent? You bet. Coy? Most certainly. Funny? You'd better believe it. To borrow a phrase (sort of): If you don't think this is the funniest film ever, then I will fight you."

","Going by the trailers, I expected this film to be more satirical and less stupid than it is. It's still pretty funny, especially to someone who lived in the San Diego area for more than 30 years. I think that people in the TV news business must bust a gut watching Anchorman, as the stereotyped characters really do exist. I really got a laugh out of all the uncredited cameos (see below), especially Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller. I didn't know that Tony Dow or Missi Pyle was in it until I read the IMDb credits. This movie is certainly longer than it needs to be, but it's reasonably amusing, and I got a couple of belly laughs out of it.

"Anonymous_Maxine","5","1","2","27 January 2005"," I agree with Vince Vaughn.
","I finally got around to watching Anchorman last night, one of the most popular and, as it turns out, overrated comedies released in 2004. I was just on vacation for 6 weeks and while I was away I watched lots of classic comedies, from Buster Keaton, the Three Stooges, and a few Shirley Temple shorts, and it seems that contemporary comedies have not learned anything from their ancestors. Buster Keaton remains untarnished in my mind, but the Three Stooges and Shirley Temple have both starred in films that are distantly below their talent level, but which continue to receive praise simply because they are early Three Stooges or Shirley Temple films.<br/><br/>As is also the case with some of their films (such as The Brideless Groom for the Three Stooges and Shirley Temple's awful War Babies, among a few others), Anchorman's creative growth seems to have stopped when Will Farrell signed on. Much stock is put into him in the lead role, and none into the content of the movie. There are times when the movie is very funny, but these times are to say the least outweighed by the stupidity in it, which is odd because the character whose role is stupidity is the funniest character in the film (""Mmmm! I just burned my tongue!""). Far more amusing than Will Farrell, from whom I have come to expect better than this. I have to say that I long for a comedy without poop jokes.<br/><br/>Christina Applegate is wildly miscast as the new Anchorwoman, an oxymoron is anyone at the news team has ever seen one, Veronica Corningstone, a respectable woman except that she occasionally transforms into stupid comedy fodder. We are introduced to a highly professional, well-dressed, intellectual newswoman with goals to become network anchor. Veronica summarily rejects the pitiful, frat-boy come-ons of the all male news team, which is amazing because who could resist something as charming as ""I wanna be on you."" Where the movie starts to really go wrong is that her character has no consistency whatsoever. Half the time she is pure professionalism, inspiring her colleagues to refer to her as such things as an ""ice queen."" The other half the time she is a breathless, steamy temptress, unable to resist the hairy Ron Burgundy, playing on Christina Applegate's iconography rather than what we have come to know about Veronica Corningstone.<br/><br/>Burgundy's colleagues are more interesting than he is, although the tremendous Will Farrell thankfully does give his character some weight, despite an almost paralyzing amount of stupidity festering in the script. Particularly amusing is Brick Tamland, who sometimes forgets his name but knows that someday someone will discover that he has an IQ of 48. The movie clearly doesn't have a lot to say about the intelligence of news teams, but when it operates as a satire it is amusing. When it turns news teams into street gangs and has them fight each other in alleyways using medieval torture devices as instruments, it's not. You don't need to show people having their arms torn off to have a funny movie, even if it's only to pay homage with the line, ""It's getting to be ri-goddam-DICulous!""<br/><br/>The movie makes some interesting points about women entering into the news workforce and the torturous times that the all-male newsteams suffered as a result. That's what the movie satirizes, as you know, and when it sticks to that it's pretty funny. There are probably five or six times during the movie that I laughed out loud and had to rewind a couple of times because it was so funny, but more than half of the movie was so dumb that I was sitting stone-faced for 15-20 minutes at a time. When it comes to comedy movies, I prefer to leave the stone-face-making to Buster Keaton.<br/><br/>Vince Vaughn plays a very small part in the film, which is sad because if he had a bigger part (and a different one, as it were) the movie could have been a lot better. It is not uncommon for him to carry an entire film, like he did in Old School, Clay Pigeons, Psycho, Made, Swingers, Dodgeball, The Cell, Return to Paradise, etc. He nearly steals this movie and he wasn't even credited, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>He is at one point so overcome with rage at being second place in ratings to a team that includes a man who taunts him with such gems as ""Where'd you get YOUR suit, the toilet store?"" that he slams his fist against the hood of his van like a rebellious 12-year-old. It's disappointing that his role doesn't really go uphill from there, but his exit from the film is truly telling. His exit from the movie plays out like this: he's talking into the TV camera on location for a news story (the birth of a panda which, in this movie's plane of existence, has captivated the world). When he finishes his line, he throws his microphone to the ground and stalks off with a disgusted look on his face. I don't know why, but I got the feeling that he became Vince Vaughn again. His expression was a moment of clarity realized on the set of this movie, not as his character. I don't know why, but I got the feeling that Vince Vaughn decided he had had enough of this movie and was getting the hell out of there.<br/><br/>I tended to agree."
"jrfranklin01","5","1","2","29 December 2004"," Good News Station Spoof
","Having worked at a news station before, I could appreciate the humor behind the idea used in this film. It is a spoof of the inner workings at a news station and the characters that bring you the news. The theme used is a bit throwback, with an old-school flavor. Will Ferrel plays Ron Burgundy, a chauvinistic playboy news anchor. When a gorgeous female is introduced to the all-male news cast, all goes awry.<br/><br/>Some films are really funny and others are more silly. While ""Anchorman"" had some genuinely funny parts to it, it was otherwise mostly silly. Will Ferrell's idea as the writer of this film was good and brings comic relief through a unique perspective, but things begin to get ""Naked Gun"" fast and go goofy.<br/><br/>I am beginning to think that Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson (Owen's younger brother), and Vince Vaughn have some sort of comedy band going. Lately, these four have interchangeably starred in film's together. It reminds me of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. I can't say I've been wholly impressed by such repetition. I hope Will keeps to himself and continues to give us that ""Saturday Night Live"" wackiness he is known for. 5/10<br/><br/>P.S.: I still can't believe that was Christina Applegate playing Veronica! Whew, she's still hot!"
"babiedol12","7","1","2","25 December 2004"," A Silly, but Delightful Comedy
","Anchorman launches us into the world of the 1970's broadcast journalism with local San Diego anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) as the poster boy for men behaving badly. His supporting anchors introduce themselves by breaking the fourth wall with all the casual gusto of their on-air person as. There's good-IL'-boy Champ Kind (David Koechner) with sports, ladies' man Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) in the field, and dumb-as-a-Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) on weather. Soon, new reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) enters the fray. Improbably, Ron and Veronica hit it off until a series of events puts her in the co-anchor seat and professional jealousy rips them apart, sending Ron on a downward spiral.<br/><br/>Anchorman is funny from beginning to end, mainly thanks to Ferrell's incessant and skillful need to be zany at all moments of filming. Ferrell is so good at turning even the worst material into something witty that there is really no point in analyzing the script; the only thing that can be said is that the script obviously gave Ferrell and the rest of the cast free range to work their magic, and also throws in some calculated jabs at the television journalism. For instance, for the entire movie all of the news stations are clambering over the story of a pregnant panda at the zoo, labeling it as ""the story of the decade."" Funny enough, this isn't too far from the truth as local news tends to put a huge emphasis on unimportant animal stories.<br/><br/>Written by Will Farrell and director Adam McKay, it's a campy, extended ""Saturday Night Live"" skit - but an amusing one. While Ferrell embodies the clueless buffoon, he and Applegate have a cheerful comedic chemistry which is even more apparent in the outtakes that play over the final credits. Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Vice Vaughn pop up in cameos, and the soundtrack is a delight.<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"

","I've talked to many friends who had very different opinions on this movie: some went expecting ""Frank the Tank"" with different makeup, some expected more sophistication. In a sense they got both, sometimes though not enough to their satisfaction. While I can't be completely objective with this film (I enjoy Will Ferrell's work WAY too much), I can say that it is enjoyable. While Ferrell's character has a bigger vocabulary than some of his previous characters, Burgundy's depth as a person runs about as deep as a mud puddle.<br/><br/>The pathetic chauvinism and intellectual inferiority coupled with a completely misplaced sense of importance are a riot! The one thing I did find to be missing in this film was a straight-man/woman/character, and unfortunately it does bring down the comedy. With every character being an over-exaggerated caricature, there is no sense of reality to ground the comedy and make it even funnier. While the ""Old School"" wives (despite their unfortunate fellatio class) were pretty believable as real people, no one in ""Anchorman"" provides that grounding that adds to the comedy. As many great speech and sight gags as there are (particularly from Steve Carell, who arguably is the big star here), you should find plenty to belly-laugh at without losing your self-respect. Definitely worth at least a rental when it comes out"

","The one big complaint about Anchorman is it had no plot. It was about this big shot tv newsman, Ron Burgandy, and how he has to deal with the introduction of a female reporter, Veronica, who also wants to be a news anchor.  So, we get a lot of sexist jokes since it takes place in the 70s. The movie felt like a bunch of short skits thrown together. Ron dates Veronica and announces it to the office. Very funny. He also with a coworker makes prank phone calls to her. He has his news buddies, which form a funny and unusual group. One guy says things that are off the wall and have nothing to do with the conversation.  It had some funny cameos, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller.  There was one disturbing scene in which the audience actually gasped and that was when Jack Black kicks a dog over a bridge. That was terrible. But, the dog lived and came back to negotiate with a bear. Don't even ask if you haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>It had one very funny and uncomfortable scene when Ron is talking to Veronica and gets ""very excited"" at the office.  Ron and his buddies sing Afternoon Delight; it was just funny how they did it.  I along with the people I was with laughed a lot.  And throughout the film, they let us know Ron will read whatever is on the telepromtor, so you know that will lead to a good joke. Veronica writes something which gives this pg-13 film it's one ""f"" word. And it was very funny.  There are many other scenes which made me laugh, I just wish more thought had been put into coming up with a delima for the characters to overcome.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I found it to be funny, so I recommend it.

For example, the scene where all of the anchormen from the five local stations are getting ready for (and eventually are participating in) a brawl. It just falls flat.

The take-off of a Gangs of New York murderous brawl was quite hilarious."

","Hello, did somebody order a plot? If so, it never arrived.<br/><br/>I wanted to love ""Anchorman"" and I think Will Ferrell is usually hilarious, but this film just didn't work for me. While there were some very funny parts that had me laughing out loud, there seemed to be nothing coherent holding this film together. It just seemed to me like a bunch of skits loosely placed around an idea for a plot, rather than a full fleshed-out film.<br/><br/>Also, it too often went into lunacy instead of a straight-ahead story. I would have liked the story more if it were just about Ron Burgundy, obnoxious news anchor. But instead, we had total lapses of rational thought, for example, with the ""rumble"" between the various news teams or Burgundy's flute performance. It was things like that which took me out of the moment -- of 1970's San Diego -- and the movie lost all semblence of reality.<br/><br/>When it stuck to the more basic plot (old-school men vs. women's lib movement), the film felt more coherent and way funnier -- but the asides overwhelmed the plot..."

","Okay. Okay. I realize this movie is ""The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" and not ""The Legend of Veronica Corningstone."" But I couldn't help being just a tiny, tiny bit disappointed. It's a comedy, not a documentary about women in broadcast journalism, and even so, I was dying for it to scratch a little deeper. Will Farrell said he was inspired to write Anchorman when he saw a colleague of Jessica Savitch on TV reminiscing about his loutish behavior. So why not take it a little further? As the credits rolled, there was a listing of journalists who were thanked for their insight.<br/><br/>
All men!!!<br/><br/>No mention of the warrior women who survived the real Ron Burgundys! (Who, by the way, make Farrell's character seem like a prince.) Insight from these women could only have enriched the movie. It definitely would have been appropriate to honor these pioneers with a special dedication to Christine Craft, Linda Ellerbee, Connie Chung, Barbara Walters, the late Miss Savitch, or Chris Chubbuck, the anchorwoman who committed suicide on live TV 30 years ago today."
"francineking82","3","1","2","14 July 2004"," Don't waste your time or money
","Not being a huge Will Ferrell fan, I didn't have high expectations of Anchorman, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. Ferrell's usual following might be, however. His over-the-top physical and sexual humor soars to the moon in this film and takes its time coming back down again. The situations range from a trip to a cartoon ""Pleasure Town"" to an incident with a dog that is much more disturbing than funny. As for the supporting cast, Christina Applegate tries to portray a serious journalist fighting for recognition, but she comes off as the vapid, ditzy girl we know so well from her days on Married with Children, though that's more the script's fault than Applegate's. Paul Rudd and the rest of the newsroom gang do offer some interesting background. In fact, some of the funnier segments of the movie come courtesy of the mentally deficient weatherman's random comments. Of course, the film does have the benefit of several hilariously unbelievable cameos, but all-in-all I wish I could get my two hours back."
"cmkmhall","4","1","2","14 July 2004"," ""ANCHORMAN"" IS ADRIFT
","Maybe ""Anchorman"" qualifies as improvisational parody or satire, and rollicking comedy. Or maybe it is just a great big steaming pile of lame and asinine humor which is neither very funny nor very cogent. If you are not in the mood for a throw-away comedy, do something else with your 2 hours and $8. Only the concurrently running ""White Chicks"" could possibly be worse, but I'm not going to go see that dunce-trap just to prove myself right. Whatever you saw in the trailers is about as good as it gets. Certainly there are some scenes which are funny, but they are really dredging a muddy bottom to pull off an entire movie. Dan Akroyd & Jane Curtain were much funnier 25 years ago on SLN than this news team will ever be. To me, the last laugh is on those who think this caliber of movie is worth paying for."

","Since Elf came out, I've been waiting for Ferrell's new starring movie, and Anchorman is it. And it does not disappoint, comedy fans! With great actors and script, it's one not to miss.<br/><br/>The story: Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is a newcaster who's mostly concerned with himself and what he wants. Along with him is his newscrew: Brian, a ladies' man with a sense of fashion, Champ Kind, a western-esque man with little politeness, and Brick, a a person with low intelligence (Think Ralph Wiggum from the Simpsons.) Anyway, a new girl comes into the crew, named Veronica Corningstone. Her and Ron fall for each other during a dinner, and things couldn't be better for Ron. Until Veronica is promoted to co-anchorman, which angers the newscrew. So Ron wants her off the newscrew, in anyway.<br/><br/>Aside from story, the characters are very funny, especially Brick Tamland, who's played by Steve Carell.

"wildwellz","Null","1","2","13 July 2004"," MY 25-minute standing-O goes to Anchorman
","Since the start of the new millennium, it appeared to me that great comedy had died. Modern comedies resorted to the cheapest, most obvious, most stereotypical kind of dull-witted humor that had graced the silver screen since the late 1980's and earliest 1990's. Aside from a few sleeper hits, the torch of belly laughs and good clean fun had fallen, and it had fallen hard........ .... But Will Ferrell has picked up this torch, dipped it in gasoline, and has dropped the match....<br/><br/>When I said that Dodgeball was the appetizer for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, I didn't know how right I was. I will admit that I had high hopes for this film. So high were my hopes that some of this review had already been planned in my head, but I thought for sure it couldn't be this good. It's like whenever you ask out a girl and you imagine this whole scenario in your head before you go about you 2 striking a chord, laughing together like children in the womb, and ending the night with a kiss. Then when you call her she says she's going to lie down for awhile and she'll call you when or if she wakes up within the hour....... and....she never talks to you again but....... Maybe this isn't an analogy you can relate to..........<br/><br/>Well... this time... its as if that same girl DID go out with you and you're happily married to her and thinking about children, but not sure if you can fit it into your schedules.<br/><br/>Oihh....In a way that's easier to understand, I expected gold and got platinum.<br/><br/>I feel no need to go into plot details, because who really cares? The plot is just icing in a movie like this and should be as convoluted as possible. Having said that, I must admit that a lot of the time I had no idea where the movie would go next -- adding to my enjoyment. It was just one surprise after another. So I'd rather not explain anytihng about the story for fear I will giving away just one of a nonstop barrage of priceless gags, lines, and character peculiarities.<br/><br/>But what I will say is that I loved how Anchorman has no ""gross-out"" gag or shock value. By todays standards, it's pretty darn clean if you ask me. So don't expect any lesbian make-out scenes or 5-minute masturbation or semen jokes, cuz you won't find them here. I guess the closest thing I could compare the movie's humor to would be if the cult hit Wet Hot American Summer had a multi-million dollar budget. For those of you unfamiliar, that means the movie is very silly, very hyperactive, very ridiculous, and most importantly ---blatant, unapologetic, relentless retardation. But occasionally the comedy transcends even further into the type of truly bizarre humor that only the likes of Sealab 2021 and Homestar Runner would boldly go. After it got going, the movie went in every offbeat direction that I could only dream of. <br/><br/>The beauty of the movie is that there are so many jokes that probably shouldn't be funny at all and really don't work, but they just do. See, this is one of those rare gems that doesn't care if people think it's funny. It's just a natural. They pull off crap I thought only cartoons could do. Anchorman's comedic climax... involving what I think was a parody of Gangs Of New York... is jaw-dropping both by measure of scale and laughter.<br/><br/>And the casting for this film is incredible. Aside from Ferrell and Christina Applegate, most of the co-stars are b-list. However, the cast is made up primarily of comedians, which range from Saturday Night Live alums like David Koechner and Chris Parnell to Daily Show regular Steven Carell.<br/><br/>I think in it's own way, Anchorman is a bit of a masterpiece, and I honestly don't know how Will Ferrell could top this. This movie made my week and for an hour and a half made me forget what a boring dead-end my life is right now. It's the funniest movie I've seen in years, and there is a such a swell of re-watch-ability to it that there will be no need for me to search for better laughs in the deleted scenes when the DVD comes out ( in the case of many comedies lately, those are the only GOOD laughs). Even the cameos are through the roof. Vince Vaughn's grand total of five minutes in this movie are funnier than his duration in Dodgeball. And  though it didn't need to Anchorman's end credits are loaded with delightful outtakes (one of which is a stroke of brilliance). I had such a great time that when it was all over, I swore on the way home that something bad was going to happen. And sure enough, I found out that my town's shopping mall had caught on fire. I'm not joking. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the reader may have noticed that I have limited the amount of second person in this review. I don't wanna say that ""you"" will find this movie as hilarious as I did, because ""you"" may have a different taste in comedy. Point taken. The crowd I saw it with seemed to be as enthralled with it as I was, and that makes me happy. Contrary to popular belief, it puts a smile on my face when the public embraces something as obscure as this. But hey, maybe it's not your cup of tea, and if it isn't, have no fear. White Chicks and Garfield are right down the hall, so you might find one of them a little closer to your pace.<br/><br/>4(out of 4) stars. 10/10... I really did want to stand up and clap for a movie that made me feel so good."
"morgan831","9","1","2","13 July 2004"," The funniest movie in 5 years!
","This is one of the most hilarious films in recent memory. Not to discount other recent comedies, most notably Jack Black's teamings with writer Mike White. But there were several moments I was laughing so hard, tears were streaming down my face and I could hardly breathe. And it is very rare that a film has one moment that can provoke that sort of response from me. Will Ferrell has always been a very gifted comedic actor, but with this film he has found the perfect role. Christina Applegate provides a very good counter to Ferrell as well. And the supporting cast is nothing short of amazingly funny in their roles, especially Steven Carrell. I hope we see much more of him in years to come. Great cameos too, but I won't give them away like some of the previous commentators have. In short, go see this movie and laugh your a$$ off."

","I eagerly anticipated the summer release of ""Anchorman"", the trailers for the film looked amusing, and ""Old School"" was one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.<br/><br/>But this movie downright stinks. There are some laughs throughout the movie, but they are too few and far between to make watching this a worthwhile experience. After awhile you feel as if the movie is trying to hard to be funny, and as a result it fails miserably.<br/><br/>Ferrell's overly-dramatic style becomes grating at times, and often completely lacks anything resembling humor (ie: the crying on the phone scenes). Seven Carell is given the absolute worst part he's ever played in his career. His lines are scarce, and when he does speak it's not funny. Carell deserves much better than this. And what's with Christina Applegate?<br/><br/>This movie is supposed to be a comedy, but her character thinks the whole thing is a drama. Not one laugh comes out because of her.<br/><br/>The movie begins to drag on before you reach the one-hour mark, and watching it begins somewhat of a tedious endeavor. By the time it was over I felt like I had wasted two hours of my life. By amazingly, the movie is only 91 minutes. I'd avoid this one and just go watch ""Old School"" again."
"mike-1682","Null","1","2","11 July 2004"," With no apology - this movie is lame.
","Will Ferrell comes across as a babbling idiot who is absolutely desperate for approval - his jokes varied between funny to odd to just plain crazy.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be inconsistent and only marginally funny. The theatre I was in was half-empty so the jokes that didn't go over were met with stone silence. I did hear a few snorts of disdain through the movie.<br/><br/>The scene where Paul Rudds character talks about naming his penis and testicles is just plain strange. The character himself isn't horrible and the scene about the men's cologne is pretty funny (reminded me of old Hai Karate commercials for those of you old enough to remember those).<br/><br/>David Koechner as the sportscaster was irritating and I don't recall him having a single funny line. His best scene is where he's a ragdoll for a bear - as for the bearpit scene itself I find myself asking who is Ferrell's audience? 10 year old boys who are amused by making farting sounds with their armpits?<br/><br/>Christina Applegate - I like her and don't think she gets nearly enough work. This movie is not going to help her career. I had hoped that as this is a movie about gender ""war"" that the main female character would be well written. Will Ferrell is content to leave the Corningstone character 2-dimensional and the character's behaviour is completely unpredictable. Why were there no other female characters of any consequence in this movie? It's about the emergence of the women's liberation movement in the 70's forchrissakes! You'd think they'd find room for women in the script. What we get is Christina Applegate in miniskirts and eminently forgettable lines.<br/><br/>The background - the 70's. Great idea - poorly realized. Ben Stillers homage to the 70's in Starsky & Hutch did a much better job. Do you think they could have tossed in a few more baseline references to set the tone - how about trotting out Ronald Reagan (he was Governor of California) - and there were no references to movies of that era - one reference was to Planet of the Apes (but that's a 60's movie). <br/><br/>OK - Steve Carell's character got some great lines and his comic timing is superb. He did have me laughing out loud and Ferrell used the character very well. Vince Vaughn was good and should have had more scenes - but his final scene at the bearpit made me squirm it was so badly written (what can an actor do with lines like that??)<br/><br/>The ""rumble"" scene was ridiculous, the ""down & out"" routine was silly and the whole thing doesn't deserve more than a 5 out of 10 in my books (and that's due solely to Steve Carrel - otherwise I'd rate it much lower).<br/><br/>American cinema needs an ""Alpha"" Comic badly and Will Ferrell isn't it."
"movieguy1021","7","1","2","10 July 2004"," Anchorman: 7/10
","I have mixed feelings about Will Ferrell. I think he's a very funny guy and a great improviser, but I still can't let bygones be bygones and forgive him for making Old School. Although I didn't get around to seeing Elf, I think that Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is the movie to make Ferrell a comedy star or not. If his name alone can fill theaters, I think he'll be hot property for studios in the future. The trailers for Anchorman made it look promising. I had watched the trailer many times and kept on laughing. I had hoped that all of the best parts weren't given away in the trailers, and much to my surprise, most of the material in the trailer wasn't even included in the final movie, which I guess was both a blessing and a curse. It showed that there was even more riotous material than was in the trailer, but it also meant that some of the great stuff from the trailer couldn't be in the movie.<br/><br/>Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is a macho, chauvinistic, popular news anchorman in San Diego in the 1970s. He and his news team, which consists of field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports anchor Champ Kind (David Koechner) and low IQed Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), are the number one news team in town. However, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins the news team and threatens the masculinity of the station, but also it threatens Ron's job. Ron and his news team try to do whatever they can to stop Veronica from becoming the first female anchor, while still trying to get in bed with her.<br/><br/>The whole premise seems like it's some sort of Saturday Night Live sketch stretched into a movie (almost like a Weekend Update movie-now that would be awesome), especially since Ferrell, an SNL alum, co-wrote the movie. But it's just a silly, funny, stupid movie that has little plot and relies chiefly on Ferrell's improvisation. He's a great improviser, and it shows, because it often takes center stage, taking it from where it belongs: Steve Carrell. Playing the dimwitted Brick, he has some great lines and actions. He says my favorite line in the whole movie. I won't spoil it here, but it's in an argument with a rival station (led by Vince Vaughn). That brings me to another point. It seems like they don't even try to stay coherent (like the stylings of The Naked Gun and those types of movies). It's that type of comedic styling that's always the funniest.<br/><br/>The laughs seemed to be coming in at a pretty steady pace, but the main problem is that this low-brow humor didn't warrant that large of laughs. They were regular, but they weren't that large. You can't expect perfection, but when you have so much material, I would think you'd try to find the best of the best. Maybe when this movie is released onto DVD there will actually be good deleted scenes. Whenever there's a movie with so much material to use, they always bring it down to about 90 minutes. Couldn't they bring it up another half hour? It'd work, I think. But anyway, Anchorman is a great, leading-role making performance by Will Ferrell, and enough consistent laughs to satisfy most people. Just beware that whenever Ferrell's name is on a poster, it usually equates to stupid humor. But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for sexual humor, language and comic violence."
"upallnight2002","10","1","2","9 July 2004"," The trailer may not look funny, but the move was hilarious!!
","Probably one of the funniest movies of the summer if not whole year. 10 times better then ""Dodgeball"" and ""Starsky & Hutch"". The movie starts off funny and winds its way through a rather surprisingly well put together plot line. Though at times it does seem to look/feel just like a giant SNL skit. (which is hilarious anyway)<br/><br/>It has its moments where it goes off on extreme tangents, but they too are equally as funny. The second half of the movie does tend to get a tiny bit too silly. Overall though the movie had literally every person in my theatre laughing from beginning to end. Some parts of it are actually so funny I couldn't breathe for a second or two and that rarely happens anymore with today's Hollywood garbage.<br/><br/>I'm surprised it got a PG-13 rating for it's pretty colorful language, but regardless for any open minded adult its hilarious from start to finish.<br/><br/>I will recommend this movie to all of my friends and I recommend you go see it as well!"

The only other character that might be funnier than Ferrell is ""Brick"", the weatherman. His lines are some of the ""best timing"" ones i have heard in a while. The only negative to me was I think the movie could have had a funnier ending than it does. It seemed they went with an over the top, ridiculous one instead of a pointless but funny one which I usually enjoy more.

","Will Ferrell as a phony, materialistic 70's TV news anchorman? Funny premise, but it's just not funny beyond the previews or the first 5 minutes. Movies can be both stupid and funny, like ""Old School"" but this one is just stupid and very rarely funny. There's not much of a story - it's just a vehicle for Ferrell's anchorman character.<br/><br/>Look for one wildly over-the-top scene between dueling news teams and some well-known actors in quick cameo roles (familiar faces from ""Old School"" for example). Beyond that, only comic actor Steve Carell (former regular on ""The Daily Show"") is good for a reliable laugh, and he steals just about every scene he's in, as a dumber-than-dumb weatherman. Ferrell, though, is rarely funny in the leading role.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can recommend this film even as a bargain matinÃ©e. It's not that good even as brain-dead comedy."
"gregsrants","4","2","8","11 July 2004"," Like a long skit that doesn't know where to end
","Call me shallow or even easy to please, but one of the things that I have definitely appreciated this year is how the titles of movies have gotten back to a one or two word name that fits easily a top a theatre marquee or nicely within the margins of a film review. Kill Bill, Troy, and Miracle, all are good examples of studios having enough confidence in a film that they don't feel the need to put half the script in the overhead title. Last year, I exhausted myself trying just to get through the names of films like Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life and Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. When you try and stick to a review of under 1000 words or tell someone about a film within 5 minutes at a water cooler, it is a lot easier if the writers and the studios can save you the time of constructing a difficult to pronounce anagram just to save yourself a breath. <br/><br/>Well, maybe my new world of Spartan's and Hellboy's are over and done for with the new Will Ferrell comedy Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (referred to as Anchorman for the remainder of this review). Possibly lengthened for comedic effect or maybe simply because the writers get paid by the letter, it looks like Anchorman has opened the door again and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow's are now crawling into our movie magazines.<br/><br/>Anchorman takes us back to a simpler time. Set in 1970's San Diego, the movie surrounds the crew of Channel 4 News and the changing of the times that effect their male dominated profession. Ferrell plays the title character Ron Burgundy, an egomaniacal scotch-loving womanizer that is the sole anchor of the 6 o'clock news. To the right and left of center chair is the dimwitted weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), the big Texan sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner), and the emotional leader and fashionably challenged roaming reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd). Together, the team has assembled to lead the ratings across the major networks for evening news telecasts. They are a tight team, a fun team and a team of out and out morons.<br/><br/>To the credit of their program director, Ed Harken (Fred Willard), an opportunity to diversify the group and add a female presence to the team leads to the hiring of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). Immediately, the boys club is not amused. Back in the 1970's women were still fighting their way into male dominated environments and television was one of the predominant holdouts. The disgust of the news team explodes into a shouting match with the program director, but eventually her pushed-to-the-side role is accepted enough that they can forgo their hatred as being considered an equal and focus on the pursuit of wooing the new addition. <br/><br/>Striking out with rapid-fire consistency, the team does get credit for pulling out all stops. In two of the films funnier moments, Brian uses a cologne 'made with bits of real panther' to make an impression which ultimately leads to very rib tickling comments from the newsroom as they rush to vomiting receptacles. And when Brick tries to relay the fact that he has a 'party in his pants' and that Veronica is invited, I will admit to having my fat cells jiggle with a reaction. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, director Adam McKay then diverts the movie into a soap opera where after a brief fling, Burgundy and Corningstone fight for camera time and eventually, a crude sign-off delivered by Burgundy via the always trusted teleprompter, leads to his dismissal from the station and the fulfillment of Veronica's dream to anchor the news. We watch as the pitiful Burgundy drinks himself into a stupor while the team continues to flourish and improve on their number one rating status. Using the 70's backdrop can only provide us with pockets of amusement as this melodrama plays out to what is eventually a ridiculous conclusion and final act.<br/><br/>For those of you that are Will Ferrell fans, he dominates the film with enough screen time to probably keep you laughing for your money. For those of you who find him only somewhat amusing during his brief skits a la Saturday Night Live, this will seem like a television bit that just doesn't know how to close. Every time the film would begin to pick up comedic momentum, it would be tarnished by the need to showcase Ferrell as someone who would not turn down anything he ever read on a script page. His yelling, screaming, crying and love for his dog are so hopelessly exaggerated that they begin to tire the audience out when stretched over 91 minutes. Also noted are that the funnier moments are too off the wall and would probably be better suited for a dream sequence rather than having us believe that as a flute player Burgundy would slide under a men's bathroom stall or that rival news station crews would meet in a back alley with pitch forks, grenades and gladiators on horseback to fight as an outlet to their disrespect for each other. <br/><br/>There are some funny moments in Anchorman and some real interesting dialogue (Did you know that San Diego is German for a Whale's Vagina?), but as a whole, it just didn't keep me entertained. The cameo's were a nice surprise, but only for a second or two and then I wondered whether Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller or Luke Wilson would be able to find work outside of their collaborated efforts. Tim Robbins does a great job in a very comedic 180 from his Mystic River character, but his small presence and big hair doesn't generate anything more than a 'that's neat' from this critic. <br/><br/>I suppose the fact that director McKay had only helmed Saturday Night Live episodes should have tipped me off for what I was about to encounter, but Ferrell's energy in Elf and Old School gave me hope that he could pull what must have been a fascinating idea before put to script papers. I can only hope that his next stab (Bewitched) reins him in and uses his talent as opposed to his audacity. If not, we can always hold out for Anchorman 2: The Legend of Ron Burgundy To the Temple of Doom to Uncover the Cradle of Life."

","I was not expecting it to work, especially after seeing the dreadful The Other Guys recently which to my understanding also had director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell together. But somehow it did. Although it is very dumb in places, some of the plot with its episodic feel has the feeling of an overlong comedy sketch even with its interesting observations about the workplace and battle-of-the-sexes and there is the odd puerile joke that doesn't work. However, the film is quite short, moves quickly and the hit jokes more than make up for the misses, the best of them being the moment when Burgundy slips the announcer a fistful of cash to introduce his co-host as ""Tits McGee"". The film looks good too, with the photography and editing crisp and make-up, sets and costumes top-notch, and the script is very funny and smart. McKay's direction is good, and the enthusiastic playing of the cast gives the film an extra list. Will Ferrell, who I don't care for usually, gives one of his funnier and better performances, Steve Carell comes very close to stealing the movie in a zany turn and Christina Applegate is on sparkling form.

","I came across this film, and thought while watching it that it wasn't really funny or good. Many people (critics and fans) wrote positive reviews about his film saying that its really funny and Will Ferrell and the cast shine. Well, I strongly disagree. The film is not that bad but its not that good either. Its a very basic comedy starring Wil Ferll and the plot is pretty predictable and silly. First he's the lead anchorman, then Christina Applegate (Veronica Cornerstone) comes in the picture and all the workers try hitting on her. She then says she wants to be an anchorman also like Ron Burgundy. First they have little disputes then they eventually fall for each other. She ends up taking his job, he gets mad and gets fired fro cursing on the air. Something happens in the middle. The crew call Ron back when Veronica is somehow lost and he surprisingly comes back and does the news again. he covers it well, saves her and everything seems fine again. The comedy really isn't that funny, the jokes are just sexual and slapstick type humour. Their were some funny scenes but not enough throughout the entire film. As a rewatch 09.03.19' opinions remain same. Film isn't as funny and feels forced. Somewhat entertaining but not nearly as much as it has been praised to be."

","In many ways I think the best comparison for this movie is probably ""Gilligan's Island"" - and I mean that in a positive way. What I loved about 1960's comedies such as Gilligan's Island (or Hogan's Heroes or The Beverley Hillbillies) is that they had no pretension about them. They didn't claim to be making any fundamentally important social statement. They were all just about being silly enough to have fun with - and, to me at least - they worked. And that's what ""Anchorman"" is - it's silly enough (stupid enough to be honest) to be able to simply sit down and have fun with. There's nothing serious about this; no important subplots; no significant life lessons. It's just good old fun, and it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell as the legendary anchorman Ron Burgundy and Christina Applegate as his romantic interest and anchor rival Veronica Corningstone play this perfectly. Their straight up serious performances are exactly what the movie needs to make it really funny. I actually thought that they worked so well together that it would be interesting to see what sort of chemistry they might have in a more serious romantic comedy. Also brilliantly funny were Ron's news team, played by Paul Rudd (as Brian Fantana), Steve Carell (as Brick Tamland) and David Koechner (as Champ Kind). These three - and especially Koechner - were hilarious in their roles.<br/><br/>There were a couple of problems here, mind you. At times - even for this sort of movie - it went a bit over the top. I remember especially the news team rumble. It was a cute idea, but didn't add a lot to the story and added too many other rival news teams. Where the movie had to that point featured a rivalry between only two news teams (Ron's and Wes Mantooth's, played by Vince Vaughn), all of a sudden we have a third network, public television and Spanish language TV in the picture. Too much - way too much. I also though that there just wasn't enough story here to go much past an hour and a half, but this one went over 1:45. Again, too much - way too much. After a while the jokes started to get a bit old. Probably there was enough to go 1:20 to 1:25 with this.<br/><br/>Basically, though, there were a lot of laughs here (and I loved the closing dialogue between Baxter the dog and the kodiak bear - ""fare thee well, Baxter. You shall always be the friend of the bears."") If you just want to have some fun without having to think too hard - and we all need that sometimes - this is a great one to watch. 8/10"

","Farrell is an intelligent man, most gifted comedians are. Now, I'm not saying he's Robin Williams, but he is talented. But with one mediocre movie after another, we SNL/Farrell fans were wondering what was going on. How could he be so good on SNL and die on screen so badly? <br/><br/>It seems the key was the screenplay. He needs a specific vehicle line in order to demonstrate his talents. Maybe it was the supporting cast. Maybe it was the combination of writing and the casting. I'm not sure exactly what that formula consists of, but Achorman has obviously nailed it.

","Possibly the best comedy of the 21st Century. The film has everything, laughs, great characters, 70s suits and even Paul Rudd fighting a bear (and getting beaten). In the 70s city of San Diego there is one man, and anchorman, who is loved by all and cool beyond believe. Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is Channel 4s main anchorman and the people of San Diego worship him and obey his every word. However, when Miss Veronica Corningstone (played by Christina Applegate, who you may remember plays Rachael's hilarious sister in Friends) joins the team, Ron's world is turned upside down. However you should not watch this film for Ferrells antics, not for Ben Stiller as a Spaniard, not for Baxter the all-knowing dog, not even for Garth (what a name) but for Brick Tamland. Steve Carell's character is so unbelievably funny that he steals every single scene which he appears in. With his stupidity and fantastic one-liners he takes the film by storm. I would go as far to say that no other character has ever had me in such fits of laughter before.

I was particularly impressed with Steve Carrel's performance as Brick. His portrayal of a weatherman who was mentally retarded was the perfect addition to an already hilarious news team.

","I should say up front that I have never been a big fan of Will Ferrell. A little bit of him goes a long way. Elf was cute, but not that funny, and so I wasn't really looking forward to seeing this movie. Thank God I had a free HBO preview and some free time and decided to check out the unrated version of Anchorman on On Demand. This flick combines the inspired lunacy of Monty Python with the joke-a-minute absurdity of Airplane and comes out a big winner.<br/><br/>First, Steve Carell is a genius with his line delivery and timing. Every time he was on screen he was hilarious (I love lamp, I love LAMP!). I'm still laughing at his intro where he cheerfully announces he is what some refer to as mentally retarded. Brilliant! Paul Rudd is well cast as Brian Fantana, a Mark Spitzian type who's good with the ladies, especially when wearing Sex Panther (it has bits of real panther in it, so it must be good). Hysterical. All the other cast members acquit themselves well, especially the under-appreciated Christina Applegate who can react beautifully to the insanity transpiring around her and gets her hilarious revenge on Ron by changing his sign-off from ""Stay classy"" to ""Go F*** yourself San Diego!"". I had to replay that scene several times because I kept laughing so hard that I missed what came after.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell has changed my opinion of him with this masterpiece of humor, both as actor and writer. As soon as I had finished watching the film a third time, I immediately ordered the special 2 disc version (unrated of course)."

The basic premise is 'act stupid and the jokes will create themselves,' but, alas, they don't. Characters that are beyond caricatures are not a good place to start-- the only person who comes out of this mess with a measure of dignity is Christina Applegate, who at least has a character that seems slightly real at least part of the time. The rest of the 'characters' are just wigs and costumes and so horribly written that the actors can't do anything to fill the time, other than make faces and try to say things that show desperation rather than inspiration. The entire world depicted in this film is so senseless and ungrounded in reality that nothing CAN be funny, it's just Bizzaroland, and an unamusing one at that.<br/><br/>Funniest recent movie?

"december18","10","1","3","29 July 2005"," An Absurdist Masterpiece
","I know. I just used the word masterpiece to describe Anchorman. I must be off my rocker, but I think that many, if not everyone who has seen this fresh, seriously funny film from the ever-talented Will Ferrell is underestimating it. I think that even the people who loved the movie are underestimating it, most importantly, as an artistic film.<br/><br/>Today, I'd like to make the case that Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, a film which contains jokes about poo-covered squirrels, is artistic in nature. I know, that sounds absurd in itself, but bear with me for a moment.<br/><br/>Absurdism has long been underrated as an art form in motion pictures. The Naked Gun, the masterful comedy from Jerry Zucker and Leslie Nielsen, has always been lauded as a ""funny movie,"" but never been even remotely considered as an ""artistic accomplishment."" The same is generally true for Anchorman. People are quick to point out how funny it is, but shy away when any semblance of art is brought into the discussion.<br/><br/>But Anchorman gains unbelievable strength as a film from the most unexpected of places, namely the fact that much of the film is improvised. Although perhaps it is not improvised to the point where it becomes a Mike Leigh film (where there is no screenplay), Anchorman comes across as spontaneously joyful, throwing jokes around like spitshine as they all center around the same theme: excessive hubris and male chauvinism.<br/><br/>Although Anchorman is absurd, it is not random. Most of the humor deals with the hubris of the characters involved, and how their overt pride in themselves one by one leads to their downfall. Even the moral center of the film, Veronica Corningstone (played with considerable skill by Christina Applegate) suffers from her self-love (insisting on numerous occasions in a condescending tone that she is ""a professional."") This is the magic behind Anchorman, that it uses its absurdist mentality for a purpose, rather than letting the humor be an end in itself. By using increasingly erratic, absurd humor, Anchorman effectively challenges common biases that we find in our society today to great effect.<br/><br/>The film is essentially anchored (no pun intended) by the greatest performance of Will Ferrell's career. If there were ever a genre of film that challenges the auteur theory that directors are ""authors"" of their films, it would be absurdism, because most of the time, with an absurdist movie, it is a healthy relationship between the director and the leading man (or woman) that makes the movie brilliant. One can argue that Leslie Nielsen is as much an author of The Naked Gun as Jerry Zucker is. The same is true with Anchorman. It seems as though the film grew organically from the collaboration of Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay.<br/><br/>And so there you have it. Two hours later, after random bursts of jazz flute, harmonic renditions of afternoon delight, and appearances by a dog that speaks Spanish, you are left with a film that is quite absurd, but is anything but random. Take another look. There's a brilliant film hiding underneath the surface."
"muchneededescape","10","1","3","18 July 2005"," a lot better than i thought
","I originally wrote this movie off to be a stupid little Will Ferrell flick that lacked almost any actual kind of humor at all. I also thought that Ferrell could never pull off a comedy where he is the main character. However, I saw Anchorman today and I'm shocked to say that it actually had a lot of funny moments. As expected, almost the entire cast of Old School was in action but it wasn't a bad thing. One of the funniest parts was the big news team bedlam and the talk they had afterward about what had happened was hilarious. In conclusion, it was really silly but pretty funny too...surprisingly. And Christina Applegate is pretty hot and that always helps too."

Most of the random jokes came for Steve Carell with his 'I like lamps' phrases. Steve Carells' character even outshines Farrell whose character becomes annoying real fast (like most of the 'Frat pack' characters). The characters can be funny for five minutes. This movie seems more like a SNL skit which expands for 2 hours (which a lot of other critics have said). I think the only reason i saw this movie was so I could see what steve carroll's character would do next (hold a grenade and start screaming while everybody else is fighting).<br/><br/>This movie is not quite a guilty pleasure but it's a descent movie to watch when there is nothing better to do, or if you and your friends have a few drinks and you want to find something to laugh at when all the bars and clubs are closed."

","I'm sorry to say that I enjoyed the mind-numbingly pointless comedy of Anchorman. The movie was purely based on the comedic presence of Will Ferrell and the actors he worked with. The movie was void of all drama and acting value that a timeless movie is comprised of. Yet the simplistic, idiotic humor appeals to a primal level of the psyche. This arena of the mind, where amusement comes at a cheap price, is present in some level in all viewers and this movie taps into that aspect of one's intellect. Although it doesn't particularly stand out from any other comedy of its kind, the shear volume of idiotic, pointless humor makes this movie shamefully enjoyable. This is in part due to the complete commitment of Will Ferrell to his character's persona. Additionally, this film is by no means a ""great"" film by any valid stretch of the imagination. Yet it accomplishes its goal of making one laugh hysterically for a moment until the realization that the content one is being amused by is completely devoid of all intellectual merit."

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy.<br/><br/>Easily put into my list of top 5 movies, Anchorman is very very funny. If you like movies like Zoolander and Dodgeball, you'll probably love this. The difference between Zoolander and Anchorman is ""smart comedy."" Zoolander is ""smart comedy"" while Anchorman...is not. Zoolander was meant to be a satire on male modeling, and they pulled it off very well. Anchorman, equally, if not more, funny, was meant to make people laugh because...they're so stupid. I love it. anyway, go out and buy this one, and Zoolander, and Dodgeball for that matter, in fact, buy any movie with Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, or Jack Black in it!"
"pulpface","10","1","3","24 February 2005"," Ron Burgundy is the man.
","I'm leaving some things out of this review, because I don't want to spoil the movie for you... There have been some good comedies this decade ranging from American Wedding, Old School, Undercover Brother, Austin Powers 3, Barbershop, School of Rock, Zoolander, Starchy and Hutch, Dodgeball, both Sherk movies and Bruce Almighty. However, none of these comedies have been as funny and as original as ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"". Simply put ""Anchorman"" is the funniest movie of this decade so far.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" is a 90-minute running joke, you could probably laugh throughout the entire movie. Anchorman is about a '70s news anchor named Ron Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell, who also co-wrote the movie) and his news team must adapt to new times as the station they work for bring on a new FEMALE co-anchor named Veronica Cornningstone (played by Christina Applegate, she was Kelly in Married with Children). Back in 1970's, only men where allowed to read the news. ""It's anchorman, not anchor-lady"" was the motto that Burgardy and his news team followed by. Well, the plot kind of stinks, but who cares it's a dumb comedy, nobody cares about the plot when it's entertaining (sort of like porn).<br/><br/>Onto the Channel 4 news team, who is the #1 news station in San Diego (and hated by every other news station, most of all by Channel 9 led by Wes Mantooth (played by Vince Vaughn)). The Ch. 4 news team is made up of 5-time Emmy winner anchor Burgundy, Champ Kind and his famous catch-phrase ""WHAMMY!!!"" on sports, Brick Tamland, who is so dumb that he loves lamp, covers weather and Brian ""Da Bri"" Fantana, who owns every type of cologne possible (even ones that are banned in other countries), as lead field reporter. All four of these guys are stupid, horny, argonaut, drunk and sharply dress. Champ (played by Dave Koechner) is a bit over-the-top, however though that's probably because his blood-alcohol level becomes illegal ten minutes right after he wakes up. ""Da Bri"" (played by Paul Rudd) thinks he's a cross between John Homles and Ron Jeremy when it comes to sex. He is so cocky he has a name for his penis and both of his nuts. Brick (played by Steve Carell, Bruce's enemy in Bruce Almighty and he was also on the Daily Show) has an IQ of 48 and likes to eat toasted mayo. Out of these three characters, Brick is by-far the funniest because he is just so dumb.<br/><br/>Now, some of you might be wondering ""I hope Applegate doesn't ruin this movie!"" and ""does she get naked?"". No and no. Applegate does come up with some good one-liners to insult Ron and the gang and this is a PG-13 movie, so there isn't any nudity.<br/><br/>Also in ""Anchorman"" there were a lot of cameos as well. And if there are a lot of cameos that must mean it's a good movie. I already said that Vince Vaughn was in there and he had a funny part, in fact all cameos were funny, which included Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller. However, the best cameo was by Jack Black. I won't give away too much, however the scene that he is in, shows him p*ssed off and Ron scared with his dog.<br/><br/>Ron Burgundy is by-far Will Ferrell's best role and right now he is probably the #1 comedy actor in Hollywood (even though Ben Stiller put up a good fight in Dodgeball). You can put Ron Burgundy on the list ""comedy characters that put an actor to the top"" along with Rodney Dangerfield's and Bill Murray's characters in Caddyshack, Eddie Murphy's role in 48 hours and Jim Carrey in ""the Mask"".<br/><br/>I bet some of you have seen the trailer, well about 90% of the trailer is not in the movie (and there were some funny parts in the trailer as well). This was very unusual, especially for a comedy, because usually, all the funniest parts are in the trailer. However, there is a rumor going around that there will be an UN-CUT edition of this movie, which has a chance to beat out ""Caddyshack"" for funniest movie of all-time.<br/><br/>Grade: 9.5 out of 10 (the only reason there it doesn't get the 10 was because they did make fun of Pres. Bush in the movie, liberal bastards).<br/><br/>GO SEE ANCHORMAN!!!"
"jpschapira","7","1","3","13 February 2005"," Will Ferrell is making it
","Every time I watched Saturday Night Live (a program I don't watch at the moment), I always thought all the cast was good. They were all funny, and still are. But there were these two guys who were the funniest (in my personal opinion): Norm McDonald and Will Ferrell. Both of them were destined to movies. The first one chose television, and he's still stuck there. The second one, well, has the lead role in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"".<br/><br/>This movie is funny, very funny. And the main reason is its cast, with Will Ferrell at his best, as always (he also co-wrote the screenplay). He makes his character believable, although he's always overdoing it. He gives Burgundy the charm and ignorance he needs, and the good heart he shows to have. I laughed a lot watching him.<br/><br/>The supporting cast finds the place in this piece. I find in Paul Rudd a gifted actor. I loved him in ""The Shape of Things"", one of my favorite recent films. There, and here also, he does things naturally. Christina Applegate is the important female character, and probably the only one. She seems to be having a good time, overacting most of the scenes, but making them fun (""Take me to Pleasure City"", funny). Steve Carell is fine, but his character seems very familiar to the one he played in ""Bruce Almighty"". And about David Koechner, well, he doesn't have much to do. His Champ could have been a better character.<br/><br/>And I have to say the small appearance by Danny Trejo and the cameos of Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black were awesome! <br/><br/>About directing and writing, I must say. McKay and Ferrell did the whole thing right. They have worked together in Saturday Night Live and they sure know what they are doing. They know each other, and it seems they had fun writing this stuff. I have no doubt that they'll be doing some other things soon. They love doing this! The rest of the environment is pleasant. There's a constant joy feeling in the set and it's contagious. The film has some scenes that reach stupidity. Maybe what this people were trying to do was that. Make a fool of them, or at least, of the characters they were playing. The scenes I'm talking about are the ones that make you feel like a total fool(""Afternoon Delight"", who responds to love with that?, very funny).<br/><br/>I could describe many more things, but I don't want to spoil the ride for you.<br/><br/>So I will just put it like this: ""When in Rome..."""

","I'm watching this again for the 4th time. I bought a little over a month ago & after watching it, stopping to text someone the funny lines. This person on other end of text is who encouraged me to buy. I watched it again in full w/o interruption right after 1st viewing. Again, watched the next morning. I laughed as hard as I did the 1st two times if not more, because I missed a lot of things. A++ I suggest this movie to anyone who is having a bad day or merely wants a good laugh to life their spirits! It's a given, you'll laugh HARD at least 3 times, ha ha!

","i believe that this is the funniest movie ever. but a lot of people disagree. but they're WRONG!................it is so awesome will Ferrel is brilliant and every other actor in it is just so brilliant. the cameos were awesome and it had all of my favourite comedic actors in it apart from the great man, Jim Carey. it had an awesome storyline and wasn't low brow in any way...............it had me stitches for ages...........but i found that a lot of the people in the cinema weren't laughing.........only me and my buddy did which was very disappointing considering we loved it......it is as funny as zoolander.........and it will go down with the greats of meet the parents, old school, ace Ventura, school of rock, orange county, and a long list of other films, at the moment i cant think of them all and i will remember it later and will be very annoyed."

","This movie shows why Will Ferrell gets the attention he deserves. It was hilarious. Paul Rudd pulls off a funny performance showing his comedic acting well established in Wet Hot American Summer. I loved this movie and will continue to look for more films with Will Ferrell. The list of cameos in here adds to the overall enjoyment level of the film. Vince Vaughn continues to impress me the more I see him in comedies. Some of the scenes are a little hokey like the dream/sex sequence. Steve Carrell is great. Chris Parnell is great in a supporting role. Fred Willard continues to answer the bill in no matter what role he is asked to play. I loved this film and would recommend it to anyone!!!"
"jonnydamaj","9","1","3","7 February 2005"," Something strange seems to have happened?
","I am slightly confused! Having seen the score given to Anchorman (a mid 6 is creditable, but not great) and the mixed reviews this film has received, I can only come to one conclusion. Half of the reviewers watched the same 'Anchorman: the legend of Ron Burgundy' as I did, the others must have watched the little known TV movie 'Anchorman: the legend of Roy Bogard' featuring the little known comic talent Wally Farrell. Yes, that is truly the only explanation as to why some of you did not enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Ferrel is magnificent- hilarious in almost every quip and a truly likable, if flawed, character. Christina Applegate does a good job as well, but its Steve Carrel who really puts the icing on the cake. His understated performance as the imbecilic Brick Tamland is genius (eg 'loud noises', 'toilet store, I love carpet, hand grenade moment, trident, etc, etc) The early Pink Panther movies, Naked Gun and some of Sandler's finest moments may challenge this title, but at the moment having just watched 'Anchorman' twice this weekend, I've got to say that presently I'd rate this as the funniest movie ever.<br/><br/>Doubters: Check the box before you rent."

","While watching Anchorman,I had to clutch my belly because of all the uproarious laughing I did.Don't get me wrong,it isn't high art,there's no plot or character development,but who cares?Anchorman is funny,in the spirit of the Naked Gun series and the hilarious comedies in the 60's and 70's like Police Academy and Airplane.It makes no sense,that's why it's so funny.And best of all,it's funny 100% of the time,and it NEVER takes itself too seriously,the problem with many comedies these days.Will Ferrell does a great job,playing a macho,super-pompous news anchorman (duh),the scene where he plays jazz flute is really funny.And Steve Carrell's portrayal of Brick TAmlin,the mentally disabled weatherman is unforgettable.A must see for comedy lovers everywhere!!"
"Bigcritic73","5","1","3","1 February 2005"," Dumb Movie, Brilliant Commentary
","This movie was bad, but had its moments of low-brow humor that elicited some chuckles. At the end of the movie, I felt as if there were something missing from the overall experience. Curious as to what the co-writers were thinking as they wrote the film, I decided to watch the commentary voice-over feature on the DVD. I almost never watch the commentary, so this was purely a fortuitous happenstance.<br/><br/>When they collaborate, Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are comedic geniuses. The commentary offers a glimpse into what these guys do when they get together. The commentary is basically a brainstorming, free-for-all that stands apart from the movie, as they actually comment on the movie only a fraction of the time. The rest of the time is spent staging humiliating, awkward moments with other cast-members, un-cast actors like Andy Richter and even entertaining a surprise visit by Lou Rawls. Poor Lou had no idea what was going on. Adam McKay asked Rawls if he thought Ferrell should agree to make a movie called ""Dwarf,"" a movie about a naive dwarf transplanted to New York City from the North Pole. Ferrell is adamantly against the idea and Rawls tries to act as go-between. Its almost like an Ali G interview - very awkward to hear. The introduction to the commentary had me laughing to tears, it was crass, but really, very funny."

It really showcases the best abilities of Farrell, Applegate, and especially Steve Carell. I have no negative criticism of this movie.<br/><br/>The majority of the negative criticisms I've read have focused on how this movie is too sophomoric. But isn't that the point? When you watch a movie like this, don't you want it to be sophomoric? And these guys do a great job with this."

","One of the funniest movies of 2004, if not, the funniest, is a gut-wrenching laughfest that will make you laugh if you have sense of humour. <br/><br/>The movie exploits the life of ""real life"" anchor, Ron Burgundy, or at least attempts. i don't know , I've never seen the real Ron. However this movies has characters that expose extreme dumb hilarity. Characters like Brick and Jack Black's cameo appearance, Will Ferrell's stupid humour.<br/><br/>All in all, this is quite possibly the funniest movie of 2004. Extremely hilarious."
"Hollywood_Yoda","10","1","3","12 January 2005"," Ron Burgundy: A Very Funny Movie
","When I first saw this film, I couldn't stop from laughing. It was just so funny. Will Ferrell as a 1970's anchorman, bent on sexual behavior. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but after I started, i just couldn't stop.<br/><br/>Ron Burgundy, who just loves to have fun, kind of reminds me of, well, ME! His attitude, and his behavior, and his social skills.<br/><br/>You can't beat the fight in the alley though, with all the news anchors in San Diego. There was Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Luke Wilson, and non other than Will Ferrell. This is definitely the part you should not miss.<br/><br/>I had to just give this movie a 10 of 10 rating. And if your'e able, you should see Wake Up, Ron Burgundy; because you will love it too."
"kashta","10","1","3","11 January 2005"," The guy at the rental place was wrong.
","I saw this movie on a flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Atlanta, having watched most of it in the Ft. Lauderdale airport. This movie was horrible if you are too high browed or have completely no sense of humor. The guy in the airport DVD rental thingy type place said it was horrible and he couldn't even get through it. Knowing how incredibly stupid I am, I had to see it.<br/><br/>I haven't laughed that hard in a long long long time, watching a movie. <br/><br/>Rental attendant: ""It's horrible, it's like 'Elf'!"" Me: ""I LOVED ELF!"" Rental attendant: ""Okay, you MIGHT like this one.""<br/><br/>I'm not even feeling elf right now, Anchorman was so much better. ""I'm going to punch you in the ovaries"" and ""Oh gosh! It smells like Bigfoot's d*ck!"" are two lines that show you where the comedy is in this movie. Don't expect any intelligent humor here, it's gone, regardless of what these actors are capable of. Just sit back and ALLOW the sheer stupidity to wash over you. I give this a movie a 10, because for what it is -- a stupid slapstick comedy -- it's up there with Airplane. Basically, it's airplane, just not as stupid, and more funny. Police Squad with better quality comedy."

","Check out this flick if you: a. enjoy goofy plot lines b. understand that overacting is sometimes a good thing d. love lamps.<br/><br/>Anchorman doesn't give you any knowledge about anything that you didn't already know before starting the film. But what it does do is comment on that knowledge, hams it up a little (often), and inserts a 1970's Disney Animation Parody that would make the cartoonists for Mary Poppins excited beyond the bounds of prescription induced intensity.<br/><br/>If you watch this looking to find something sure fire in comedy, I can't guarantee it will deliver. But if you'd like to take a risk on a film experimenting with the rules of comedy, I would suggest it. It's a 50-50 chance; it really depends on what type of person you are.

"Aysen08","3","1","3","6 January 2005"," Pure Drivel!!
","I was debating on whether to rent this movie or not considering that all the reviews were complete fence walking between who liked and disliked the movie, but decided to go ahead since Will Ferrell hasn't been so bad in other movies and was decent in SNL. BIG MISTAKE! This movie was horrid. The jokes are canned, flat, and just unfunny overall. If there is something to be made fun of, it was hit, and badly.<br/><br/>To think that this many people could be this straight out stupid in real life and even function on a daily basis is absurd. If breathing weren't an involuntary function I'm sure they'd have died already.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing to like about the Ron Burgundy character at all. Will Ferrell as a supporting moron tends to render him an alright actor, but between a bad script and the bad acting he's just not good as a leading man. Veronica Corningstone, by Christina Applegate was likable until she fell for the worst pick up attempt in history and stoops to being as ridiculous as the other asinine characters.<br/><br/>Only saving graces in the movie were Steve Carell as Brick Tamland and the brief appearance by Jack Black as the angry biker. Carell's character is the only one who manages to bring any real laughs and completely outshines his co-stars AND he's the only one who's supposed to be ""retarded."" Bad script, bad humor, and warning to parents that the PG-13 rating is pushed heavily with the sexual content (seeing Will Ferrell's chest hair is upsetting enough, I just keep praying that it's not really his...YUCK). Overall just don't waste your time. If you want to watch a movie with an idiot who's funny, try Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, who both incidentally make appearances (lamely) in this movie...I now know why they both went uncredited for staring in this piece of garbage. At best 3/10."

Also, if you don't care for Will Ferrell you probably won't enjoy this movie. Don't expect a beautiful plot either. Most of the jokes are plain silly. If you are into that kind of humor you will love this movie, if not, maybe not so much. I would recommend this movie but not to all audiences. This kind of movie is the one you can't really read reviews on to judge but must see it for yourself. Will Ferrell was great in this movie and if you go by my word, I would definitely recommend it"

This is one of those movies that will move to the 'classic' comedy category, or at least 'my' classic category. Loved the Anchorman back alley brawl, Brick's excessively stupid comments, and the panther cologne scene where everyone runs away and uses HILARIOUS comments like, ""something smells like a turd wrapped in burnt hair"" - a line I will be sure to use in the future to reference a foul odor.

"DeeNine-2","3","1","3","19 December 2004"," Doesn't live up to the hype
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>How stupid is this? Well, pretty stupid. Consider the scene where the News at Five teams from the various local stations (in San Diego) square off, gladiator style complete with tridents, swords and axes. Or how about Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) reading everything put on the teleprompter--""You put it there, he'll read it"" including the ""f"" word. Or the musical score in the background, a selection of the most sappy seventies tunes including (God help us) ""Skyrockets in flight/Afternoon delight."" I watched this on a United Airlines flight and took a read on the other passengers. The guy in the window seat was in and out of sleep most of the time, and there weren't many of the other passengers laughing, at least not aloud. However I have to say almost everybody put on their headsets and watched. I attribute that to the mass bucks the producers spent on advertising. I just had to check it out.<br/><br/>And it WAS kind of fascinating to see a film done this way, so much so that even if you don't laugh, you might be glued to the tube anyway. The satirical idea is to lampoon TV news anchors as empty-headed, surface kind of people who wouldn't know a differential equation from their hair spray. Ferrell is perfectly shallow and vain and arrogant--and that is right on target. However he proves the counterpoint to the movie's premise by actually being Quite a Guy, especially in the scene at the bar restaurant when he gets up to play the flute. He plays one mean flute, I gotta tell you.<br/><br/>Ferrell gets support from Christine Applegate as Veronica Corningstone who wants to become the anchorperson herself. Most comedy fans will remember Applegate as the ditsy and voluptuous Kelly from TV's ""Married with Children"" where she started out when she was something like 14-years-old. However, you might not recognize her at first glance since (1) she is trimmer, although she still has a bodacious figure; and (2) she's had the pre-mature wrinkles under her eyes surgically removed and her face looks a little different.<br/><br/>Although this is a burlesque of the ""reality"" at your local news station, some of it is strangely real. For example, the lead story constantly being the latest update on the panda bears at the San Diego Zoo and the media frenzy surrounding them is pretty much true. Also real was the fanatical insistence by the TV producers (as a means to higher ratings) to feature human interest and crime stories as entertainment for couch potatoes.<br/><br/>One of the funniest bits in the movie is near the beginning when Ron Burgundy tries out his unique pick-up style on Veronica by telling her that she has one very fine rear engine...or words to that effect, and she comes back with something like, ""You sure know how to flatter a girl,"" the sarcasm as heavy as molasses in January at the North Pole.<br/><br/>See this for Will Ferrell, whose over-the-top performance fascinates even when he isn't funny, and just kind of zone out on the dead parts that don't quite make it."
"tek_07","8","1","3","15 December 2004"," A Fine Example of True Comedy in our Time
","Will Ferrell is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most talented comedians in feature film rotation today, and by the stream of movies being developed with him in them, I'm not the only one to believe so. So maybe Elf wasn't the hilarious work we expected from Ferrell, but this movie is just wonderful.<br/><br/>I don't know if I'm the only one sick of these ""hilarious"" attempts from previous entertaining comedians. Adam Sandlers recent attempts at comedy were lackluster, and Ben Stiller is single-handedly digging a grave created a parody of himself with the garbage he has been making, seemingly a movie a month. But when this movie hit, it was down right humorous. Maybe it's Ferrell's style that I like, and from observing lots of his SNL tough, he's known to repeat this type of character. Whether or not he will reuse it in the future or not is beyond me, but this film is a delight.<br/><br/>Just watching the opening sequence makes me laugh-out-loud, while Ron Burgundy prepares for a broadcast, he's told he's on the air, and simply replies after a awkward pause "" I Don't Believe You. "" It's little things like that, that made this movie a spectacular comedy. It isn't one of 2004's best films, but it's one of the best comedies in the past few years. To even compare it to Dodgeball is ridiculous, this has a light-hearted story you can watch over, nobody wants a underdog overcoming the conglomerate emperor sports movie, where the underdogs overcome their handicaps, and reign supreme in a movie of luck in the finals of the game.<br/><br/>No Brainer, when Anchorman comes out on DVD December 28th, 2004, I'll have bought it, and loved it. It'll amuse you, and keep you entertained, even if you hate to laugh.<br/><br/>A must have to your DVD collection. *** 1/2 out of *****"

Granted Christina Applegate is not the greatest of comedic actresses but she has to work hard to compete with Will Ferrell's ferocious comic timing and delivery. Everyline in this movie will make you laugh, some a bit, most a lot. The fact that another movie (wake up, Ron Burgandy) has been cut together out the additional footage shot shows how many ideas are used here.

Will Ferrell's characters in other movies, such as the magnificent and under-appreciated 'Dick,' (1999-ish) and the solid 'Zoolander,' (2001)have always been unpleasant dorks. His characters have always been the darker, villainous types, always odious. 'Anchorman,' however, avoids the easy path of making his character simply a prat, simply an a**hole. The character is, actually, dim-witted and naive, rather than malevolent or mean. One gets the impression that he just doesn't know any better, that he wouldn't be all that bad of a person to know, even when he does do the arrogant and narcissistic things (typical of many, one assumes, who lust after careers as 'news models').<br/><br/>The supporting cast, especially Christina Applegate, are wonderful! Overall, a funny movie with a bit more depth and meaning than might have been in a satire. Well worth seeing!"

","Will Ferrell is a comedic actor who not everyone enjoys. And when I say not everyone, I mean I don't enjoy him either.<br/><br/>That said, I did like the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy skits. Doesn't matter. Ron Burgundy is typical Ferrell humor; if you like it, then you'll like this movie--otherwise, steer clear of it.<br/><br/>To me it's like a SNL skit drawn out way too far. Ron is an anchorman who has some problems with the new reporter at the station, a woman. Then some stuff happens, there's some other crap that happens, and generally a whole bunch of lame jokes bombard the theatre-goer.<br/><br/>I only recommend to fans of Ferrell."

","This is hardly a perfect film. The plotting and logic of the film seem to trip along at breakneck speed(of course,I'm willing to buy the fact that that was the way it was intended)to the point of delirium. And it does seem to gloss over some of the finer points of San Diego(To echo what one person who wrote on the Imdb about the show who hailed from that area). But this film was still LMAO funny!  Steve Carell and, to a lesser degree,Paul Rudd really do steal their scenes! Ferrell is a blast as the overconfident,vain and somewhat doltish title character and Applegate earned every penny of her paycheck not cracking up through too many scenes. Offhand,this is a 3 out of 4 Star film,good tonic for those who grow eary of heavy-handed sci-fi/actioner movies being cranked out over the summer."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Fellow SNL writers and alum (Director) Adam McKay and Will Ferrell deliver a decent comedy with solid writing and mediocre direction.  It misses being a great comedy because it fails to provide any ""Classic moments or lines"" that we associate with the great ones.  We can all quote lines from ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Office Space"" and ""Caddyshack"", but my guess is ""Anchorman"" will fade to black.  I say this despite the pure genius of Will Ferrell, who is the funniest guy working today in film.  He prevents the film from sliding into nothingness.  His physical presence and facial gestures are enough to keep the audience smiling ... but rarely howling.  Christina Applegate (""Married With Children"") is miscast and mostly awful in her poorly written role.  Jury is out on whether she will make a successful transition to film.  Overall, I was definitely hoping for better."

He said like the dumbest lines but it came out to be hilarious! I did love Rob Burgundy but I still didn't think he was better than White Goodman in Dodgeball.

","I saw Will Ferrell's new film Ancorman today, and was in stitches from beginning to end. I already knew that he was a comedy genius, but this is his best work ever (sure beats Old School). Unfortunately, when I saw the movie, there were some idiots sitting behind me yacking on there cell phones, but that did not stop me from enjoying it.<br/><br/>So the plot of Ancorman is that there's this man named Ron Burgundy, who basically the James Bond of San Deigo Journalisam. He and his news team buddies are the top of the heap in the rating, life is good. Unfortunitly for the boys, A new anchor person from Ashville, NC comes to The city of Saint Deigo, and this particular person (to everyone surprise) is a woman. Now in the 70's, a woman anchor was un-heard of (except of coruse for Barbra Walters who was on the Today show during the 60's and 70's). Anyway, everyone on the news team was pretty peeved about it, but all tried to get a piece of her (If you know what I mean) Veronica (played by Christina Applegate) is a womans woman trapped in a mans world who's trying to make herself respected in a mans world. <br/><br/>The whole film will make you laugh so hard, you'll spit the popcorn out of you mouth. I give it 3 1/2 stars and suggest it to anyone over 13 who loves good comedy and music from the 70's. You stay classy IMDb."
"zetes","9","1","3","11 July 2004"," Thank God! A movie that is actually funny!
","I was afraid I'd be getting another Dodgeball here, especially when I saw that the completely talentless Vince Vaughn was on the payroll, but nope. This doesn't pull any punches. It's also the movie that Will Ferrell deserves to star in. He's far too funny to make crap like Old School and Elf. This is his movie and he dominates. His talent with words is unmistakable. He plays arrogant anchorman Ron Burgundy, of course. Christina Applegate wants to take his job away from him and become the first anchorwoman in the United States (the story takes place in the 1970s). Applegate doesn't have too much to do here, although some of her insults are classic. She's mostly the straightman here. Most of the laughs after Ferrell come from his news team, made up of Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Steven Carell. They're all funny, but Carell, as a weatherman with a tiny IQ, gets the most laughs. The movie is successful both when it is playing jokes on Burgundy's arrogance and when it gets entirely surreal. The funniest scene in the film involves a huge rumble between five different news teams. I could hardly breathe during this sequence. And the climactic scene is outrageous! Anchorman also employs two devices that usually betray a sense of desperation, the celebrity cameo and outtakes during the credits. It might be the only time these cameos ever made me laugh, and the outtakes are really funny mostly because they are made up of alternative improvisations. Except for an outtake from Smoky and the Bandit that hilariously sneaks up. I can't imagine that there'll be a funnier movie this year. In fact, as it is easily the most consistently good movie I've seen in 2004, it probably qualifies as my favorite film of the year, at least so far. 9/10."

","I worked at a TV station in San Diego in the early 70's. I remember the anchorman that Ron Burgundy is based on. I was the first female engineer they had there. This movie makes such a mockery of the real women with real stories to tell about breaking into the man's world of television. I know, because I was one of them. This movie was full of crude, meaningless sexual jokes, and I feel like they wasted their time and money when they could have been telling real stories about real women who were the real heroes who had to put up with crude sexual jokes and harassment from men who couldn't figure out why they wanted to be there. I hope someone takes the time to tell *our* stories for real."

","Will Farrell, in his funniest movie since ""Old School"", stars as ego-driven, chauvenistic, Ron Burgundy i this movie that sets itself in the 70's, when news shows were more or less a mens' business. The problem with the movie is the Ron gets emascalated far too quickly and the PG-13 rating hampers the comedy that much more. Not to be misunderstood, I did enjoy the film Steven Carrell as kind of a grown-up Ralph Wiggum, and the Jack Black cameo was one of the funniest things I've seen at the cinema in a while. It's just that so much more could've been done with the scenerio and it wasn't. Ron is seen as too incompetent, and Christina Appelgate's Veronica too good at everything she does. The Bush joke was also groan-worthy, it would've been good if EVERY comedy since 2001 didn't have at least one Bush joke.<br/><br/>My Grade: C+"

The movie includes tons of cameos, from such great actors as Jack Black, Ben Stiller (as the lead anchor for the Spanish speaking news channel), Tim Robbins, and Luke Wilson. This movie also includes one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen, the news channel turf war. This is where you see Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, and Luke Wilson.

This film is perfect for those who have or lack a brain, with the great comedic acting of not only Will Ferrell (Ron Burgundy), but of Steve Carell (Brick Tamland), Paul Rudd (Brian Fantana), David Koechner (Champ Kind), and Christina Applegate (Veronica Corningstone). The best part of the movie is the newscast war in the street that turns into a ""bilingual blood-fest"". The best character was definitely Brick, played by the Daily Show with Jon Stewart's Steve Carell. Carell's mentally retarded weatherman really keeps you laughing the whole way through, even through serious parts. From beginning to end this movie is a laugh riot.

","When Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy first hit cinema screens, I did not go to see it. It seemed like another predictable, unfunny waste of time; another Sandler-esquire love-in for the comedy frat-pack.<br/><br/>The reviews it got in the press did not command viewing either, and so it was not until it came out on DVD that I gave in and rented it out; see what all the (not very much) fuss was about.<br/><br/>That evening, I cursed my pomposity those three months before. I should have seen it in the cinema. I laughed throughout, and the lines kept on coming, thick and fast. I decline to write any on this comment, because I couldn't possibly do them any justice. Rest assured, if and when you go see this, you will not regret it, and you will laugh your ass off.<br/><br/>The one problem is that Ferrell lifted his Ron Burgundy character from Steve Coogan's eminently superior Alan Partridge, and Americanised him. He does a good job at it, but Coogan is still the master, so get acquainted with Mr. Partridge before you see this movie, just so you know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>In closing, Anchorman is a splendid way to spend 1 1/2 hours, and s thoroughly deserving of the accolade: ""2004's best comedy""."

","Firstly I am no will ferrel fan, but I am seriously getting tired of hearing about this particular movie. I saw this once in the theater (sadly) when it first came out, I don't remember laughing much. But all over the net everyone seems to quote this movie, that and I got the feeling it must be some kinda cult movie thing that only hipsters like. So it was on TV and I decided to watch some it. WOW. its terrible. its not funny. its no different then any other stupid will ferrel comedy, which means its basically ferrel screaming and acting stupid, more screaming, over reacting that wasn't very funny at all in the first place. I couldn't stand him on SNL, and I cant stand him now. he is NOT a ""comedic genius"" in the same way andy kaufmen is not. both were known for being really stupid and there was not even a whiff of intelligence in there comedy. Now, think about some truly great comedic actors, like Bill Murray. That guy is hilarious no matter WHAT he does. Yes, bill was also guilty of acting like an idiot but that was VERY early in his career and even when he WAS acting stupid, he was still 100% more funny and fun to watch then anything will Ferrell has ever done. Bill Murray is great because he can be funny but then be emotional and someone you feel for. He can be funny one minute and serious the next. Scrooged is a perfect example. Ferrell clearly does not have that kind of range as an actor, and if THIS crap is supposed to be for Ferrell what Groundhog day is to bill Murray, then I must concur with the other poster who said this is the Death of Good Comedy. somewhere in the 2000's comedy got painfully unfunny with VERY few exceptions. What's interesting is that I watched the first 2 teenage mutant ninja turtle movies from the 90's with my Girlfriend recently (having never seen them before) and almost busted my ribs laughing at some of the stuff in those movies. yet an actual ""comedy"" like this made me laugh not even once, instead it only made me think ""well THAT was gross"" and ""ew, people really find this crap funny? Have peoples standards gotten this low?"". Another movie that is somehow popular and stupid that I hate is super troopers. what's the deal with these junk movies? not funny, not funny, and NOT FUNNY! enough with Ferrell, put him in a cage and throw away the key already."

"MovieAddict2016","6","1","5","6 January 2005"," Funny but inconsistent with only a few memorable segments
","Being a big fan of Will Ferrell and ""SNL"" humor in general I made a blind buy with the ""Anchorman"" DVD. I had heard it was supposed to be very funny, and to some extent it is - there are a few scenes that are hilarious, and a few clever/subtle jokes that you might miss on first viewing.<br/><br/>However, I was overall disappointed with the film, and felt it was a bit too silly and over-the-top. I do enjoy silly comedies but this one was just a bit too childish - the first ten minutes are awful stuff, with not a single good joke, and just loads of lame sex gags.<br/><br/>However the ""Gangs of New York"" battle spoof is utterly hilarious and no doubt the scene I will remember most. It has a handful of really funny jokes - ""Oh yeah? Well you're about to be in dead place!"" being one of them.<br/><br/>The cameos are really amusing - Ben Stiller, Vince Vaugn, Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Tim Robbins amongst them (there are also some SNL actor cameos scattered throughout). However the one thought I came away with was this: Ben Stiller really needs to slow down the amount of movies he's starring in! Cameo or not....<br/><br/>Ferrell is funny as always and (as always) never breaks character. He's good at doing this and like Phil Hartman is the sort of comedian who, even off-screen, still seems to act distant and humorous. Ron Burgundy is a funny character, and Ferrell portrays him well. The movie's sexist commentary of the 1970s and the clever news group insights are worth watching for, as are some of the few funny scenes - however overall this really is a disappointment, being too childish and stupid, and I for one just felt it missed a lot of potential.<br/><br/>That said, some of the jokes will stay with you, like, ""Because you're probably wanted for murder."" It's a testament to Ferrell's abilities that he can make unfunny lines very funny, relying solely on pronunciation and delivery for effectiveness."

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy follows a news anchor called Ron Burgundy (as the title suggests) who is considered something of a celebrity, when a new female anchor shows up and tries to one-up him. <br/><br/>The movie is hilariously over-the-top in most every aspect of it. The acting, for starters, is obviously fake but supposed to be. Basically the entire main cast (Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Steve Carell) is completely over-the-top in their performances, but each one is kind of dumb in their own overdone way. It's hilarious and considering everyone is like this it's clear that that's the style the movie is going for, so it isn't distracting. <br/><br/>The comedic aspect itself outside of the acting is fantastic. The movie is, again, way over-the-top. But it's a funny kind of over- the-top, where clearly everything is supposed to be taken with a grain of salt, or the characters are simply saying something so out there yet in character that you can't help but laugh. <br/><br/>Overall Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is great fun to watch.

"The-Sarkologist","4","0","1","22 October 2016"," That Escalated Quickly
","There was really only one reason that I ended up watching this film and that had to do with that meme that was really popular round 2011 (and still appears around the place). I knew that it was connected to this film, but had never really thought about it all that much until one night when there was not all that much to do and had been reminded of it after seeing a friend's Facebook post. Anyway, when the film had hit the cinemas I wasn't particularly interested in it (but then again it was 2004 so I wasn't really spending huge amounts of time in the cinemas in any case), and it had never really grabbed my attention, even when the sequel was released. Well, as it turned out, other than a few funny moments, I now understand why I never went out of my way to watch it – it wasn't all that great.<br/><br/>The film is set in San Diego in the early seventies, back before there was cable as the narrator tells us, and in a time when men dominated the new rooms. Burgundy is the multi-award winning anchor of the Channel Four news and has managed to secure the top ratings. Everything seems to be going well for him and his crew until the network decides to introduce a bit of diversity and brings in a woman journalist, who wants to also be an anchor. Mind you, unlike now, this was a male dominated industry, so when Veronica Corningstone enters the office all of the men suddenly want a piece of her.<br/><br/>Sure, Anchorman has quite a few classic lines (such as 'that escalated quickly'), but in the end it is your typical American comedy – funny in places but basically a feel good movie where everything works out well in the end, and with the exception of the guy that has a trident thrust through his chest, nobody really dies, or at least dies in a serious manner. However, the catch is that while one could argue about equal opportunity in the workplace, and with women being just as capable of performing the roles of men, in reality this is once again little more than your typical, sexist, American movie. Sure, we do have an element of girl power, but the way that the women are treated, especially at the beginning of the film, is nothing short of atrocious.<br/><br/>Sure, some suggest that such films are funny because they have no shame in what they make fun at, and sure I agree that there is a form of censorship over what people can actually say and that we go out of our way not to say things that just might offend somebody; however there is also the case that sometimes we make mockery of people who have really no way of being able to defend themselves. Yet, there is also the case that these rather successful people are all basically morons – it is just that they are celebrities, and because they are celebrities then they are successful, though all they can do is read a teleprompter, and look good.<br/><br/>However the other interesting thing is that Ron is painted as not actually being all that sweet tongue, especially at the beginning (his attempt to chat up Veronica is absolutely disastrous). However, we must also note that he does eventually succeed quite early on in the film, and also despite Veronica wishing to keep this quiet, he does anything but – in fact he shouts it not just from his office, but also live on air. Isn't it also quite interesting that Ron (at least) gets an office, while Veronica spends the entire film at a desk with everybody else. Oh, the other thing is that this film is pretty predictable, particularly since I could see a joke with the teleprompter coming right from the beginning of the film – though that might have more to do with Chekov's gun, not that Hollywood actually has any hard and fast rules that they follow."

Will Ferrell is top anchorman Ron Burgundy who feels threatened with the possibility of a female anchor. Issues arise such as women in top positions but director Adam McKay successfully combines cultural elements with variety of comic fare ranging from witty dialogue to extreme slapstick such as a scene where several news teams meet for a fight to the death. Ferrell brings a balance of hilarity and humanity to Burgundy. He loves attention yet he is also smitten with this female anchor and announces his involvement with her on live TV. Christina Applegate delivers a great performance struggling with chauvinism on the job while still enabling Burgundy to prove his manhood in a climax that has them both in a dangerous place. Great comic supporting work by Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and Steve Carell who delivers many of the most hilarious outbursts. They are Burgundy's fellow journalists who follow his every command and each carry different comic approaches. Rudd introduces us to Black Panther spray. Koechner gives us the term, ""Whammy!""

For animal lovers, there are a few animals in this movie, and, yes, they will leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling. The only negative I have of this film was that Christina Applegate's make-up did not completely do her justice. The lipstick was too dark and shiny. Aside from that, the movie was great fun and kept me laughing throughout."

","This is the first time I have watched this movie in about five years and I can remember it being pretty funny but after watching it this time, it was laugh out loud hilarious and it reminded me that not every movie needs to be scrutinized in terms of acting, directing, plot holes and more in the way you might analyze a drama. My advice for watching this movie is not to think too hard but to relax and have a fun time. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, who is the anchorman for KVWN Channel 4 which is enjoying high rating thanks to him and his crew of misfits, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd)- the lead field reporter, Champ Kind (David Koechner)- sports reporter and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the intellectually disabled weatherman. Set in the 1970's which their news panel featured an all male line up, station director Ed Harken (Fred Willard) tells them in order to move with the times, they've had to hire a female, Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate). It's a dumb comedy, but a great, affable type of dumb comedy and I for one appreciate this type of humor where it can be over the top and still make me laugh so much from their gags. Credit has to go to Will Ferrell who also co-wrote this comedy masterpiece and it clearly has aged too bad. Everyone of the cast played their roles well from a comedy perspective and the cameos from fellow ""Frat Packers"" like Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Jack Black as well as Tim Robbins and Danny Trejo add to the fun."
"Sandcooler","9","0","1","2 December 2014"," A night at the improv
","A comedy that mostly ditches the script and gives the actors their freedom can really only go two ways: it's either going to be really good or really terrible. It just depends on how well the actors play off one another and how long they have to ramble on before a decent punchline comes along. Thankfully, this movie is chock full of fantastic comedians so there was never really much of a risk. If you put Will Ferrell and Steve Carell in a room together you can count on it that they'll have something good in five minutes, and writer/director Adam McKay (without underestimating his input, obviously) lets the magic happen. It also helps that Will Ferrell knows everyone, so there are a lot of amusing cameos in here. They just keep piling on new familiar faces as the movie progresses, without it ever feeling forced. ""Anchorman"" is just about as disjointed and filled with non-sequiturs as a movie can get, but in the final act there's even some room for character development and a genuinely touching ending. Infinitely rewatchable."

","The movie starts off right as many stupid comedies do, making a group of people look like they fall under some spell of following stupidity, this time it's the whole San Diego watching Ron. It then builds the story well enough, introducing the character who is the source of the main conflict in a common way comedies do, a hyperbole of spotlight among a group of people. The rest feels just like other movies, but with Will Ferrell's funny yet stupid babbling. The jokes are not really balanced on the funny scale; most of them fall short on cracking a laugh from me. Will Ferrell acted his comedy part quite nicely, going total on those stupid babbling stuff. Christina Applegate gives the balancing role a good spirit, taking more part compared on her other comedies. I like what Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, and even Tim Robbins did for smaller roles in this movie."

Ron Burgandy is a cinematic character who reinvented this criteria in order to move us. By move us I mean make us laugh our asses off. Will Ferrell does his most outrageous and hilarious work in 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" Ron Burgundy is a handsome, charming (at least what were supposed to believe) San Diego news Anchor who with his news team report the news in a legendary fashion during the 1970's. We have Paul Rudd as Brian Fantana, a ladies man who reports in the field, Steve Carrell as Brick Tamland a mentally insane and dim-witted weather man and David Koechner as the raw sports analyst. Together, the four men are comedic brilliance and do a fine job reporting the news until Ron Burgandy is challenged by a female reporter, Veronica Corninigstone (a sweetly funny Christina Applegate)who causes a plot by adding competition to Ron. This film is the type of comedy that after seeing it the third time it starts to get old. The first two times are a blast. Will Ferrell is so funny in this film that just looking at him makes me grin. The supporting cast is very funny as well and together the cast holds a great chemistry put together by directer Adam McKay. There are many patches of dialogue that will stick with you and make you laugh by thinking of them, but really the fact that Will Ferrell pretends to be serious and how motivated Ron Burgundy is to ""saving the day"" is what tickles your ribs. This is a very entertaining comedy that deserves to be seen more than once."
"tariq-hossenbux","8","0","2","14 May 2014"," Funny but designed to show why sexist attitudes are wrong
","Ron Burgundy is a hilarious comedy that features many stupid and/or sexist jokes. Will Ferell is brilliant as a newscaster who refuses to view women as people who are capable of all the same things in the workplace as men. And it is a really funny movie. But this is also what makes it intelligent because it is a movie about how stupid such sexist attitudes are. The dated setting of the 1980s which is so different for our digital age further accentuates the message that these attitudes are not appropriate in modern society. It is out of place that Ron makes sexist jokes while dressing and viewing himself as a gentleman. Putting these types of men in immature or medieval situations drives the point that mature people should not espouse a mindset that women are not capable of the same things as men. The film strives to show us that being divided in the workplace leads to far less success than if we all work together and respect that everyone has the same dreams and aspirations of personal success."

The Story is that Anchorman Ron Burgundy and his team are a successful news show until the execs decide a female is needed among the group and then the shenanigans begin. Now this film's best part is the chemistry between all the performers every body rightly gives Will Ferrell huge credit for his portrayal as Ron Burgundy but the rest of the cast is also superb with actors like Paul Rudd and Steve Carrel showing great comedic timing and making this film one of the funniest hour and a halves your going to have with a movie. This is Will Ferrell's best performance and his best film possibly however, there are some negatives. At least in my opinion this film lacked a laugh out load moment that I look at with comedy there was a lot of small to medium size laughs but no huge laughs, also the story is pretty weak which I guess works for this film but still is a weakness. However, there is some great laughs, great chemistry and also great small roles for people like Vince Vaughan, Jack Black and Ben Stiller which are all really funny.

","I'm a fan of Will Ferrell, and I like big dumb comedies like ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Tommy Boy"". And this turkey was sure dumb...but not funny. I didn't laugh once or even crack a smile for almost 30 minutes, and then I shut it off and returned the DVD. What finally made me pull the plug on this mess was Ron's date with Corningstone (the names aren't even that funny, btw). I was ready for laughs to see how Ron was going to handle a ""strictly professional"" date, and seconds later we see his car parked at some sort of inspiration point, which is promising. But then Burgundy doesn't make a move on her?? And she's not upset at having been driven to a make-out spot? What was really dreadful was the dialog about ""San Diego"": Burgundy: ""San Diego was discovered by the Germans in 1902, and they called it 'San DiAh-go', which means 'whale vagina'."" I thought this was dreadful, because it lacks all plausibility. Even someone as stupid as Burgundy would know San Diego means ""Saint Diego"" in Spanish. Humor that is completely ungrounded in reality is not that funny to me, unless you go whole hog with absurdity like Monty Python. This movie tried to be both absurd and a little bit grounded, and it failed. The ""San Di-Ahgo"" bit sucked. Then, Burgundy takes Corningstone to his favorite nightclub, and he's asked to play jazz flute. At first, he can't play (plausible). Then we hear flawless flute playing, which I assumed to be a recording, because certainly someone so stupid as Burgundy can't play the jazz flute like that, right? WRONG. The scene continues with him wow-ing everyone in the nightclub with his incredible flute playing, and there's no dubbing/recording going on whatsoever. We are just to believe he is this talented. It's inconsistent with his idiotic character. The rest of the characters are cartoons, also, including Steve Carrell's ""retarded"" weatherman, who calls NW U.S. ""The Middle East"". I mean, the writing seems really ad-libbed and sloppy. McKay and Ferrell must have written this script with tunnel-vision and groupthink. 2 years later, McKay and Ferrell get it right with Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. At least that had some real laughs, because the characters were consistently stupid throughout."

","Will Ferrell and Adam McKay of ""Saturday Night Live"" recapture a bygone era of broadcast news history with their hopelessly juvenile but insanely hilarious comedy ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy."" Once upon a time in television history, only men were allowed to deliver the news. Women had not yet broken the glass ceiling, and Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone creates chaos with her ambition to anchor the news desk. The action affectionately follows the shenanigans of a rating proved quartet. Ron (Will Ferrell), Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Champ (David Koechner) make up the triumphant Channel 4 News Team. Basically, this rude, crude, infantile farce draws its comic highlights primarily from Ferrell's straight-faced, over-the-top, zany performance. As the eponymous Ron Burgundy, Ferrell has a field day as a bubble-headed idiot with immaculate facial hair and a puffy coiffure. No less funny are his co-stars. Rudd and Koechner are solidly funny, but Carrell as a mentally challenged weatherman steals the show with his glassy-eyed look and demeanor. The confrontations between the Channel 4 News Teams and opposing teams from Channel 2 and Public News are funny and benefit from cameos ranging from Ben Stiller to Vince Vaughn to Tim Robbins. Other actors who contribute memorable cameos are Danny Trejo, Jack Black, and Luke Wilson. Bill Curtis adds a touch of class as the narrator. The erection is as goofy as the confrontation between Ron's dog Baxter and a bear. The belated sequel is just as funny."

","By what must be pure coincidence this was screened on television in the UK the very day that Anchorman 2 opened and by further coincidence I checked out the sequel never having seen the original and completely unaware that it would be screened this evening. My overall impression of both movies is that they are reminiscent of the very early Woody Allen titles in that there are lots of dull bits punctuated by the occasional laugh-out loud moment. In Anchorman it's not so much dull bits as pathetic, embarrassing, totally non-funny bits in which four grown men behave like gauche teenagers constantly shouting at the tops of their voices for no apparent reason.

Well, I'm pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed it and laughed loud and long throughout its running time.<br/><br/>It probably helps that I grew up watching ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", the classic early 70's sit-com set in a TV newsroom, in fact my first thought watching this was that Ted Baxter had made a comeback. Not that there's a lot of the sharp, wry humour tat characterised the ""MTM"" shows, the humour you get here is mostly broad and low, although its undeniably funny.<br/><br/>Principally the movie gets its laughs from the antiquated sexism of the 70's with San Diego's number one TV news anchorman, Ron Burgundy and his little gang of co- presenters on the show seeing their male dominance challenged by a new, pretty and ambitious female, played by Christina Applegate. Cue numerous gratuitous sexist remarks, but before long, Applegate and her new band of female co-workers have turned the tables although before the end, there's the obligatory ""Let's make up and be friendly"" resolution occurs in of all things a bear-pit at the zoo.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is good value as the dim but perfectly coiffured Ron and Applegate, who knows a thing or two about crass humour has a ball in her part as his lady-friend / rival, but the whole supporting team have their moments. I liked best the off-the-wall inserts like the accapella version of ""Afternoon Delight"" and the TV news-room teams bloodbath showdown and Ron's boys trying to put Applegate off in her first solo newscast.<br/><br/>Throw in those pretty awful 70's fashions and some of the worst songs for the soundtrack and to a child of the times like me, this was a real hoot and maybe just maybe, I'll get along to see that sequel.

Its good to report then like a good news anchor would that despite being almost ten years since we first meet Ron Burgundy and the channel 4 news team Anchorman has lost none of its original charm.<br/><br/>Anchorman's long lasting success falls largely upon the perfect casting of all involved with Will Ferrel still yet to top his creation here whilst Paul Rudd, David Koechner and the ever lovable character of Brick as played to perfection by Steve Carell are all on arguably career best form. These central 4 actors have a chemistry on screen that makes dialogue and situations in the film fire from random sing-alongs (Afffffffffffffternoon delight), meetings with rival news teams (""Where'd you get your clothes, the toilet shop?"") or seriously vicious news team wars (""That escalated quickly""). The 4 actors are ably supported by token female Christina Applegate and a raft of cameos with highlights being Jack Black and Tim Robbins.<br/><br/>It's a testament to not only the actors who carry the antics of the movie on their shoulders but that of director McKay who has the unenviable task of editing a film such as this down to 90 minutes where there are no doubt hours upon hours of comic gold recorded that had to be cut out completely. McKay and Ferrell proved also that there comedic genius was not a once off with success realised in there later teaming namely Talladega Nights and The Other Guys.<br/><br/>Anchorman is a film that by now has seeped well and truly into pop culture from its dialogue through to its branding.

","""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" represented the directorial debut of Adam McKay, a long-time writer on Saturday Night Live.

When his superiors hire a female reporter he and his male colleagues greet their decision with resistance. However, Burgundy soon falls for this new addition to the news team, although their professional aspirations quickly turn them into rivals.<br/><br/>The story is pretty loose and isn't especially strong on plot. However, the writing of McKay & Ferrell consistently creates humorous situations that mostly steer clear of cliché. Some might not appreciate the sometimes absurd humour but I found it frequently amusing and, above all, unpredictable. I expect that the movie benefited from improvisation for a considerable number of its jokes.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's hard to fault a cast that includes Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell, Fred Willard, Christina Applegate and others too numerous to mention. Besides the stars & supporting cast there are also a number of notable cameos, including Tim Robbins, to name just one.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie's well done and doesn't show any of the inexperience that you might expect from a first time film director. However, musically is where the film really excels. It's full of nicely chosen period-specific tunes, including a memorable acapella rendition of ""Afternoon Delight"".<br/><br/>All in all, ""Anchorman"" delivers the goods comedically but the lack of a strong story means that it isn't quite as good as it could have been.

It all comes down to what you want I suppose, and, sorry, but I like a little wit, of which there is none in this offering. If you want to send up vacuous TV journalism – and for all its empty-headed vanities, it doesn't really head any particular list of world greatest evil's as an obvious target of satire – that job was done far better by Broadcast News. If you merely want to raise a laugh or two, well, you could do worse. But for my money you could also do a lot better. Will Ferrell and Adam McKay and the rest cut their teeth on Saturday Night Live (which, living in Britain, I have never seen) and that figures because in many ways The Anchorman is episodic with its stars merely repeating their various schtick from that series. If there's a story of sorts, it merely serves the purpose of linking those different comedy episodes together. This isn't in any way bad, it just isn't particularly outstanding.

The connection with media is in the effeminate issue. Women of that era were always treated as second class citizens and were not seen as serious or competent in the mainstream workforce.

"johnnyboyz","4","0","1","21 November 2009"," Loud, obnoxious and woefully misjudged – newsflash: it's horrid.
","A collective sigh ought to sound up amongst the audience once the end titles for the horror-show that-is Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy begin to scroll, a collective sigh of relief that the pain is over and the fact that the characters we just spent the runtime of the film with are going onto the sorts of things that none of it's target audience will ever see or experience - and all that by way of acting in the manners they do throughout. The film is a misfire of monumental proportions, a horribly misjudged; badly executed piece whose very existence, whose very presence, on the screen just feels like a continuous two-fingers up gesture at the watching audience. What plays out under a very colourful; very false (in more ways than one) setting full of daft, glossy 1970s clichés and pastiches is a series of un-likable people doing leery, stupid and downright cruel things to one another; all under this painfully upbeat and colourful umbrella of the 'spoof' variety. In a word, it is shocking and I am stunned at the overwhelmingly positive reaction it has received.<br/><br/>The film, whose overly long title does not deserve to be re-typed, is quite clearly supposed to be some sort of stupid spoof of egotistical driven, male dominated work places from yester-decade and the beginnings of the rise of female co-workers in this area. The film covers what Claire Monk wrote about in the late 1990s in regards to men in crisis and the rise in feminism, and that these sorts of things were being explored in British cinema of that time under the banner of comedy. But where Brassed Off and The Full Monty were more restrained in their humour and attitudes towards women and the respective desperate situations the guys were in, Anchorman ploughs on ahead without a destination in its brain and without a brain in its head; tearing up the road forever in search of pathetic, frat-boy inspired laughs.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays the the titular role of Ron Burgundy, an anchor man at a California based TV network. He's the lead guy at a local news station and head of a crew of others that include sports reporters and weather guys. No distinction is made as to why he's the best in the business and as to why he's such the proclaimed genius everyone thinks he is, I guess he is purely out the fact he happens to be the one that introduces and concludes each broadcast. The man wears a sickly grin and kisses his biceps in what is an ego-driven and very masculine act that signifies power in the workplace, by way of muscular iconography. He dresses in loud suits and sweet-talks his way into and out of many-a situation, usually involving attractive women of some sort. Despite this titular-proclaimed legendary status, the man is severely and frighteningly mentally disturbed. I think the above cliché-ridden masculine archetype is introduced fairly well, but the film really wants us to buy into this character as he stands when the whole thing should be of the spoof variety. Rather than introduce and proclaim ""look how much of an idiot this guy is and how stupid his attitudes are"", I think we're supposed to follow an ideation along the lines of: ""look how fantastic this guy is, and look at how he got to where he is by way of treating others"".<br/><br/>What is supposed to be the direct conflict of the piece's characters arrives in the form of Christina Applegate's Veronica Corningstone, a female employed by the station after rising demands for female employees, and an instance of Monk's theory revolving around the rise of women in male dominated work places rearing its head. For about thirty to forty minutes the film does something with this idea, then it has its two leads sleep with one another before veering off into a dumb passage of play revolving around the two hating each other and working out new ways to demonstrate this hating. For what should be the best part, the film introduces a pig of a male character; has him seduce a strong and up-coming female character attempting to get a foothold as feminism arises with her; consequently bring her back down to Earth before branching out into a narrative that is about one rung above that of an episode of a Tom and Jerry cartoon.<br/><br/>Burgundy is a living legend; he's both every male's idol and fantasy and sits atop both the TV ratings and his career path along with his crew. Yet the man is unaware of what 'San Diego' translates into out of the Spanish language; the man abuses his power rather than come to respect it when he attempts to pull women at a party at someone's pool house and on occasion, his dog talks to him, further pushing the film out into a scary realm it shouldn't really be treading anywhere near – maybe we ought to re-title the film 'The Legend of David Richard Berkowitz'. There's a really uneven sense of sexual predatory goings-on in Anchorman, and the realisation that it's the horrid and somewhat evil piece that it is settles in by way of an ominous and creepy fashion. The film's runtime is false; it needs dumb extra tidbits to bulk it out: a horribly misjudged scene in which a dog is supposedly killed is one of them, and a monumentally tired Sergio Leone pastiche had me with my head in my hands. Everything in the film bottoms out; from weatherman Brick's (Carell) role as the constant source of ridicule due to his own special needs, to the fact the film thinks constant shouting acts as something 'funny' on screen. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is trash of most misjudged, misguided order."

","Anchorman is by far Will Ferrell's best comedy. It isn't his best film though. i think that his best film is Stranger than Fiction, but Anchorman is his best comedy. Anchorman is so random and funny. Every performance in the film is funny.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell plays Ron Bergundy, an anchorman living in San Deigo. He has quite an exciting life. He has an enemy named Wes Mantooth(Vince Vaughn). He has a dog named Baxter. He has four friends who are also in the news business. But all of the friends lives change when a female named Veronica Corningstone(Christina Applegate)becomes an anchorwoman. All of the guys start to hit on her but she is too serious and the gang doesn't like it. I am not going to spoil too much of the fun. <br/><br/>Anchorman has so many funny moments. But the best part in the entire film is when they get in the fight in the alley. The scene is so ridiculous that it's hilarious. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Bergundy and all of the characters in Anchorman are great. Anchorman has so many funny moments. It's a smart comedy. I love Anchorman and I think it is Will Ferrell's best comedy. So, I give Anchorman a huge thumbs up. It's probably the funniest film of 2004.<br/><br/>Anchorman:****/****"

","There are many ""stupid"", or the way I call them ""absurd"", masterpieces.<br/><br/>Marx Brothers had their own formula 70 - 80 years ago and repeated it perfectly in their handful of movies. A bunch of young British geniuses had their shot and they were outstanding. From ""Meaning of Life"" to ""Holly Grail"", Monthy Python brought us some of the finest examples of ""absurd"" comedy. Later the famous Z.A.Z. team produced likes of ""Top Secret"" and ""Airplane"". Not everything they did was as successful as these, but they set a fine standard.<br/><br/>To call ""Anchorman"" a great stupid movie is quite an insult to those guys, and many others I couldn't name here.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell is not my favorite actor, but after seeing him in a Woody Allen project (Melinda, Melinda) and watching extraordinary ""Stranger Than Fiction"", I was convinced he had more talent than he showed on ""A Night at the Roxberry"". So I decided to give a shot to ""Anchorman"", which also contains pretty Christina Applegate.<br/><br/>But the result was disappointment. Every character is a cartoon like most absurd comedies, but the jokes are not raining like they supposed to be. This brings out the flaws of cartoons on the screen. In the good examples of the genre, like those I mentioned above, you probably miss some jokes, while you are laughing on others. In this you won't risk of missing anything because they are well apart from each other.<br/><br/>If you think lines like ""Sixty percent of the time, it works every time."" are funny, this movie may do the trick for you. You'll laugh anyway, I admit I laughed, but not enough to make this experience worthy.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" has one of the most overrated notes in IMDb, I'm afraid."
"Electrified_Voltage","4","0","2","27 July 2008"," An occasional laugh doesn't prevent this from being a mostly unfunny and sometimes uncomfortable film
","I saw the first little bit of this movie three years ago, and it seemed promising. However, a couple months later, I got to see the whole thing from start to finish, and was disappointed. Not long after that, I watched ""Old School"", another film featuring the polarizing Will Ferrell, and was amused. However, I've seen ""Old School"" twice since then, and the second time, I thought it was reasonable, but it wasn't the same as the first viewing. The third time, I was pretty much indifferent to it. I was hoping ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" would be more enjoyable with a second viewing three years later, but I was once again let down.<br/><br/>Set in the 1970's, Ron Burgundy is the top anchorman in San Diego, California. He is friends with three colleagues; Brian Fantana, Brick Tamland, and Champ Kind, and these four make up a very sexist all-male news team. With feminism on the rise, a woman named Veronica Corningstone is hired to bring diversity to the team, and finds that three of her sexist, dimwitted co-workers get on her nerves in their attempts to seduce her. Soon, Ron finds himself falling in love with Veronica, and she agrees to go out with him one night when he claims it's strictly professional, not a romantic date, but during the outing, he manages to impress her enough to start a romantic relationship. This relationship looks promising, until Ron learns the full extent of Veronica's ambitions. She makes it clear that she wants to go further in the news business and become an anchor, and the chauvinistic Ron feels threatened by this, so a rivalry ensues! <br/><br/>Where do I begin? Well, for the most part, I was simply bored. As you would probably expect, Will Ferrell plays a silly maniac, and while the polarizing comedian has made me laugh on several occasions, sometimes hard (for example, in a lot of the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches I've seen him in), he's not too amusing most of the time in ""Anchorman"". The part early in the film where Ron Burgundy says ""You have the most breathtaking hiney,"" was amusing to me this time, just like it was before, and Burgundy's goofiness can be mildly amusing at other times as well, such as when he can't help but announce his relationship with Veronica out loud, despite promising to keep it a secret. However, his antics are usually boring, and none of the other characters are funny enough to save the film, either. The jokes are sometimes just a little TOO puerile, such as Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) saying ""It smells like, like a used diaper, filled with Indian food!"" I've never cared much for the scene where the angry motorcyclist (played by Jack Black) throws Burgundy's dog over the bridge. Also, late in the film, Burgundy unemployed and drunk with a bad reputation around town was a little disturbing to me at times.<br/><br/>Crude, juvenile, and overall stupid comedies are popular these days, especially with us guys, and I sometimes enjoy them myself, I can't deny that. As long as I get my laughs from them, they're usually fine in my book. However, some of these films overdo it with the stupidity, and ""Anchorman"" may be one of those, though it's definitely been done worse, with the likes of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's appalling ""spoof"" movies, and a film I watched just last month, ""Freddy Got Fingered"". Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying anyone who likes this 2004 comedy is dimwitted, but I don't think it's a film I'll ever be able to get into, since I didn't like it the first time and it didn't improve with a second viewing three years later. For some people, mostly guys, I'm sure ""Anchorman"" is fun to watch for laughs and silliness, but even if you often get a kick out of this type of comedy, there's always a chance you might be disappointed."

We have similar tastes in movies and music, so I thought by renting this movie, it would help him feel better.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, we felt that something was missing. We both managed a few laughs, particularly the fight scene between Farrell and Applegate. But what I thought would be a great parody of 1970s television news just wasn't so. It didn't quite go for parody. It didn't quite go fully over the top. I don't think the creators of the movie knew which type of comedy they wanted to do. So they tried to have it both ways and it fell short on all accounts. I have mixed feelings about Ferrell as an actor and so does my twinbro. I thoroughly liked him in STRANGER THAN FICTION and I kinda liked him in this. Applegate was wonderful in this and yet she seemed restrained too.<br/><br/>In fairness, there were some other great scenes. I loved the rumble between the different news teams.

And this film shows us in comedy ways how anchorwomen, so to speak, started coming to power. And of course heroine's main weapon is love, skilfully using it she worms her way straight into an anchorman's heart and then his downfall and accordingly her uprising begins. High romance and wars with other news teams for the best place under the sun, machismo against feminism. Unexpected turnings in plot, good actors play and fast moving action make this movie enjoyable and memorable."

","BYGHT wrote a great review of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. I would suggest reading his review first before anything I have to say. I think he's right about Anchorman. It's much more than the cookie-cutter comedies that pollute the theater screens and home entertainment centers across the country. There is some--not a lot, but some--sharp parody here. Anchorman is a flawed and, probably, too silly send up of the news business on TV. Yet it is something of a good companion piece to, say, the much, much more highbrow Broadcast News.<br/><br/>I think what makes Anchorman work is that it really does catch you by surprise. You're expecting a movie that pokes fun at the '70s or just a Will Ferrell vehicle. You sit down in anticipation of a battle of the sexes or just 90+ minutes of frat-boy humor. But A:TLORB gives you all of these things. It's a multi-joke movie; it multi-tasks! <br/><br/>Although it misfires from time to time with its fluffy wackiness bordering on just-too-weird, Anchorman delivers more than enough belly laughs and guffaws to keep the viewer with an IQ above room temperature chuckling and interested. Ferrell is maddeningly sincere in his portrayal of the shallow and idiotic Ron Burgundy. His supporting cast do what they're supposed to do--support him. And Christina Applegate shows enough talent to not get bowled over by the comedy heavyweights.<br/><br/>Applegate is not only beautiful, but there's something tough and ambitious about her--I think it was the smoking--that plays well against the cocksure idiots with which she has to contend. You go into Anchorman not expecting much, but being pleasantly surprised by her performance.<br/><br/>She is a metaphor for why Anchorman is a much-better-than-average product of Brand SNL."

","Will Ferrel has one of the strangest brands of comedy. He isn't traditionally funny the way Eddie Murphy or Russell Peters are. I don't know if he would be good in stand up. But put him in a movie where he can be self deprecating, self loathsome, and just flat out bombastic, and there is no equal. Anchorman--The Legend of Ron Burgundy is his Beveryly Hills Cop, his Something About Mary, his Stripes. You won't find a funnier, albeit stupid, but nonetheless funny film anywhere. And the thing about this film is that the gags and the jokes just never stop. They are perpetually launched at us, every frame, every sentence, every word is meant to make us laugh. I haven't laughed this much in a film since perhaps Zoolander.<br/><br/>Will Ferrel plays Ron Burgundy, one of the dimmest, most arrogant people in the business. He actually thinks he is important, that he matters. And he has good reason to think that as he is treated like a celebrity everywhere he goes. Women fall over him, men want to hang out with him and even his co-workers lionize him. He is part of a news team that works for a San Diego news station. The other members of his team are sports caster Champ Kind, who thinks he's even more of a ladies man than Burgundy does. Paul Rudd plays Brian Fantana and he is perhaps the normal one on the team but does enough zany things to prove he belongs. And the diamond in the rough, and perhaps one of the funniest characters ever created on film is played by a pre 40 Year Old Virgin Steve Carrel. He plays Brick Tamland and to say he is a moron is an insult to the intelligence of morons. He follows the crew, imitates them, and acts completely stupid almost all of the time. To quote him to prove how funny his character is, for anyone who has not seen the film, would seem futile. But for those of is who have seen it, who can forget his ""I love lamp""...or ""Loud noises""...or ""I killed a man with a trident"". He makes Zoolander look like Socrates.<br/><br/>The plot? Well the male dominated business of T.V. news is about to get a shock when Veronica Corningstone, a very sexy female broadcaster gets to become a co-host with Burgundy. The plot is fine, but the movie is really just one skit after another and I'm wondering if any of this movie was really scripted. To me, the way it looks, the director just gave the cast Carte Blanche to do what they want. And it works. Take for example perhaps the funniest scene ever filmed.<br/><br/>The news team meets up in a back alley with other news teams, all cameos by the Frat pack, and they rumble, in the style of West Side Story. But in this segment, people get set on fire, arms are chopped off, tridents appear and so on. The hilarity just never ends.<br/><br/>Anchorman might not be for everyone. I hated it the first time I saw it. But it does grow on you and Steve Carrell is just hysterical. I highly recommend this film and especially the DVD with all the extras. You have to see Ron Burgundy's auditon for ESPN. Classic!! <br/><br/>Also, watch for the cameo by Jack Black.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","""Anchorman"" grew on me. Like unwanted back hair, it grew on me. The first time I saw it, I thought it was fairly funny. Then I saw it a second and third time and it went from fairly funny to undoubtedly funny. This movie has several quotable and memorable scenes, plus each one of the characters in Ron Burgundy's broadcast team was amusing in his own way. In fact, the broadcast team was just a perfect bunch. But, without question, Will Ferrel held it down as Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrel has just been ascending in my book as of late, but if there is any role I would say he shined the most in, it would be this one. As I watched ""Anchorman"" again, I was a bit more attentive and I picked up on even more funny little subtleties. And the scene with him bickering back and forth with Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) was just classic. My advice to those who haven't seen it... watch it, and then watch it again. If you didn't like it the first time, you'll warm up to it."

","I wouldn't say that ""Anchorman"" is a very good film, it's more like a collection of funny and partly hilarious scenes, and in between those are also plenty of scenes, that didn't work for me. An advice for future comedy-makers: Just get Will Ferrell and Steve Carell and your film can't be a total flop. While Ferrell is great in everything he does, Carell literally steals every scene he is in here. Even when someone else was talking, I always looked at Brick. Just check the scene where he tries to ""flirt"" with Veronica (Party! Pants!). One of the highlights was also the massive fight between all the different TV news teams (with a considerable number of guest stars). The problem is: Funny scene after funny scene after funny scene gets a little bit tiring after a while if there is no plot that keeps the whole thing together. And in this case, that plot is very thin. But this does almost no harm, because it's really damn funny."

Cleverly written by Will Ferrell and a SNL writer, it is random humor that you wouldn't think would be... well... so hilarious! Many memorable quotes will stick in your mind on a Post-It and you can't go through one day without saying at least one. The roles are so well played by all cast members and is a film that is just so funny for words. You will think, ""Ron Burgundy is the sexiest newsman alive."" It is a film that can actually be taken seriously if you laugh your brain off. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy so well, you're going to fall in love with him.

It is one of my favorite movies and I could watch it over and over and over and over and over and over again!"

","I've not found a film as funny as anchorman in many years. From start to finish it had me laughing my socks off and repeated viewings are equally as funny. Having read the other reviews I find it hard it understand how some people could rate it with 1 star, or even make claims that if a negative rating was available they would choose that. These people are humourless. Indeed, one reviewer said that Dodgeball was a better comedy which, as much as I enjoyed it, was nowhere near as clever or rewarding as Anchorman, and too often relies on people getting hit in sensitive areas with a ball. I know a great number of people who rank Anchorman as among their favourite films and I am inclined to agree. And finally, will people stop calling him Will 'Farrel' or other such variations! p.s.

","One of the funniest movies of the last six years.<br/><br/>A winning combination of comedy talent given free reign to develop their (admittedly one dimensional) characters to provide a series of great compliments/contrasts that give the film a degree of depth.<br/><br/>At the top of the food chain is Applegate's Corningstone. She fulfills her ironic role of eye-candy-with-a-punch well (although she is perhaps the weakest of the bunch). She shoots down Farrell's Burgundy to great effect (the 'when in Rome' joke is a classic), and their relationship deals neatly with the film's moral message (chavinistic cartels are doomed to failure in the face of liberated women).<br/><br/>The plankton at the bottom is Carrell's Brick. Carrell clearly loved his role, and with McKay's assistance has managed the near impossible of making his every line an instant classic ('I ate a big red candle'... 'I love lamp'etc, ad.inf.)His absolute stupidity is cleverly highlighted to great comic effect by the fact even Burgundy can pick him up on his comments (r.e. 'I love lamp'- 'Brick, do you really love the lamp, or are you just saying that because you saw it?' 'I love lamp').<br/><br/>Koechner and Rudd are funny as they ham up their characters of oversexed hick and wannabee-Lothario-actually-wet-sap smoothie. Koechner's Champ is probably afforded the least opportunity to develop a real persona (but Koechner's caricature is so grotesque that it really isn't required!). In the UK, to break out the 'Sex Panther' has become a by-word for dressing/scenting up in a manner that dooms you to a score-free night from the get-go. I'm sure that's true in the USA as well.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly didn't win any Oscars.

","Two summers ago, I saw Anchorman and was completely blown away. I am sure I am the minority in thinking it was one of the best films of the year, but when done well a pure comedy can be just as much a show of great film-making as anything else. Anchorman, a spoof of chauvinism and male insecurity, is set in a 1970s newsroom in San Diego where star news anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his news team become threatened by the arrival of a woman (Christina Applegate) in the newsroom.<br/><br/>Anchorman is the best display of improvisational comedy on screen since Christopher Guest (This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show). It's jokes come from the creation of funny characters. The beauty of Anchorman wasn't so much the comic intensity of Will Ferrell, but the fact that every other actor in the movie could keep up with him in creating such zany characters. Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carrell as Ferrell's team of sidekicks all have breakout roles as his news anchor team and Applegate matches Ferrell line-for-line in their battle-of-the-sexes rivalry. Together, they all provide so much comic energy and mine comic situations to such extremes, that it had me laughing throughout the entire movie."

","ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY solidified for me my long-dormant suspicion that Ferrell is a comic genius who had been so underrated up to this point. I have not laughed so hard at a movie since YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, and like that classic, no matter how many times I watch this movie, I'm laughing out loud. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a self-absorbed TV news anchorman working at a San Diego TV station in the 1970's who finds his world as king of the 6:00 news rocked by the arrival of Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a woman who longs to be a news anchor; however, in the 1970's, this was pretty much unheard of. The relationship between Ron and Veronica is very entertaining but the lion's share of the laughs in this film come from Ferrell, who I am convinced improvised approximately 60% of this movie, but the stuff that works clearly outweighs the stuff that doesn't. The 1970's are lovingly recreated here with settings, costumes, and some wonderful forgotten and not forgotten music from the 70's (wait until you see this film's cover of the classic ""Afternoon Delight""). This movie is just one comic highlight after another, including the ""trip to Pleasuretown"", Ron's jazz flute solo, and the news anchor rumble in the alley. Ferrell is a riot and Applegate shows a surprising gift for slapstick comedy and there is a scene-stealing performance from Steve Carell as Brick, the weatherman on Ron's news team.

Will Ferrel is a fantastic comedian and with the always beautiful Christian Applegate as his leading lady a match was made in movie heaven. With Will as their leader the comedy quartet of Ferrel, Rudd, Carell, and Koechner keeps the audience entertained like a sky rocket in flight. The cameos of other great comedians such as Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and Luke Wilson just adds to the fun of the group. Adding Tim Robbins adds a bit of class to the movie.

The good and funny moments definitely make this movie worthwhile but it simply is not the best or most consistent comedies around. The movie relies (too much) on its silly over-the-top comedy characters. The actors that portray them are definitely good and obviously very experienced in the comedy-genre, so they still make most part of the movie and its jokes work out fine but because of its inconsistency this movie is also a quite forgettable one, even though it certainly had some memorable moments. It's a movie that's perhaps fun to watch once but I don't think I want to watch it again any time soon.<br/><br/>In the end it really are the actors that definitely make this movie a worthwhile one. I didn't necessarily liked Will Ferrell in the main role, in my opinion Ferrell is better and funnier when he plays smaller comedy roles, in similar movies like this one. Perhaps also a reason why I didn't liked this movie that much. But the supporting cast is really superb. Of course no matter what she ever does, Christina Applegate shall always be remembered as Kelly Bundy from ""Married with Children"" but in this movie she shows that she can handle other comedy roles just as well and just as convincing. Other stellar comedy roles are there from Steve Carell, Paul Rudd and Fred Willard. Some fun cameos are there from; Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Danny Trejo, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller. I just love how these guys always pop up in to each other movies, just for the fun of it. It makes this movie for the fans of the silly-comedies from the late '90's and '00's still a bit of a must-see and a recommendable movie, despite its flaws.<br/><br/>It's fun that the movie is set in the '70's but it unfortunately doesn't do enough with this fact, comical-wise.

","I can only recommend this movie because it is no more than its intentions. When it begin, I thought it was at least trying to be somewhat realistic. Once I got over that, it turned out to be pretty funny. In nearly every instance, the most outrageous kind of behavior was presented. The romantic angle and the seriousness of the young woman, striving to be an anchor herself in the good old boys' club, becomes as ridiculous as the whole Will Ferrell schtick. Scenes are borrowed from other movies (The Sandlot with the guys from the other TV station on bikes or Gangs of New York with brutality and dismemberment). I did find Ron Bergundy charming. Everything is locker room, but they are all such boobs that you can't take them seriously. The fact that the world is set on its ear over the birth of a panda while other more serious stuff gets no time at all is pretty believable. Those other three guys are hilarious. I loved the photo shoots they used to lead in to the news.

","Judging from the state (and unaccountable success)of this movie, it seems that audience standards are declining as the spoof comedy becomes increasingly difficult for Hollywood filmmakers to successfully pull off without blundering into juvenile crassness. One condition is probably a result of the other - although which came first is open to conjecture - and, considering the film's success, it seems as if it will be a long time before things are turned around.<br/><br/>Anchorman 'satirises' US TV of the 70s with a deftness of touch as subtle as Will Ferrell's wig and a vast appetite for laughs that it never comes close to satisfying. This is cinematic junk food: too bland, too homogeneous and too lacking in substance to offer any real nourishment, and simply offering a quick fix to those who don't care what they ingest just as long as it offers them a few moments of escape. Too often, while watching this flick, you get the feeling that the writers are just throwing every idea they have - good, bad or indifferent - at the screen in the hope that someone somewhere will find it amusing. Hit and miss comparisons are redundant here because the hits don't exist. Even the moments that should work don't because the makers overplay their hand each time they come close to hitting on a funny idea.<br/><br/>On this evidence, Will Ferrell is a better comedy actor than he is a comedy writer, and only his clever performance salvages anything from the untidy wreckage of this collision of scenes. Christina Applegate looks good but contributes little while Ferrell's sidekicks are mostly just irritating. Nothing meshes here: the plot is repeatedly sacrificed in favour of another weak gag; touched with inspired insanity, plot doesn't matter - the humour is enough to carry the viewer - but here the weakness of the material simply serves as a constant reminder that nothing is happening - and its not happening in a very unfunny way.<br/><br/>Even the out-takes aren't funny."

It's science."" Simply by being The 70s Male, Ron's team gives us Truth In Jest: There's Field Reporter, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), muttonchop sideburns and a cock of the head to match his jaunty, bellbottomed step; Sports Desk, Champ Kind (David Koechner), cowboy-hatted, beer-swilling Man's Man, with an affinity for Ron Burgundy's ""musk""; and ambiguously-retarded Weatherman, Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell, whose way-off-script performances here and in ""Bruce Almighty"" and ""The Forty-Year-Old Virgin"" indeed prove his mettle as a comic, yet which doesn't excuse him from accepting the job in the remake ""for American audiences"" of Ricky Gervais' comedic masterpiece, ""The Office."" That ain't right.) And there's Ron Burgundy himself - Anchorman (""I'm very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany""), Jazz Flautist (""Hey, Aqualung!""), Legend (""Last time I looked in the dictionary, my name's Ron Burgundy!""). From doing shirtless barbell curls in his office to impress Veronica (""sculpting my guns""), to wailing, ""I'm in a glass cage of emotion!"" when asked where he is calling from (a phone booth), Ferrell (who co-wrote the movie with director, Adam McKay) takes Burgundy on a mad joyride and abandons him somewhere between 70s chic and imbecile.<br/><br/>Ron's team must endure the infiltration of female Veronica into their complacent All-Male world, as she steals away the heart and job of their beloved leader. Along the way, every aspect of seventies normalcy is tweaked to hyperbole, from the news team suddenly bursting into an a cappella rendition of The Starland Vocal Band's ""Afternoon Delight,"" to Ron's appraisal of the ""new fad called jogging, or 'yogging' - I think the 'j' may be silent,"" to hosing off Brian Fantana's almost-lethal man-fragrance, Sex Panther.<br/><br/>The comedy hits on all levels, from the subtle (the television spots, with the News Team all looking up at the camera on cue) to the broad (Burgundy's and Veronica's love-making fantasy), to the insensate (the street battle of the Network News Teams, involving tridents, amputations and Roman gladiator man-nets). The usual suspects all cameo: Vince Vaughn (as competing Network Anchor, Wes Mantooth - after bequeathing this character name, where else can you turn?), Tim Robbins with a blond-fro (ditto with this 'do), Ben Stiller as a seedy Spanish News Anchor, Luke Wilson (whose amputations in battle cause him much annoyance), and Jack Black as a hard-ridin', hard-vengeance biker (""Did you just throw a burrito at me, Brosef?!"").<br/><br/>The dependably hilarious Fred Willard is Station Director (constantly apologizing on the phone for his son's felonies at school), who fires Ron after a practical joke by Veronica goes awry, which sees Ron unwittingly swearing at San Diego on air.<br/><br/>So begins Ron's spiral into oblivion, wandering the streets in a hermit-beard, drunk on milk, whilst Veronica's star rises as the world's first female anchor. Ron must mine untapped reserves of Man-Reportage to rise to the occasion and come to terms with Veronica's equality. In a bear den at the San Diego Zoo, all is resolved.<br/><br/>With its dialog generally more ""cerebral"" than most SNL alumni offerings - as ridiculous as that may sound - and a cast willing to take themselves beyond the fringe for the cause, Anchorman ranks alongside A Night At The Roxbury or Wayne's World as a stupid, stupid idea that somehow entertains despite itself.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

Ron is smitten, but falling in love is only the beginning of his troubles.<br/><br/>The ridiculously puerile and downright immature humour on display will either repel you, or hook you completely, as it did me. But then I loved Zoolander and Dodgeball, equally daft movies which also had a healthy dose of the absurd running through their veins.<br/><br/>You can tell that the entire cast are having a blast getting paid for being stupid, and the fun is infectious (just try keeping a straight face when Ferrell plays Jazz flute). If you dig this kind of thing (and I pity you if you don't), you'll have a great time watching the film, and an even greater time afterwards quoting your favourite lines."

","Oh my god!! The funniest Will Ferrell movie ever. this was without a doubt the best from the start of his career, and probably the best ever to come of one of the funniest people in showbiz. of course the supporting cast was awesome. This is one of the casts i would like to see in more then one film. (Unlike the Adam Sandler crew) Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgandy, the Anchorman o Sanfransico (A Whales Vagina in French) (Maybe) in the erly 70's. After the station that he works in hires there first female reporter, nothing but controvercy and comedy comes from it.<br/><br/>So, you stay classy Will Ferrell, Stay Classy."

","I wasn't sure what to expect from ""Anchorman"" when I first heard about it. Certainly, Will Ferrell can be pretty funny (I don't really watch the newer SNL episodes) and Steve Carrell can have his moments. But I also had some gut instinct that told me that this movie would be an utter chore to get through. Well, split the difference. ""Anchorman"" has portions both delightfully amusing and jarringly boneheaded.<br/><br/>In this motion picture, Will Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, the top anchor of a Seattle news station. He and his buds are living the high life until a woman becomes co-anchor. The movie is about Ron's struggle with this new development in his professional life. It's a mixed bag, folks. Some scenes (like all four newsmen singing ""Sky Rockets in Flight"") can't help but evoking laughter from the audience. Unfortunately, others (such as when Ron tries to ask out his new costar) just seem forced and awkward. Overall, if you want something to waste away an afternoon with or you feel like shutting down your brain for a while, this is for you."

","If you can accept this movie's imperfection, to put it mildly, and let then sunshine of original comedy and Will Ferrell's antics in, you'll find this movie is more clever than most other comedies of late. Without Will Ferrell, this movie is nothing, but with him it's got plenty of hilariousness. The played-out style in comparison with other movies with the same frame like The 40 Year Old Virgin and Wedding Crashers is tiring before it even begins, and the cameo by Vince Vaughn and mediocre part played by Applegate are slightly more offensive than the pointless presence of the retarded weatherman, but there are enough original jokes and siliness to make annoyances like these stay in the background. Will ferrell is the funniest man alive, I wish he could be cast in more substantial roles in better written movies, even it they were comedies. His lines and personal comedy are consistently entertaining in this one."

","Normally I don't watch the news except when it's something huge. However I would watch it everyday if Ron Burgundy delivered it. I personally loved Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Anybody that has watched previous Will Ferrel movies knows Will is hilarious. In this movie, he's kind of the glue that keeps the whole thing together, he plays Ron Burgundy a news anchor. He thinks he's every woman's dream, he's got class, style, great pick-up lines, and very smooth. This movie takes place in the 70s and you can tell that just by looking at the clothes that they wear and everything is groovy. Than Veronica Corningstone enters the picture (Christina Applegate), she's proved that she has what it takes and she comes in to be Ron's co-anchor, although she wants head-anchor badly, and she'll do anything to get it. Will she, or won't she? It's a hilarious movie, lot's of funny lines, Vince Vaughn makes a cameo as a fellow news anchor, so do Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson and Tim Robbins. Probably the funniest guy in the movie besides Will is Steve Carrel who plays Champ Kind the weather guy. So watch the movie and see for yourself, I gave it 6 out of 10, because, it's not the funniest movie, i've seen, and it could have been better, but it was okay, well...i'd have to say it's good, but not great."

","I thought ""Anchorman"" was hilarious, so I was surprised at the low rating it received here. Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is a very funny adult comedy with some classic scenes and lines. I will not soon forget the ""West Side Story"" rumble between five rival news teams, that includes a man on fire and another man being speared with a trident. Or the verbal abuse Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate throw back and forth at each other while the credits for their news show are rolling (""I'm proud of my pubic mane"" is one of my favorite lines, which Ferrell says in response to Applegate telling him he has too much pubic hair). Ferrell of course is funny, and Applegate makes a good straight man (or woman). Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are also terrific as well. And I had a blast with the impressive list of cameos, my favorite being Tim Robbins as the lead anchor at the local public television station.<br/><br/>This movie really satisfies the need for good comedy that you don't have to think very much about, but that still manages to be more clever than usual and doesn't rely on bathroom humour for all of its laughs.

","Okay, first off this is Will Ferrels greatest movie, and may perhaps stay that way, and the reason is EVERYTHING! From the completely stupid one liners, to the hysterical references that come thick and fast, indeed even the outstanding cameos. Nearly everything about this film is perfect if you're just looking for a title to relax with, maybe share a glass of scotch with... It isn't the most profound movie in the world, and it certainly isn't ""clever"" but let's face it, it's a movie where Will Ferrel is a sex god and anchormen rein supreme - it's not taking itself seriously so why should you? Of course this movie couldn't survive with just Will Ferrel goofing off and not being supported by some quality talent (as is shown by his many other movies, yes i'm looking at you Kicking and Screaming!) This is where his News Team, Brian Fantana, Brick Tamland and Champ Kind come in, and for the most part they do their jobs fantastically, with Brick often being the scene stealer of the movie, and possibly the most quotable man in history. And that's where this films magic really lies, in the way you and your friends can quote it for hours, whether it's one of Ferrels outbursts, or one of Bricks stupid one liners, it can have you rolling in stitches months after you've seen it, this gives the movie serious sticking power and always makes you go back for more, on that note I've just heard the DVD start up again, I'm off, you stay classy IMDb."

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is the exactly what its title states. It is the legend of Ron Burgundy. Set in 70's San Diego, Ron (Will Ferrell) is the lead anchor of Channel 4's news station. Ron's life is one of fame and enjoyment along with his news team, the oddest people you'll meet. But Ron's life is about to change when a female reporter comes aboard by the name of Vernoica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). <br/><br/>She becomes the love of Ron's life until she becomes co-anchor with him and soon they are arch-rivals. Ron's life is turned upside down as the story of his life nears. The story pretty much just follows the meeting and aftermath of Ron and Veronica. Their isn't exactly a plot, but it doesn't need one. It's a comedy!<br/><br/>Ferrell fits right in another role where all he has to do is act stupid. However, Ferrell doesn't make you believe he is acting stupid, actually he's probably the smartest of the news team. As for the news team, they make the movie. With up-and-coming comedian Steve Carell as Brick the weatherman, Raul Rudd as the the reporter in the field, and David Koechner as our sportsman who can't keep his hands of a fine woman, how could you go wrong? <br/><br/>While Rudd, Ferrell, and Koechner are hilarious, Steve Carell proves again he is one of the best comedians in Hollywood. His role as the retard (please don't take offense to that) weatherman with every scene involving him making no sense and every line, funnier then the last, he just keeps the laughs coming. <br/><br/>Christina Applegate's role is not meant to be a fantastic role and isn't meant to bring many laughs but she does set up quite a few. The fight scene between her and Ron is one of the best scenes in the movie. She doesn't try to act scornful even though she comes off as it and Applegate doesn't overact once. Her lines are delivered perfectly and adds a little something to look at.<br/><br/>Anchorman is the best comedy of '04 and Ferrell's best. He is finely given a good script of laughs instead of a family oriented, watered down , comedy film. It's crude at times but brings a smile to your face more than once and keeps you laughing the second and third viewing.<br/><br/>Anchorman: The Legend of ROn Burgundy. Starring: Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and David Koechner.<br/><br/>4 1/2 out of 5 Stars."

These include the Naked Gun series and this movie, ""Anchorman: The Legend OFRon Burgundy."" Will Farrell is a scream in the lead as the clueless dimwitted macho anchorman. Steve Carell as the weatherman who is even dimmer than Ron Burgundy himself is also a riot. The always reliable Fred Willard is once again, reliable - no, make that, is once again funny as hell as news director Ed Harken. Willard shines in everything he does.<br/><br/>But this film belongs to Christina Applegate as newswoman Veronica Corningstone, who fights Ron's hilariously sexist Neandrothol news team. Applegate gives a terrific performance, nailing every glance, every look, every line.

Will Ferrel on the other hand sometimes acts so over it's just stupid, but most of the times he is OK. Many have complained about Christina's acting and her being boring, but that's just the way she was supposed to do the role, be serious, but Christina Applegate is without a doubt the most talented actor on the movie, everyone is just thinking about her on Married... With Children, but like the character on MWC, her character on Anchorman doesn't really let her show her talent. I really hope she will get some big leading roles after she's done with Sweet Charity on Broadway. It's an OK movie after the terrible start, just turn brain off and it will help you spend two hours, and of course if you're a Christina Applegate fan, it's (sadly) a rare chance to see Christina in a big role on a major movie."

","The Legend of Ron Burgandy, Anchorman examines the life of a popular news anchor in 1970's San Diego. He has the bad hair, the cheesy mustache and everything else that makes a man popular, even if he doesn't have a clue about what journalism is. When a beautiful woman (Christina Applegate) who actually has an intellect shows up at the station, Ron is at first intrigued - that is until he finds out that she will be co-anchoring with him. In a society and industry where men rule, there is not enough room for the both of them, and while they are both romantically interested in one another, it is going to be war... Very little can be said in this review to change someone's mind as whether to see Anchorman or not; the first time the previews played, most people decided right then and there. Ferrell has a big following of fans who find him to be one of the funniest men alive, and then there are those that see him as only the next successor of the SNL comedians, who have the tendency to make their mark for a few years and then fade off. Anchorman is a movie for those that enjoy silly humor; anyone who doesn't should probably just stop reading this review right now. Anchorman is funny from beginning to end, mainly thanks to Ferrell's skillful need to be zany at all moments of filming. Ferrell is so good at turning even the worst material into something witty that there is really no point in analyzing the script; the only thing that can be said is that the script obviously gave Ferrell and the rest of the cast free range to work their magic, and also throws in some jabs at the television journalism. For instance, for the entire movie all of the news stations are clambering over the story of a pregnant panda at the zoo, labeling it as ""the story of the decade."" Funny enough, this isn't too far from the truth as local news tends to put a huge emphasis on unimportant animal stories. By the way, Steve Carrell as Brick is also quite hilarious. The movie succeeds by always being goofy and never taking itself seriously; it never stops to take a breath so I loved it! Nathan Cali"

Ferrell's experience on Saturday Night Live shines through as he's able to make the most out of just about every joke. Steve Carell is fantastic as the retarded weatherman.

Fred Willard played the befuddled boss/director, and I think he was pretty good trying to balance pleasing his star anchorman and the new woman on the scene.<br/><br/>My problem with this film is Christina Applegate. I think Ms. Applegate is a very beautiful and talented comedienne. And she holds her own against Mr. Ferrell's histrionics. However, it appears to me that she had some plastic surgery, and it looked like she was unable to wrinkle her forehead. It was kind of disconcerting. I began paying more attention to her forehead than her performance. When she got angry at Ron, her voice showed it but not her face.

","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one of my favourite comedies of all time, and my favourite of 2004, one of the greatest years for movies of all time. We had a wonderful summer with other great movies like Spider-Man 2, DodgeBall, Kill Bill Volume 2 and The Day After Tomorrow. Anchorman was truly the best, and here's why: They were able to pull something off that's usually quite difficult. They made the emotional/love scenes funny! I also loved the music, such as the main theme and I liked hearing Neil Diamonds ""Cherry Cherry"" in the ""love at first sight"" scene. I've been waiting for a movie to have that song in a scene like that since it first came out in 1972. Now, onto the characters. Will Ferrell was always hilarious, and Paul Rudd was surprisingly funny in his role! David Koechner was hilarious, really reminded me of a good friend of mine, and Steve Carell.. Oh my, he was outstandingly hilarious in his role! A real break-through in his career as a comedy actor, and went on to do The 40 Year Old Virgin which I also really liked.

","Anchorman has a funny effect on me. I remember laughing out loud through nearly the whole film when I first saw it, and yet I still chuckle, to myself, at the now familiar jokes and setups. Like (the Holy Grail of American comedy) ""Caddyshack"" before it, Anchorman will live on in repeated lines for years to come. I don't pretend it's writing is more brilliant than ""Caddyshack"", it isn't. It's over the top where Caddyshack is underplayed to perfection, but the two stand as staggering cinematic moments in comedy. I've heard the outtakes are as funny as the finished film, and that most of the movie was just the lead actor's riffing, but I have to hand it Adam McKay for directing a mostly ""riffed"" film into a brilliant little piece. Of course, I love Will Ferrel's bluster (especially the outtake clips where he overreacts with so many ""Great - something's something"").<br/><br/>Still, the supporting cast is spot on, the performances always over-the-top and yet never over-the-line. Anchorman walks the tightrope and maintains a crazy energy the whole way through. It's also a very democratic film, every character receives a large share of the laughs. I struggle to think of characters on screen who are not being funny or adding to a joke. Accept the film for the big, ridiculous thing that it is and laugh your pants off.<br/><br/>Also, the moment Roger Ebert criticized as out-of-sync, the ""Brawl"", is just too funny on its own not to be there. Honestly, the last time you watched ""Caddyshack"", you knew the Yacht Club scene was a little un-subtle, but you still chuckle at the filmmakers disregard for maintaining tone. It's touches like that that keep these frenetic films alive for years to come. In ten years, you'll ask your friends what they could have been thinking shooting this scene, but you'll laugh just as hard knowing that they actually did shoot it and put it out there."

In San Diego, California during the 1970's, Ron Burgundy is the most watched news anchorman in the community. He is a master at what he does and never wants anyone to sabotage his reputation. His fellow news-team members are also very charismatic: Champ Kind, who handles the sports, knows how to have fun no matter where he goes; Brick Tamland, the weatherman, is very dedicated and persistent despite having a very low I.Q.; and Brian Fantana, the field reporter, has a very appealing personality even though it is often hard for him to make sensible moves. One day, a sweet and beautiful young woman named Veronica Corningstone is brought to the Channel 4 News staff and is met with mixed reactions from Ron and the gang. Ron gradually falls in love with Veroncia and the movie takes on whole new meaning. He wins her heart at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Once more, I think that this movie is extremely fun. Anchorman offers lots and lots of surprises for comedy fans everywhere. If you haven't seen it yet, do so because you will not regret it!"

","Will Ferrell is undoubtedly one of this era's great comedy geniuses. Every time he takes the screen he cracks me up! His performances are a laugh a minute and are always hilarious, even if the films themselves aren't so great (I hate to mention The Ladie's Man!). So it comes as no surprise that Anchorman is right up there on the laugh scale. This film is so unbelievably stupid but Ferrell plays it dead straight as Ron Burgundy, the legendary 1970's news anchor. Burgundy's status as network top dog is threatened when young, ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) is hired. Stupid, silly humour is abound throughout the film and is set off by a number of things. The 70's gear is a absolute crackup! And so many cameos!! If you are a fan of Will Ferrell or just good old fashioned dumbass humour, you just have to see Anchorman!"

","I looked forward to this movie coming out, I thought the trailer was a riot. Strangely they really didn't use any of those scenes in the movie or when they did the scenes were cut up and lost much of their impact. Having worked in radio and down the hall from a TV station I know about the egos and the TV stars. This was the perfect concept that just did not jell for me. I didn't find much to laugh at. The humor if you call it that was as childish and tacky as a leisure suit. Making one of the news team members an idiot was not funny to me. The fight scene with the other stations was just plain STUPID! The way women were treated in the newsroom could have been done better, the pranks were pitiful and not funny.<br/><br/>I bought it used at the video store and I can trade it back in and get half my money back which I will do ASAP. A real waste of time. <br/><br/>The best thing about the movie was the great '70's soundtrack.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty was a movie with a similar theme, that movie thankfully got it right!"

Unbelievable! Was it really that bad? <br/><br/>The story takes place in the 70's. Ron Burgundy is the anchorman from channel 4. Him and his 3 more or less retarded friends are the news-team. One day, the hot female reporter Veronica Corningstone is added to the team. The 4 men definitely don't like the idea of sharing their news with a woman, and even worse, she clearly plans on taking Ron's job! <br/><br/>There were only a few moments in this movie where I wasn't amused. With this, I mean the annoying dog Baxter and its stupid subtitles. However, the idiocy of Ron Burgundy is good solid comedy. The storyline was a bit weird at times, but in my opinion, only for the better of the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a total imbecile, but I think this movie deserves far better than 1 star.

","Not real funny. I really don't have high expectations for recent cinema, but those low expectations weren't even met. I kept expecting to laugh, looking for the jokes, waiting for it ... but nothing. The only funny parts of the movie are the character of Brick Tamland (he just says random things, and I think they were all improvised) and the outtakes at the end. There is one laugh regarding a prank the female newscaster plays on Ron Burgundy, but that was mostly for the shock value than actual humor content. Oh, and there's a little dig at the Bush Administration at the end, but it was so unoriginal and unfunny as to almost be insulting. If you're just dying to see this movie, go find the trailer and watch it. The trailer has about all the kinda funny lines Ron Burgundy says in a convenient short form.

Anchorman is an example of how funny and unfunny he can be. The funniest parts were honestly the bloopers during the end credits, where i laughed a lot more than the entire movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a series of either mildly funny or just stupid scenes.

","I just saw Anchorman recently, and was surprised to see how many people seemed to hate it. I kind of had to weigh in here to help make the score for this film reflect in a more realistic way its' actual worth. Comedies are kind of like horror movies in that you have to suspend belief to a certain extent and just go along for the ride. If you want a sound, reality based movie, go watch a serious drama. This movie was simply, pure escapement. Sure, it was dumb fun. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. This time around, I wanted a movie with lots of laughs, and Anchorman, by and large, delivered. I came into the movie not having any experience with any of Will Farrell movies, TV appearances on SNL, or anything. I had no idea what I was going to get. What I got was a pleasant enough farce, though by no means a classic. Will Farrell plays the fool quite well, and parts of the movie was pure genius, though most of the laughs for me were generated by the rest of the cast. I mean, how could you not laugh at the biker drop kicking Ron Burgundy's dog off the bridge, or the (very) mean spirited banter between Ron and Veronica over the end credits of the nightly broadcast following their recent breakup? My only complaint was that on the DVD version, I had never yet to date seen so many good scenes wind up on the cutting room floor. My opinion? 7 out of 10 stars. Very close to being the best comedy of the summer, though ""Harold and Kumar goes to White Castle"" probably edges it out by a hair."

Unfortunately, it's easy to tell when the actors veer away from the script because the context of their jokes don't make any sense and they go into the gross and annoying. While Ferrel is competent with most of the material, the majority of the supporting cast comes off weak, including Fred Willard. The only other bright spot is the weatherman (Steve Carrell).

But in the end, it just doesn't come through.<br/><br/>I've seen the same problem in all too many movies made by 'Saturday Night Live' alumni--an idea that might (or might not) have made for good sketch comedy is mercilessly stretched over 90 minutes or so, and usually doesn't survive the experience.<br/><br/>An obnoxious TV news anchor in the swingin' 70s? The idea itself isn't too bad--maybe Ron Burgundy could have done well as a recurring character on SNL, but you can't build a feature film around a character like that. The sex jokes and 70s-culture references get old in a hell of a hurry, and there's just nowhere left for the movie to go. As happens so often on SNL (and other sketch-comedy shows, like MAD TV), ""Anchorman"" feels as though they started out with a great idea, then said ""Damn...now that everyone's watching, how do we finish this?"" <br/><br/>I will admit, there are a couple of genuine ""bwa-ha funny"" moments (the scenes with the Teleprompter are definitely on that list), and those moments do save the movie from being a total disaster. They don't build on any of these funny moments, though--they happen, then they die off, and the script is very uneven as a result.<br/><br/>Overall: very, very thin stuff.

","Sense of humour, like musical taste, is an intensely personal thing. That it is not until #16 on this site's top 250 films that we see a film which could even remotely be classified as a comedy (Dr. Strangelove) is testament to the fact that, when it comes to comedies, one man's Beethoven is another's Vanilla Ice. Note also, that in one of the many criminally awful (yet strangely addictive) E! Entertainment Specials, the woeful ""Blazing Saddles"" was named the greatest comedy ever. With this firmly entrenched in my mind, i will review Anchorman.<br/><br/>The whole premise of Anchorman is thin enough to be a potato chip. A news team of chauvinist males are up against the newly appointed, ambitious female newsreader. Its not much, but it is enough for Will Ferrell to work something.<br/><br/>Ferrell could make me laugh painting a wall, so it is difficult to be objective about the film, but as i prefaced, it is difficult anyway. I would call it a mildly above average comedy. It made me laugh, a fair bit too, but there is little substance to it, and most of the laughs are cheap.<br/><br/>The cameos which have characterised the recent films involving the team of Ferrell, Stiller, Wilson and Vaughan, are on the money. Particularly the unexpected appearance of Tim Robbins.<br/><br/>In reality, Anchorman is little more than a pleasant diversion.

This is a film that succeeds in its own unique, bizarre manner, a film so ostensibly inane and mindless that it perhaps didn't require much of a script for its execution. With a premise so universal and amusing: a look inside the life of obnoxious news anchors, the film's deliverance of comedy is equally brilliant. One relentless riot after another, from ridiculing the now accepted concept of women in newscasting in such a profane, irreverent manner, to ""the bloody showdown"" of the rival local newsteams, to some hilarious innuendo on the news teleprompter, and on and on and on. This is an insane, outrageous comedy, and nothing more, so all that is required to enjoy the laughs is some humor (and maybe some depreciation towards newsteams). It covers all the bases you might expect in a comedy, from clever, implicit jokes about culture and gender, to insane, outrageous occurrences you would never see coming, to delicious dialogue (""When in Rome...""); this film succeeds on nearly every level as simply one of the funniest films ever. Outrageous, mindless fun that promises to amuse those who believe there are no bounds in the eloquence of comedy. **** out of ****"

","Man, I don't remember the last time I've laughed so hard. I finally saw this film last night and I wish I wouldn't have waited so long. This movie made no sense whatsoever, but it's hilarity made up for it easily. I completely lost it during Jack Black's cameo. I don't want to give anything away, but I HIGHLY recommend that everyone see this hilarious comedy. I'm definitely going to watch it many many more times. The icing on the cake was the dumb reporter. I know I personally have a weird sense of humor and that may be why that character cracked me up so much. I mean, he said things that had nothing to do with the dialogue at all. I'm laughing so much right now I have to buy this movie when it is released. <br/><br/>This movie gets an 8/10 from me."
"michaelholme","Null","0","1","27 August 2004"," One of the funniest films I've seen in a long time
","I see many people get all bent out of shape about Anchorman's lack of plot. The lack of plot is actually one of the aspects of the film that makes it hilarious since the plot is so ridiculous! Brick, the retarded weatherman, really steals the show (""Where did you get that suit? The toilet store?""). Will Ferrell once again plays his hysterical self as Ron Burgundy, a chauvinistic and silly anchorman who is wrapped up in himself. The sheer stupidity of the film had laughing so hard I was struggling for breath! The ridiculousness of the fight scene between all the rival anchormen (with a great cameo appearance from Ben Stiller) was one of the countless highlights of the film. I walked out of the theater with a smile and I cannot wait to see it come out on DVD!<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"jew_59","8","0","1","24 August 2004"," All the news and fits
","This is one of the silliest, dumbest movies I have ever seen. The plot is paper thin, the characters are drawn in broad unbelievable strokes, the gags are totally crazy. Over all, it's impossible to buy  a minute of this film.<br/><br/>That being said, I have not laughed this hard in a while.  The story, though absolutely insane, had me in stitches the entire time. Rarely was there a comedic misfire with each gag more outrageous than the last.<br/><br/>If you want quiet sophisticated humor, see a Woody Allen Film. For pure belly laughs, see Anchorman."
"Barky44","5","0","1","1 August 2004"," This Just In: Another SNL Alum Flops
","Anchorman is a comedy starring Will Farrell of Saturday Night Live fame. It is a spoof of 70's local news broadcasting, complete with sexist humor and wide lapels.<br/><br/>It's a mediocre comedy at best. There are some very funny bits about lame local news stories (including the obligatory waterskiing squirrel), and a lot of sexist jokes about the new anchorwoman (played by personal favorite Christina Applegate). The scenes where the threatened reporters try to distract her during her first telecast are hysterical.<br/><br/>The big problem is the film is not consistently funny. They ruin it right away by making Will and Christina an unbelievable ""item"", it goes downhill from there. A promising but eventually ludicrous scene involving a rumble between rival telecasters shows one of the problems: over-the-top humor. Humor can be at it's funniest when it's smart and sly, here they try to pummel you with it, but unlike Airplane, they carry it too far.<br/><br/>I give the film 5 out of 10, because it's funny about half the time.<br/><br/>

"johnnyaction80","5","0","1","19 July 2004"," Anchorman is the best movie ever. Except for the ending. And all the other movies that are better than Anchorman.
","These type of comedies are so fun. Plot takes the backseat while improvisation takes the wheel. This movie feels like the creators looked at the script to see what scene is next, then said what ever they felt like. It's truly a comedy that bows down to no rules of logic. There is a scene where the news teams of five different channels meet randomly and a fight to the death, gang-war begins. With future viewings of this film the parts that are going to stand out are the golden lines that come frequently. ""By Zuse's beard"", Will Farrell says when he sees a knock-out blonde. It may not seem that funny, but it's a good example of Farrell always being hilarious, no matter what. When tragedy strikes Ron Burgendy. It comes in the form of a foot from a special cameoed celebrity, kicking Ron's dog, Baxter, off of a bridge. This leads to Burgendy calling a fellow reporter and crying while struggling to tell him what had happened. The harder Farrel cries, the more confused the reporter is, the harder the audience laughs. Anchorman is filled with scenes that build audience laughter by the characters reacting to one another. When Burgendy breaks into song to describe how love feels and all the characters follow in an acapella version of Afternoon Delight, it's magic. Sadly, just like most comedies of this nature, the magic ends in the third act. When it's time to stop messing around and squeeze in some kind of climax and an ending to the plot that hasn't really been the focus. It comes off rushed. Kind of like Ron Burgendy finishing off his scotch in the last seconds before 6 o'clock news is on air."
"7dayweekend","Null","0","1","19 July 2004"," Skip it and watch Broadcast News or Mary reruns
","I really hate it when I see a film and walk out of a theatre thinking of a hundred ways that the script (pretty much nonexistent in this case) could have been better.<br/><br/>There is a real difference between sketch comedy writing and comedy film narrative. The writer and director have no idea what they are doing. I wasn't expecting Broadcast News or His Girl Friday but this was so sophomoric I stopped finding this level of humor funny by the time I was a high school sophomore.<br/><br/>Will Farrell as a forty year old fraternity rat is not funny, but pathetic. The film is also anti-PC (while pretending to be PC) which can be a good thing but not like this. <br/><br/>People who liked this movie, you need to do a little film history research and learn about free form chaotic comedy and how to do it right, i.e. go see Life of Brian in the 25 year revival or Duck Soup or early Woody Allen. John Cleese is funnier reading the Gettysburg Address than Farrell is trying to be funny."
"fgwri","Null","0","1","16 July 2004"," Very stupid, but it has it's moments
","If you're looking for a funny flick that also has some intellectual stimulation, look elsewhere. If you reduce yourself to wanting some mindless entertainment, then Anchorman is right up your alley. Basically, it's a romp through a 70's newsroom, where a hotshot reporter has to contend with an up and coming female contender to his throne. Very cheesy, and most of the gags in this one are either ho-hum or just outright stupid. But there were a few genuinely funny moments that kept me tuned in. Steven Carell really shines as one of Ferrell's dimwitted sidekicks. I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan; his off-beat brand of humor has never really did it for me. But it seemed to fit in just fine here. Overall, I would say not worth full admission price; wait til it hits your local video store."

The weatherman was the funniest character in the movie. The film was not worthy of Will Farrel's talents. Hard to believe that the film got such good reviews. I am usually open to raw humor but this was stupid. I can't think of any more bad things to say. The rules say I have to write 10 lines.<br/><br/>In all it sucked."

","Yet another one of those movies where the trailers show the funniest bits. Apart from that, the cameos from Jack Black & Ben Stiller are good, but the rest of the movie is just like an SNL repeat. It's disappointing, and to be honest - as a non-American and non-SNL viewer - I just didn't get half of the stuff (the whole ""Brick"" character in particular was just a cheap and crappy gimmick, the only laugh being at the end credits). Don't get me wrong - I like Will ferrel and his other movies, but i just thought the antics in this one were poor, we'd seen all the jokes after the first 15 minutes. After that they were just recycled in a different order. Now I've written all this and reminded myself, I think I should reduce my vote even further!"

","After seeing teasers for this for quite a while, I was pretty excited to see this movie. I had been watching Old School to get myself in the mood for some good Will Ferrell humor. So, got my tickets for opening night, and headed to the theater. The opening credits got a few laughs, but after that, it was down-hill. The entire theater seemed to be put off by the movie. I, for one, was very disappointed in the movie. In essence, the ads showed the only good parts, and when I look back at it, those parts weren't all that great. I almost left the movie. Sigh. And with this cast, it should have been stellar. Anyways, I just think it was an SNL skit Will thought up and never used, and then tried to turn it into a feature-length film. Bad idea.<br/><br/>Just wait for it to play on television."

Will Ferrel was not exceptionally funny in this movie, he was just ""ok"". Steve Carrell is absolutely the best part of this movie. His semi-retarded character is hilarious and he should have been included more than he was. The other two members of the ""Action news team"" are painfully unfunny. Applegate didn't have any funny lines in the movie, she just played it straight the whole time so she didn't get the opportunity to be funny.

","I feel that the review that's posted on the first page for this film is completely unfounded as the reviewer suddenly perceives to know how and why the strangers around him were laughing (saying it was contrived laughter).<br/><br/>I found the film to be a laugh riot. As usual, Ferrell delivers the laughs without holding punches. This is a man who never thinks twice about how ridiculous he might look when delivering the funny. <br/><br/>What could have been a boring premise in the hands of another director and cast became a hilarious playing ground for the well seasoned talent in this film. Cameo upon cameo peppers the film with unforgettable performances and no doubt, this film will soon become a cult classic like Office Space before it. <br/><br/>This film just shows what we have always known - critics can never agree on what's funny. You can agree about a drama being poorly written or a science fiction film not filling in the plot holes, but comedy is such that not everyone is going to find the same thing funny. No one can truly tell an audience what is or isn't funny because comedy is a personal thing. And this film certainly proved to be funny for me and everyone who I attended the showing with.<br/><br/>If Will keeps up this kind of work, he will survive long after those around him have perished.

"dm-38","8","0","1","11 July 2004"," Finally A Silly Comedy Worth Paying $10 For!
","I rarely go see comedies in the theaters anymore. If I see any, it will be on DVD or on cable. It's not that comedies lately have sucked. It's just that as I get older I have gotten bored of the same formulas used over and over again. Comedy is such a difficult genre to make, and make well, for long-form cinema. Too often we are treated to one of a few types of comedies which don't do much for me.<br/><br/>Lately the formula's have been the Farelly-style gross-out movies, the stupid-but-sincere Adam Sandler flicks, or the one-joke wonders (any SNL sketch turned into a movie, etc.)<br/><br/>I honestly expected to be disappointed walking into this movie. I thought this movie basically was going to be a one-joke movie: look how narcissistic Ron Burgandy is, isn't that funny! But I was totally surprised to find myself laughing to the point of tears. Will Ferrell's character is great, but so many other hilarious characters in this movie make it an ensemble tour-de-farce. <br/><br/>I also was afraid it was going to be another one of those comedies that is half silly but half serious like so many Adam Sandler flicks that have to have some sort of sincerity, sweet happy ending, or some moral dimension; which formulaic Hollywood execs love for some reason. At one point I thought ""Anchorman"" was heading in that direction, but pleasantly it doesn't go for that: it stays true to itself as a very funny, ridiculous movie.<br/><br/>This is a comedy that relies heavily on random, improv-style comedy. It's creative, non- sensical, absurdist and ""silly"" in the British humour sort of way. If you love improv comedy or absurd-random humour you'll absolutely love this movie like I did."
"ThurstonHunger","Null","0","1","11 July 2004"," Mindless comedy works best without a thought...
","I don't think this is the film that will bring tons of new fans to Will Ferrell, but for those of us who enjoyed his time on SNL this should do just fine.<br/><br/>While some here cite this as nothing more than an SNL skit stretched to film-length, I disagree (we've already seen more than enough of those). This really rivals an SNL episode. It's the same length, but I think overall there are more laughs in this and certainly less commercials. At the same time, SNL is free...<br/><br/>Well, this was worth a matinée for me and my wife. We went in with our expectations scraping the floor and that always helps for a comedy. There are some Ferrell staples like idiotic idioms for $100, bad yet funny nakedness for $200 (well nearly nakedness we don't get the full burrito here), a cavorting cover of a goofy pop song for $300, and plenty of doofy self-denigration....priceless!<br/><br/>So we got our money's worth...in addition a new manchild maneuver, the crying inconsolably and uncontrollably worked very well. The required animal-abuse humor is included, and better than usual. Anthropomorphizing worked for Muppets and it works here too with a dog godhead.<br/><br/>Passing gas is largely passed over (thankfully), but fun is poked priapically at prudes (even more thankfully). That scene works well because it is an embarrassment most male members can identify with.<br/><br/>Where this film could have worked more? Squeeze in even more jokes...why save them for the 4-hour DVD, cut out the semblance of plot altogether. The Taliban was defeated, we know women can compete with men. Heck, you could have used Tina Fey more than Christina Applegate. I think the old Naked Gun films worked thanks to rapid firing...if a dud came along, you didn't have minutes to think how pathetic it was, as another round came in immediately. <br/><br/>I do think it is admirable that the trailer, rather than representing the sum of the funny moments in the film, actually had a fair amount of funny moments *not* from the film. I suspect that everyone making a comedy wants to also make a great film, but not everyone should try. Mindless comedy works best without a thought...<br/><br/>Sadly the Old School mini-reunion sorta flopped. Cameos on SNL worked usually because someone on screen was impersonating DeNiro or Dole when the real deal appeared. The excitement of the live crowd, and the inherent awkward nature of doing an impersonation in front of the target added to it. Here the cameos are mostly harmless...and Vince Vaughan gets really only one laugh when he chastises his posse. He's usually money (sorry...but really he's painfully funny when unchained).<br/><br/>Meanwhile Ferrell's posse never rivals Will for a laugh. I've seen rave reviews for Steve Carell's one-brick-in-his-name, many-shy-of-a-load weatherman and he's the best of the bunch, but Ferrell is funny enough that he can fend off even more competition. Let Will and Jack Black collide for a full film!!<br/><br/>If you read more, or I write more...than we're overthinking this. If you enjoy Ferrell's brash cluelessness (less snarky than Bill Murray's, but playing upon our same fear of lacking self-awareness) then you'll likely want to tune in Anchorman.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

I felt all the characters were funny in there own unique way. The previews of this movie don't do it justice, which is rare in comedies. Usually comedies show their 3 or 4 funniest scenes in the preview and this is NOT the case in Anchorman. It has a dozen or more ""belly laugh"" scenes and none of them are in the previews on TV.

This movie is a pure comedy- it's sole purpose in life is to make people laugh, and the entire theater was near tears with laughter. Critics may do what they do best, and overlook some of the more fantastical scenes, and mock the violence which is used wonderfully to make one of the funniest scenes in the movie, but this is what you would call a must see.

","Will Ferrell still aims to please (and still does) in this movie. I expected to laugh, and I realized I underestimated this movie. Will Ferrell was absolutely stunning and hilarious, just what you would expect from him. If you're looking for a good laugh, I recommend Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy all the way. Ferrell plays a San Fransisco news anchor in the 1970's, the time when only men delivered the news. He was named Ron Burgundy, who was loved by all. Thanks to his excellent talent of reading off the telepromtor, he once again made his news channel #1 in the ratings, which leads to conflicts throughout the film. Ron later finds himself having to share the spotlight with his co-anchor Veronica Corningstone, which, as you can also guess, leads to more conflict as the battle of the sexes. Ferrell is teamed up with a colorful cast which brings more to the story. I give this movie a 9/10, but i give Ferrell a perfect 10/10. This movie is totally worth watching, if you're over 13."
"JAKastner","8","0","1","9 July 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
","Will Ferrell is boldly going where no Saturday Night Live! performer has gone in years  translated success from the small screen to the big screen! Not since Mike Myers made the move to feature films with Wayne's World has Hollywood seen such a comedic performer such as Will Ferrell. It isn't recent that Ferrell has been making appearances in feature films; in fact he made his feature film debut in the Mike Myers comedy, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in 1997. Since then he has made feature roles and cameos in numerous comedies, none of which have made anything beyond a few million dollars of their production budgets. It wasn't until 2003 when Ferrell appeared in two surprise smash-hits, Old School and Elf, and decided to leave Saturday Night Live! Since then he has become of the most sought after comedic stars in Hollywood, receiving offers both left and right and there appears to be no sign of him slowing down anytime soon.<br/><br/>As with most sketch comedy films, the story doesn't matter as much to the audience as the laughs are all that seem to matter but Anchorman at least attempts, unlike so many others, to the plot it starts off with. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy takes movie-goers back to the 1970s when Ron Burgundy was San Diego's top-rated news anchor and only men were allowed to read the news. But the times are changing and when an ambitious female reporter, Veronica Corningstone, comes to the Channel 4 newsroom, Ron's world begins to change and not to his liking. At first, Veronica is given 'female' oriented interest stories, like cat fashion shows, and is kept out the lime-light for the most part. But one day, Ron fails to show up to report the news on time and Veronica takes his place, only to receive her big break and become co-anchor. Things just continue to get worse the more Ron fights the fact that he is no longer San Diego's top anchorman. The story for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy may not be the most accurate representation of the era at the time but it does manage to touch on some issues, as in the rise of feminism, that were of importance in the 1970s, although the film does not take them as seriously as they were in real life. But bottom-line is that film plays for laughs and nothing presented in this film should be taken seriously, except perhaps the representation of news anchors that are often seen on the local news today.<br/><br/>The cast of Anchorman consists of mainly of actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live!, whether they be current or former members, as well as several others that are well accustomed to sketch comedy of this nature. Will Ferrell, who proved to Hollywood that he was comedic driving force to be reckoned with thanks to his holiday smash-hit, Elf, owns the show as the title character, Ron Burgundy. This film proves to many that Ferrell is one of the best comedic minds in the business today as he is able to turn even the dumbest material into something funny  it may not be gut-busting but it doesn't come off as stupid as it should, which is all that matters to move the film along. Christina Applegate performs reasonably in the role of Veronica Corningstone, the female newswoman who threatens Ron Burgundy's news world. It wasn't that she doesn't work well in the film; there are severely scenes between her and Will Ferrell that are particularly funny. The problem is that most of the material given to her isn't as funny as it should be. Often she is too dependent on someone like Will Ferrell to help make the scene humorous and when it comes to a scene by herself, it doesn't have the same impact as the rest of the film. David Koechner's Champ Kind, the sports reporting cowboy, is one of the bigger disappointments and becomes a character that should have been entirely cut from the film as his material more trite and annoying then anything else. Steve Carell's Brick Tamland, the mentally retarded weatherman, is one of the biggest highlights of the film and, yes, there is a jab at the Bush administration with his character (what kind of Hollywood production would it be without one of those?) but other then that, he draws some of the biggest laughs of the film. And what would a comedy such as this be without celebrity cameos? Though many of the jokes of Anchorman don't live up to other comedies, this is one area where it probably rises above anything else in the past few years, including the opening segment of Austin Powers in Goldmember. Without giving away anything, pay attention to the street-fight sequence or you may miss someone.<br/><br/>Overall, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is dumb, immature, and lacks the consistency and technique of vastly superior comedies of the past such of Austin Powers but in a summer severely lacking in anything remotely humorous, it does the job its meant to do, making us laugh, even if years from now it will be long forgotten. One of the film's main problems is that there isn't anything excessively amusing. There are certain parts of the film that are certainly humorous, most notably the street-fight sequence between the numerous news teams, but they are few and far between. For the most part Anchorman relies on monotonous toilet humor that becomes old and tired the more they use it. It doesn't get to the point where it makes the film intolerable but it gets graze the line a bit. Another problem wasn't what was seen but rather it was the material that wasn't shown in the comedy. Remember the film's trailer? Some of the trailer's more entertaining moments don't make into the film ('Well, I'm getting a divorce and I may never see my kids again'  'Fantastic!') but according to the film's director, he ended up with about four hours worth of material which may all end up on a special edition DVD when its released later this year. The point is, despite those minor complaints, Anchorman is a pure, dumb comedy that doesn't expect to be anything more then entertaining, even if it fails to be all that memorable. In a year that has certainly lacked its share of quality comedies, let alone decent ones, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is one class act and worth the price of admission this summer.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)"
"MechaSlinky","10","0","1","9 July 2004"," This is the best movie Ben Stiller has been in all year.
","I will say this. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is, without even the slightest hint of doubt, and with not a single exception, the greatest movie ever created in the history of all the universe and all parallel universes. It is flawless. It is so great in every single way that not even the mighty Christopher Walken could make it better. If this movie is not held up high as a timeless classic of comedy, if not the absolute epitome of all things right with the world and good in life, for decades upon decades to come, I will personally see to the world's destruction. This I swear to you.<br/><br/>This movie is not only hilarious beyond belief (Steve Carell steals every scene he is in), but it actually manages to do something no other comedy has ever done before. Ever. It manages to tell a really good story without the story ever getting in the way of the comedy. There isn't a single scene that isn't funny because it's too busy advancing the plot. Either the jokes enhance the plot, the plot enhances the jokes, or they both enhance each other in some sort of weird plot/joke 69 orgy of greatness.<br/><br/>~MechaSlinky... Baxter should win an Oscar. I don't care which category."

","Watching this movie is better than therapy! Will Ferrell is a master of comedy! Not only does Ferrell authentically capture all the cheesiness of the 1970s perfectly-coiffed, mustachioed, male chauvinist, he revels in it. It's so funny watching him react to everything in life while using his ""broadcast voice."" It turned many scenes from being just funny to being hilarious! The supporting cast is just as strong with scene stealing from Steve Carrell and Fred Williard. The real ""star"" of Anchorman is Ron Burgundy's dog, Baxter: what a cutie! There are several cameos that make you go from ""oh my God that's..."" to peeing your pants! I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Will Ferrell's work or who remember just how laughable the 70s were. ""Six Million Dollar Man"" sound effects, sappy love songs, a cartoon sequence and men who name their penis: it's all here! Enjoy!"
"anne13-1","10","0","2","8 July 2004"," so funny it made my fiancé's boss cry with joy.
","There are few movies that have come out recently that I would rate as highly as this one. Usually when you go into a movie with high expectations, you're a little let down. But this is NOT one of those occasions. Will Ferrell's ability to truly sell a character is once again outstanding! The entire cast does a phenomenal job. You have to be grateful for a cast such as this who can have a sense of humor and put themselves into these ridiculous roles 100%. Hats off to all involved! I can't wait to own this one."
"notjim1150","10","0","2","7 July 2004"," ""It's official...Will Ferrell, funniest man in America!""
","Saw ""Anchorman"" the other day at a sneak peak, and I gotta tell ya...holy ""F""... Will Ferrell, is without doubt, the FUNNIEST man (or woman...sorry) in America. Great physical stuff. Great one liners. Great set pieces. Great, well, just about everything. This is a FUNNY movie.<br/><br/>To be honest, for the last several years, Ben Stiller, has been the ""Man"" when it came to ""Funny,"" for me. Who would have believed that the ""Cheerleader Guy"" from SNL, and Adam Mckay, the guy who directed the short film (The ""H"" To The ""O"") on SNL, among countless others, would end up making this hilarious film.<br/><br/>But they did, and if push comes to shove, and you only got ten bucks to spend on, oh say, Spider Man or Anchorman, do the right thing, and ""tune in at eleven""...you'll laugh your balls off!"
