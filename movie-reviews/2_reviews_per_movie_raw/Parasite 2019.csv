"mysticfall","10","3818","4210","18 October 2019"," For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half
","It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.<br/><br/>It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.<br/><br/>Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".<br/><br/>It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.<br/><br/>It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.<br/><br/>Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.<br/><br/>At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.<br/><br/>Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.<br/><br/>That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.<br/><br/>And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.<br/><br/>However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.<br/><br/>With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.<br/><br/>The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.<br/><br/>Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.<br/><br/>But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","1543","1970","5 July 2019"," One of the best films of this decade
","I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.<br/><br/>What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).<br/><br/>And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.<br/><br/>I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).<br/><br/>Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.<br/><br/>When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
"jtindahouse","8","663","872","6 October 2019"," You name a genre, this movie covers it
","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.<br/><br/>I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.<br/><br/>The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
"nehpetstephen","10","589","824","25 August 2019"," Meritocracy: it's metaphorical
","In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""<br/><br/>The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.<br/><br/>But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.<br/><br/>But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.<br/><br/>I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.<br/><br/>South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.<br/><br/>The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
"Aaron_Kyle","10","454","638","28 December 2019"," A modern era masterpiece
","Parasite was directed and written by Bong Joon Ho and tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.<br/><br/>Parasite can best be described as astonishing, astounding, stunning or any other synonym of amazing. It is so far my favourite film of the year and one of my favourite films of the decade. The very idea of the plot is simple but incredibly hard to execute and that's, why it's editing, is pitch-perfect and leads to an unexpectedly shocking and brutal ending.<br/><br/>The biggest forte of Parasite is the screenplay as it impeccably mixes comedy, drama and horror featuring flawless pacing, breath-taking cinematography, a beautiful score and a brilliant cast making it a masterpiece. Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them. Themes of capitalism can also be felt throughout the film, but Parasite shouldn't be mistaken as a pro-capitalism film as it doesn't support or hate anyone or any side; it's ambiguity also contributes to this factor.<br/><br/>Taking everything into account, Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by everyone at some point in their lives, especially film lovers.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 10/10"

The humour was also done really well. It's just that past the halfway mark it becomes a bit 'meh'. Kind of similar in a way to the film 'us', once it did it's core 'reveal'.

"tmcapitals","10","271","438","5 November 2019"," One of the most thought provoking films I've ever seen
","Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite.
Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that.
The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."

Who am I gonna recommend this movie to ?
Am i gonna remember this movie a year from now ?<br/><br/>Beside the somewhat chaotically random events happening in the movie, Parasite wants to be way too many things at the same time, a deep serious movie with a message, a comedy, a drama, and a thriller, the mixture left me feeling confused and not really sure what to feel once it ended.<br/><br/>It wasn't too bad, some scenes were super intense and enjoyable for thriller lovers. But I don't see myself recommending it to anyone who wants all these genres crammed in a single movie, nor do I feel anything from the story was amazing enough to stick with me in the future."
"DJKwa","9","274","451","2 July 2019"," Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us
","As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.<br/><br/>That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.<br/><br/>The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.<br/><br/>It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.<br/><br/>However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."

","Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.<br/><br/>The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.<br/><br/>Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life.

","This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away.

","How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.<br/><br/>There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.<br/><br/>It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon.

You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too!
There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog?

"CineMuseFilms","8","82","137","28 December 2019"," A black comedy on social inequality
","There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.<br/><br/>If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.<br/><br/>The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.<br/><br/>There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.<br/><br/>For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."

"crownofsprats","7","203","368","22 August 2019"," Observations
","Firstly, movie hype of the wildfire sort (ovation, talk of Cannes, etc) grossly overinflates expectations for a film. If you've read 50 reviews calling something 'best film ever' and then watch said film, I can almost guarantee you will not share their opinion afterwards. No, it's not a flawless masterpiece that will be remembered for centuries - but just because others think so is no reason to hate on it either, since it is undoubtedly an accomplished and entertaining piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Haters may hate for ideological reasons: something is definitely fishy with the skewed helpful/unhelpful ratio on most of these reviews (it's 1:5 to 1:10 for most reviews), which may or may not point to some sort campaign of orchestrated manipulation, or at the very least an outpouring of emotion. Clearly this has people roiled up!<br/><br/>Which is funny, because it's not really all that clear what there is to get roiled up about! Lots of reviewers talk about the underlying themes and motifs and whatnot, vaguely alluding to what those are - class struggle, a dash of political allegory - but no one so far has written up any sort of concrete analysis that decodes the film, pointing out the literary, cinematic, political, or psychological allusions in specific scenes. If you read enough of these reviews, you know there's always at least one arch-geek who takes on the challenge and posts something that borders on coherent and insightful. The North Korea references would be a great place to start, perhaps.<br/><br/>But yeah, I suspect this aggravated the sensibilities of some anti-anti-capitalist types, who rail against any lefty do-gooder subtext and want their films all storytelling and no agenda. (This is a silly expectation, since most storytelling throughout history is overtly agenda-driven.) Though it's definitely not a 'pro-capitalism' film, it is quite ambiguous about its morality, and there is no one to really root for or hate. This is actually one of its more subtle but grandiose achievements.<br/><br/>More to the point are criticisms of the acting, which may or may not be annoying (I don't speak Korean, so I cannot fully judge). Plot is on the improbable side, although the 'fun factor' of watching this unravel counterweighs the contrived nature of the initial setup. The final stretch doesn't quite deliver (if it did, this would be a 9-10), and there's an unnecessary and rather maudlin coda.<br/><br/>But overall, strong work, and definitely one of the year's must-see films."

","After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!"

","I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).<br/><br/>The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.<br/><br/>Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.<br/><br/>7 stars"

","""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.<br/><br/>""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.<br/><br/>Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes."

But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become.

"collisd","10","65","111","1 February 2020"," Parasite: a poignant reflection upon inequality - and funny
","This film - Parasite - is so good that I set up an IMDB account to write about it. The film is a reflection upon poverty and wealth, an issue that is visible and salient in South Korea where the film is set. It uses humour, likeable characters, and a mischievous pace to draw in the viewer. Like a frog in the proverbial slowly-heating pot, we unwittingly come to consider what it means to be poor, what it means to be rich, and the volatile interface between the two.<br/><br/>I began watching the film barracking for the various characters of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they weave themselves into the life of the wealthy Park family. The Kim family son, Ki-woo, pretends to be an English tutor to the Park family's daughter. In turn, Ki-woo draws in his sister, Ki-jung, who pretends to be an art therapist, to work with the traumatised Park family son. The mischief expands like a spider web, as the Kim family father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, take further positions within the Park family as their driver and housekeeper. It's a simple premise taken to a ludicrous extreme, making the film both real and not-real.<br/><br/>Beneath the light-hearted tone in which the 'parasitic' enmeshment is established, a dark underbelly of resentment reveals itself as the poorer Kim family inhabits the life of the wealthy Park family. As their unlikely success grows, the Kim family shift from a mindset of sporadic life resignations towards the dangerous realm of possibility. The Kim family may actually find a way out of poverty by inhabiting of the Park family house. The second half of the film shifts gear to explore the violence and ruthless deception that is spawned within this up-close-and-personal straddling of absurd extremes of inequality.<br/><br/>Parasite calls on its viewers to understand the dynamics of inequality through this fable-istic account of two families, both having their own type of parasitic relation to each other. The Kim family is parasitic on the money of the Park family; the Park family, in turn, is parasitic on the Kim family to do life's chores. With great agility, the film sidesteps the temptation to valorise the poor or demonise the rich. We like all the characters, but there are no heroes. Instead, Parasite invites us to reflect upon inequality in its inglorious everyday forms. The Park family father doesn't like the smell of the Kim family father, while the Park family son inadvertently almost reveals the Kim family ruse by innocently noting that 'they all smell the same.' Poverty and wealth are not abstract categories; they are smells, experienced differently by rich and poor.<br/><br/>In this down-to-earth-ness, the filmmaker, Bong Joon-ho, explicitly calls on viewers to interpret the movie on different levels. From the opening scenes, the Kim family son, Ki-woon, repeats the word 'metaphorical.' He is ostensibly talking about a rock that is supposed to bring wealth, but we viewers are left to open up wider horizons of meanings, such as: societies of great inequality must inevitably devolve into transactional-parasitic relations; wealthy families in the midst of poverty must inevitably defend against the social incursions of poorer people doing what they can to survive, as well as defending against the psychological incursions of bad conscience. In every rich household there is something hidden in the basement, as least psychologically.<br/><br/>This film holds its line against the temptation to explicitly condemn the evils of inequality. Instead it relentlessly represents the dynamics of inequality, drawing away from the judgement of individual characters, leaving it to viewers to make sense of it. Being vague enough to not spoil the ending, the film's climax portrays violence bubbling up as an expression of long-suppressed resentment. It does so in light of a jarring juxtaposition between the despairing circumstances of the poorer family hitting rock bottom, and the oblivious self-centredness of the rich family who are circumstantially geared by the everyday realities of inequality to not want to know about anything outside their bubble.<br/><br/>If the film has a political point, it shifts the debate about inequality. Instead of talking about the 'deserving poor' or the 'greedy rich', the film describes the impoverished social ecosystem of unequal societies, and the social roles and habits these societies require of their people. Violence in the face of absurd levels of inequality does not come from character flaws. But, rather, it emerges as the breaking point of the logics and habits of inequality taken to their logical extreme.<br/><br/>An untended pot of boiling water creates scalding steam, and eventually bubbles over."

"eoghanorourke-00011","8","28","44","9 February 2020"," Who the Parasite really was:
","We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea.
Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children.
In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.<br/><br/>The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.<br/><br/>The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns.
This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees.
Their crimes are as follows:<br/><br/><ul><li>Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.</li><li>Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.</li><li>Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.</li><li>Stealing food and alcohol.</li><li>Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lived underground for 4 years</li><li>Had a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of him</li><li>Was dead</li></ul><br/><br/>The Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be. What they were was a respectable family who contributed to society in a positive manner.
The Kims were a clever but immoral family who continually made bad decisions at key moments, bringing their downfall on themselves.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the parasite was so entrenched that once its downfall became the downfall of the host."

A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB...
It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them ""lovable"". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting.<br/><br/>Post Oscars Addition:
Technically Parasite is a great movie, no, really. But the Oscars are not about that. Nor it is why anybody watches movies. People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics. Now, the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising. Could be because it is a foreign movie, could be because it is a marxist movie, could be both, as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood. What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I'm sure that most fans don't care about the art of storytelling or directing. I think they believe what Bong Joon-ho ultimately shows us: that nobody is deserving, that we are all a bunch of idiots, clashing in a stupid game for money. But think about that: someone did build the house where we all want to live in, right? And that must be someone with some knowledge, skills, and integrity, otherwise the roof would have collapsed, wouldn't it? Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this?"

"jimbikerider","9","25","40","15 January 2020"," Parasite and Schizophrenia
","An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia.
There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water.
Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite.
Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion,
Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents.
Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes.
In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better?
A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy
Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality.
Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment.
The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes.
The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections.
The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him.
However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter.
Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia.
The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes."

","""Parasite"" Review
(10/10)<br/><br/>Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle.
It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again.
The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust.
At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor?
The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."

","Korean films are love. Yes, they are! 'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective.
Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure.
Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience.
No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.

Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.

"dynamitmand","10","20","31","20 January 2020"," The best movie of the year!
","I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!"
"stringheralong","9","20","31","20 January 2020"," A social commentary of the highest order
","As many other reviewers have mentioned, Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing. There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end.Take for example ""Crossing the line"" - the rich dad keeps bringing it up. He wants his staff to know their place. That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes.<br/><br/>Sure, it was easy, yet deceiving, to infiltrate their household so cunningly, but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper-class folks they were serving. Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn't fit in despite the daughter's fondness for him, she might even be in love with him (or she's just infatuated).<br/><br/>The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches. The upper-class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul. When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all.<br/><br/>The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion, frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair. The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around. In fact, the very man he drives around is disgusted by him.<br/><br/>This is a great movie that touches on many subjects. I highly recommend it."

","Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint.
The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."

","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.<br/><br/>It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.<br/><br/>The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.<br/><br/>The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.<br/><br/>In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.<br/><br/>Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."

","This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.<br/><br/>Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.<br/><br/>As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."
"overlookcinema","9","20","31","12 January 2020"," Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.
","There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.<br/><br/>But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.<br/><br/>The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.<br/><br/>Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.<br/><br/>The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.<br/><br/>If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.<br/><br/>You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."

"Nahid_15","9","20","31","12 January 2020"," Simple yet realistic
","This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense.
The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously.
What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently.
While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."
"filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin","10","20","31","28 December 2019"," UNLIKE EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER SEEN
","Parasite is such a fantastic movie that even its comparison with other amazing works can be dangerous. Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly.<br/><br/>The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets.<br/><br/>The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe.<br/><br/>Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house.<br/><br/>First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence.<br/><br/>After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung).<br/><br/>From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?"

Every reply is well studied and crafted, but the play is powerful and natural due to the high performance - play and sets.
I ve found a very articulate speech, addressing topics like: global warming, Korean Reunification, the ... global enclavisation, the mistification of science, the blindness of the media (Park seemns to be involved with media or visual arts), the running from myths and fears (the ghost from the basement is a very complexe symbol), the dephts of the social construction - with it s double perspective (the rain as a disaster or entertainment).
I ll watch this movie several times, because the building is equally robust and opened to zooming and nuances.

","A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho
SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan
CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin
In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.<br/><br/>Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.<br/><br/>Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.<br/><br/>From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!<br/><br/>The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.<br/><br/>So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"

It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life.

","SYNOPSIS:
A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film.
POSITIVES:
As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance.
NEGATIVES:
Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10.
CONCLUSION:
This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."

","I haven't watched many international films, mostly because I haven't been met with the opportunity of the will to actually go through with the commitment with finding the perfect film and taking my time to sustain it enough. But after hearing all the great reception of this movie I couldn't help but be intrigued enough to search for this movie. I was so happy when I saw it was playing in my local theatre, I rushed to go watch it with as little knowledge of the plot as possible, with the exception of the very vague trailer. And I'm glad the trailer I was shown was interesting enough to get my ass off to watch it but also vague enough to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it.
This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused. The beginning was slow but I was never bored. The jokes land delightfully especially since it had to be translated from Korean. I couldn't believe a movie like this could actually exist until the last 20 minutes I was snapped back to reality and realized ""OH RIGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW""
I have nothing against movies in other languages and from other cultures but I honestly didn't think I was gonna be left this impressed. I feel terrible that I had been missing out on such phenomenal works of art. I will mostly definitely try to seek out more of this director's work.
If this doesn't win Best Picture I will cry."

"sanda_moroianu","10","9","12","8 February 2020"," A film worth rewatching.
","I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!"

"joshtill-98100","10","9","12","5 February 2020"," Parasite: A Connection That Leeches On To Perhaps The Audience
","Parasite was one of the contenders for Best Picture that I was intrigued by. I had only heard good things going in, but nothing of the actual plot points. I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred. Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film. Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm. Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line, Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class.<br/><br/>The film opens to the Kim family, a very low-class family living in a semi-basement in South Korea. The family consists of Ki-Taek, the father, Chung-Sook, the mother, Ki-Woo, the son, and Ki-jeong, the daughter. They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. The house struggles with animal infestation, as Ki-Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house, acting as a bug disenfectant. Min-hyk, Ki-Woo's friend, offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house, a stone, which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it.<br/><br/>On his final night in town before studying abroad, Min-hyk offers Ki-Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family. Ki-Woo declines due to his lack of degrees, but Min-hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki-jeong, who excels with her photoshop. Ki-Woo enters the Park's house where the interview is to be held. Yeon-gyo, The mother of the Park Family, trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da-hye, the eldest child. On his way out, he notices a painting by the youngest child, Da-song. Ki-Woo, under the alias ""Kevin"" from Mrs. Park, refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica, who is actually Ki-jeong. Ki-Jeong and Mrs. Park discuss Da-song's artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger. Mrs. Park accepts Ki-jeong as Da-song's art therapist.<br/><br/>Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family, Ki-Taek comes up with a plan. One night, while exiting the house, the Park's Driver insists on taking Ki-jeong home. She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car, in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace. The driver is soon replaced by Ki-Taek. The maid, Moon-gwang, who lived in the house many years before the Parks, has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family. The Kim's present the evidence as Tuberculosis, ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung-Sook. The whole family, now working in the house, experience an upper-class living style. The Park Family goes away for a camping trip, leaving the whole house to Chung-Sook, who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well.<br/><br/>That night, a heavy downpour begins across town. As the Kim's settle in to the Park House, drinking and eating, Moon-Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung-Sook to let her inside, for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement. The remaining Kims hide while Chung-Sook goes with Moon-Gwang and helps her move a cupboard, which reveals a secret door. Moon-Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband, Geun-sae, who had been living there for four years, hiding from Loan Sharks. Moon-Gwang pleads Chung-Sook to take care of him, but she declines. The remaining Kim's fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they're all family to Moon-Gwang. She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs. Park, as Chung-Sook gets a phone call from Mrs. Park, who states the family is coming home due to the rain. Ki-Taek swiftly ties Moon-Gwang and Geun-Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs. The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re-enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued.<br/><br/>As Chung-Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks, Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong all hide under the living room table. Da-Song, saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined, insists on sleeping outside in his tent, in the midst of the storm. Mr. and Mrs. Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep. Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder-high. The three gather their belongings as Ki-Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck. The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours.<br/><br/>The next morning, Mrs. Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da-Song's birthday fun by creating a last-minute garden party for him. She invites Ki-Jeong, while Da-hye requests Ki-Woo to attend, for they have secretly been in love. Mrs. Park accepts and invites Ki-Taek and Chung-Sook to attend as well. As the party is about to begin, Ki-Woo opens the door to the basement, ready to kill Moon-Gwang and Geun-sae. Geun-Sae gets free and mourns Moon-Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight. Geun-Sae bashes Ki-Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party, holding a steak knife. He then stabs Ki-Jeong, as Da-Song faints, revealing that Geun-Sae was the ghost that he saw, which created his childhood trauma. As Mr. Park insists that Ki-Taek drive them to the hospital, Ki-Taek murders Mr. Park for not understanding the importance of class. Ki-Taek flees the scene, Ki-Jeong dies from her injuries, Ki-Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later, alongside Chung-Sook. A few months later, Ki-Woo is walking on a hill by the Park's residence where he sees a message using Morse Code. Ki-Woo decodes it, to reveal that Ki-Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement, going full circle from where the film began.<br/><br/>Parasite is a film that has no end. It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen. Bong-Joon-Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet. Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti-climactic (ie. the first half of the film just being about infiltration), the film never loses your interest. A great example is during the films first climactic moment, when the Park's call. The audience is sweating as you watch the father, fighting to ensure that the Parks don't find out about the truth, the children sweeping through broken glass bottles, and the mother who makes dinner. Nothing too much happening and yet, you are so intrigued. I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone.<br/><br/>Overall, Parasite gets a 10."

","One of the best movies i've ever seen. This movie is full of wonderful surprises.
The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it's overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house. Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical(laughed out loud). I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie.It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them. The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn't see any of it coming; it's really clever. I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so. The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off. I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out, i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed. It's a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality, meritocracy, social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don't have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie, this movie is for everyone.
Satirical, metaphorical, genius, paradoxical, impulsive, genuine; watch this movie!!!!"
"tomfeller","9","9","12","3 February 2020"," Story of two Korean families
","This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film."

","Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.<br/><br/>It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.<br/><br/>So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?<br/><br/>Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do."

","'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).<br/><br/>The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.<br/><br/>All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful."

The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story.<br/><br/>The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause.

With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale.

"abasu0819","10","16","24","29 January 2020"," A little fantastical journey that reflects the harsh and unfortunate reality.
","The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!<br/><br/>And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.<br/><br/>On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.<br/><br/>But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!"

","I made an Imdb account just so I could write this review. I watch a lot of films, typically one movie everyday and sometimes even two. Out of all the movies I watched, Schindler's List was my all time favourite. That film moved me in ways which no other film has managed to. I am a fan of Bong Joon Ho's work but none of his movies lingered in my mind with exception of "" memories of murder"", that film is a masterpiece. I watched Parasite at a local film festival and boy was I blown away by it. I have watched this movie more than 12 times and every time I watch it I discover something new about it. I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext. The musical score is haunting to say the least. I fear that Bong Joon Ho won't be able to top this film and every movie that he makes after this will be compared to Parasite. I highly recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece."

","I don't know whether if it's just me but each member of the ""parasitic"" family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves. It is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination on-screen.
The film starts out portraying the Kim family, their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich. A ""lucky stone"" introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait, clinging to the narrator throughout the plot. The all-too-powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon.
One of them leading to the protogonists' running away from the affluent Park's home after an eventful night. This scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers. This juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me- the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of ""actions gone too far"" makes you feel for them.
The transformation that the narrator's father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio- economic casteism that is present in our world.
A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!"

","When you go in unexpected get ready to be hit in the head harder than you can imagine.The movie takes you in for a slow burn which gradually comforts you in its comedic and slice of life plot which then unfolds into an epidemic rollercoaster of twists and turns. I intially thought this would be a gore or hardcore thriller film but it's something ethereal, something you need to let sink in as the film takes jabs at the hardships and reality of both stratas of life. The methodically cinematography and the clever use of sound effects and music makes every scene a work of art.

","Bong Joon-ho's (Snowpiercer/The Host) latest is coming to local screens w/the Palm D'Or stamp of excellence & it is well deserved. This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!"

","Glad I managed to watch Parasite just before the Oscars. A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories.<br/><br/>Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews.<br/><br/>I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time.<br/><br/>Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks.<br/><br/>The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against.<br/><br/>The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense.<br/><br/>The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions.<br/><br/>I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it.<br/><br/>Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film.
It will certain open many others for others to follow him.<br/><br/>A must watch.<br/><br/>PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)"
"classicsoncall","8","34","57","26 January 2020"," ""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""
","This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.<br/><br/>Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.<br/><br/>Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.<br/><br/>As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - """"If you make a plan, life never works out that way"". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!"
"akjaiswalsrk","10","27","44","10 February 2020"," Best movie of the year. Clearly Oscar Worthy.
","Bong joon ho gives you everything in this movie. Laughs, Suspense, Disgust, Empathy, Shock and Hope. The message is so woven into the film and subtle. Hardly a flaw in the film. The film does not talk down to it's audience and presents characters who are not your stereotypical rich and poor. The movie makes you think, a deep long think. The runtime of 132 mins is hardly noticeable in this fast faced storytelling with a crisp screenplay. Bong Joon Ho is hands down one of the best directors of our times. Deserves all the accolades it has been garnering."
"jacob-scheer90","10","27","44","10 February 2020"," This One is a Game-Changer
","In 2006, when I went to an art house movie theater, I saw Bong Joon Ho's campy but awesome sci-fi horror monster movie ""The Host."" I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs.<br/><br/>When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed.<br/><br/>But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win.<br/><br/>Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too.""<br/><br/>Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you."
"whippan","9","27","44","9 February 2020"," Parasite (2019)
","Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."

This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment.<br/><br/>A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches."
"zhenwenho","10","27","44","10 January 2020"," Absolute Brilliance
","It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.<br/><br/>To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.<br/><br/>A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.<br/><br/>Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.<br/><br/>Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats."

","This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane. There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. This--THIS is a TRUE thriller. Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on the condition of humanity."

","Parasite
Hollywood Theater
11/09/19<br/><br/>Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you're cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:<br/><br/>Part One:<br/><br/>Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can't go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.<br/><br/>I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I've been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I'll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.<br/><br/>The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you're in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.<br/><br/>It's worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you'll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you ""Terminator: Dark Fate,"" and John Cena's new firehouse dog movie ""Playing with Fire,"" will keep you company while you wait.<br/><br/>Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye' ave' been warnd' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)<br/><br/>Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It's a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it's an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two 'twentysomething' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur.
When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.<br/><br/>Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He's totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.<br/><br/>I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren't. That's something I respect about Parasite, there aren't any clear cut villains or heroes. It's not that kind of story. It's so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn't belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.<br/><br/>What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It's visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can't smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It's hard to explain but if you've seen Parasite you'll get what I am talking about.<br/><br/>Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It's absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino's: ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that's exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say. See it as soon as possible."

","Synopsis: Kim Ki-woo lives on the edge of poverty with his family. They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks?
Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards.<br/><br/>A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely.<br/><br/>The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently.
Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house.<br/><br/>Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father. During another occasion, the daughter says that she fit in well with the Parks, but ironically she is the first to die. When it comes to the father, he is the only one to continue his life in the basement, just like he was the only one, who was not afraid of the smoke. When it comes to the Indian theme, it is a foreshadowing for the fate of the Parks family.
Bong Joon-ho doesn't portray the rich as villains neither the poor as victims. The borderline between the bad and the good is opaque: we do not know for which character we should cultivate the most empathy. Deep down, they may all have the same insecurities and worldview with very slight differences...apart from the smell..., because ""they all smell the same"" according to the Parks. Is it because of the subway, or the soap they use, or the basement smell? It is just a metaphor: the smell symbolizes the poor. By the way, during birthday festivities, the father of the Parks family is killed by the father of the Kims family following his disgust towards the smell of their first housekeeper's husband.
One of the highly used symbols is the concept of ""up and down"" or ""high and low"" for class representation. Parks' house is located at the highest point of the town. The upper-class family of Parks rarely looks down on the floor. They always look forward or up, which means that their house's employees hide easily under their tables, in the ground-floor or elsewhere if/when they feel that hiding is necessary. The notion of ""parasite"" is recurrent and questions what exactly it means. Who exactly is ""parasite"": the poor or the rich. Are there any parasites? What if everybody are parasites?
One of the most important points of this film is the fact that people fight against each other. Even those, who are down, fight mercilessly for keeping their place in the Parks's house even if it means living in the basement. They lack a lot of solidarity.<br/><br/>Parks' son has an obsession with native Americans. For his birthday, the native american theme is highly used. It represents a surprise: just like the Kims discover that there is a family living rights in the basement of the Parks's house, the Europeans had discovered that there were native Americans living in the newly discovered continent. In both cases the result was the war and/or the fight. Moreover, during the festivities, Kim Ki-woo checks if the other family's father is in the basement taking the stone, which was given to him by his friend as a symbol of success, symbolizing the hope for a better future, with him. The stone is only used to smash someone's head and never brings success.
The closing scene shows Kim Ki-woo. In his letter to his father, Kim Ki-woo says that he will work until he could afford to buy the mansion and adds:""All you'll need to do is to walk up the stairs"". These expressions summarizes the myth of social mobility and supports social determinism."

The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions."

The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character.

It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people.

The film makes subtle nodes to the class differences between them which doesn't come across as preachy or in your face, which all adds up to a stunning ending. But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan.

"brodysmatthews-84808","10","21","33","13 January 2020"," Parasite (Spoiler Free)
","Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..<br/><br/>I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.<br/><br/>As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.<br/><br/>Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.<br/><br/>Grade- A+<br/><br/>Brody's TAKE 5"

","So much to unpack. incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography. Well written script. Masterful suspense, so many metaphors! the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over. I was captivated through the whole movie.<br/><br/>I thought that there might be some symbolism of North Korea/South Korea as well as social class, but I haven't seen anyone else point that out, so it could be me grasping at straws.<br/><br/>For the main family, the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began, minus the father and daughter. Ki-Woo and Chung-Sook are presumably still struggling, at the bottom of the stairs again. Everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away. Thus describes Bong Joon-Ho's ruthless realism; the poor get poorer, and life continues on with no plan to fix anything.<br/><br/>Not that that matters, it wouldn't work anyway."

","PARASITE
Directed by Bong Joon-Ho
How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner.
Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo.
The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller.
Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality."
"trelerke-politics","10","21","33","7 November 2019"," instant classic, this generation's Rules of the Game
","As Jordan Peele is to race, Bong Joon-ho is to class. He creates strange, shocking scenes and stories from the seemingly mundane. A fancy house with an underground, with an underground prisoner. This is about how human civilization is the Parasite that drives everyone absolutely crazy. There will always be those few who essentially live off everyone else, the main point though, is we all suffer, maybe there is no solution but it really is this ugly, ultimately. The pin-head wife lives in oblivious vapidness, going on about the swan formation of tables for her spoiled son's birthday. A birthday party called the day after a hellish flood, well, at least a hellish flood that drives everyone in a working class ghetto to an evacuation center. Sewage backing up, blowing out the toilet,it's like the last scenes of the movie Titanic, except far less tidy, while the rich family enjoys the rain on their mountain top mansion. But far more is happening in a very small space, the con family is trapped under the coffee table as the rich couple watches their son's little Indian idyll play on in the Teepee on the lawn in the beautiful rain. (this focus on using American Indians as the spoiled child's play, forcing the fraud family to participate or else, is a masterstroke, as the play became real, toy symbol turned into actual violence). Switching back in time, the fraud family and the underground family essentially fight to the death. Bong Joon-ho mimetically has above ground and the underground and the naive disgust the wealthy have for how the poor smell. It's a little over the top, but in a way that is Brechtian, in showing the contradictions of our materialistic existence. Major props to Bong Joon-ho, it will be a classic."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","10","21","33","25 October 2019"," A devilishly delicious and twisted tale of class dynamics
","After hearing so praise much about Bong Joon-ho's latest film when it premiered at the Cannes film festival this year, I went in not trying to know too much about it. And it definitely lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme.<br/><br/>To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them.<br/><br/>Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it. Go see it."

","This movie is not a ""masterpiece"" by any means. And all the apparent hype it's getting? Why? Is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an ""American film""? (That is, trying to be an American ""genre"" film?)<br/><br/>THE GOOD:
<ul><li>The actors are good.</li><li>Some good cinematography. Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.</li><li>The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it's like 50 minutes in, and it's too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD:
<ul><li>We've all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it's supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, ""Man, these criminals are effing morons, it's just NOT believable. You've seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.</li></ul><br/><br/>I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It's just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they're all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn't work.<br/><br/>The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family's living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a ""what if."" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??<br/><br/>Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn't even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it's too late.<br/><br/>The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.<br/><br/>Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.<br/><br/>All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry."

","In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.<br/><br/>Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".<br/><br/>As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.<br/><br/>Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care."

","Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.<br/><br/>If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!"

","One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today."
"ketgup83","8","22","35","11 January 2020"," Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps
","The Oscar fever has started and it is my favourite time of the year where I get to watch the films which is engaging, clap-worthy, entertaining and relatable.
Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it.<br/><br/>Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society.
As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house
only to get the shock of their life.<br/><br/>Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of
a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences.
The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main
drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the
old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads
to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected.<br/><br/>If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member
and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message.
There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking
up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling
and this is where Parasite scores.<br/><br/>Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction
is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding. Performances wise - I felt all the actors played their part while but if I had to pick up, my favourite would be
Kang-ho Song, who plays the role of father of the unemployed family.<br/><br/>Parasite is nail-biting and intense thriller that is going to give you goose bumps. Brilliant 4/5"
"brodysmatthews-84808","10","22","35","9 January 2020"," Parasite (Spoiler Free)
","Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..<br/><br/>I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.<br/><br/>As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.
The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining.<br/><br/>Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.<br/><br/>Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

"andrewroy-04316","10","22","35","10 November 2019"," A masterpiece that showcases an artist truly in control of his impeccable craft
","Parasite is a movie where each element has the precise intended effect. Bong can shift from hilarity to tension in an instant, and showcase surface level plot elements and deeper class themes in one clever shot. If you haven't seen Parasite yet, I implore you to stop reading this and anything else about the movie and just go watch it.<br/><br/>The class divide between the two families is at the thematic heart of Parasite. On a surface level everything the Kim family does is to earn money and live more comfortably, while the Park family is as secure as could be and are oblivious to the situation and scheme of the Kims. The twist adds to the complexity of the situation - who's the parasite in the situation and how did the Kim family and housekeeper family get to their respective situations? The ending is a devastating metaphor showing how the family is never really able to get out of the basement or buy that house. It's also an edge of your seat thriller where you're so nervous that the family is going to get caught and then that the other family is going to escape. Even the descent into violence at the end was controlled and each attack made sense. The comedy is an underrated element, as many scenes were very funny, especially the self-portrait artwork discussion which was hysterical. The acting was all excellent, and my two favorite performances were Jessica (the sister), who was so great in showcasing how she acted differently with her family and as a tutor, and Mrs. Park, who portrayed the innocent honesty of the upper class wife perfectly. The cinematography was great and reinforced the class themes, especially in the juxtaposition of how the houses are shot, with the cramped underground Kim house and the spacious green Park house, or how as they go back home in the pouring rain that they keep going down, down, down. So many things to absolutely love about this movie that I could go on about, and nothing feels incomplete or not fully satisfying. Parasite is a genuine masterpiece."

The soundtrack was gorgeous, the editing superb, the acting was so genuine and looked effortless.

"michaeldoud","10","22","35","12 October 2019"," First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.
","First Hit: I really enjoyed this story as it dives from the hilarious into the absurd.<br/><br/>We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home.<br/><br/>We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making.<br/><br/>The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam).<br/><br/>Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park.<br/><br/>When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way.<br/><br/>Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat.<br/><br/>Seeing an opportunity and because the family is wealthy and pays well, he says he may know of a young woman who is an Art Therapist that could work with the boy to become a great artist. Getting home, he tells his family about this and his sister is ready to do her part and take on a new role as Art Teacher and Therapist.<br/><br/>I'll leave the rest to your imagination, but let's just say the family all participates in this adventure.<br/><br/>But when the wealthy family takes a camping vacation, and the old housekeeper comes to collect something she left behind, the whole story starts to turn towards the macabre.<br/><br/>Parasite is a perfect name for the film, and it is not easy to pin down all the aspects this film offers the viewer. As it won the Cannes Palme d'Or for best film and I can see why.<br/><br/>Song, as the patriarch of the Kim family, was exquisite in embodying this character. Early in the film, when he announces that they need to leave the windows open when the street fumigators come down the street, I knew I was in for a ride. It was perfect for setting up his mindset. His silent looks while driving Mr. Park around after he learns that the Park's think he and his family smell, are spot on. Jo was excellent as Mrs. Park. Her expressions when buying into the stories shared Ki-woo and Ki-jung were priceless. She was the perfect foil and focal point of the Park family. Choi was terrific as the Kim family young man. His wistful story at the end of the film about finding his father was excellent. Park was sublime as the Kim family daughter turned instant Art Therapist. Her embodying the story she made up for herself was funny, engaging, and perfect. Jang, as mother to the Kim children, made me laugh. Her actions and responses during the opening scenes while the family was eating were scene-stealing. Lee Sun-kyun was outstanding as Mr. Park. His command of the family as he waltzed in from work was evident and clearly identified who was in charge of the Park family. Lee Jung-eun, as the housemaid for the Park family, was engaging. Her arriving back to collect what she left in the basement under the kitchen opened the door for the film to move to another level. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won wrote a wildly entertaining screenplay that had both funny and dark edges. Joon-ho was outstanding directing this film. Some of the shots, especially as the family tried to get back home during a major storm, told much of the story. The direct downward view of the slums in which they lived, being flooded, was telling. Just as the shots of the luxurious home where they worked were just the opposite; clean, crisp, and wonderfully shot with various angles.<br/><br/>Overall: This is a contender for Best Foreign Film and maybe even Best Picture."
"ronakkotian","10","29","48","26 January 2020"," Bong Joon-Ho is a genius!
","Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.<br/><br/>It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.<br/><br/>The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.<br/><br/>Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.<br/><br/>I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.<br/><br/>I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.<br/><br/>2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss."
"perica-43151","9","29","48","16 January 2020"," Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea
","This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.<br/><br/>Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.<br/><br/>The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."

Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)<br/><br/>Parasite? 6. (all deserved).<br/><br/>Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.<br/><br/>It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world.

It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.<br/><br/>This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once.

","It is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.<br/><br/>In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.<br/><br/>The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion.
The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.<br/><br/>Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed."

Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all.

"miaharpr","8","17","26","22 January 2020"," Do not read reviews or the synopsis. Just watch it.
","The best way to view this movie is like the movie Get Out. If you do not know what it's about, it's to your advantage. Enter with a blank mind, and watch it before everyone starts casually throwing the plot and ending around. If you're still reading this, though, I can tell you that it definitely deserves the praise it's been getting. Korean cinema has been overlooked for a while, and Hollywood is finally catching on. Korean cinema has so many great films with unique twists that Parasite gets lost in the sea of them, but compared to all the other Oscar-nominated movies this year, it's a standour-yes, because it's a foreign film, but also because it's not in your face and the same old period, war, biopic, Hollywood-loving-Hollywood movie that seem to get nominated year after year. It's more a subtle, pensive, edgy yet equally humorous and entertaining film that caters to both critics and audiences alike. The cinematography, direction and script are the crowning jewels of this film, but apart from externals, I think this movie deserves more than one view because a lot of themes has surfaced and requires a more in-depth analysis. The characters and their motivations can also be studied. It's a movie you can watch with a bag of popcorn and/or one that requires complete and undivided attention. If you're still reading this, then SPOILER ALERT for you before I write my next line:<br/><br/>I can't stop checking every nook and cranny of my house now. If you know, you know."

","Parasite is written and directed by Bong Joon Ho (Memories Of murder, The Host, Snowpiercer) and tells the story of a poor family living In Korea who take particular interest in a wealthy family as they slowly integrate themselves into there lives. Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career.<br/><br/>Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well.<br/><br/>My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top.<br/><br/>Just go support this movie if you get the chance. Especially if you are a fan of film as an art form. Beacuse this truly is a masterful put together movie that from the second it starts to the end had me transfixed."
"prenalrai","10","17","26","6 December 2019"," The best flim of the year 2019....a masterpiece
","This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece "" parasites"". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade."
"EdgarST","10","17","26","5 December 2019"," Family Affairs
","Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.<br/><br/>Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.<br/><br/>When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."
"bartubos","10","17","26","29 November 2019"," Sweet smell of poorness
","Parasite is perfect reflection of the era that we live in. I believe it is not coincidence that while we are witnessing demonstration all over the world caused by ecenomic disparities, a movie like Parasite ( also we can add Joker) is publishing. Parasite is brilliant class struggle movie.
Fim starting with a lower class family who are living in a high class family's house as parasite. After the end of the movie I started to think that both family was parasite. Rich family, who are enable to handle daily difficulties, is in need of labour class. And Kim family using their need by cheating them.
Things I like:
#Park family's wannabe, American and the Indian references
#Elevation allegory between houses of the families and the social classes
#Rainfall sequence (Masterpiece directing !!)
#Wrestle of cockroaches to keep the house and the owners of the house does not aware of what is happenning.
#Below the coffe table scene
#Production of sets
#Rising of tension until the birth day party
#Smell of poorness<br/><br/>I did Not like:
#Last 5 minutes ( I thing it was not necessery to show us what happened after the birthday party)"
"mudblood477","10","17","26","14 November 2019"," Masterful storytelling that fully utilizes the art form.
","Bong Joon-ho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best. Parasite is wickedly funny, stunningly tragic, and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim.<br/><br/>I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.<br/><br/>The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.<br/><br/>I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss. This is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place.<br/><br/>10/10 First a trickle, then a flood"
"aarosedi","Null","17","26","29 September 2019"," In any successful black comedy, GREED is GOOD.
","My rating: A-plus.
(Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)<br/><br/>
Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...<br/><br/>This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.<br/><br/>But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.<br/><br/>Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought."
"CarsonTrent","10","17","26","22 September 2019"," Very powerful social satire
","This genre transcending movie is a rare achievement in capturing the disparity in our global civilization as well as the clash of contrasting mindsets.<br/><br/>A destitute family of four gradually inserts itself in the life of an upper class home in order to profit financially. At first things seem to go their way and the movie maintains a playfully comical tone but soon they must realize just how far apart their world is from that of their mark. The gap is insurmountable. The fun is over.<br/><br/>The movie is no socialist propaganda. It's a brutally painted picture of class dynamic in society. Any human society. Be it past present or future. Things will never change because to have top people there must be bottom people. And in the underbelly of every nicely polished place an underground torrent of resentment builds up in silence in the hearts of the servants. Until a simple ill gesture of the master class makes it suddenly erupt. In this case it was the master holding his nose in disgust at the driver's damp clothes stink after he spent the last 24 hours salvaging his few belongings from his flooded home and sleeping on the floor of a refuge while currently holding his deadly wounded daughter in his arms. When all hope is lost the clash is unavoidable (valid also in the case of the other ""parasite"" family).<br/><br/>While the weak (characters) cling to naive hope to the very end, the movie remains satirical, visceral and poignant but mostly intransigent offering no solution because there can't be any. On might call the family parasites or disenchanted survivors depending on the view point."

"edsfsousa","10","42","73","23 December 2019"," Best Film of the year 👏
","It took me while to be able to sit and review this movie. It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core.
Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window.
The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT?
Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time?
For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house. I often felt watched in the movie theatre
Was I the parasite?
If this isn't the Best Film of the year, I don't know what it us.👏👏👏"

The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying.

"altereggo123","Null","207","407","30 August 2019"," Long, with inconsistent characters and no moral compass
","This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.<br/><br/>But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.<br/><br/>The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!<br/><br/>Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.<br/><br/>While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.<br/><br/>Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."

","Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.<br/><br/>Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.<br/><br/>Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.<br/><br/>You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.<br/><br/>To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.<br/><br/>It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!<br/><br/>As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!<br/><br/>Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.<br/><br/>It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.<br/><br/>It comes with a highly recommended from me.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)"

"pmkremyda","10","13","19","18 November 2019"," I've never seen a movie more deserving of a 10/10
","Edit:
After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it.
Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.<br/><br/>
I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry.
After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films.
I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder.
But there are many that I've yet to watch.
What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much.
I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line.
I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.<br/><br/>So, regarding Parasite.
If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT!
Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer.
This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was!
My spoiler-free thoughts:
This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius!
All praise to director Bong!
I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural.
When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"".
So, respect to the professionals.
This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless."

","This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness.

Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.<br/><br/>I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date.

"OPPATRIA_","10","13","19","2 November 2019"," A masterpiece
","""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture."
"garethcrook","10","32","54","14 January 2020"," Perfection.
","There's quite a bit of hype around this film already, but going in I knew nothing about it. I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year."
"philipposathina","9","24","39","11 February 2020"," Deserves every single award of it...
","I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: ""Do you know you speak Greek?"". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?"

"Pairic","9","24","39","26 January 2020"," Brilliant Dark Satire
","Parasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10."

","I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.<br/><br/>And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.<br/><br/>There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire."
"N18hthawk","10","24","39","17 January 2020"," Parasite is a very rare film ...
","Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.<br/><br/>However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.<br/><br/>Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.<br/><br/>Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout."

"kluseba","10","24","39","12 November 2019"," Food for thought delivered with exciting wit
","Parasite is the best movie of the year. This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards.<br/><br/>This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead.<br/><br/>International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again.<br/><br/>I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."

The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?<br/><br/>But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.<br/><br/>Pity.

"MOscarbradley","10","33","56","16 December 2019"," An instant classic.
","If you must make a home invasion movie do it as a comedy and not as a horror film, right? Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" arrives already festooned with awards and rightly so. In this gem a family of low-life con-artists manage to take over the home and lives of a softer and much richer family that in some ways mirror them. It's like ""Us"" but without the supernatural element. Of course, a scheme like theirs can't succeed without something going very wrong which, of course, it does turning ""Parasite"" beautifully and brilliantly into the blackest of comedy-thrillers that does finally manage to erupt into just the kind of horror flic we expected from the start.<br/><br/>With pitch-perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year, not to mention the kind of home any family would be happy to invade, this is an instant classic.

","Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.<br/><br/>It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).<br/><br/>I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.<br/><br/>However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.<br/><br/>I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.<br/><br/>EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat."

This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.<br/><br/>My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.<br/><br/>I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers.

"lmcerrado","10","18","28","24 January 2020"," Parasite will leech into your heart.
","An instant classic! It's a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch. Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family, but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble. Somehow, these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the ""top"". The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal, and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film. Dialogue is very engaging and riveting, it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all. The story is well executed and well paced, there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes. The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film's atmosphere of tension and ease. The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night. Overall, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life."

","Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring.

It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape."
"ShanTeaTime","9","18","28","23 January 2020"," Class Struggle and Deception The Visual Representation.
","Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.<br/><br/>This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!<br/><br/>I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!<br/><br/>This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it."

","For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love."

","With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all."

I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.<br/><br/>Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.<br/><br/>Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews."

"TheCountVictor","10","18","28","2 December 2019"," Funny, messed up, depressing, scary. All of these things describe Parasite.
","I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.<br/><br/>
I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.<br/><br/>
Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better."

","This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."

"bijanadhikari","10","18","28","18 September 2019"," A film that manages to interrogate the choices every class makes while delivering a roller coaster of emotions for the audience
","I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.<br/><br/>Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.<br/><br/>There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.<br/><br/>Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while."

","A MUST SEE for every cinephile. I finally understood why critics and audiences had been raving about this film. Bong Joon Ho's direction, storyline, cinematography, performances, and use of symbolism utterly blew my mind. My eyes were fixated on the screen and I was sitting on the edge of my seat in suspense for more than half the movie; the suspense was really engaging and enthralling. The touching and melancholy ending, the jaw-dropping scenes that startled, shocked, and surprised me and the effective use of symbolism (such as the scholar's rock and the peach) are some of the attributes that classify Parasite as a truly essential movie.

"kaneeddy","9","25","41","3 February 2020"," Parasite is an excellent showcase of fantastic writing
","Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.<br/><br/>On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.<br/><br/>Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise."
"Prashast_Singh","10","25","41","1 February 2020"," Unexpectedly shocking, unforgettable and of course, highly entertaining.
","Song Kang-ho is one of my favorite South Korean actors and I've seen many of his films. However, I hadn't seen a Korean film since a long time, and once I heard all the good things about Parasite and the amount of acclaim it has earned, I couldn't stop myself from watching it. And whoever said it slowly transforms into something unexpected, wasn't kidding at all! Parasite started as a drama with shades of dark humor, before morphing into an edge of the seat thriller that keeps you captivated and shocks you to the extent that you can't even move. It's that spellbinding.<br/><br/>The film can't be easily put into one genre, and that's true. Still, whether you like black comedies/dramas/thrillers or not, you must see this film at least once. It's just that you need to prepare yourself to be shocked because once the surprises start coming, you can't forget any of that for a long time. Parasite runs a little more than 2 hours but is so captivating that it might feel like the shortest 2 hours of all time.<br/><br/>Words won't be sufficient to further describe this film's actual brilliance. I'm still spellbound. What started like a fun movie became something so surprising that it was hard to forget after it ended. It took away the very feel of watching a film. Whatever I saw just felt real, absolutely real. No doubt, Parasite is one of the most original films you'll see in the recent memory, and surprisingly has elements of almost every genre covered in its entire duration. Let's hope it wins big at the Oscars too!"

"JustaReplicant","10","25","41","12 November 2019"," Parasite, a spoiler filled discussion
","Parasite
Hollywood Theater
11/11/19<br/><br/>I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.<br/><br/>My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.<br/><br/>That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.<br/><br/>A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.<br/><br/>The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times."

","This movie without a doubt is the best movie I've seen in years. 2019 has been a slow year for movies, and the 2010s in general - jam packed with superhero movies that are all the same and hundreds of sequels. But this movie is quite the gem.<br/><br/>It blends comedy, suspense, family, and a little romance in a beautiful way into a brutal commentary of class and society. I'd love to say more but it's better going into it knowing nothing about it so I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Go see this movie."

","I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10"
"view_and_review","8","19","30","22 January 2020"," Bong's Brilliance
","When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.<br/><br/>What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.<br/><br/>How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.<br/><br/>Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."

","Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film.

"sheldonnylander","10","19","30","19 October 2019"," Polished and Masterful
","The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.<br/><br/>This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.<br/><br/>However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!<br/><br/>Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.<br/><br/>This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!"

His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words.

"drqshadow-reviews","9","14","21","29 January 2020"," As Stakes Rapidly Rise, a Clever Family of Con Artists Slips Underwater
","A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naive, white collar household.<br/><br/>Unpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.<br/><br/>The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
"marcelosichonany","9","14","21","25 January 2020"," Masterpiece
","Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.<br/><br/>Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.<br/><br/>The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar.
The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).<br/><br/>Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.<br/><br/>The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo.
Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film.
Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.<br/><br/>Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.<br/><br/>Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content."

"jon.h.ochiai","10","14","21","3 January 2020"," ""Parasite"" Crosses the Line
","In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.<br/><br/>Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.<br/><br/>Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.<br/><br/>Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.<br/><br/>Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. NaÃ¯ve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.<br/><br/>Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.<br/><br/>In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.<br/><br/>Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in ""Parasite"". His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Parasite"" is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. ""Parasite"" might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.<br/><br/>All that being said: ""Parasite"" is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, ""Parasite"" fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying."

This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible.
Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You.

"RforFilm","10","14","21","14 November 2019"," Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""
","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.<br/><br/>In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful.<br/><br/>We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars.<br/><br/>After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something.<br/><br/>Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019. It may sound like a typical dark comedy, but because the character development focuses on all four members of the family, it allowed the story to go in a variety of directions that I didn't expect. At the front, this is still a story on class difference. A lot of these movies will revolve around the theme of ""helping the poor"". Thankfully, Parasite is a smarter movie and tries something different.<br/><br/>Parasite doesn't try to make the wealthy family out to be villains. But they don't try to paint the main family in a complete positive light either. These are all grey characters that are simply living life and the lengths their going to climb up. This could mean conning themselves into good jobs or getting a party together for a child. If anything, it tries to lean into how stabbing others in the back to get what they want is bad, but even that can depend on a number of factors. This movie is the prime example of ""would you steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family"".<br/><br/>Not only is the movie written and directed beautifully, but it's acted amazingly. Though the movie is in Korean, you can tell the actors are still giving it their all as they each understand the complexities of their situation and why each one would make the decisions they make. This also remains one of the better ensemble pieces I've seen this year, hence why I'm not naming them one by one. I noticed this as well in Snowpiercer with how Bong Joon-ho knows how to cast as a whole and work with what he has.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten fancy houses out of ten. It may be in a different language, but this is already one of my favorite movies of the year. This is the kind of movie that can be hard to describe, but my best bet is to simply tell others to see it. I feel like that even talking about it a little could ruin it. Check it out and see just how complicated class difference really is."

","I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better.
The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world."

","I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.<br/><br/>Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.<br/><br/>The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything.<br/><br/>This film is simply a must watch!!

"joachimokeefe","9","10","14","10 February 2020"," An epic dark comedy. Really funny, really dark, 90% epic
","Two nuclear families - Mum, Dad, son, daughter; one filthy rich, one filthy poor. The first hour is about how the poor, conniving Kims take advantage of the rich, naive Parks in an old-school way that's like one of those classic Ealing comedies like 'The Ladykillers'. You have to admire their cunning - and luck, and the satirisation of both families' self-seeking ways is hilarious.<br/><br/>After the first hour (there are two), of course, it all starts to go wrong in the way that classic Ealing caper movies used to do, except with severe - though not over-explicit - violence. And to an extent, so does the movie, which becomes a wild, morbid farce complete with plum extract, secret bunkers and barbeque bloodbaths. You start to feel a little claustrophobic about the fact that it all happens within the swanky architect-designed show house. Apart, that is, from the sewage floods in the Kims' squalid semi-basement.<br/><br/>'Parasite' does have a solid story arc, sharp social observation, and mostly engaging characters though, and the poignant ending brings it to a satisfying close. It's quite old-school, but with an up-to-date take. Imagine a later Steve Martin comedy with cutting social observation.

","What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.<br/><br/>It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.<br/><br/>This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.<br/><br/>Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world."
"tyelder","10","10","14","7 February 2020"," An Original Work of Art
","Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.
This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great.
Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies.
Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven.
Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall.
Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles.

","Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.<br/><br/>All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.<br/><br/>Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.<br/><br/>It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.<br/><br/>Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing."

","Parasite tells the story of a poor family in South Korea. Kim Ki-taek(Kang-ho Song), his wife Kim Chung-sook(Hye-jin Jang), son Kim Ki-woo(Woo-sik Choi) & daughter Kim Ki-jung(So-dam Park), start working for the super rich Park family. Soon, things start getting complicated.<br/><br/>Parasite is a jaw-dropping film. Director Bong Joon Ho has given us another unforgettable movie, after The Host(2006), Snowpiercer(2013) & Okja(2017). Parasite has so many levels & nuances to it. This film, makes you experience a whirlwind of emotions. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll be shocked, you'll be teary-eyed & you will be left ruminating about the movie, long after the credits roll. The performances are mind-blowing. Kang-ho Song is spectacular as Kim Ki-taek. Sun-kyun Lee is brilliant as Park Dong-ik. Yeo-jeong Jo is amazing as Park Yeon-kyo. Woo-sik Choi is outstanding as Kim Ki-woo. So-dam Park is fantastic as Kim Ki-jung. Jeong-eun Lee is excellent as Moon-gwang. Hye-jin Jang is awesome as Kim Chung-sook. Ji-so Jung is great as Park Da-hye. Myeong-hoon Park is superb as Geun-se. The supporting cast is memorable. Parasite is a must watch. It deserves all the awards it has received so far & deserves its six Oscar nominations. Definitely one of the best films of the year, whether it's English, Korean or any other language!"
"thenolanfan","8","10","14","3 February 2020"," Fascinating
","I really enjoyed this film, because Bong Joon-Ho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place. The best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script. In addition, this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks, it does this very effectively by mixing Thriller and Comedy."
"MrPupkin","10","10","14","3 February 2020"," It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.
","It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time."
"soulexpress","10","10","14","3 February 2020"," Just saw it for the second time.
","PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again. Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.<br/><br/>What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.<br/><br/>This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.<br/><br/>If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner. Still, it's a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film."

It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres.

"js-66130","9","10","14","2 February 2020"," CROSSING THE LINE
","Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.<br/><br/>Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.<br/><br/>Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.<br/><br/>Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?<br/><br/>Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.<br/><br/><ul><li>hipCRANK</li></ul>"

But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project."

It shines a very narrow light on poverty but it is all conveyed in a very surreal scenario which makes it quite difficult to emotionally engage with the situations that transpire. However, that's not the only reason.<br/><br/>The main characters are not particularly likeable, which I'm sure defenders of the film would describe them as morally grey, given the prevailing cultural obsession with the moral ambiguity.<br/><br/>It's this morally ambiguous narrative that intends to blur the line of what is good and bad. Nevertheless, this blurring as well as the general surrealness didn't compel me to emotionally engage with the film's story as much as I would've liked. As a result, I found that it really lacks something. It feels like it has rattled out of someone's head, unedited."

There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film.

However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.<br/><br/>A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb.

Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved ""Snowpiercer"" but this is total crap."

","If a film makes you think continuously even after the show ends, it must be a great one! And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece!<br/><br/>It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time!<br/><br/>It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in.<br/><br/>But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience.<br/><br/>My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally.
Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately. It's amazing and a surreal experience that could not be forgotten easily. Top of the table recommendation."

"dom-lerose-8","Null","20","32","1 December 2019"," Unlike Anything You've Ever Seen
","The winner of the prestigious Palme D'or back in May at the Cannes Film Festival, South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho has crafted the most original and entertaining film of 2019 in ""Parasite,"" a film layered in style and creativity.<br/><br/>Set in South Korea, ""Parasite"" follows the unemployed Kim family of four living in dire poverty in the metropolitan slums who collaboratively take an interest in the extremely wealthy Park family and one by one infiltarte their house through a master plan of schemes and lies to be employed by them. The patriarch, Kim ki-Taek, strives to become the Parks' personal chauffeur, the matrich, Moon-gwang, pursues a position as the family's maid, while their son and daughter Kim Ki-woo and Kim Ki-jung become tutors for the family's son and daughter.<br/><br/>Each family member goes to extreme lengths to pull off their deceptive lies in order to maintain their positions, a testament to the desperate measures impoverished people are willing to go in order to get by these days. Joon Ho manages to examine the increasing inequalities between the rich and poor without ramming a political social statement down our throats. Instead, the filmmakers subtly exemplifies how both wealthy and poor people are shaped by a competitive global capitalist economy, never taking a side on which family is more of a moral embodiment.<br/><br/>Joon Ho expresses how people of both wealth and poverty leach off each other like parasites, the Kim family leaching off of their wealthy employers the Parks, while the Parks leach off of them for their labor. Joon Ho reveals how we as human beings use each other for personal gain and how such a relationship is embodied in our society. The fashion he used to express such a phenomenon is one of pure cinematic magic, a rich story that hits you like an ocean wave and takes twists and turns like you can't imagine.<br/><br/>'Parasite"" plays out as a darkly comedic satire, it's dark comedy sharp and poignant, yet eventually takes a direction that no one will be able to see coming. Joon Ho's ingenious script and artistic cinematic direction lead us into a film that is simply unlike anything in the history of cinema. This is a film that is able to make us laugh one minute and then have our hearts beating out of our chests the next due to the gripping and riveting intensity on screen.<br/><br/>What gives the film a test for the audience is how we genuinely want the Kims tos succeed with their plan despite their vicious lies and desperation. Each actor delivers a humorous yet mesmerizing performance that captures the emotions and frustrations of not only poverty, but of determination and blind ambition.<br/><br/>Director Bong Joon Ho proves he's one of the world's very best filmmakers with not only his brilliant story, but the way he's able to manipulate the audience from start to finish and craft a film with sharp imagery that illuminates the eyes. He creates an individualistic film style built upon pitch-perfect editing, gorgeous opera music that captures the film's mood, shocking twists and gripping conflict.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" will surely be a major contender for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards and is one of the most memorable foreign films of the 21st century. This is the kind of film that shows you what movies can do and one that makes you fall in love with cinema again."

"sansay","10","32","55","10 November 2019"," Kim family vs Park family, and then...
","At the beginning of this movie we watch the Kim family struggle to survive in our modern and advanced society. Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review.<br/><br/>The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other.
Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done.<br/><br/>As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts.<br/><br/>This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own? Note how the Kim family is actually pretty smart and resourceful. And yet, they are poor. Yeah s. it happens, and more often than not, just because of the way our society works, or rather, doesn't."

This masterpiece is also technically brilliant. Cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong is damm good for a gripping thriller. And the BGM, it's not like the natural thriller, but the violin and the piano playing is perfect with the situation. And of course the outstanding performance by the ensemble cast.
At last the film speaks about the differences between the higher class and the lower class people and also says ""You know What kind of plan never fails?? No plan at all ""."

The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem.

","When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect.

"theredsky","10","15","23","30 October 2019"," Parasite Review
","Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."

","There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own."

","Parasite (2019)<br/><br/>10/10 ðŸ’¸<br/><br/>""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""<br/><br/>The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.<br/><br/>Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing."

"TheVictoriousV","10","16","25","6 December 2019"," One of the decade's most clever and original
","South Korean film crews may be World Cinema's most painstakingly dedicated; the movies are detailed, powerfully acted, and creatively daring in ways that would be impermissible under Western studio supervision. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also provide some of our time's most refreshingly, impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process.<br/><br/>We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent.<br/><br/>Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook.<br/><br/>The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are.<br/><br/>The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the persona they assume when posing as the Park family's home employees.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each actor's performance all the more considerable. And yes, it seems a bit unlikely that the Parks would fall for the scam and refrain from asking questions when each new employee of theirs happens to know someone suited for a very recently vacated position, but the film is self-aware and deliberate about this, not only because the Parks - in their carefree luxury - aren't the most observant.<br/><br/>This is all comical to experience, yes, but what Bong has to say about class inequity and - during the films bleaker, later scenes - how it isn't necessarily so simple as letting the poor ""have some luxury"" for the sake of fairness, is what makes Parasite stick. We may understand the downtrodden Kims (we learn from a revelation that their desperation is not unique), and laugh at their conniving schemes, but are they truly Sherwoodian heroes in the end?<br/><br/>Parasite is generally well-loved, but divisive in the circles you'd expect. My guilty-pleasure film critic Armond White is certain that the film scoffs at nuclear families (also calling it a ""cancel-culture comedy"" because, I guess, anti-family sentiments are common amongst those who also like to ""cancel"" offensive celebrities and, indeed, berate classism). So far as I can decipher, White's main evidence is the fact that, in the story, a traditional and successful family suffers comically at the hands of the semi-titular social parasites - who he likens to entitled, modern Communists and AntiFa terrorists.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the Kims aren't strictly heroes or justified. Isn't this a bit like saying Midsommar seeks to paint Swedish tradition as perverse because it has characters (read: villains) who co-opt our customs perversely? But then, psh, who'd reason like that?"

","Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre."

","The movie 'parasite' was harrowing. Greed and envy - thats what it is about. Lying, cheating family traits, inflicting these lies on a kind family who employs them.

Through further subterfuge, his sister, father and mother all end up working for the family. Unbeknownst to them, the family of lying 'good for nothings' have not only ruined the income prospects of former employees, they go stir crazy and it leads to double murder and countless horrible outcomes not shown.<br/><br/>Were they punished enough for the horrible things they did to that kind family who employed them? I believe the filmmaker tried to partly justify their actions based on the inequality of the social divide between one family to the next. If enterprise and cunning got this family into employment, why were these skills not used for employment from lawful means?
The story is skillfully told but it is still a horrible story. There was little justice in the end, so it does make you regret watching it."

","Only mild spoilers.<br/><br/>If you are looking for film that skillfully evokes a myriad of emotions from the audience - you've landed-on it! The Koreans have always been great at combining tones/genre's. Parasite Is a deftly handled film about social classes, income disparity(in particular, the psychological impact of it) and karma.<br/><br/>Song Kang-Ho gives the standout performance as the father of a poor family who seems perfectly willing to break through any ethical walls to climb their way out of the slums.<br/><br/>The meat of the storyline comes when the fathers' son infiltrates a wealthy household as an English tutor. Does the event spark an opportunity for financial freedom or horror for the entire family?<br/><br/>This is both a visually and intelligently spectacular vision, played out to near perfection. There is some great symbolism throughout the film - the highs of high society, and the drowning abyss of the lower class. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.<br/><br/>The film is also as funny as it is thrilling. Hopefully American audiences can take all of the comedy-in as some can literally be lost in translation and dryness.<br/><br/>The films' not perfect. I think the poor fathers emotional state could have been fortified a bit with a longer opening set-up; if for no other reason but to drive home the income disparity impact in Korea. Americans may not fully understand the dangers of income disparity and the ""monopolization and manipulation of capitalism(a good system but not necessarily a foolproof one), but perhaps watching this will help. That aspect of the ending is a slightly under-developed, or just perhaps under-appreciated according to your demographic, though the ending as a whole is still well-fashioned and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>I've only seen a few of the Best Picture nominees(Fordv8, 19178, Once Upon a Time7.5-8, and Irishman7) , but this is clearly my personal favorite. It wont win. IMO, The Oscars gifted ""The Artist"" the ""foreign acknowledgement Best Picture"" a few years back, so it may be awhile before we see another one. Not that there haven't been many that should have one or at least been nominated. On direction, writing, acting, cinematography, and pure enjoyment - this film checks every box for me.<br/><br/>You might like this if you liked: The Host(7), 3-Iron(7.5-8), Nightcrawler(8), Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance(8)"

","Review:
'Parasite' is a black comedy-thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho.
I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different.
The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.
The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around.
The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin.
Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film.

","This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so.
Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival."

","My Review- Parasite
My Rating 9/10<br/><br/>I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.<br/><br/>Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.<br/><br/>The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""<br/><br/>I read Director and script writer Bong Joon
is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home.
I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon.
It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on.
Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.<br/><br/>Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year .
I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro AlmodÃ³var's Pain & Glory..<br/><br/>Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.<br/><br/>After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more.
There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment.
I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .<br/><br/>This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing ""Emma"" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series ""Succession ""portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup.
The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth.
The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.<br/><br/>2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .<br/><br/>Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.<br/><br/>Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.<br/><br/>Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.<br/><br/>Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-<br/><br/>parasite<br/><br/>Learn to pronounce

"AngelaJabla","9","11","16","31 January 2020"," Class Division and Lack of Empathy - Is It Innate?
","Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans."

Multiple times in the film, We are shown scenes of the humiliation, abuse and the depravity of the poor family, the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away.

","Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists.
Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away.
Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals.
But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it.

"howard.schumann","7","11","16","15 October 2019"," Lacks any realistic human dimension
","South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.<br/><br/>The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.<br/><br/>Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.<br/><br/>Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."

"LogicIsEverything","Null","255","531","5 September 2019"," Extremely absurd without basic logic
","Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!<br/><br/>There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.<br/><br/>At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.<br/><br/>The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.<br/><br/>The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.<br/><br/>In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.<br/><br/>The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.<br/><br/>I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.<br/><br/>I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket."

The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea.<br/><br/>It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality."

"Otkon","6","5","6","12 April 2020"," Were the blueprints to the house never filed with the local planning commission?
","See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn't a masterpiece in any regard.<br/><br/>The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.<br/><br/>So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.<br/><br/>And the ""wealth rock"" symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.<br/><br/>And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it's one dead, two on probation and one ""scot-free"" after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets ""lesson learned (maybe)"". And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.<br/><br/>I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.<br/><br/>I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child's birthday party to get a couple of them to say, ""aw shucks, maybe this wasn't a great plan"". And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. ""The whole notion of ""why bother"" makes no sense or point thematically in art."

","In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;<br/><br/>""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...<br/><br/>Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.<br/><br/>I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.<br/><br/>Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.<br/><br/>To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;<br/><br/>Best picture:

","For reviewers, universally-acclaimed and awards-sweeping movies call for immediate viewings and reactions, whether along the enthusiastic stream, or the other way (the eagerness to express a dislike being even greater). With Boon Jong Ho's ""Parasite"", I wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it.<br/><br/>But I was puzzled by that bloody climax. The last South Korean masterpiece I saw was ""Old Boy"" and if I was riveted by the story, the violence disturbed me no matter how relevant to the plot it was. Now, I didn't expect that film that started like a fun comedy of errors leaning toward screwball to generate such a hyperbolic outburst of violence. It wasn't even black comedy but straight out drama. I wasn't sure I liked it, but I wasn't sure I hated it either. I guess I had to sleep on it and figure out what Boon Jong Ho was telling us. So, here's my personal take, and apologies if I don't mention the actors' names, with the exception of the father played by Song Kang Ho.<br/><br/>First of all, this is not a spoiler-free review, which allows me to get right to the point.<br/><br/>Having digested the film now, I realized that Boon Jong Ho didn't make a comedy at all, which makes senses. I don't think the film would have won the Golden Palm or the Best Picture or all these awards if it was a cute comedy of a family of con-artists. Of course, the film Is encrusted with many humorous bits but so was Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"", a film less celebrated for its humor than its sharp blow against white liberals. Retrospectively, I find it obvious that the director and screenwriter was preparing us to a fatal clash between the classes, but I didn't expect it the catalyst, and film's leitmotif, to be something as trivial as ""smell"". You read me.<br/><br/>There are three key scenes in my opinion that build up to the final rage that will lead the father to kill his boss, despite the total absence of enmity between them.<br/><br/>1/ ""They have the same smell"": we've come to the comical momentum where every member of the ""poor"" family got a job in the rich property. They're all fitting in the family, appreciated for their work and yet it's the little kid who smells something 'fishy' in the way that they all smell the same. Bong Joon Ho doesn't treat it as the hint that there's something fishy about them (which a lesser director would do) but that they live in the same ramshackle house with all the street and fried onions stink sticking to their clothes. They smell because they smell like poor people. The smell symbolically blows their cover.<br/><br/>2/ The hidden-under-the-table scene: what could have been used as a slapstick moment gives more depth to two key characters: the fathers. Laying on the sofa, snuggling with his wife and watching his son outside in the teepee, the rich father compliments his driver's work but laments about his terrible smell. Notice that the comment is paralleled with another one about him knowing how to stay in his place. Also notice the father's reaction, he realizes that he's not just a man or a valuable employee, he's got the smell in the package of appreciation. Notice that the comment is said in secrecy during an intimate moment because in real-life, we never tell anyone about his smell, only a child can be that careless. But the father's comment resonated like an indisputable verdict, one that reduced the father (and automatically his family) to their poor and stinky background, like the untouchables in India. Speaking of India, the scene is followed by a huge flood in the lowers streets... that feature the third key scene.<br/><br/>3/ One last cigarette: while everyone is trying to save whatever valuable hasn't been taken by the waters, the daughter rushes to the toilet where huge sewage cascades are propelled from the bowl, spilling all over her body. Without minding the foulness, she just sits down and savors one last cigarette. We realize how familiar to the low depths these people are, that smelling anything is barely an issue. They don't like it, they just don't have the luxury of caring, but from the rich ones' perspectives, people who don't mind the stink, stink physically, and then symbolically.<br/><br/>So, no matter how friendly the relationships are, they clash each other on that iron curtain made of streets, sewage, gasoil or cooking fragrances and bourgeois hypocrisy. Which all naturally leads up to that moment where having just seen his daughter stabbed to death, the father must give the car keys to his boss to take his boy to emergency. The keys lay under a dead man's body and the rich father is repulsed by his smell; one time too many. The poor father who should be angry toward that man who took his daughter's life, directs instead his anger toward his boss, tracing an ironic line of solidarity with the killer... because he knew the hardship he went through inthat bunker and the respect he showed to the house master only to be reduced to a smell, him too.<br/><br/>If there's one movie that shows in powerful symbolism the battle of classes, it's ""Parasite"" and the mood whiplash at the final act was like the detonation of a talent. Boon Jong Ho proves that Asian cinema is one to rely on, an Art that tells inventive stories and make them insightful and relevant and entertaining. It also reminded me of my criticism of former Asian Golden Palm winner ""The Eel"", where I wished the film left the bloody scene as a climactic flashback. Blood is a big narrative expense and should be left to the right moment to implode its meaningful or cathartic power.<br/><br/>I was puzzled first but once I got that leitmotif, I could see the genius."

","Parasite (2019)<br/><br/>With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking.
I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension.
The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting.
That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place!
Enjoy it!"

"mrcoletti","6","23","39","3 October 2019"," Bong Joon-Ho's most uninspired film to date.
","Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.<br/><br/>I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.<br/><br/>Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.<br/><br/>Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise."

Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be  ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get.

The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture!

"SnobReviews","10","13","20","4 December 2019"," ""Parasite"" is a masterful film.
","""Parasite"" is a powerful and perfect film that will leave you in awe with its twisted, funny and tension-filled scenes. Writer/director Bong Joon-ho's approach to social classes creeps up on you like suspense in a Hitchcock film.
.
In this dramatic thriller with elements of dark comedy, an unemployed family schemes their way into working for a much wealthier family by posing as highly-qualified individuals.
.
Where to begin on how great of a film ""Parasite"" is? Never has there been a film of this genre to exceed so much and so perfectly. All the performances are incredible, the direction is Joon-ho's finest and most masterful and the story is beyond relevant to all of us. You never know where ""Parasite"" will lead you but when it gets there, it shocks you or it makes you laugh or even both. This film ranks among the best of the decade and definitely one of the best of the year. An absolute must-see."
"RussHog","10","13","20","17 November 2019"," Great Movie
","I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade."
"hmingtei","10","13","20","14 November 2019"," Amazing movie
","One of the best movies I have ever watched in years. The life of the rich and the poor yet never felt cliché, not even once. Very unpredictable and the anxiety you get from watching the movie is thrilling yet you don't know which character to root for because they have their own stories. So please watch it,, you won't regret it."
"prazz27","10","13","20","21 October 2019"," Who is the Real Parasite?
","A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.<br/><br/>Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.<br/><br/>The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.<br/><br/>The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.<br/><br/>While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?<br/><br/>Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves."

","As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."

The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?<br/><br/>It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film."

","The west favors the films that look western in its aesthetics and treatment. This film is the example. A commercial, illogical potboiler with not one original character. This film can be compared to a number of Hollywood, European cinema. Everything is stupid and illogical. An entire family cons another entire family into entering their home as servants in various capacity. Top it with a secret bunker in the basement where the previous servant has kept her husband to save him from debtors?! And the owners of the house, a family of 4, has no clue about any of it, despite all these happening right under their noses for years? Sounds stupid and illogical and nonsensical. Sounds like a Hollywood B comedy movie starring Queen Latheefa, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrel and other SNL cast members."

"powermandan","10","15","24","14 November 2019"," The Best Film in Years.
","Maybe it's just me, but I have known a decline in film quality since 2017. 2016 was a very good year for film--the last great year altogether. Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on.<br/><br/>The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains.<br/><br/>'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great.<br/><br/>it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom.<br/><br/>'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable.<br/><br/>The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine. Even when a movie is unpredictable, the payoffs are plausible and the viewer is able to tie things together easily. But with this, each time a twist comes (which is frequent) the viewer is still left flabbergasted and completely caught off guard. The director really pulls out the rug from underneath.<br/><br/>Watching this movie was such a breath of fresh air and director, Bong Joon-Ho could easily have messed up at any moment. But there is not one second of wasted or subpar material. In fact, it it just the opposite: the movie keeps building and just gets better by the minute. The thrills get stronger and stronger as the twists get smarter and more intricate. With all that happens 'Parasite' becomes an imservie film experience that you will never forget.<br/><br/>4/4"

"bastille-852-731547","10","17","28","20 October 2019"," Staggeringly original Korean social satire; one of the best of the decade
","I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.<br/><br/>I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.<br/><br/>One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10."

"helenbassett","10","9","13","22 February 2020"," Parasite Film Review - Bong Joon Ho Directs An Oscar Winner That Trump Dismisses
","Parasite won Best Film and Best Director for Bong Joon Ho at the Oscars this month, also winning International Feature Film and Original Screenplay. Neon the distributors suggested that Donald Trump, (leader of the free world) unsurprisingly didn't like it as he cannot read. Harsh. My only gripe with subtitles is I cannot always watch the screen action as I don't want to miss the words. You get used to them of course but like Pedro Almodovar's Pain And Glory I missed some of the beautiful designs. Caught that on demand prior to the Oscars as it wasn't available anywhere locally. But missing out on world cinema and tv because of subtitles is very sad.<br/><br/>To be honest Paradise is a horrible film. With horrible characters living a horrible life. A black comedy, horror tragedy that reeks of the class divide between a successful South Korean family and their poor contemporaries. And the living conditions are startling, with the poor living in a basement with a window on a street that is regularly urinated in. Just in front of them. And piggy-backing off their upstairs neighbours internet connection. We take pleasure in laughing at their hovel while our wealthy family live in the most architecturally perfect modern home we all would imagine living in. Bravo to the Production designer Lee Ha-jun for realising this on a sound stage.<br/><br/>So while our wealthy Park family smell of money, the poor Kim family smell of whatever you can imagine poverty and that bug infested basement smells of, and it isn't nice. Old radish our rich husband played by Sun-kyun Lee suggests. But things are finally looking up for the loving Kim family. Not with the pizza boxes they construct for minimum wage though. Instead son Ki-woo played by Woo-sik Choi is recommenced for a tutoring job with the wealthy Park family. His rich friend who currently tutors the young daughter wants to romance her when she goes to college. We can see where that might go.<br/><br/>And for Ki-woo the Park family live in another world, as he climbs out of the basement. Mrs Park played by the lovely Yeo-jeong Jo goes about her day supported by terrific housekeeper Moon-gwang. To be honest Lee Jeong-eun keeps the house running as Mrs Park is a little on the ditzy side, but in awe of her young son's 'artistic' talents. He needs an art tutor for sure, and once saw a ghost she confides, although his sister sees right through him. But what are the chances that Mi-Woo knows of an art tutor, very in demand and just returned from Chicago I think. So So-dam Park's Ki-jeong also climbs out of the basement and spins the gullible Mrs Park a line of Google babble that wins her the job. Mrs Park even spins herself the lines as she accepts Ki-jeongs. Although the Park family are really lovely. But as these two chancers have managed to begin feathering their nest, they are actually good at what they are doing. And with the right opportunity both wasters could have aspired to the same roles, without the deception.<br/><br/>But deception is what they do and Ki-jeong sees an opportunity for her Dad played by Kang-ho Song, to be the new driver to Mr Park. Her actions in getting him the role left a bad taste in my mouth. Getting her art tutor job didn't hurt anyone. But after a wash and brush up Mr Kim can actually drive, cornering without spilling a coffee in the hand of Mr Park. And now our three hustlers spy even more opportunity for Mum to get in on the action when Moon-gwang's peach allergy is discovered, and Mrs Kim's Hye-jin Jang is recruited as the new housekeeper. All the Park's money for staff now goes directly into the Kim's pockets.<br/><br/>But with all the family out of the basement their smell has followed them. Something that the Park's son notices. All are perfectly capable of doing their jobs but with their bad odour they pollute the beautiful home. Where do they go from here then? How do they grab this beautiful life for themselves? Well one dark and stormy night the poor cross the line. The veneer of respectability can disappear in an instant and ghosts can materialise from basements long gone.<br/><br/>But all actions have consequences as Bong Joon Ho directs the poor fighting over scraps from the table of the rich, when they could have shared instead. But why should they share the scraps we ask? If his first film was called Barking Dogs Never Bite, Parasite will show us that with enough antagonism they will. But I don't blame the Park family who gave employment to the poor to facilitate their comfortable lives. They are incapable without them. Each class living off the other.<br/><br/>And there is no answer of course to the film's questions, only the international language of morse code desperation to decipher, and never be able to respond to."

The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.<br/><br/>With a finely crafted script, honest emotion, and some beautifully positioned shots, this film is unforgiving and left me completely emptied and speechless in what was one of the most affecting movies I have seen.

One hell of a climax and the thought, the question that follows 'why the ending was like this'?

","First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this."
"kjproulx","10","18","30","28 October 2019"," A Masterpiece in Filmmaking
","Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.<br/><br/>To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.<br/><br/>The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.<br/><br/>Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.<br/><br/>It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture. This is as close to a masterpiece you can get today."
"uwalvin","10","19","32","9 January 2020"," 132 minutes of perfectly measured film
","Like a five star dish, every minute of this film is superb, respecting the time it asks of you, the viewer, as it takes you through a roller coaster of highs and lows. It is not overly dramatic nor does deplete you emotionally, which is my typical fear with Korean dramas and thrillers. I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.<br/><br/>Avoid spoilers at all costs and dive in at the marvel of the story it can tell within two hours, as Hollywood struggles with two part films and making coherence out of overly packed blockbusters like Star Wars.<br/><br/>Perhaps a permanent entry into the Top 250 films of all time."

This is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like Fargo or even breaking bad, it has a similar aura to it.<br/><br/>I literally don't have any major critic for the film but if I have to nitpick, I wish the death of Kim's son was real. Because when it was implied at the beginning that he's dead, but the later on revealed that he survived, takes away the horror of that scene.<br/><br/>Overall, It's dark, funny, horror and sometimes feels like it's real, what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just don't know it, how many mask they wear."
"slaithier","10","20","34","12 August 2019"," Both comedy and tragedy, a fierce social satire
","This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones.
Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience."
"Fiahm","7","23","40","1 December 2019"," Crime & Class
","An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder.<br/><br/>_________<br/><br/>Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.<br/><br/>But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.<br/><br/>Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look."

"pablobiedma","6","6","8","24 March 2020"," Good (for pseudo intellectuals)
","First of all I want to say that this is not a bad movie and I'll talk about the good things later. I want to start with the bad ones because there are already apparently thousands of reviews talking about how good the film is.<br/><br/>I also want the reader to realize that for a foreign movie, Parasite is extremely comercial, and easy to watch. This of course is not bad but it's important to mention.<br/><br/>In fact, in certain tones and aspects during this film, it could remind the viewer of a Quentin Tarantino movie, in particular during the Ending. Satiric ending full of violence. Speaking of this part of the movie, I believe that certain scenes were not needed at all. For example when ""The rich guy"" aka Mr Park tries not to smell the dead body while getting the keys.<br/><br/>It was back in 1960 when Billy Wilder (arguably the best film director and screenwriter of all time) became the first person to win Academy Awards as producer, director, and screenwriter for the same film. It was for the movie ""The Apartment"" starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine. This movie is a masterpiece. And since then not many other directors have achieved the same thing. In the 2020 Oscars Bong Joon-ho joined Wilder in such an important achievement. It wouldn't be very subjective to think that it was not well deserved.<br/><br/>This could have possibly been done in order to expand Asian market in Hollywood, by making use of the current popularity of Korean culture.<br/><br/>As I said the movie is not bad, it has a solid photography and editing and script that led to an exciting and brilliant tempo. I really like the first part of the movie because I think the director sets up the story in a intriguing and appealing way however after the beginning the movie looses power in many elements.<br/><br/>Many people love this movie because of its message. I find this rather silly because it's a quite simple message, The difference between the rich and the poor? Is this a radical or new message in any way? I do not think so.<br/><br/>In fact I believe this movie is great for pseudo intellectuals, because actually watching a foreign film and liking it (this movie is easy to like because of its commercial features mentioned above) makes your ego go as high as the empire state."

If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem."

"eelen-seth","10","51","101","30 June 2019"," Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face.
","After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.<br/><br/>Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.<br/><br/>Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.<br/><br/>Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.<br/><br/>Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.<br/><br/>Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off."

Just watch it without any prejudice. It will send your emotions on a journey that does not allow you to cheer for one character or the other.

"JerylBlazikerKoh","10","45","88","2 July 2019"," The Best Bong Joon Ho Movie So Far?
","A common factor between movie director greats such as Kubrick, Hitchcock, Wes Anderson, Tarantino and more are that they tend to make movies so unique that you cannot just categorize it into just one genre. Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list.<br/><br/>If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched.<br/><br/>The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems.<br/><br/>I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing.<br/><br/>Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make.<br/><br/>As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to).<br/><br/>(Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure, 2 July 2019)"

"PotassiumMan","10","14","23","15 November 2019"," Explosive crime and class warfare film, funny and suspenseful
","Bong Joon Ho's film about an impoverished family of petty criminals in Korea is full of menacing, mischievous energy and spiked with sharply-drawn characters, with varying shades of moral and ethical decay. It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns.<br/><br/>It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat.<br/><br/>Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever.<br/><br/>For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended."

"jabox-89571","10","16","27","9 December 2019"," the line between class
","Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.<br/><br/>Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.<br/><br/>The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10"

The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies."

","I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable.
For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people.

","If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr. Bong's place as one of this century's greatest artists, then this film certainly did.

Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon.<br/><br/>Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely.

","As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory."

I watched the film in Korean with Brazilian Portuguese subtitles, I think it is important to watch the film in its own language.
Song Kang-ho is an excellent actor, I really liked his work. The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980.

","After all the hype about this film and the number of awards I was very left feeling very disappointed with this film. Whilst it may have achieved what it set out to be. It seemed neither one thing nor the other. For the most part I found it completely predictable."
"overdarklord","5","15","26","1 December 2019"," mediocre and forgettable
","Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.<br/><br/>So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")"
"teodoreh","8","23","43","17 December 2019"," Parasite is not a valid title for this brilliant movie
","It's a nice-to-watch movie and nice-to-think afterwards of what you've just saw.<br/><br/>At first, it feels you are watching a single-sided comedy, in which a family of poor-devils manage to build a scam against naive rich people. But, 45 minutes later, you see something different.<br/><br/>It is a very strong contrast to see the father of the family on the same scene, trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is ok.<br/><br/>The ending is not the best I could think of, I guess, rich people will keep living and poor people will keep dreaming.<br/><br/>Very strong and meaningful pictures, painting a country that is supposed to be of the wealthiest in the world, showing that the barrier between rich and poor people is opening everywhere. The main characters is like they're living in North Korea if you think of it!<br/><br/>Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show that nobody is good or evil, nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that make us react the way we do. I am not even quite sure who's the parasite. Poor people who discover a window for (a better) living or rich people who take advantage of lower-class people in order to obtain their wealth, not knowing how it is, to be poor?"
"maperspective","1","14","24","8 March 2020"," Five reasons why it blew
","First, for the film to make sense you need to believe at least four things about Koreans: all those who are poor can turn into skilled con artists on a dime, all those who are rich are gullible disinterested idiots, all Koreans are despicable, and Koreans from the same family never look alike ... or maybe all Koreans look alike, then no one can't tell if Korean people are related or not based on the way they look...<br/><br/>Second, ""Parasite"" is actually two films: the first one, a kind of comedy, somehow funny, in which you don't follow characters but their schemes; and the second one, a kind of drama/thriller without tragedy, nor mystery, nor surprising, nor excitement, nor sadness ... a film that I would call ""What?""<br/><br/>Third, deus ex machinas. Brilliant. The midpoint came from nowhere and switched the entire pace and genre. Then, a plague happened. Yes, a plague. Literally. Like in the Bible, but without the fantasy, the rubbish moral, nor the divine purpose that normally comes in a peplum. Nothing. And, the funny part is, just before the first deus ex machina, I thought: ""This film is going nowhere."" Well, the writers thought as well, so...<br/><br/>Fourth, all the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end. What's the point? Was I supposed to care about someone? Might as well do a film featuring families of parasites! No, wait... Moreover, and this is the biggest weakness of the film, the characters are not developed. They are all one-dimensional people and they never evolve, only your perspective of them could change when then go through the deus ex machinas, but nothing of interest. And as the relationships between the characters are not exploited nor elaborated, when something positive or negative happens, we don't care.<br/><br/>Fifth, if you want to create metaphors, write poetry. I need a story. Avoid at all cost, it's a waste of time. I gave it a point because I had to read subtitles, and reading is good for my brain."

","I was just stunned as the movie ends. The plot is both unreal and real at the same time. So unreal, so creative was the plot and so real was the depiction of sheer poverty and how that could possibly deconstruct people's moral..<br/><br/>The way some scenes were shot shows clearly the power contradiction of characters, as when Ki-woo was entering Parks' villa, the surrounding was just pushing towards him.<br/><br/>I really like some of the details of the movie's plot, especially when the Kim family fled back home in the pouring rain, probably looking forward for their shabby but at least rain-free dwelling, only to find out the basement flooded. The scene when Ki-jeong bled to death was also heartbreakingly realistic. No tearful words of goodbye to her father like lots of drams movies have done, the girl was just whining about the pain and asking her father to stop pressing on the wound. The scene when the Parkers' dog carelessly went to eat the kebab sticking to Geun-sae's back was also amazing. I might be over interpreting, but that scene seemed to be expressing that when a nobody like Geun-sae dies, nobody would care, not even human's best friend.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was not able to pay much attention to the actors' expressions when watching the subbed version.And although I have no trouble understanding the subtitles, the white words sometime just blended into the scene and I couldn't read them. Maybe I'll watch it online someday and figure out what I missed."

The housekeeper kept her husband down in a secret dungeon and would bring him food every week and the rest of the time just ignore the fact he is down there by himself. The poor family couldn't even fold a pizza box then all of a sudden they are master con artists overnight. Then the guy in the dungeon goes berserk and starts stabbing the con family and no one seems to care about stopping him not even the family he is after - they let him attack the mom and they don't even try to help her. The husband just watches him attack his wife and doesn't even try to help. Then instead of attacking the attacker, he runs over and kills his boss! It make no sense whatsoever.

REVIEW
As the title suggests PARASITE..it symbolizes the entire plot of the film..the film starts off at a comedy film.. And slowly it turns into a intense thriller.. And finally into a horror film... The film focuses about the rich and poor.. Their goals and aims which bother us.. Exactly before the interval and the climax.. Characters in the film lay a foundation of extreme cinematic experience which was all spine chilling and mind boggling for sure.. The performance delivered by the KOREAN actors was stupendous and flawless.. The details introduced by the director was truly a masterpiece.. It was a great experience..

","Jumping on the post-Oscar win bandwagon, I went to see this film today. Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment."

","Bong Joon Ho's absolutely brilliant and powerful masterpiece is a sheer work of cinematic art. It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho.

","Was expecting a great movie about social inequality. I find I usually agree with the IMDb rating. But this movie was NOT about social inequality or class status. It is about a down on their luck con artist family. Completely understandable the boy lying about going to University to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for. But morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting. Totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears. But then the family lies, manipulates, and scams two people to get fired. Deplorable. Do people do this cause they are poor? No, it's cause they are criminals. There are criminals at all social levels. So this is NOT some type of movie about social inequality. How disappointing.. but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers. But true to form the scam is threatened to unravel."

"kimnamkimchee","10","4","5","12 February 2020"," The self-portrait you think you watched was actually a gorilla
","Just saw it, blown away like everyone else. As I walked out the theater door I started reading the film reviews that I'd been avoiding in order to dodge spoilers. I was met with yet another shock:
Instead of finding others peeling their jaws off the pavement at the miracle of Bong's ingenious and politically powerful satire of a satire film, all the reviews seem to stop at ground level (maybe half-basement run-down 1960s Seoul apartment level-- you'll understand that if you've seen the film,) and they never 'cross the line' to descend into the full-on hidden underground BUNKER level of what Bong is doing with this film.
I'm reading review after review, all authored by viewers smug that they were sharp enough to deduce the film's 'subtle commentary' on 'economic inequality' and ''the evils of consumerism.'
WHAT? Idiots! That commentary was NOT subtle. It was obvious to the point of being ridiculous. Bong has made fools of you, although I don't think that was his ultimate intention. He made use of the satire genre to throw fresh light on another subject, and it's a subject that has been overdone by everyone, especially westerners, in the arts, in international politics, in every possible aspect: It's that whole pesky North/South thing that all 77 million KOREANS, north and south, have to deal with.
In support of this, there are dozens of scenes worth citing. But the most glaringly obvious one is crazy little DaSong's backyard overnight during a brutal rainstorm. He's in a mini-teepee (he's obsessed w/ US 'indians,' who are used as code for 'americans' throughout the film) w/his floodlight & walkie-talkie. His parents are sitting on the couch in their grand living room watching his antics through the huge window that frames their backyard like a big-screen TV.<br/><br/>Dad: 'Do you think that tent will keep the storm out?'
Mom: We had it made by americans, so we should be fine....'
I'm sorry, that backyard IS the DMZ, with its floodlights and speakers. The kid is the 'crossing line' between N. and S. Korea. During the brutal murder scene @ the climax of the film, the guest tables for the 'party' are laid out like combat lines around the DMZ 'teepeet' that was 'made in america' so 'we'll be safe.'<br/><br/>And the whole scene @ the b-day party when Park, Sr. is instructing Driver Kim, (both wearing american native headdresses) on the 'role' he is supposed to play in the fight scene they're staging around the teepee....never has an actual Native American man been cast to play a Hollywood role where he looked more like an american stereotype than Kang Ho Song did in the scene where the camera paused on his sad/irate face in that ridiculous headdress. Kang Ho Song's character represents THE AVERAGE KOREAN, not north, not south, that has succeeded @ living through the last 600 yrs of Korean history. At the end of the film, he's a KOREAN, who just needs to 'walk up the stairs' (or, 'cross the DMZ line') into the world South Koreans are making for themselves now that they're economically capable of 'buying the (national) house.'<br/><br/>I swear I could write a 300 pg thesis on this film, but I'll just leave it at this: since Bong won the Oscars, N Korea's 'dear leader' Kim Jung weasel has used the film as propaganda supporting the idea that South Koreans have been forced into capitalism by 'americans' and would really prefer to be like supposedly less consumerist N. Koreans. There's therefore an EXCELLENT chance that at least some form of the film will be widely viewed in North Korea. And Bong is hoping that North Koreans will, unlike western reviewers, be smart enough to deduce the REAL content of his message.
Fave, & very telling quotes:<br/><br/>""Brilliant! That's a gorilla isn't it?'
--""It's supposed to be a self-portrait...""
(pause) ""Oh, yeah, of course it is....""<br/><br/>""Opening my eyes for the first time in a month, I saw a detective who looked nothing like a detective. Then the doctor who looked nothing like a doctor spoke...""<br/><br/>Clue in, fools... this film is NOTHING that it appears to be to the average internet keyboard warrior reviewer who thinks he's smart enough to have decoded Bong's 'anti-capitalist' message. AND, R. Brody's attempt @ a review in the NY Times is particularly pathetic and misguided. Just sad."

The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is.

"jasonjason-33756","4","316","780","7 August 2019"," A little confused as to how this movie is so extolled worldwide.
","I would like to start out by saying that I am a Korean-American college student (studying at an American college) and have plenty of experience watching Korean movies, including some great ones by Bong Jun-Ho himself, such as The Host, Memories of Murder, and more.<br/><br/>A few months ago when the trailer for Gisaengchung (Parasite) came out, I was really hooked; the trailer gave off that eerie vibe (remotely reminded me of Midsommar by Ari Aster) which I found really intriguing. Seeing all the positive reviews on multiple websites, hearing that this film won at the Cannes Festival and understanding the genius of Bong from his previous films, I had very high expectations.<br/><br/>Here are some of my main points to why I don't love this movie:<br/><br/>1. Acting: The first 10~15 minutes were rather painful to watch. Perhaps it would hit differently for foreigners watching with subtitles, but the unnatural lines and the poor delivery made it really hard for me to focus on the characters. I think the poor acting performance gets better throughout the film, but the Jo Yeo-Jung (mother of rich family)'s acting just felt too out of place and cringey. Perhaps that was the point: to make it look awkward and artificial (especially with the sprinkling of English words) to poke fun at the rich class and their pretentiousness. I understand this is social satire, but the execution was not very convincing. If done properly, I feel like it could and should be subtle yet piercing. I would have had to hated her guts, wanting her to die or her close people to die, but I was barely filled with such emotions. She treats her maid a little too well, and her tone just isn't all that condescending or demeaning. Seemed more like a typical Korean woman freakishly obsessed with her children's education; not a greedy, disgusting woman who doesn't deserve her wealth and privilege.<br/><br/>2. Poorly written/Predictable Plot: I don't the writers tried too hard writing the script for this movie, especially in the beginning where Park Seo-Jun (the tall, smart dude who used to teach Ki-Jung, the daughter of rich family) refers Ki-Woo (son of poor family) as a private tutor. Ki-Woo seemed too smooth with it (not to mention their entire family) even though it is implied that he has never done this before (in the scene where he drinks with Park, the ex-tutor). The film makes it seem like Ki-Woo and their entire family are expert con-artists who screwed up rich families all their lives. That transition was just too abrupt and unconvincing with very little build up.<br/><br/>Now I want to talk about my main point, and perhaps my main pet peeve about this film: predictability. The element of surprise and keeping the audience at the edge of their seats is what drives us crazy and get excited: questioning every scene, line, action of the characters.<br/><br/>However, many aspects of the movie were predictable. I felt like I was always two to three pages ahead of the script throughout the movie: how Ki-Woo will soon bring in her sister after getting the job and thus bring in the entire family; how the rich family will soon return from their camping trip due to the thunderstorm, to screw up the poor family that threw a party in the mansion-ish house. I also do not understand how the sex scene on top of Ki-Tae (dad of poor family) and his kids hiding under the table contributed to the plot. I wish they focused more on the class struggle, the main theme of this movie, and develop on that. The rich dad is the guy who is remotely the obnoxious, successful man who disdainfully looks down upon the poor (bc of his hate for Ki-Tae's smell, which is later the reason Ki-Tae kills the rich dad), but I feel like they could have painted him with a more obnoxious, cunning, and elitist personality. I didn't want or need the rich guy to die at the end, meaning that I wasn't in Ki-Tae's shoes as much as I wanted to and was supposed to, due to lack of character development and build-up.<br/><br/>3. Execution: The theme of this movie is banal; but that doesn't matter because I believe execution and delivery are essential elements in story-telling. To bring up Breaking Bad, as much of a masterpiece it is, the plot, although extremely well executed and developed, isn't all THAT ground-breaking. A poor, depressed guy turning the tables around (rather dramatically) is a recurring theme in movies (American dream movies, super hero movies, and more. I am not discrediting Breaking Bad in any matter. The show's plot is unparalleled, not because of where it started but because of how it developed. How Walter became a criminal mastermind. How Jesse became so vulnerable. How the tables have turned so drastically.<br/><br/>In Parasite, there is no development nor shock value (especially as to how the poor family will tear apart the rich family, perhaps so because of the title haha). I don't feel connected to the poor family. Their motives are weak and unfounded: they are mere criminals (now I can't say that their financial struggles is deserved or not because that is a whole another issue), but there is just too little build-up. Like I said, they just seem too smooth of criminals who's been in the field for decades.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I have been chewing on this ever since I finished watching, but it could be that Bong didn't intend to hit on the points I made; like he didn't feel like he needed to add a strong shock value, or that the poor family needed more build-up. But overall, the plot was too predictable and unconvincing. I saw little pain and suffering of the poor; I wanted to see more jealousy and contempt towards the inequality; perhaps make the rich dad a corrupt CEO? Not just a regular man who's in the tech industry? I didn't feel bad for the poor family, nor did I feel disgusted by the rich family. I didn't think that the rich dude needed to die; I definitely don't think this family didn't deserve that, when in fact I should be triumphantly cheering for Ki-Tae to just go out on a killing spree. Him hiding in the basement was also very obvious. Would have been cool if they didn't reveal that and just show the malfunctioning light blink at a certain pattern, indirectly letting the audience know that Ki-Tae, who was supposedly gone missing, had hid in the basement. Showing not telling (done exquisitely in No Country for Old Men). Instead Bong put a longnarrative in the end which was not inspiring, shocking, nor meaningful. Bong just had the actor explain the whole thing in paragraphs.<br/><br/>Proposal/Biggest Regret: Where I think they really could have taken this movie off was when the rich family cancelled their camping trip and came back: the family finding out about how the poor family was stabbing them from behind, and thus the rich family just mercilessly oppressing the poor family with extreme measures. That is the only part where I was curious about what was going to happen. I think that was where Bong could have given us some insight into the cruel, unfair, and corrupt capitalist society that he is (supposedly) trying to criticize and writing this satire about.<br/><br/>Just some thoughts. Although I am in the never-ending search for good movies, I am no expert. I was just confused at how ppl thought this is Bong's greatest movie ever or even the best film of the 21st century for that matter.<br/><br/>Subpar."

","In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""<br/><br/>The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.<br/><br/>But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.<br/><br/>But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.<br/><br/>Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.<br/><br/>I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.<br/><br/>South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.<br/><br/>The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."

","With many other films out there pointing out of the problem of wealth gap and the struggle to survive in cities, Parasite stands out being different because of its comedic effects and the sudden twists.
There are so many moments in the first half you can laugh with ease when the family use their wits to resolve problems. But under that surface, there is pressure building up, and the dark finally emerges from the most grand-looking house. I was awed by the sudden twist.
The cinematic effect is great. I was surprised to know that the mansion was purposely 'built' for this film. There are so many details that portrays the 'bitter-sweet' life of the struggling family."

"MomoFuzz","10","5","7","21 February 2020"," A movie that stays in your head for weeks and weeks.
","I've never seen a movie do all the things that Parasite does and manage to do them so well. It's a comedy, thriller, horror, and heist film rolled into one, meticulously directed and beautifully edited. It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth. While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone, it never feels disjointed. Most importantly, Bong Joon-Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner, so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn't devolve simply into the poor vs. the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas. Rather, he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters, giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society. It makes the movie's appeal universal.<br/><br/>After watching the movie I was floored. It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards. Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene. And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed. Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing. Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims' basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers. And the result, at least in my summation, is a near perfect execution of a great film."

","One Sunday night I eagerly watched the oscars, hoping my favorite movie of the year once upon a time... in hollywood would win several awards. While it won a few I was shocked to see parasite win so many. A few weeks later I decided to rent the movie and watch. And after 2 hours I can say that I don't think it's all that great. Let's start with the positives. I enjoyed the comedy. There were several bits that had me laughing. They were probably not in the same spots others would usually laugh but nevertheless I thought the movie was decently funny. I thought the acting was pretty good too. Both sides of the family pulled off a pretty believable take on the rich and the poor. But that's all I can really say I liked about the movie. About halfway into the movie I turned to the person I was watching it with and told them that ""This movie must get pretty great within the next 45 minutes amiright"" I had heard so much about the many twists and turns of the movie and I can say that they're really wasn't ever a big twist for me. I mean there was one. That one lead to the entire 3rd act of the movie so I can't really say it was all too surprising. As a person who has loved
Movies since I was a mere lad I can say this wasn't anything too groundbreaking, and can definitely say if it was made the same exact way expect by an American, the movie would be perceived as sucky and unoriginal.

So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...).

","Parasites are a social movie whose main theme is a discussion about poverty. In the main role, a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich. At first glance, it seems that the name ""Parasites"" obviously expresses the author's opinion about the main characters. But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love, and the author would not like to call them guilty. But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists, they are naive, kind people, as much the main characters as the poor. It is not possible to call the third family parasites. Then who are the parasites? I would say that the parasites in this film - and this is what makes movies valuable to me-are rather States, social statuses. Poverty, as well as wealth, are parasites, they set boundaries, they deform people, and people are not really to blame, people by their nature do not seek evil, they are only victims.<br/><br/>If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture - it is dynamic and interesting, the dialogues are cute, the plot is constantly developing and growing, and resembles Kafka, in the sense of growing and growing absurdity. In General, the film is a Comedy, it is easy to watch, through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony, from this the ending becomes surreal - it is even more felt that all the characters are victims.<br/><br/>Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism. Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water, which at one point becomes a flow, a symbol of the smell, which becomes smell, the use of characters for foreign words, the idea of ""plan"", which gradually develops one of the characters, the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him. This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation.<br/><br/>It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot. I would like to say something about dialogues - sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away. I liked the ending very much, apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what, poverty can not be overcome, you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries, which is a rare occurrence, especially with foreign films.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this, I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented. I found it to be witty yet subversive, and I had no idea where it was headed. Bong-Joon Ho is a director who's work that I've seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate. He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring. It doesn't diminish from the story's overall seriousness, nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast, especially Song Kang-Ho, who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet.
Where the story did head completely caught me off guard, but in a good way. It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time, to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it's astounding because it works so well. The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well, as the score becomes more tense and dramatic, and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic. It's all so perfectly complementary to what's escalating on screen. The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster, and it would make good one at that.<br/><br/>The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come, and it was a truly rewarding experience. I think there's still things I won't pick up until my third or fourth viewing.<br/><br/>I absolutely adore this film, and I think everyone should check it out. I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they're watching.
This is my favourite of 2019 so far, and I would be very surprised if that changed from now."

After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!"

","Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.<br/><br/>Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic."

","This film has different genres which makes the film unique.Overall, if you're wanting a movie of mixed emotions (comedy, horror/thriller, mystery, sad, psychological, etc.), this movie has it.The story of the family mixed with different genres and sub-genres such as comedy,thriller,suspense,horror is done seamlessly and quite brilliantly such that it feels earned. The shift in the quirky fun heist comedy to horrific edge of the seat thriller is the highlight of the film. There is meaning conveyed in almost every scene,every shot constructed with such precision with much deeper layers into it connected throughout the film,for instance, the Native American reference or the line that Mr. Park crosses that urges Mr. Kim to take such a sudden and extreme action.Such films don't come very often and this movie proves why Bong Joon-ho is one of the best filmmakers working today."

I stopped watching the awards years ago because the movies are sooo predictable or pretentious or big budgety but not a lot of soul. So by that standard, and the fact it introduces more people to the awesome world of Korean cinema, this movie is really good.<br/><br/>The story is great, the characters were fun and you got to know each, and the acting was spot on. The settings were great as wel.<br/><br/>I thought it was a sci fi flick, but I truly knew nothing about it. I was expecting a thriller like Bug or The Fly or something weird like that. What I got was not disappointing. Very quirky which reflects the work of the director who brings an interesting flare to movies. He's definitely developed his signature style and I think it will make people visit this portfolio.<br/><br/>Again, very good movie. But won't change your life.

Oscars for Best Picture (first one ever for a film that's not in English), directing and screenplay and Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival... close to five hundred nominations and awards... I honestly don't get it.<br/><br/>The movie really is good, but in any of the categories I could possibly classify it, it wouldn't be at the top. I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a ""con-artist"" family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend ""Oldeuboi,"" which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be ""A Moment to Remember.""<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it.<br/><br/>And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about. I guess the author meant poor fraudsters, but from my perspective, their employers are essentially bigger parasites.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

I think I just watched a classic. A modern classic that will be studied for all time to come. I was happy that Parasite won most of their awards at the Oscars, including establishing a landmark for the Oscars by being the first non-english film to win Best Picture. But after watching this masterpiece, If Parasite didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, and it went to films like Joker, 1917 or OUATIH, it would be the worst Oscar year in history.<br/><br/>I'm telling you, if you don't watch this, you can't consider yourself a true movie lover, because this movie has made it practically impossible for all succeeding Best Picture winners to live up to this.<br/><br/>WATCH IT!

","'Parasite' illustrates the Kim's persistent inclination to transcend social classes. It is essentially a realistic scrutinization of how the rich and poor are parasitic towards one another, however the beauty of this film is that this idea merely one of the countless interpretations out there. Each scene in this film has been articulated with such thought, while subtle, and the use of cinematography, mis-en-scene, motif and symbolism (to name a few film techniques prevalent) all cohesively work together to portray the social disparity. There is so much yet so little going on...for me, this film was minimalistic but incredibly insightful and meaningful. It is the epitome of perfection.<br/><br/>I also love Choi Woo Sik, he is easily one of my favourite actors. This movie, from the actors to the filming is absolutely flawless. If you don't want to watch it because you don't want to read subtitles, well you're missing something incredibly special. Bong-Joon Ho is a genius, alongside the many amazing members of the production team. They all worked together to create such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>A good movie leaves you speechless after but a GREAT movie, like Parasite, will keep you invested for months and months and perhaps, for the rest of your life because of how realistic this is.<br/><br/>Amazing movie, 10/10"

","In this dark comedy thriller, the Kims, a resourceful lower-class family swindle their way into employment within the home of the wealthy Park family. Rich with style and social commentary 'Parasite' presents director Bong Joon-ho in complete control of his craft.<br/><br/>The cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push-ins on the characters. Even if the audience doesn't at first notice this subtle movement, we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse. The film is filled with deliberate long takes, the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut. This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships. These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks' house and give the audience the chance to gain a well-constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks' vast wealth.<br/><br/>The production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail, both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar, they both feel equally believable. The locations of these two houses are also important, with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi-basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill. This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes. Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes, while the rich keep moving up, for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder. This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound, forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks' with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity.<br/><br/>But the movie is more complex than 'poor people good, rich people bad' each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity, aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it. The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich, while the upper class may be considered child-like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate. The two sides of society romanticise aspects of the other, what then separates them is the ease with which the wealthy Park family can dip into that fantasy and return to their privilege while the Kim family are punished for their aspirations and attempt to embrace a more lavish lifestyle outside of their designated class.<br/><br/>In 'Parasite' Bong Joon-ho has carefully crafted a slick and evocative film that through excellent film technique conveys important social themes of the segregation of classes through the systematic structures of society. The film Resonated with audiences all while being insanely entertaining leading to a much-deserved Best Picture win."

","How courteous is the Japanese
He always says 'excuse it, please'
He walks into his neighbour's garden
And smise and says 'I beg your pardon'
He bows, and grins a little grin
And brings his hungry family in
He grins, and bows a little bow
'So sorry, this MY garden now'.<br/><br/>That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances.

Actual children are killed, some bashed in the head, multiple people stabbed, and this is somehow okay because somewhere some darling critic said it was good and the rest of the sheep followed. This film is silly and the message is disgusting. At least some of the folks here at IMDB aren't brainwashed.<br/><br/>Yeah, so a film about not being holes to the mentally ill (or anyone) because it hurts, can aggravate their conditions and drive people to suicide or murder is ""bad"" but a film about falsely accusing people to get them fired so you can steal their job, then murder them along with their employers for no reason but greed is ""great"" in whacky CriticLand.<br/><br/>Nothing from this film will be remembered next year.

"Turfseer","6","18","37","17 October 2019"," Noted Korean director's enjoyable grifter family farce devolves into unfunny bloodbath
","Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His ""heroes"" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.<br/><br/>
The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.<br/><br/>
The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.<br/><br/>
Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself ""Jessica"" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces ""Uncle Kim"" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the ""uncle"" is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.<br/><br/>
The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When ""Uncle Kim"" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.<br/><br/>
Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).<br/><br/>
When Moon-kwang discovers the new ""hired help"" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.<br/><br/>
As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is ""permitting the outrage without the consequences."" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.<br/><br/>
A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.<br/><br/>
Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.<br/><br/>
But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.<br/><br/>
Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.<br/><br/>
Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet."
"danielnikrasov","10","18","37","4 August 2019"," A craft masterclass by a genius
","I watched Parasite twice at the 36th Annual JFF (Jerusalem Film Festival) and I have to say, the film is still in my head. The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood's franchises, trust me (Bong Joon-ho was right!).<br/><br/>This review doesn't contain spoilers (although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film).<br/><br/>""Parasite"", directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon-ho, is a social satire comedy-tragedy film that, like the film ""Us,"" tells of two families of different status, one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition. Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family's estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists.<br/><br/>The film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival, and in fact, it deserved and won these awards (Eat Straw, Pulp Fiction). Why? Now comes the twist.<br/><br/>On the one hand, Bong uses a very creative black comedy, as I will describe below, to improve stories of inequality, economic imbalance, inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society's view. And on the other hand, all seven Bong films cover the genres, from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small-town murder mystery, but they all have many things in common. Such as: in the films ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea, South Korea in particular, and the perfect results. As mentioned, this film is ignored by the genre's conventions: it's soft and cruel; Beautiful and hard; Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation.<br/><br/>The screenwriters, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin Won, use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year. Each line is delivered smoothly, as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story, with Jung Jaeli's classic score playing tremendously in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment, to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters. This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world. The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before.<br/><br/>Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences. It is a film that focuses on poverty, despair and what we are willing to do to take what needs to be ours. The tension between supreme elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Therefore, Bong likes to blur the lines of the genre and he makes sure he hits every step in the stairwell to succeed.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" is a craft masterclass in which the power of the story lies in the way comedy and drama rub off on each other in the proper way to ignite a bit of thriller that turns into pure horror when despair and hatred meet each other. This is also not a film that built on one plot twist at the end, it's completely different from any Hollywood film that makes viewers angry at the viewer who just finished watching and suspecting him. This film will be remembered in the history books of world cinema, and foreign cinema in particular as one of the most creative films of the year in general.

","The story is not believable at all and also so predictable.
The director couldn't work on characters and that is why we don't care about them at all, there is no sympathy.
It is a teenage level movie, I laughed throughout the movie but not because it is funny! I was laughing because the story was so naive. However, from the rate he has got so far, I can say he knows people even around world to make such a bad movie but get credits and who knows awards!! So disappointing to see what credits and stars he has got for this kind of movie!!!!<br/><br/>There is a lot of holes in this one such as stabbing the rich guy for nothing! Just not treating well! If the director would like us to believe it, he should take much more time on this character.
In the first 30 minutes, at most, we can predict even the final. Ok, the director doesn't focus on this, but what else he gave us!

The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood.

Their lives not unimportant but treated as unimportant. It shows that education although a tool for wealth does not teach common sense or protect anyone from their safety called money. Just as the poor are not protected in their strong hunger for it. It's a mad cycle. Eye opener to look within your heart and find out the agenda of how valuable life is over money.

"statuskuo","4","17","35","3 January 2020"," I'm Going To Ruin This Movie For You
","I had to delete my previous review after considering it for a day...
So folks...here it is...
It's ""Married With Children"" meets ""The Three Stooges"" told with great style and eventually dark violence.
Yes, friends..you've been fooled and somewhat charmed, but it seems the people who've rated this a masterpiece just got a dose of cold reality.
They even mention Chicago, Illinois in the flick. Which is where the 90's show took place. Critics are too dumb with short memories to draw this conclusion, which is why I'll fill you in.
Dad who is underemployed/unemployed, former gloried athlete
Wife has no aspirations to work, has bad housekeeping skills, crass
Son, distances himself from the low-life world of his low life
Sister, street wise and pretty. Uses her sexuality to get things<br/><br/>I wondered why it felt familiar. In fact, there is an episode where they meet a rich family at a campsite. Also, ""The Simpsons"" had an episode where Homer loses the house to carnys.
So much for originality.
Though you're fooled by a different message of the have and have nots. Which confused me even more. They spent so very little time allowing the family to integrate themselves as ""the rich"" which is how it was sold.
Any way, the message also backfired, considering how despicable the ""poor family"" behaves. The only rationale is that they are so desperate, their actions are forgivable. No, the ends doesn't justify the means. It becomes even MORE muddled when we see the future life that is the possibility, never mind the supposed Morse code feature works only one direction. So if the son is writing a letter to the father, he can't get it. Or maybe we're to assume he left it somewhere where he'd find it. Too many damn questions.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!! Stop reading if you are going to see:<br/><br/>I dunno, it's shot well, and it's funny, but there are just questions. As one reviewer had put it ""why do they make dumb decisions?"" Are they trying to say that poor people are dumb? Also, when the old housekeeper comes back, why don't they just join forces? The entire thing was unnecessary and aggravating. Also, what was the end game? To kill the rich people and assume their lives? And the fact that poor Dad snaps and attacks the rich Dad over a stench poor people have? Delaying the bleed out death of his daughter?
Pretty grim stuff.

He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment.<br/><br/>And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say."
"EasternZZ","7","37","87","3 November 2019"," Just ok
","This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.<br/><br/>The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?<br/><br/>In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Parasite is getting a ton of great reviews from its American audience. i get how class separation can frustrate those on the lower rings and pompous prejudices on the higher echelons. That frustration can lead to fierce debates and sometimes violent acts.
It's the later in writer/director Bong Joon-ho's black comedy where he takes the easy way out to settle his score with those with more wealth. Up to the movie's denouement I was rather thoughtfully following his methodical examination of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" approach on seeing the two families civilly working alongside each other despite the low-esteem both parties privately felt on one another. A more ambitious approach with a far greater payoff would have produced both a moral and soluble message to a societal problem in today's civilized world. Instead Bong ruins it in the final analysis. I cannot recommend this movie despite its witty dialogue and unusual setups."

What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank.

"subreality-864-770504","8","12","24","17 November 2019"," Very Good, but Too Safe for Greatness
","I very much enjoyed this film. It wasn't particularly different than a lot of other dark comedies I have seen, but it was very well made and entertaining. I was hooked from the very beginning, when during the fumigation scene our anti-hero protagonists are likened to stink bugs.<br/><br/>The first part of the film is a very clever dark comedy, planted with seeds of the trouble to come.<br/><br/>Then we hit a point in the film when Bong Joon-ho steers the film from comedy towards a more tragic end. My only criticism is the film does not fully commit to this darker direction.<br/><br/>The garden party scene was the perfect opportunity for Bong Joon-ho to go for a Tarantino-style bloody onslaught that would have had the crowd cheering in their seats. Or Miike-style shock-fest that would have had us covering our eyes while gleefully reveling in the gruesomeness. The film could have ended right there, on a high note, without losing momentum to a gratuitous denouement. Instead, I would have loved to have seen end credits rolling over stills of ""artwork"" by the sole garden party massacre survivor, the doubly-traumatized Park Da-song.<br/><br/>I would have liked that.<br/><br/>But the ending didn't reach for any extremes. It was good, but just a bit too safe for my personal taste. I hope Bong Joon-ho pushes the boundaries a bit more in his next film!"
"TheNabOwnzz","5","14","29","28 November 2019"," A dumb bunch of Marxist propaganda
","Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.<br/><br/>Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd & easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man & woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.<br/><br/>There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.<br/><br/>In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score & generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.<br/><br/>In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing."

The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence).

The fact that Mr. Kim killed Mr. Park really explains the type of people Mr. Parks family were. In a dire situation, Mr. Park shut his nose because of the smell of Mr. Kim, this truly made a realization to Mr. Kim of the type of people they are. The clash of rich and poor, this clearly set Mr. Kim off, to kill him. I like the message at the end, it's very realistic. The son dreamt of buying the house to save his father, and it all would have been a happily ever after. But no, it is sadly a realistic and actual outcome of what the movie should've been.

The main complaint - I was not ""blown away"" by any element of the movie. I know that's a high standard but with a score of 95 it should do exceptionally in some aspects. Instead, this movie did just ""pretty good"" in all of them.<br/><br/>Movie about class struggles might be new and exciting to US viewers but is - I don't want to say cliched - a pretty common theme in East Asia. Juxtaposing two closely-related group of characters with some uncrossable divides that ultimately result in conflict that reflects on the society itself is also a tried and true storytelling device.<br/><br/>Execution of the movie is professional and top-notch. Almost all actions by the characters have meticulous setups (some of them a bit in the face), which, on the bright side, shows the movie was extremely well-thought out and executed. Yet it simultaneously takes away any true element of surprise - a bit over-crafted, I'd say, which is a bit ironic in a highly choreographed dark humor genre movie but bear with me.<br/><br/>Character arcs are well-justified but predictable; was most impressed by the detailed and vivid portrayal of classism through a non-visual medium - smell. The juxtapositions of the underground v. above ground, the pre- and post- discovered housekeeper, and the weather changes vs the mood of the characters was effective but a bit on the nose.<br/><br/>Last, the cinematography was beautiful, the tone was unique and well-balanced, and the performance was amazing.

Having heard only good things about the movie I expected a lot, but it still exceeded my expectations tenfold.<br/><br/>Firstly, the writing is incredible. What seems to be quite a simple story about a family commiting fraud and deceipt to escape poverty, changes throughout the numerous twist and turns into something very unexpected, interesting and absolutely brilliant. The pacing is on point and from start to finish, the film takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions including, but not limited to: sadness, a feeling of well-deserved success, hapiness, guilt, unease, discomfort and fear.<br/><br/>Secondly, the score is fantastic and greatly accentuates these different feelings into something more. For example, the many intense and thrilling scenes are strengthened into a crippling suspense that leaves you unable to lose focus and calm down.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is absolutely wonderful, although it also houses about the only critisism I have for this movie. After about half of the film I found myself wondering how on earth they were going to be able to pull of the ending, but they did, and it was not what I expected. Some of the decisions the characters make in the final act seems a bit out of left field and takes them in directions that doesn't neccesarily feel right. I do however think that's the point and it brings a very intriguing point about the movie's theme into question.<br/><br/>In short, ""Parasite"" is nothing short of a masterpiece."

","I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.<br/><br/>Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.<br/><br/>I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.<br/><br/>I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)<br/><br/>I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.<br/><br/>So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.<br/><br/>I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.<br/><br/>I had no issue with understanding it.<br/><br/>It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.<br/><br/>Except he does.<br/><br/>As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.<br/><br/>Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.<br/><br/>Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.<br/><br/>The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.<br/><br/>The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.<br/><br/>The cinematography is simply beautiful.<br/><br/>It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.<br/><br/>Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing."
"Bertaut","9","5","8","21 February 2020"," An uncategorizable masterpiece
","What is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define Parasite? Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, Parasite is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director <a href=""/name/nm0094435/"">Bong Joon Ho</a> also tied with <a href=""/name/nm0000370/"">Walt Disney</a> for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night - four. On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.<br/><br/>But what exactly is Parasite? Described on its official website as a ""pitch-black modern fairy-tale"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature - part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the Ulysses of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like Ulysses, it's exceptional in just about every way - screenplay (co-written by Bong and <a href=""/name/nm8243301/"">Jin Won Han</a>), directing, cinematography, mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things - it lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (<a href=""/name/nm0814280/"">Kang-ho Song</a>), mother Chung-sook (<a href=""/name/nm4525883/"">Hye-jin Jang</a>), daughter Ki-jeong (<a href=""/name/nm6476224/"">So-dam Park</a>), and son Ki-woo (<a href=""/name/nm6079248/"">Woo-sik Choi</a>) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (<a href=""/name/nm6124994/"">Seo-joon Park</a>), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (<a href=""/name/nm1310525/"">Sun-kyun Lee</a>), mother Yeon-gyo (<a href=""/name/nm1856097/"">Yeo-jeong Jo</a>), daughter Da-hye (<a href=""/name/nm7616095/"">Ji-so Jung</a>), and son Da-song (<a href=""/name/nm10700274/"">Hyun-jun Jung</a>), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.<br/><br/>Obviously enough, Bong's main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth - the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and completely bonkers third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that's about as different from the film's early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, Parasite feels like a culmination, the film to which he's been building for his entire career.<br/><br/>One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong's avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics - the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it's the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families - as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect.<br/><br/>There are no heroes and villains here - Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. It's a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect.<br/><br/>It's in relation to the two family's status as heroes or villains that the film's title is so important. A parasitic organism lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren't that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well - they've been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship.<br/><br/>However, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. <a href=""/name/nm0393240/"">Kyung-pyo Hong</a>'s cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb <a href=""/title/tt7282468/"">Beoning (2018)</a>, and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. <a href=""/name/nm4342766/"">Ha-jun Lee</a>'s production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' and Parks' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.<br/><br/>It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks' lavish home has two main stairways - one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he's suddenly directing a horror film (there's a thematic reason for this that I can't go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There's also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which will have huge narrative and thematic importance.<br/><br/>Parasite is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie - a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich - but Bong is far too talented for that, allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art, a film which has proven itself very much a game-changer and completely deserving of every bit of praise it's received."

","This movie holds the pure depth of cinematic drama in 02 hours"
"samjudd","10","5","8","18 February 2020"," Parasite
","Bong Joon Ho's chilling satirical masterpiece addresses the age old theme of social class. Much like Bong Joon Ho's previous work, Snowpiecer (2013), the question of why some people are seen as ""lower"" and some people are seen as ""higher"" class is asked. The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system.
The narrative follows the Kims, a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life. Although it is all set in South Korea, the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere. It could be argued that there are no villains in the film, just people; however, it is anything but a soap opera. It is a commentary on the human condition. Nothing is black and white, just shades of grey.
Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before. However, there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to. Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963).
There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian. I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999).
The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang-ho Song and Sun-kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge. The spider-like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness.
The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which, combined with the direction, made for some side-splitting moments. However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film, there are moments of real sadness and pain. The contrasts beautifully represent life, because what is life if not a series of contrasts?"

"blevine-91014","10","5","8","17 February 2020"," Excellent film, with very unique and effective techniques
","Parasite is Bong Joon-Ho's latest political thriller, and definitely his most complex one yet. Similarly to his 2013 sci-fi film Snowpiercer, Parasite follows a group of people ignoring their standard place in society, and trying to climb up the social ladder to the rich and powerful. Unlike Snowpiercer, however, Parasite's view of social classes is much less simplistic. Using only 10 characters and a single household, Bong Joon-Ho tells an incredibly truthful and realistic portrayal of modern times. The more the family of 4 protagonists disrupts social order, the more they uncover about how society is run.<br/><br/>The movie follows many different perspectives of the world, perspectives that other characters aren't aware exist. Mainly, ignorant rich people, and the workers who are scamming them. Due to the increasing amount of perspectives throughout the movie, many normal things begin to seem quite ridiculous. What some characters think of as master plans no longer seem as masterful to the audience, and what are some characters' pleasant memories of harmless fun, are for others' intense near-death experiences. This type of divide in viewpoints both further shows the divide in social classes and creates some of the most hilarious moments in cinema. However, Parasite is not only a satire on social structure, but also one on modern art, education, technology, social norms, business, and Korean politics, making for a story covering multiple aspects of society.<br/><br/>While most directors' first foray into another genre is usually noticeably shoddy, Joon-Ho Bong's first primarily comedic film is actually much better than most comedies written nowadays. Instead of taking the modern approach of making unclever jokes and then stretching it out until it becomes painfully obvious to every single member of the audience, Parasite follows the old method of screen comedy used by many early Hollywood writers, and most notably, later by the Cohen brothers. Many segments of the movie will contain multiple concealed jokes in each sentence of dialogue or corner of a shot. While it is true that they happen too quickly and too obscurely for a given audience member to understand every joke, they also create a movie that is much more satisfying on rewatches, or even just in retrospect. 2 different audiences will laugh at 2 completely different parts of a scene. While cell phone use may seem normal to younger audience members, older ones will more easily notice the ridiculousness of them. Korean and American audiences read the meanings of scenes in 2 different regards, with some things only noticeable to one of the cultures. All of this makes for viewing experiences that actually follows the previously mentioned satirical formula of the movie.<br/><br/>Aside from (usually satirical) juxtaposition, there is another major technique used throughout the film to make it more intense and interesting. This is tied to one of the movies main messages: that life never goes as planned. This is either hinted at or proven in almost every scene, starting with the first, in which the wife jests to her husband after their wifi goes down, ""What's your plan?"". This line is followed by a shot of her athletic medals, obviously showcasing the fact that her early life plan to become a professional athlete did not go as expected. There are many other lines in the same vein as this one. At one point, one of the main characters blatantly admits their philosophy in life is that ""the best plan is to have no plan"". In general, it feels as though Bong Joon-Ho's technique in writing the more intense sequences in the movie was to make sure that, no matter what, nothing would ever go as planned for any of the characters. This ensured that the audience will always be on edge as to what would happen next, and most of the film's major and minor plot twists or advancements are due to this.<br/><br/>I think the best example of all of this is during the sequence when the rich family is out of town. The protagonists expected to be able to relax for the next couple of days, and even talk about what they want to do later in life, like one day being able to buy a nice house just like that one. This doesn't go as planned when the old maid arrives and ruins everything. Later on, the maid and her husband act the same way, abusing their power to relax and daydream about the old days when they felt free and alive. They many references to North Korea, probably hinting at themes that American audience members (such as myself) don't fully understand. Their expectation too goes haywire when the protagonists charge them and take the phone. Another plot twist occurs when the rich family suddenly call the house saying that they'll be home in a few minutes. Another great example of differing perspectives can be found as the family arrive at home to nice meals and a clean house, unaware of all that is happening behind the scenes and that they are in the middle of a fast-paced, intense action sequence."
"sebastianschlicht","10","5","8","17 February 2020"," When the lights come on, they crawl away quickly!
","After watching some good films in 2019, there were only a few that really blew me away. I'm a big ""Avengers - Endgame"" fan, but ""The Irishman"" and especially ""The Lighthouse"" really touched me. And now we have ""Parasite"" by Bong Joon-ho, the South Korean director of ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"". ""Parasite"" was the first South Korean film to win the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered tons of good reviews. Recently it also won four Academys, amogst other things of course ""Best Picture"". Logically, I was interested.<br/><br/>The Kim family lives on a subsistence level and takes every opportunity to improve their situation. How fitting that one day the son receives an offer to help a wealthy family ...<br/><br/>The less you know about ""Parasite"", the better! Nevertheless, I try to rate the film as best as possible without giving anything away.<br/><br/>What is the best way to describe ""parasite""? It´s not easy, because the genre of the film alone is not easy to grasp. The film works here and there as a satire, can surprise with some really funny moments, but also has very metaphorical scenes and then suddenly becomes scary and exciting. And that's all an understatement. ""Parasite"" always surprised me. In a moment you suspect you know what kind of film it is, but then there is the first twist and then the next and I was always surprised. Few films can do that. Joon-ho stages a masterful, socially critical film that works on so many levels. The visual level, for example, is fantastic, ""Parasite"" works with grotesque, but nevertheless appropriate exaggerations, which sometimes are difficult to bear in terms of their message and strength. The name of the film gives a wonderful hint of what to expect.<br/><br/>All actors are fabulous and deserve the greatest recognition, because it is not just the terrific script or the equally fabulous direction that make ""Parasite"" so effective. I especially liked Song Kang-ho as father of the Kims!<br/><br/>Technically, ""Parasite"" offers creative and sometimes breathtaking camera settings. Some spectacular sets were built for the film, such as the Kims' family home. The editing is great and Jeong Jae-il's score was also wonderfully integrated into the visuals; everything just fits here!<br/><br/>Conclusion: You have to see ""Parasite""! It is one of those films that certainly offers something for everyone, but at the same time brings with it so much intelligence and strength that I am amazed and happy at the same time that this South Korean work is so well received by the audience. Without a doubt one of the best films of 2019. A masterpiece, a must-see and in a way also an important film, I think. Terrific!"

"Artimidor","9","5","8","15 February 2020"," Parasite(s) and where to find them
","With ""Parasite"" Bong Joon Ho goes for another exercise of social commentary, not unlike his praised ""The Host"" (2006) - for those who cared for a monster movie dealing with social issues. It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as ""Parasite"" protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in ""Parasite,"" and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. ""Parasite"" comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort ""Memories of Murder.""<br/><br/>""Parasite"" is an all-out visual genre mix of the first order, as much commentary about western society's underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition. Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us, metaphorically - and literally. In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama, a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle, and yet it works.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" is also the ultimate staircase film, to name just one striking image. This owes itself to the implied fairy-tale lore that at the end of the staircase - society's equivalent for the romantic rainbow - you'll find a pot of gold, right? It's just that stairs work in both directions, and climbing them up or down is less romantic. Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle-like. Consider this circle squared."
"alexander-e-bloch","9","5","8","15 February 2020"," Cinematic marvel
","Four highly coveted Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay), being awarded to a foreign-language film, is an unprecedented event in my memory. This makes Parasite (South Korean 2019 tragicomedy) a must-see movie.
Having just come out of the theatre, I can admit in all sincerity that the film has affected me on multiple levels. But before broaching the poignant essentials, should firstly dispense with the banal, which I expect the woke and self-righteous movie-goers are likely to focus on. These will undoubtedly include such predictable clichés as injustices of income inequality, disdain of the chauffeur-driven elite towards ""smelly"" subway riders, aloof callousness to the upper classes, etc. These elements are undeniably featured in the film, but purely as a foil for a deeper exploration of the human psyche, which deserves to be examined with some specificity.
Viewer warning: Parasite, while a monumental piece of cinematic work, is not a joyous viewing experience. The unrelenting intensity, unleashed on the viewer almost from the start (not too dissimilar to that of observing a circus acrobat on a tight rope without the safety net), is sustained without respite throughout the two-hour-plus duration.
Armed with only a cursory knowledge of the South Korean society, culture, and class hierarchy, I felt somewhat disadvantaged, particularly during the early scenes. At the risk of being exceedingly presumptuous, I fear that most of the US movie-going public might be in the same boat, despite the prominence of the ubiquitous Samsung, KIA Motors and other Korean brands permeating global markets. If not for the omnipresent media denunciations of its dangerously unpredictable neighbor to the north, we would probably know even less about the Region. While ignorance is generally considered to be a bliss, in the case of Parasite, not knowing the Korean societal dynamics, one can't help but experience the frustrations of cognitive dissonance right from the start.
On the one hand, we are presented with:
<ul><li>a close-knit Kim family, exhibiting an unmistakably cooperative and mutually supportive spirit;</li><li>healthy, good-looking, clever and articulate offsprings;</li><li>athletically accomplished mother (the inference is drawn from a prominently placed photo, displaying her hammer throwing prowess in what appears to be a serious track &amp; field event).</li></ul>While on the other hand:
<ul><li>all seemingly underemployed (e.g., relegated to pizza box assembly as an income source);</li><li>underpaid (e.g., mooching off the neighbors for WIFI signal);</li><li>under-housed (i.e., shabby, vermin-infested, basement-level dwelling, where drunken public urination in front of their window is a near-regular occurrence).</li></ul>The initial culturally ""foreign"" element driving the dissonance is that despite the unambiguously self-reliant and skilled family members, the mother feels she needs to kick the husband out of his slumber to ""come up with the plan"". An accomplished hammer-thrower evidently needs a man to do the heavy lifting (pun intended) when it comes to figuring out options for protecting the family or improving its finances.
What makes these incompatible realities even more disjointed is the apparent inability of the siblings, who clearly exhibit an above-average portfolio of skills, to claim their proper station in society. The brother, while devoid of formal university education, has superior math, English and college entrance test-acing skills. The sister, in addition to her mastery of drawing and appealing looks, has perfected the improv and BS artistry to such an extent that in any meritocratic setting she would easily achieve a distinguished career in marketing, politics or screenplay writing. The film creators are seemingly posing a two-part question:
1. is it the social status and family pedigree, rather than merit, that acts as a dominant determinant of one's ability to succeed; or perhaps...
2. it is a self-inflicted limitation imposed by one's own belief system that places the current circumstance or family history to be the obstacle to advancement?
The filmmakers are hinting at the latter by incorporating the heavy rock imagery, introduced to the audience in a form of a gift by a family friend (looks more like a ginormous paperweight, rather than heirloom). The brother becomes so inextricably linked to the rock, particularly during periods of high stress, that he seems unable to separate himself from it no matter where he goes. Predictably (in keeping with Chekhov's dramatic principle) this heavy rock becomes the instrument of his near demise. Curiously, it is the same metaphorically tuned brother who misses such an obvious boulder of a symbol (again pun intended).
However, it is the juxtaposition of the affluent Parks vs the poor Kims in the film that takes the cake (definitely, pun intended). An unspoken shield seems to reliably insulate the wealthy from various external forces. While a heavy downpour can dispossess the slum dwellers of their property entirely, it is only a minor inconvenience for the wealthy (down to the leak-proof pretend American Indian tents). While basements of the rich can withstand a nuclear attack from the pot-bellied dictator north of the border, any substantial deluge simply drowns basements (or basement homes, as the case might be) of the poor in raw sewage. Another purpose of incorporating the heavy rain scene into the film is to remind us that often ""when it rains, it pours"". That is, while the Kims managed to cleverly contrive themselves into the Parks' household, the elation proved to be short-lived as they discovered other subterranean dwellers in the Parks' house, whose status is even lower than that of the Kims, leading to dramatic disequilibrium to a comfortable and promising situation.
According to the filmmakers, while the invisible walls of wealth and privilege protect the affluent class from external threats, no one is safe when it comes to the ""enemy within."" The message here seems to be that as long as the class resentment is obvious and inter-class mobility is driven by factors other than merit (e.g., antecedent, lack of connections, body odor, cheap underwear or any other subjective and artificial boundaries) the risk of societal discontent is always lurking in the background, bringing the fragility of human existence to the forefront, often causing the innocent to suffer.
The carnage scene in the latter part of the film, while abrupt and sudden, can indeed be foreshadowed as a natural consequence of open expression of disdain that Parks Sr. signals to Kim Sr. in no uncertain terms.
Where I struggle with my interpretation of the film is the title. There are no obvious parasites in the plot. Even the subterranean male dweller performs light sensor duties at appropriate moments, thereby communicating his respect and appreciation. The Kims dutifully fulfill their respective roles. While the Parks Sr. works for his money. Perhaps the idea behind the title is to suggest that there is a symbiotic feeding off one another that remains fundamentally destructive as long as the gulf between societal layers remains unbridged. Not sure. Need to think about it some more.

","Before watching this film, I wondered and strongly believed that the title ""Parasite"" referred to Kims' family - an obvious choice for them being the ones feeding on their host (and rich) family. But the hopeful ending (for Kims) made me realize that Bong Joon Ho does not see Kims as villains. He imagined this movie as a class warfare. And like any war, this one had the winner too - the Kim family. Apparently, for Bong this movie is about the shortcomings of (late) capitalism.<br/><br/>And I am here thinking how is capitalism the villain in a story of a murderous, cheating, fraudulent family of Kims who decide to get rich at the expense of others (i.e. work in a non-capitalistic way). But in a world where socialism is on the rise; where the poor demand the rich to pay for their living because why not; where an individual is responsible for everyone else but himself/herself this movie is the type of crap that would sell."

","I gave this film two stars because although the story is garbage, it's beautifully filmed and the set design is absolutely brilliant. Kudos to the cinematographer and the set design people. That being said, I found the story to be trite, boring, predicable and disappointing. Caution, spoilers follow.<br/><br/>The plot is nonsensical, the characters are clichés, and I'm not sure I understand the message the filmmakers are trying to convey. Is the film trying to illustrate the shallow banality and institutionalized cruelty of the wealthy class and the devastating plight of the word's poorest folks? Those points are well-illustrated by the flood, the rich husband's treatment of his employees, etc... but beyond that, the plot settles into your standard, formulaic series of predictable events, portraying the poor family as stupid, rage-filled, murderous, half-wit psychopaths. Are the filmmakers trying to say that their murderous rage is justified or that poor people are just too stupid to understand the consequences of their actions? The poor family in the story are criminals, but they go about their criminal activity with all the calculation of an 8 year old. They are buffoons whose undoing follows a series of bad decisions, cons and assaults that are carried out with no forethought whatsoever.<br/><br/>This idea, so popular among the entertainment elites, that the rich are horrible people (excluding themselves of course) and that the poor are noble savages, seems to inform an awful lot of character motivation and plot development. It's a common trope here in Hollywood and I guess their overseas counterparts have learned from the best. If Hollywood has taught us anything it's that stereotypes and recycled stories are what the public wants. After all, filmmakers usually don't portray life as it really is, rather, they portray life as imagined by a privileged elite who write and produce this nonsense. From their perspective inside the bubble, Hollywood has spent billions of dollars over the years to bring us clichéd tropes such as:
<ul><li>""The hooker with a heart of gold who, by the story's end will be rescued by a rich, handsome millionaire,"" and,</li><li>""The wise, world-weary black sidekick, who guides the white protagonist and serves as his conscience, but who sadly must die near the end of the film,"" and,</li><li>""The white-savior schoolteacher who is determined to 'make a difference' and ultimately is able to 'reach her students' through a combination of white-lady-tough-love, mime work, hip hop and interpretive dance, transforming a ragtag bunch of inner-city HOC (Hoodlums of Color) into Rhodes scholars.</li></ul><br/><br/>Maybe filmmakers outside the US have learned from the pros, and maybe they got it right, judging from the number of folks who rated this film highly and the fact that it won the Best Picture award.<br/><br/>On some level, I find this film offensive and am disappointed that so many have jumped on the bandwagon and rated it highly. Having personally known many wealthy people and many poor people, I cannot reach the filmmaker's conclusion that the rich are cruel and indifferent and the poor are stupid and violent. I've also, unfortunately, personally known several murderers. They were cold, unfeeling sociopaths and when you looked into their eyes you saw an abyss. Nobody home. But they were not motivated by righteous outrage at an unjust system. None of them were poor. They weren't rich either. From a socioeconomic perspective, all the murderers I've known were people who had decent jobs, plenty to eat, new clothes, cell phones, access to credit, all of them were white, and people they murdered were from socioeconomic backgrounds almost exactly like their own. I watched this film to see if it lived up to its hype. Sadly, it turned out to be just one more piece of garbage, no better than most of the junk made in Hollywood. What a waste of time."

"120watts","7","3","4","12 April 2020"," I don't get it
","It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?<br/><br/>Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.<br/><br/>Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.<br/><br/>Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise."

","Bathing in the sunlight in the courtyard can evolve into an adult, breathing the air in the dark room can only walk like a ghost. You can't let go of a poor stone for a lifetime, and you will never get rid of the cheap smell. Curly bed bugs, sterilize yourself with windows of potions; hosts in high places, use money to hire people to disinfect themselves. The rich sucked the blood of the poor soared, the poor sent their lives to the rich, the people and ghosts shared food in the same room, and the insects and beasts developed together to develop enemies. In ""The Parasite"", we saw President Park's family who were blinded by money. In a high society, they respect wealth and status, but ignore the lower class people who live in darkness. The gap between the rich and the poor has increased the antagonism between the two major class relations, and has become the trigger for the tragedy."
"sebasdlvega","9","3","4","4 March 2020"," Mastering the basics
","South Korean cinema is taking more and more presence in the film industry, proof of them was the last installment of the Oscars, where the main protagonist of the night was the director Bong Joon-ho, who has made several films of diverse genres , among the best known we can find ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja, whose original language is in English, and are productions with original content, with details of great value that makes them hardly unnoticed; However, where this director's genius is really appreciated is in his films ""The Host"", ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder"", really outstanding films, full of surprises and unexpected endings, so in truth my emotion startled the find out that he made another movie, after 10 years since the last one!<br/><br/>""Parasites"" is one of the most acclaimed films at the Cannes festival and even won the golden palm, in turn was acclaimed in the ""Oscar Awards"" and won the best film, best International film and best director.<br/><br/>Like many of his previous films, he manages to put elements of comedy and drama, comedy is well written and inserted in such a structured way that he cannot take seriousness from the other scenes that were sometimes extremely dramatic, exciting and in some terrifying parts.<br/><br/>This film is the culmination of Bong as a total author, since he manages to link several genres in a total collision and thus generate the magic he looks for in one of his works, because ""Parasites"" is one of those works so well spun in its history and in the way in which it is said that he manages to wrap the viewer so that he cannot get rid of the screen.<br/><br/>Like all the great movies in history, I consider the experience to be better if you don't know too much about what you are going to experience (I hate spoilers). So I will not reveal almost anything about the plot, I will only mention that several genres at the same time, a comedy, then a thriller and even a robbery movie. It is a really ambitious film and there is too much happening in matters of messages and themes, it is also incredibly well acted thanks to the depth of the characters.<br/><br/>
It is a really accessible film that can be enjoyed, because it is one of ""those films"" that you can show people who generally do not choose to watch Asian films, since it entertains you from the beginning and never gets boring, highlighting that It is taken with a beautiful cinematography, the music is fantastic with proper use, and all the characters add to the experience, making it not feel that time is wasted.<br/><br/>Movie I would definitely see again."

","Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.<br/><br/>The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.<br/><br/>Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.<br/><br/>The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.<br/><br/>All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.<br/><br/>Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.<br/><br/>I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.<br/><br/>When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.<br/><br/>There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.<br/><br/>Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.<br/><br/>Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that."

A few others would have been worthy contenders (""Oldboy"", "" Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring"", ""Bad guy"", ""A bittersweet life"" or ""3-Iron"" come to my mind and I forgot many others), but I guess Korean movies weren't on the radar until the mid-2010's. Better late than never..."

","Parasite, is a hard film to discuss, not because it's one of those films that is truly horrendous but genuinely its a hard film to talk about because its one those where you cant do your research, or where you can see any trailers because they would most likely spoil the outcome. The hard truth is, you have to go into it completely blind, because its one those films that can surprise you at any turn, essentially there are no words to describe this superb South Korean thriller but simply it's director: Bong Joon-ho.<br/><br/>This is pure Bong, it's insane, if you were to put it into one single genre you would a very hard to find trying to find which genre it would slot into, is it a horror? A thriller? A crime-caper? A comedy? Or is it just a drama? It's all of them, and none of them at the same time. But in a way in that sense that's the way that Bong creates his cinema, just for him, the man has no one genre he has not one single technique in his directing style. From his first film in 2000 Barking Dogs Never Bite, to Memories of Murder, through his monster invasion flick The Host, Snowpiercer and there's even no way to describe his last film Netflix's Okja they are all him. And his seventh film Parasite goes completely crazy in fact we're not sure if it's trying to be a meticulous crowd-pleaser or a mindbending thriller or an Art-house caper. The point is where he is trying to go he does it successfully. From the opening reel it'll have you intrigued and it scratch you out until you are unwillingly bridled to watch it again and again...<br/><br/>And why shouldn't you? It's perfect - the plot is watertight, the Kim family are poor and penniless and utterly hopeless, they are getting tired of their stingy underground basement apartment so the eldest son (Woo-shik) seeks out other opportunity besides living in squalor conditions. So he has a plan to work for the wealthy Park family in their stunning mansion, liking what he sees he decides to bring the rest of his family along for the ride, and for a while everything is going fine until the rise of an unfortunate incident. And that's when everything changes. Intrigued? Well, that's enough. Because when it comes to Bong it's not the story that matters its the way his characters are written, the way they delve into making new plans for the well-off Park family. No. What the story is a about, is family. Now we know what you're going to say, and you can refrain from that because this is the exact opposite, it's about a family who have nothing, then they go into everything and then they think they're doing fine until they slip. And that could result in a lot of things going wrong. For the first hour during the different plans you could essentially say that this is another version of The Italian Job minus the cars and Michael Caine or perhaps a mixture between Ocean's and Rififi and you'd be write it's all those. And much more, there's no knowing how many references to old films Bong has put here. But what he does in that first hour is absolutely captivating and the execution of the plans is one-of-a-kind cinema. It's a film that doesn't that doesn't really sound like it works, but it does. And here Bong has created a miracle of a film.<br/><br/>Joyously it couldn't have come at a better time, amidst all the modern cinema redos, remakes and been-there-done-that sequels this is a real miracle and Bong has a real gem on his hands. Plus naturally in crime caper when people get found out they lose everything, here there's no evidence of that, maybe (but remember no spoilers) but the Kims they just keep going until they have ruined enough of the Park family's well being. There's a moment of a threat of being caught but with eager hands they soon put a stop to that. The fact is Bong does nothing wrong here, Parasite is a perfect, water-tight and captivating thriller that will put your heart on edge, make you scratch your head and finally make wonder if cinema can get any better. No is the answer, and Bong could not have made it a better time as it will keep you going to the end reel and refuse to let go even well after the credits roll. He's essentially the Korean version of the Coen brothers, and there's no better compliment than that.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Bong has made a miracle of a film that's a water-tight crime caper, thriller and dram a plus many more genres all in one film. And with an unforgettable story it will keep you watching for years to come. Truly cinema at its best."

"Tokushirou","5","41","107","7 September 2019"," Parasite by Bong Joon-ho is like a Hollywood, almost-shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang-dong
","Parasite by Bong Joon-ho is like a Hollywood, almost-shallow version of Burning by Lee Chang-dong. The acting is jarring and obnoxious until you get used to it, the characters and plot are one dimensional, the praised twists by the trailers and critics aren't exciting but shallow and even almost predictable. The scenes that are supposed to be thrilling, like the scene in which the rich family comes home earlier than expected from the vacation to the horror of the parasites, are ridiculous in a cartoonish way without anything of value to contradict it. The cinematography and shots are constantly almost awkward in their cheesy-ness and obvious structure. The film belittles its viewers as well, what only takes away from its own intelligence, by feeding them with a spoon its meaning - immediately explaining in words what was already told in visuals, which more often than not was completely unnecessary and dense. None of the characters make any truly moving progress, and even though the director claims in his movie there are no good and bad guys - he mostly failed to translate this sentiment into the film itself by making one dimensional, static confrontational characters.
No matter how aesthetically calculated cinematic shots are, if there is no core-deep meaning in the film to back them up, they're worth nothing. Moreover, you can't calculate emotion. The visual storytelling of the shots in the film is so obviously calculated almost mathematically, with barely no internal intuition or feeling. And it only makes them awkward, as if the director only now graduated film school and wanted to show off everything he was taught without much experience (which isn't the actual case for Bong Joon-ho).
It seemed like the director tried to achieve what Burning succeeded in obtaining, with addition of supposed-to-be-impressive high budget visuals, music and ""show"", but failed. Burning is a fantastic example to a mind and emotion intriguing film, full of thrilling twists and turns, true dark and concerning aura and human characters that touch the core of your being, which doesn't belittle it's viewers and taken straight out of the heart. Burning is what everything Parasite attempted to be without success. Bong Joon-ho thought too much, and ended up with barely anything of actual worth. Lee Chang-dong listened to his heart and intuition, and graced us with a beautiful, well crafted masterpiece, which in its humble and quiet progression spoke volumes and echoed in the viewer's mind and heart.
Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a perfect example to a film which is all bark and no bite.
In one word: disappointing."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","16","36","6 January 2020"," Fairly entertaining film, but one of 2019's best it is not
","Okay, so these slightly over 2 hours are ""Parasite"" or ""Gisaengchung"", the original title that probably nobody in Europe or the United States is really aware of. This is one of the biggest players this awards season, also in North America, and that I find really surprising. It certainly also has to do with this movie winning the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes earlier this year. I guess it helps that director Bong Joon-ho has worked on films with big players from Hollywood too in the past. So it is a bit of back to the roots for him now. Anyway, people have said it is a powerful statement on inequality in society and while this is a key subject in the film, I don't think it elaborates on this in a really profound or groundbreaking way or is just super creative in its explanations. It is decent, maybe good, nothing more. This is the story of a really poor family, unemployed without any real prospect that through lucky coincidence (the son's friend) manages to sneak in at a rich family's house and eventually they all have jobs there with the help of fake exam reports and the people who actually live there have no idea they are all related. You can argue to what extent it is despicable what they are doing because obviously how they remove the limo driver and the maid is really full of intrigue. Still, sometimes I struggled with how realistic it all felt. I mean that it did not. For example that the driver really gets fired or that when hiring the mother as the new maid that the rich husband and wife do not talk about who made the suggestion. And there are more moments like this. It does feel kinda fictitious at times for me, which is a bit of a negative dealbreaker for sure because like I said you can see that this film tried to make a powerful statement. It also sometimes felt too much as if they were taking the idea of a parasite and what it does as too defining like how it kills the host eventually, which is what one man does to the other near the film's end and that really did not feel realistic at all to me. Just showy and for the sake of it because even in his letter he said that he felt sorry for the man and respected him, so if he should have attacked anybody, then I'd say it should have been the guy who lived down there and went rogue before that on everybody, especially the protagonist's family. And also that the son really with all the blood literally pouring out of his head survived the attack as we find out did not feel too likely to me. It was interesting though that it was this big rock he was attacked with that clearly meant something to him as he saved it when everything was under water before that and they had to leave their real home. Karma maybe a bit because they say this big mansion is their new home.<br/><br/>Still there are funny moments too. After all this film calls itself a satire. The highlight comedically for me was when they are all under the bed and this scene easily could have gone wrong, but it was hilarious, especially when all except the dad get out, but then the rich family's son calls his parents and he is down there on the ground in the middle of the room, but they don't see him. Don't suspect anything. But before that it is not too respectful how they talk about the man's smell. So they are definitely on the shallow side when (they think) their employees are not nearby. The escalation started really from the moment they let the old housekeeper in the house again. I also wondered why they did. I mean I can see why they opened the door, but then they should have asked what she wants and brought it to her, which of course would not have been possible, but this would have been the approach that made sense in this scenario. Okay what else can I say about this film let me think. The 3 younger women were all really stunning. Somebody who says Asian women are not particularly attractive should see this film and maybe he will change his mind. I have read people compare this film to Pulp Fiction, but I would not agree with that at all. The ending is as bloody as anything Pulp Fiction has to offer, but this is hardly a criterion I'd say. It felt completely different to me and also slightly inferior at least. Key subjects like religion, absolution, betting, sexual abuse and drugs are not at the center of this film here and brief talk about drugs on one or two occasions does not change that. But kinda ironic that with this comparison the director of this film is going against Tarantino at the Oscars too, even if I am pretty sure BJH is not winning. I am not sure if I like the idea of Tarantino winning the big prize this year and maybe his first Oscar for his direction, but his film is definitely way superior compared to this one here. The other contender is Scorsese and while I think his film is not too bad, I am also not won over by that one as I was by Tarantino's. Scorsese's is roughly on par with Parasite. So to sum it all up, a few more words on Parasite. It has a really nice (almost) sex scene and in general the film was working best for the comedic moments for me. The only thrilling moment in terms of drama that had me on the edge of my seat was when the former maid was walking down this long path and we had no idea what was coming. Maybe people also liked this film so much because you never knew what would happen next and if for example the family was capable of killing the two rich guys (and their kids) in order to experience wealth for years to come. They are ruthless, but are they criminals? Up to you to decide and it is all subjective. Also interesting to see their confidence rise when early on they don't do anything against the guy almost peeing right into their home, but later on they are ready to attack him. So yes, it as an interesting movie that felt shorter than it actually was, but I still must say it was not a great watch and the awards attention is just too much, also for the cast, or basically for the one guy who gets all the acting praise here (the father I think). Still go see this one, just don't go in it with great expectations. I give it a thumbs-up and I am curious to see how it fares at the Golden Globes 2020 that are just about to start five minutes from now."

Why the little boy (Park Da-song) have special sense in smell with all of them and Why was he so wild in the beginning and calm and good later on? Why did the father (Kim Ki-taek) have an odor that smells so bad that it couldn't be disguised or washed off?

","It is unclear what the main message of the film is and who should be called ""Parasite."" As the film constantly makes us feel sorry for the poor family, let us first suppose that the rich family members are considered as parasites, and we should seriously consider the problem of inequality in our society. But no, the dad was hard-working, creating jobs, spending all his available time and money with his family. The man did not abuse his employees, he did not use cheap labor, did not force anybody to work in unhealthy conditions getting huge profit in his pocket. Similarly, the mom was trying to find the best teachers available to get their kids educated, and she treated everybody well. If they had not had servants, probably the dad would have not been able to dedicate as much time to his job and not to forget about his family.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the poor family got their positions by cheating. Should they be viewed as parasites then? I don't also think so. They continued to work hard despite all the difficulties they met. They get their job done: the car was clean and driven smoothly, the favorite dishes were cooked, so what's the problem? Who are we supposed to like or dislike, what is the question the filmmakers arise?<br/><br/>Also, the movie has some problems with the plot and redundant scenes. It is unclear how a family who lived in a filthy apartment, was not able even to fold boxes became a group of good servants for an upper-class family by doing so naive and straightforward tricks. Why did the director even decide to introduce the scene when they were getting less money because they were not able to fold boxes? What does it add to the film except for the plot holes? He could have just portrayed them as diligent but poor people so that they could have perceived as more positive characters."

","9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.<br/><br/>As expected, this film is good.

However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.<br/><br/>The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.<br/><br/>A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.<br/><br/>It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."
"softsofa","5","57","160","29 August 2019"," Starts off great , then heads into the weeds.
","This film begins as a comedy until halfway through when it becomes a heavy-handed drama. How? By making the characters act out of character.<br/><br/>Up until that point, the characters have been living by their wits. Their con of the rich family is subtle and smart. Then for no reason other than the need for a plot flip, they become stupid.<br/><br/>The key moment occurs when a video leads to blackmail. However, the people being blackmailed have a completely obvious response. They can reveal the blackmailer's spouse, who is hiding from desperate trouble.<br/><br/>At the same time, the thing they're being blackmailed for is minor and the characters as presented would have a good chance of talking their way out of it. Instead, they totally ignore the obvious which leads to the ludicrous second half of the movie.<br/><br/>The comedy is now over. Instead of the self-evident continuation of the ""blackmailer's spouse"" dilemma, which would have provided the director's social commentary using a comedy angle, the film reverses direction. The film has the same social commentary as before, but through tragedy and violence.<br/><br/>By the end, everything good has gone bad. The Director tries to slightly mitigate it by having a character fantasize about a future that character could never achieve. All in all, a real downer of a movie due to that ending occurring because the obvious is ignored."
"peeedeee-94281","3","32","84","24 October 2019"," What's that bad smell? Unfortunately the bad script and mediocre directing.
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I didn't read too much about it, but watching the trailer and having seen this director's previous work 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', I was expecting something in the horror/sci-fi genre. But that's not what this movie was.
Sadly, whatever message the director Joon Ho Bong was trying to convey, it was lost in the tonally uneven mess of a script and direction, that starts off as a light hearted comedy, but then drags down into a dark and depressing disaster.
When the movie starts, we are shown a working class (more more like poor) family, the Kims, who seem to be hard on their luck. We see they work together folding pizza boxes (i don't see how the fumigated boxes were still good), to earn a few bucks.
Anyway, luck falls upon them when a friend of their son hooks him up with a sweet tutoring gig at the home of the Parks. And as the movie progresses, the members of the Kim family slowly insert themselves into aspects of the Parks lives.
Now, I think the intention was to portray this as some sort of social commentary and class struggle. But it definitely doesn't come across like this at all. All we see is The Kim family using tricks and deception to get their way, while the wealthy Park family, while a little naive, is portrayed as actually fairly nice. They don't mistreat any of their workers, they don't even do background checks on the Kim family (who are masquerading as non-related individuals). The father seems to be hard working, but is willing to take time off, along with the whole family, to take the young son out camping for his birthday.
The movie then takes a dark turn when we find out the husband of the previous maid was living in the basement of the home. Not as a prisoner, but of his own choice, to evade the law. Now, this turn of events is NOT a twist. I was expecting the twist to be more like it turns out the original architect/owner was locked down there, and the Park family was also a bunch of imposters.
Anyway, this movie devolves into scenes of violence where the Park father is killed, and really, I don't get why he had to die. His only crime was he didn't like a particular smell. It wasn't a metaphor for poor people, because poor people probably don't like smelly people either. It just seemed like the whole basement bunker/garden bloodbath was shoehorned in for the little 'twist' ending where we see the lights flickering on and off in the house because that's where the murderous Kim father chose to hide.
The whole movie premise was just bad, one dimensional characters who we never learn anything about, so we don't feel any sympathy, except maybe for the Park family who were too nice for their own good.
This movie really doesn't deserve the high praise it's been getting. It's a clumsy effort that doesn't execute it's themes very well. I just gave it a 3 because it's pretty to look at and some of the dialogue was funny. But as a whole, it's an unrewarding experience to sit through."

That the members of the family could be SO sharp as to insert itself brilliantly into a rich household but couldn't figure out how to get out of a dump where it's desperate for free wi-fi makes no sense. One minute they can't fold a pizza box and the next minute they're the best English and art teachers on the planet. None of the characters had any appeal, and I didn't care what happened to any of them.

","Director Bong Joon Ho directed, wrote the screenplay and produced PARASITES. He deserved all the four Oscars that his film and he collected. There is something Tarantino-like about his style, in the way that he presents intersecting individuals from different social strata with apparently comic but definitely violent ultimate consequences. However, he is more polished than Tarantino was at the same age, and stage in his career.<br/><br/>He presents reality without judging: the Kims are a family of jobless and largely useless individuals who do not even know how to fold pizza boxes properly, who have no money for Wi-Fi, and find it only in a toilet in the strangest place in a house that I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The father - superbly played by Kang-ho Song - claims to have a plan but ultimately admits that the sole plan that won't fail is no plan. He tries to adapat to situations and is quick to react to any opportunity.<br/><br/>The mother is admirably played by Hye-jin Jang, a courageous and resilient fighter in the face of life's adversities, and a fantastic imitator of North Korean leaders' speech delivery styles.<br/><br/>Sun Kyun-Lee plays the son, a likeable young man who forges a university degree and copies a more successful friend's example, which will ultimately weigh him down like the rock that the friend gives him.<br/><br/>His sister, the extremely beautiful So-dam Park, is the most level-headed and intelligent of the lot, a quick thinker who has a touch for children,<br/><br/>The son finds a job as a teacher of English in a rich home run by a father who is often away on business in Paris, and a completely useless but physically gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo (lovely legs!)<br/><br/>By first pulling in his sister to placate and teach painting to the bolshy child in the rich family, and then finding jobs in the household for his father and mother, the son gets the family's foot in the door to a world of wealth such as they had never imagined, and which they rapidly start wishing they could occupy. Needless to say, that can only be achieved with violence, and violence does indeed beget violence, but there are surprises along the way.<br/><br/>Acting is of the highest standard by all, but I would like to single out Jeong-eun Lee as the governess who is allergic to peaches, who keeps her husband hidden in the rich house's basement. The sequences where she rings the bell during the torrential rain, and where she tries to open the passage to the basement are unique and memorable.<br/><br/>Cinematography is immaculate, with memorable sequences like the flood in the poorer sections of town -- in contrast with the safety in the higher grounds occupied by the rich; the scramble for the cell phone before a video can be sent from it; and the overhead shot of Kang-ho Song running into hiding after stabbing the rich homeowner.<br/><br/>Credible and gripping screenplay, fantastic action sequences. Completely deserved Best Picture Academy Award."

"alindsay-al","10","6","11","14 February 2020"," An Epic Truly Special Film
","This is a film that has been in the news lately as it picked up 4 Oscars including Best Director & Best Picture which is huge for a non english speaking film. I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that.
Main Character
Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout.
Supporting Characters
Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film.
Story
The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on.
Script
The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching.
Style
First of all lets mention that obviously this film has subtitles, this should not be something to worry about as it is fine and the film is so strong that it doesn't matter. Okay this film has a bit of everything in a stylistic way, it looks great and has bits of comedy, thriller, drama & horror, it is a perfect blend that keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited to see what comes next.
Overall
Overall, this is one of the best films I have seen in the last few years, it just has a bit of everything to it and was well worthy of its Best Picture win at the Oscars. If you are put off by foreign films and reading subtitles, don't be as this is a truly special film that has to be seen to truly appreciate just how good it really is."
"MandAandM","7","6","11","4 January 2020"," Solid overall, but some flaws that make it less than amazing
","The entire basement characters arc felt almost dissatisfying just existing. This includes everything from the tacked on morse code shenanigans, to the being held hostage by a damn camera phone. I really would love to watch a version of this movie's plot where the basement just doesn't exist, and focus on the 2 primary families intriguing plot line."
"payzillee","6","8","16","16 February 2020"," Overrated but worth one watch
","I enjoyed this film but I don't think it's the masterpiece that critics have made it out to be. I didn't get the numerous multiple genres from this that others have claimed it has. It's effectively a crime flick with a poor family conning a rich family with some social commentary thrown in. I suppose the ending is a bit more thriller/horror.<br/><br/>The story is entertaining enough, some of the imagery is lovely and it's well acted. See it but don't expect it to be the best film of the year."

","Parasite is unique and manically engaging with humour, it doesn't all work though.<br/><br/>Another reviewer captured it right, in saying it's lacking of human spirit. Unlike that person I like the film, but I do agree with that. Yeo-jeong Jo's good as the house wife, but the Kim Ki-Jung character's ineffective and her mother unlikable. I don't buy that Kim Ki-taek and Kim Chung-sook could actually fill these job roles at this time, more so the mother. Plus the guy living in the basement and the Morse code, quite stupid and the resolution well it's weak. It's obvious the father will be in the basement, after fleeing the incident and Kim Ki-woo just isn't going to go from the slums to earning enough money to buy this place."

There wasn't one character that was even the slightest bit relatable and the plot was absolutely over the top unrealistic.

"Cinematic_Bullshit","7","17","42","27 August 2019"," Suspenseful, but...
","Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.<br/><br/>You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.<br/><br/>Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.<br/><br/>And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."
"steve-care","9","7","14","13 December 2019"," Bong-Kers! But in a great way!
","The hype around Parasite has been huge, and the more i read about it, the more i wanted to see it. A couple of my friends had seen it and knowing they know what i like, urged me not to wait until Feb for its UK Release, but to try and see a preview. Luckily enough, there was a preview at Curzon Mayfair in London this week with director and lead actor introducing it and i managed get a ticket. I
can safely say its the best money i have ever invested in watching a film.<br/><br/>The best way to see this is not to know anything about it and try to avoid the spoilers which i managed to do. The Tag line on the poster ""act like you own the place"" had me intrigued, but having seen the film, it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>Its basically a home invasion movie that has a lot of laughs at the start but then turns very dark. The story is very cleverly told and all the cast act their socks off. There are some real surprises/shocks along the way, but all make the film more entertaining.<br/><br/>Can clearly see why it won the Palme D'or at Cannes, ive seen nothing like it, its in my top 3 of the year and i cannot wait to see it again. Have to say its best to see with a big crowd, as the laughs and gasps that come along the way make it even more enjoyable."

"alexpitt-345-971699","9","5","9","14 February 2020"," Parasite - Movie Review
","I have now seen Parasite twice, and this rewatch was after finding out that it is officially the Best Picture winner for 2020. Do I think the film deserved it over titles such as 1917 or Marriage Story? No, absolutely not. I actually think the film is slightly overrated, but it's still great nonetheless.<br/><br/>Parasite is quite clearly structured into three definitive acts, and they all feel very different from one another. My favourite is definitely act two, followed closely by act three, and then the first act falling behind by quite away. That's the section of the film that really lets it down for me.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; it's definitely not bad, but it's also not quite the masterpiece that a lot of people are making it out to be. I just found that the first act of this movie was extremely repetitive, because they just showed how each of the family members worked their way inside of the house. If this whole section was shortened by about 10 minutes, it would flow a lot better and I would like it a whole lot more.<br/><br/>There are also several logic problems that I had an issue with at the end of the film. However, I don't want it to sound like I don't like Parasite, because I actually think it's a fantastic film and the whole second act is masterfully done. It's full of tension, laughs, excitement, a heart-pounding score, and moments that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Overall, Parasite is absolutely a must-watch, but it's far from the film of the decade which a number of other people are making it out to be.<br/><br/>SCORE: 86%"
"just_in_case","9","5","9","14 February 2020"," The hype is justified.
","I'm a little biased in that I've seen all of Bong Joon-ho's movies and have a heart for Korean cinema in general, but I can say without bias that this movie delivers on the hype. I'll be honest I was avoiding this as I kinda knew going in it was probably going to be depressing and horrifying. There's a running theme in the cinephile community that Korea has it's genre of film, unique unto itself. In Hollywood, films often go through 5 or more drafts that start with big amorphic ideas and edge closer toward crowd pleasing sometimes until they're just 90 minute commercials for the lead actors career. Korean film seems to lack that filter of cost X audience X test screening -+ = blah blah blah. They take big ridiculous ideas and drive them towards the powerful nebulous first draft finish line no matter how emotional draining or traumatic. In a word, Korean cinema can be very ""dark"".<br/><br/>Bong Joon-ho has a special talent for creating 4 dimensional characters, larger than the circumstances in the film and when the payoff comes for them it's likely to cause heart palpitations.<br/><br/>Parasite is a film about grifters who invade a rich family's home, but this is no simple film about ""Oh no when will the family figure them out!?"". This is far bigger and far more shocking. Obviously it's an amazing movie. This little blurb is more here to be a warning. Gird your heart strings when heading into this."
"aram81","9","5","9","27 November 2019"," Mr. Bong has concocted a first-rate black comedy
","Bong Joon-Ho, the writer and director of Snowpiercer, a dystopian Science fiction film about class divisions, tackles the same subject matter with his black comedy Parasite. The film centers on two families of four, on the opposite ends of the economic spectrum. Through the lens of comedy, Bong makes some socially poignant statements . He shows that not all rich people are cunning and not all poor people are dumb, lazy or unambitious. And he also shows that so much of life really comes down to chance and luck. You can plan all you want but life has a knack of throwing curveballs at you. And that is exactly what Bong does. The picture starts off as a simple comedy about class divisions, then, as it progresses, Bong throws one curveball after another. Ironically, as the film becomes more serious and violent, it also becomes a whole lot more funnier. An emotional roller-coaster of a movie. If there is one issue I have with the film, is that it may be a bit too long. I think it could have been edited a little better, because there are moments where the film does drag a bit. But that is a minor issue, in an otherwise excellent film, that is better than any American picture I have seen so far."

","The comparison of the poor Kim family to parasites is not clear from the beginning. Their underground ""apartment"" does stink and yes, bad enough, they have to look at a drunken guy pee in front of them during dinner. No job, no hope, no direction, the bland and quiet acceptance of their status quo at the beginning makes me wonder how they resonate with the film title.<br/><br/>However, step by step, through perfect acting schemes, the well thought out ploys, they make a dream of living off of the Parks come true, thereby transforming themselves into parasites. Throughout the period when they enjoy the ""improving"" living standards: from eating in the dungeon to a treat dinner with the drivers, to the actual pizzas whose boxes they were making to earn bread and butter, etc. All this time I struggle with the heartbreaking fact that at least three parties (1) the Parks (2) the previous driver (3) the previous maid were all innocently suffering from the Kims' wrongdoing. The lack of apologetic thinking is absolutely horrifying. Yet when the class difference is so drastic, I am not sure whether they are too be judged. After all what other options do they have, without a morally sound means to access anything else other than their smelly dungeon? It only became more intense when the previous maid showed her true parasitic self, together with her husband.<br/><br/>""Money is an almighty iron that straightens out all wrinkles"" - on the surface yes, but it is exactly this dangerous, monotonic pursuit of money, and money only, that has cost three families their chance to make peace with what is given.<br/><br/>""People with money are always nice."" It sounds almost absurd and I can think of millions of counterexamples, yet the director sets the story up exactly this way in the film. I think I dare thinking outside of the film context, it is rather that ""the people who do not have money sometimes cannot afford to be nice."" Either way, when the cutoff of wealth is base-line subsistence, it is clear that dignity is at risk.<br/><br/>What is the dad's plan? It sounds like a family who are so good at planning ""scenes"" to act out in fact have not a clue about planning long term for their lives. Is planning also out of reach for a lot of the poor? It turns a bit positive when the boy sets himself a goal to one day make enough money to buy that mansion, but is that enough? Or is it rather another episode of self-deceiving wishful thinking only?"

","Film does not have a mouthwatering end or twist to cover up the slow and quite obvious build up. Story line is quite simple and nothing really boastful is out there. There are films made before and will make after this on the same story line.<br/><br/>Film is categorized in Comedy category but it does not have any justifiable point to prove it belongs to that category. Comedy is visible only in some here and there scenes and actors/actresses really failed to maximize the comedy factor. Story line and acting both should be responsible for average comedy in the film.<br/><br/>Camera Direction seems to be a quite successful area in the film. Director has managed to capture some really nice angles and views to catalyst the current scene. Final scene where camera comes down through a window of snow can be cited as an example.<br/><br/>Costumes are pretty good and did not actually disturbed the viewer to immerse mentally into the fictional scenes. The chosen luxury house is also great and it always have that rich cliche in it. Fantastic work by the directors to nail that location.<br/><br/>I am 50% alright with the movie but it is average in the sense of story line and acting. Its average guys not poor so jump in and see it for yourselves. It would not be a waste of money for sure. Entertainment wise I m not sure everyone will enjoy it like a 10 star movie."

","Apart from Hollywood I like seeing International movies, Iranian, Korean, French, German etc. movies<br/><br/>Parasite movie came into news because it won Oscar for best movie. It is the first foreign movie to win the top most prize. With that came the comparison and allegation that it is a remake of a Tamil movie - Minsara Kanna.<br/><br/>May be the plot of the movie is taken from Minsara Kanna, but the story is totally different. In Tamil movie which is a comedy - the story is about winning the family of a rich girl whom the poor hero loves, and he brings each member of his family to do a job (similar to Parasite movie) in the girl's family, and there is a happy ending.<br/><br/>Whereas in the South Korean movie Parasite is about class divide, the poor family slowly plots to be part of rich family and in the end there is gory violence where the poor family kills off the rich family.<br/><br/>I have seen the Tamil movie and I was interested to see the South Korean movie with all the buzz and good reviews it garnered.<br/><br/>The Director Bong Joon Ho - has built the sets of houses for both the poor family living down town dirty and dingy basement and rich family living uptown spacious luxurious bungalow.<br/><br/>The poor family are shown cunning, smart, clever and shrewd and the rich family people are shown stupid, dumb and ignorant. As the movie progresses - each member of poor family finds a way in the rich family household by forging documents, and sweet talks.<br/><br/>The internet is so full with stuff on how the director has taken pain in comparatively portraying small details of poor and rich life styles on the celluloid.<br/><br/>The Director also insists on watching the movie without subtitles.<br/><br/>Some audiences who may be jealous of rich people - laughed at the way rich people are fooled by poor people. (sour grapes - Inequity and income gap disparity syndrome) But the movie could not drawn a little bit of smirk on my face.
Critics who have lauded this movie say it is rise of socialism against crony corrupt capitalism.<br/><br/>The Director Bong has made a stupid movie marketing it as an intelligent thriller, and those who are liking it - makes us doubt today world's sanity. People who rave about this movie must be mentally ""sick"" people.They are the real parasites of this world - and not the rich or poor which the director intends to show here.<br/><br/>The acting is not good. Th plot and twists are so convenient and predictably dumb. Forcibly inserted vulgarity and terrible violence at the end just to juxtapose the lethargy of a third rate scripting and film-making.<br/><br/>The Tamil movie was bad, but the South Korean movie is worse.<br/><br/>Anyways - the Director Bong Joon Ho - is smiling on grabbing 241 awards internationally and 4 Oscars. The times we live in...!<br/><br/>I go with 3 out of 10 rating."

"msbreviews","10","6","12","16 February 2020"," Better late than never... Parasite is as brilliant as I've been told. One of 2019's best.
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.<br/><br/>In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!<br/><br/>It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.<br/><br/>There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.<br/><br/>It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That's one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won's screenplay is excellent.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I'm actually surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It's tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.<br/><br/>Technically, I don't have any defects to point out. It's one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I'm in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it's always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it's more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre's flicks nowadays.<br/><br/>All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It's one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it's written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything's absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it's in a foreign language. Please, don't make such an awful mistake...<br/><br/>Rating: A+"

The film is based on an impeccable direction, colorful and intriguing with a cast, as in a Cluedo-game, they are all perfectly characterized to ensure that the viewer never ceases to look intrigued at the work presented to him. Parasite proposes itself as a satirical film about a society that many times looks down on and beyond the impeccable narrative for cinematic pleasure, it offers us food to think on where we are going as a human race."

none of the major characters is likable - much less heroic; no one succeeds or even grows. every character is amoral. one small example out of dozens: a young man going overseas to college gifts our penniless protagonist a job tutoring a wealthy 15-year-old girl in return for the promise to keep her away from dating til the student returns from overseas and the girl turns 18. our hero without a moment of hesitation betrays his friend and starts a romance with his student.
i read that ""get out"" originally ended with the hero dying, that jordan peele added the rescue after preliminary focus groups said they hated the movie. parasite feels to me a horror movie like ""get out"" without the redemptive ending. or think ""inglorious basterds"" without the redemptive ending."

What a shame that Kim Ki-Duk the great Korean director has never won an Oscar, and this patchwork has.
All the high-class characters are just humane, and all the low-class ones are corrupt. I'm very surprised reading in reviews and criticisms that this film was leftist or critical about capitalism and inequality in any way. It wasn't. The message is the old high-class commonplace that wealth makes you noble, and poverty ignoble. No question about whether creating such inequalities, wealth, and poverty systematically was noble or ignoble. It's just natural condition, y'know, that's life, a great struggle with winners and losers. The happy end of the film is that one of the parasites finally decides to make money, so everything will be solved.
I'm afraid that this message was the reason why the brave new winner people loved this movie so much, and also why they have all misunderstand it."

The acting is cartoony (perhaps it's supposed to be), the plot downright silly although I would say it had some originality and overall it just seemed pretty poor.

","With a fantastic cast, fabulous sense of direction, and a truly wild sense of storytelling, Parasite checks all the right boxes for a best picture winner, and proves to be something truly new, by also relying on things found familiar. The main cast is truly spectacular, with Kang-Ho Song and Cho Yeo-jeong providing for the best of the supporting performances. The dialogue is rich and relatable, and the humor in the film is well executed and surprisingly often. The film's pacing is by far one of its most brilliant remarks, with you never truly feeling bored throughout the almost 2 and a half hour runtime, and thoroughly entertained without. The film simply never stops, it doesn't shy away from different styles and genres of storytelling, but embraces them as one story and does it so cleanly, it truly is quite impressive. The cinematography is outstanding, with some truly beautiful visuals and captivating points of view. Though there are many interesting twists and turns that you may never truly see coming, the film can be a bit predictable at times with certain situations, and makes the film seem slightly less special in doing so. In the end however, Parasite is yet another brilliant work from Director Bong Joon-Ho and is one of, if not, the best work he has made to date.

","Parasite seizes our expectations, breaks them down, builds them up, and knocks them down once more.
This Korean masterclass assumes no clear genre, refusing to pigeonhole its ambition.
Straddling the line between comedy, thriller, and horror, the production presents the conceptual 'parasite' as the underlying motif; it's a profound, tragic social commentary on classism as much as it is a satirical, sardonic throwaway remark on a parasite and its host.
Decorated with multidimensional metaphors, signs and symbols, it would be criminal to not have a second or even third viewing to fully soak up Bong Joo-ho's flavoursome visual poetry.<br/><br/>Should you laugh or cry? Take sides, or simply observe the events unfold? In taking no clear stance does this movie most thrive.
In stirring and string-pulling every capacity of human emotion while dodging the clichés does it tantalise the audience like few other productions have.<br/><br/>While slow in places, and with an occasional plothole, this was overall a gorgeously shot, satisfyingly unpredictable slice of thoughtful motion picture entertainment; presenting a particularly dark blend of black comedy.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

"tuanskie","5","7","15","23 February 2020"," Meh, Ok
","I've watched South Korean films most of my adult life. Films such as ""The Way Home"", ""The Handmaiden"", and ""Train to Busan"" are indeed great within their respective genres, and are testaments to South Korea's rising acclaim in world cinema. Parasite is not on the same level as the aforementioned titles. Instead it is quite typical of mediocre SK movies - choppy, childish at moments, and the dialogue isn't highly cerebral. It wasn't great nor was it bad. I'm not sure what all the hype was about with regards to it deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture either. I think people in the United States simply haven't seen enough SK movies to truly appreciate the breadth of cinematic entertainment that SK has to offer. Perhaps with Parasite, it must be the novelty of glorifying criminality in a very conservative society that's piqued critics' and American viewers' interests. Yet, this concept is nothing new in SK films."
"MovieCriticOnline","3","14","36","11 February 2020"," Wait, what? This won the best film?
","Let's see. Some of the previous best films of the year: The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Terms of Endearment, Dances with Wolves, Schindler's List, Gladiator, American Beauty are some Oscar winners, but lately, it's been meritless films that won the accolades based on social justice.<br/><br/>It's the decline of Hollywood that has become infested with SJWs. Surprisingly the SJWs weren't upset over Koreans dressing as Native Americans.<br/><br/>Personally I thought JoJo Rabbit was the best of the year, but I honestly didn't see any film in 2019 that was worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>Here, we have an extremely unlikely family of con artists that takes a whole hour to get to anything dramatic. Was it somewhat fun? Sure, but miles away from winning the best film of the year. Are we really going to look back at this in 30 years and claim it as a classic? Not a chance.<br/><br/>It was fairly predictable. We knew the honeymoon wasn't going to last very long, I just wish it started earlier. It is also an example that plot-driven movies are never as good as character-driven movies because once you know the ending it's not that interesting to watch again.<br/><br/>It just felt a lack of focus and direction and seems to be 5 different ideas into one film. Also, I didn't buy some of the extreme clumsiness and carelessness. It was just too bizarre to win the best film.<br/><br/>They just don't make films like they used to and that is a shame.<br/><br/>On a side note, Parasite reminds me of another undeserving Oscar winner, SIlence of the Lambs, which was at best a mediocre crime/horror film, a notch above a TV film, but I think it won because it was up against a few not so great films, with the exception of JKF, which I guess should have won considering the competition. Thelma and Louise should have won but wasn't nominated for best picture. 1991 wasn't a great year for films."

"frankelee","5","10","24","15 February 2020"," It's Baby's First Social Commentary! But Give Those Who Rave About It Some Slack
","This movie strongly reminded me of several different things as I watched it, the first was American Beauty. A film with a strong experiential component that is not matched by its actual message or ""literary"" value, and as such overrated in the moment and forgotten with time. Parasite is a very well composed and executed film, in terms of emotional engagement with the story and characters it gets you all dressed up and it's easy to feel as if you must have had somewhere to go. But you didn't.<br/><br/>The second was 'Let the Right One In'. That was a good movie that was basically rated 2 stars higher than it deserved by everyone in the United States because it had subtitles. Exotic and slightly more challenging to watch is easily conflated with quality by people who aren't especially self-perceptive in their thinking. Had Let the Right One In been in English and set in New York, well, the dumb and silly parts would have just seemed dumb and silly, and it would have had to stand entirely on its own quality, and not an imagined quality. Parasite is the same way. If it starred four American actors trying to get jobs as household help in LA, people would be quite meh about it. Actually given the nature of the plot, I think most people in America currently giving it a 10 would probably be a little insulted by screwball comedy plot that simultaneously seems to fawn over its own profundity, and would give it a lower rating than my 5 stars.<br/><br/>And third, this movie can't help but make me think of America's original class conscious, degenerately poor sitcom family, the Bundys from Married with Children. They even match by character: the intelligent but lame son, the beautiful but still poor sister who connives to get what she wants, the dead-eyed father crushed by life, and the ball-busting mother who really doesn't make anyone feel better. Just like the Bundy's they're comically poor while placed in a real life setting where anyone with their talents, willingness to work, and lack of any significant vices means they would at worst be regular poor. And probably decently well off.<br/><br/>They're also selectively stupid when required to be in order to make the plot work, which seems a little more forgivable in a weekly sitcom where the writers are forced to create drama dozens and dozens of times a year, but less so in a movie where they don't. The writers of Married with Children were also smarter in allowing their comedy to shoot for simply being funny, where here the slapstick situations lead to completely unfunny, dark, but still stupidly slapstick conclusions in a badly planned out gambit to give the movie ""meaning"".<br/><br/>Reading others' reviews, including some of the top ones on here, gives a good impression of why people liked this movie, as they discuss how it opened their eyes apparently to the relationship between the rich and their servants and perhaps the rich and poor in society generally. Which tells me that most of the people who really liked this film are for the most part, very inexperienced in life, and also not yet well read. I'm sure for someone with no first hand knowledge of the world and who hasn't delved into quality literature ever before, this is pretty profound stuff. It's easy to forget that if you're not just now crossing the starting line of life.<br/><br/>On the other hand, that hardly qualifies this movie as being great. If those who gave this movie a 10 are blown away by Parasite's subject matter, they need only head down to their local library and begin reading 19th century English literature to get a thousand times greater picture of what it is like for the serving poor and the separation between them and the rich. Victorian authors living in England included these basic facts of life out of course in their storylines without even meaning to have them signify some message, and if you liked that aspect of Parasite you'll quickly find the movie put to shame in its shallow depth of portrayal on the subject.<br/><br/>In the end what we really have is a dark comedy that misses it's own setup, and ends with a flailing attempt to create a message at the expense of creating a good story. It won't be the first Best Picture winner to lose its luster with every passing year as people look back upon it without hype and blindness for objective quality, but it at least is another to be added to the list.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 stars!"

You listening to their private conversation in intimate moments, reading personal diaries, lying about yourself is alright because you are poor?<br/><br/>You can't stand anybody peeing in front of your house but feel bad when your boss doesn't feel right about your smell.<br/><br/>Carrying a rock alone in that basement was really stupid.
This movie made no sense at all after second half. I'm torn that joker didn't get Oscar."

","PARASITE: The new Bong Joon-ho film that may be the best he's made and a hopeful contender for the best of the year.<br/><br/>First of, the dialogue is brilliant. With it constantly working on multiple levels, first making you understand and care about these characters, then learning dribs and drabs of their schemes and finally subtly setting up dialogue which is then brilliantly reincorporated to fuel emotional powerhouses of performances within the explosive finale. This is all whilst it being incredible natural and just out right human, there are so many instances of character inflection which tell you so much about each and every person on screen. Especially when some of the characters later in the film are playing characters themselves, lines here and there are clearly said by either themselves or the character they're pretending to be and because of their fantastic set-up, you're able to immediately tell when they're being themselves or not on the turn of a dime.<br/><br/>It manages to always perfectly balance it's comedic elements with the serious mystery thriller ones, always knowing exactly when and how to incorporate the two into the lives of the characters to create an amount of emotional connectivity to a film I haven't experience all year.<br/><br/>The political satire and themes on class struggle are too, fascinating, they're intrinsically baked into the narrative and backstory of the characters without ever being in your face or obnoxiously telling you what to think, so when they are brought up for a narrative beat or for you to get an emotional read on someone, you're free to interpret and analyse them as much or as little as you want.<br/><br/>Joon-Ho has at some points made the political ideologies a bit too apparent in his films which has come across as almost lecturous in Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013). Thankfully this has never been detrimental to the final product, but I think the political statements within Parasite are here to create a better emotional connection to these characters, rather than blatantly tell you about the political climate you already know about.<br/><br/>By making you care about all these different and unique characters and using the political themes to set the stage for the story, when the themes on class struggle come to a head within the narrative you for one actually care about them because they're affecting character's you understand and like, and secondly they're then far more interesting to delve into and think about because the film never asked you too.<br/><br/>Even if you were to purely watch this without wanting to think about social satire, it's still an unbelievable film. It takes you on a mysterious thrill ride with some of the most interesting and unique characters put to screen this decade, the story goes to places you would never dream it would, and the soundtrack will be stuck in your head for days after you see it. It's a mile a minute masterpiece from one of the most exceptional auteur directors working today and was more than worthy of taking the Palme d'Or - 10/10"
"alikemal","5","5","10","22 March 2020"," One of the most overrated films of the decade
","Kim family members are intelligent yet very poor. They somehow persuades rich ""Parks family ""into entering their home as servants, housekeepers etc. Kim family starts to suck blood from ""Parks family"" Because Parks family is so rich they have already been exploiting poor families for years. So they deserve it completely.<br/><br/>Kim family tries to be rich at the expense of others, but it is OK. They are poor, they are victims of the system, so they have right to do that. They make other poor people lose their jobs. They don't waste their time and immediately starts drinking alcohol and having a big feast in the ""host"" family's house.<br/><br/>Joking aside, why do some people refuse to criticize Kim family's greed. They already got one good job, why not stop? Let the others benefit too. They get other jobs by defaming previous employees.<br/><br/>I am not a great fan of ""Parks family"", but am I supposed to hate them. What's wrong with them. They are just rich and extremely gullible. They even help other families by giving jobs, they don't make them work like slaves.<br/><br/>By the way, at the end the man from the poor family kills the man from the rich family because the rich guy hates the poor he even thinks they smell bad. (God, can you imagine that? How can a man be that evil?)<br/><br/>The film which deserves this year's Oscar is definitely ""Joker"" which truly depicts a man who is systematically and unceasingly ignored and looked down on. It is the real critic of greedy and selfish society.<br/><br/>Parasite got Oscar because it is an Asian movie. Joker didn't get Oscar because it is so American. It is even part of DC comics, so that makes it definitely not Oscar-worthy. The academy wanted to show they care about rest of the world and other cultures. (which is good in theory.), but art should be universal regardless of director's gender, race, or culture."

","The movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar."

","This movie is fantastic!<br/><br/>The name of the film pertains to our ""main characters"" in the film as well as two others we meet later on.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on for this film in terms of the political and societal commentary it utilizes. We see with the opening the setup of this, as the main family is impoverished and is literally living at the lowest level without being underground. They struggle to retain what most would consider basic necessity nowadays like wifi, and do odd jobs to regain that and have a simple meal.<br/><br/>Fortune strikes though as their son gets an in with a rich family to tutor their young daughter, eventually working their way deeper inside until all four are working different jobs for this family.<br/><br/>All this is achieved because the mother is easily manipulated and prefers recommendations when bringing workers into their home, rather than documentation. This ties into the difference between classes.<br/><br/>However, our main families newfound means of financial potential is put in jeopardy one night when the former house cleaner returns. She rings incessantly, needing to retrieve something in the basement. Which we find out is her husband, revealing the main family is not the first to get an in with the rich family. Her husband had actually been living there for years to escape loan sharks, and was receiving food and residency unbeknownst to the family above.<br/><br/>The raised issue of these two different families leeching from the wealthier comes to a head when the rise is discovered by the former housekeeper. She and her husband are subdued and shortly after our family, save for the mother, is able to sneakily escape.<br/><br/>This leads to a brilliant scene of our family descending back into poverty. Going lower, and lower, showing just how different these two worlds are. I loved this scene. It was so clearly thought out, and it brilliantly enacted.<br/><br/>There's so much to love about this film and it deserves so much of the praise it's been getting. It's clear that Bong Joon-Ho is passionate about the work he does. Definitely give this a watch, its worth your time and money."
"RayCharles81","8","5","10","13 February 2020"," Parasite: Is there Really a Such Thing in the Human Definition?
","When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.<br/><br/>According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?<br/><br/>Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?<br/><br/>Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?<br/><br/>Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?<br/><br/>Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?<br/><br/>Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.<br/><br/>So the question again must be asked: who ""really"" is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is."

The villain is a person who stayed in another persons secret bunker that the family living there didn't know about and the housekeeper was his wife who fed him, he was doing this because he had to pay off debts and people were coming for him. A bit over the top for a movie about a struggling family who try to find work in a rich persons house by recommending each other and making sure they aren't family.

"kaidestinyz","1","8","19","27 February 2020"," Most Overrated Foreign Movie Ever. EXPLAINED!
","Anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece, is incredibly dim-witted. I'll be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast.<br/><br/>
1. Infiltrating your entire family into the rich family's house.<br/><br/>They say it's hard to cover up one lie. You know what's harder? Covering up a whole lot of them and that's what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly. All 4 family members had to fake their identity/qualifications, pretending to not be related to one another when they are, while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up. The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time.<br/><br/>
2. Kevin's best friend problem<br/><br/>Your best friend has gave you an opportunity, to earn some cash, to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad. He also tells you that he's coming back and will ask the rich's family daughter out who he was tutoring. He has specifically told you that he's interested in her. He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her, because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn't.<br/><br/>What do you think would happen, when your best friend returns. When he comes back to find out he has lost his job, had his girl stolen right under his nose by his ""best friend"", and also finds out the ""best friend"" he confided in, who has broken your utmost trust, had his entire family infiltrated the rich man's family, working under false pretenses.<br/><br/>A: Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you?
B: Expose you and your entire family?<br/><br/>Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A.<br/><br/>Anyone care to tell me? The answer is B! They would be exposed! Who would have thought about that right!?<br/><br/>
3. Dining in the rich man's house like you own the place<br/><br/>Also, with your whole family without a care in the world. Yeah, let us make a mess of this table, get the wine, get the snacks, let's leave a it load of evidences that we had a party here! Oh crap, the rich man family is coming back? Help! I left so much mess here, what do I do now?<br/><br/>
4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me thrice, guess I'm going to die.<br/><br/>Kevin, why are you such a fool? Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem. Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage.<br/><br/>Third mistake, the most fatal mistake of them all, why did even go back into the basement? You had both of them trapped under. There was no reason to go back. You wanted to redeem yourself? What did you want to do? Kill them? To silence them forever? Well, you failed miserably, caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed. I mean, of all things, you brought a rock, you even dropped that rock. C'mon. There's only so much incompetence I can tolerate from one character.<br/><br/>
I could go on and on. The rock and its supposed ""symbolism"" that doesn't exist. How the ending went down, the absurd morse code. But I'm tired, tired of people over glorifying, thinking this is masterpiece when it isn't, of people explaining the ""hidden meaning"" of symbolism in different scenes that doesn't exist. Like how going up the stars means ascending in social status, how Jessica sits on sofa because she had a higher social status. How the toilet being the highest point in the house is supposedly a symbolism.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't actually think the movie was all that bad. But grossly overrated. Definitely not deserving of any Oscars that it has.<br/><br/>If you think otherwise, you've been factually proven wrong."
"thebeeteekay","2","8","19","19 February 2020"," sooo bad that it is good?
","Parasite is a rare movie -
the kind of movie that compels one to sit and admire.........the hype around it.
the film maker had faith in the audience's stupidity levels to appreciate whatever garbage he felt like throwing in the movie.
I saw this movie back in October 2019, much before its hype and while the first half of the movie is intriguing, it takes a downward spiral after that with its foolish plot.
*Spoilers*
mix of cliche / indigestible scenarios e.g. infiltrator family becomes uncannily cunning and smart as they take up one job after the other.
a man staying in the basement, for years, unnoticed.
infiltrator family's overboard feast while the owners are away, and guess what? home owners return right at the moment (who could have predicted that!).
the people living in the basement using morse codes via a light bulb for looong messages, but the owners never bothering to fix the light bulb.
and then there is the climax scene with killings... purely weird, unbelievable and nonsensical.<br/><br/>While overall the movie is ok, esp in the first half, but it definitely doesn't deserve the attention that its getting. This is explained in director's interview where he says he spent 2-3 years on writing the first half..... and the second half and especially the climax, he wrote in 2-3 months as if he was possessed (high IMO).
Such an attention is a disgrace to the other good movies out there over all these years that never got nominated/won an oscar. Its a dark joke on other movies."

"ferni-tierni","10","3","5","17 March 2020"," Analysis/Opinion: How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances?
","The vague incisions that are carved in your mind as you navigate through the elusive metaphors within the movie become clearer as the plot develops and unwillingly grips you with a truly unique plot, charismatic characters, sagacious dialogue, and unexpected events that last from beginning to end. The complexity of the plot resists in helping you answer questions like: Who has the higher moral standpoint? Who deserves to get the upper hand? Is the Kim family truly malevolent? If you were in their position would you do the same? Do you feel compassion and sympathy for Ki-Taek even after killing Mr. Park?<br/><br/>The movie accomplishes a feat that most movies nowadays are not able to: every single character is complex enough to merit forgiveness, understanding, and redemption. One character, despite all the deficits and obstacles, is attempting to survive to be able to get an education, wealth, and prestige, be secure financially and equally valuable as the Park family is; he is trying not to be a parasite. Another character is freer and careless, even self-destructive, acceptant of that fate that life has bestowed her. A bit more lost, but ultimately only guilty of attempting to have enough money to help the family. In the entire movie you cannot find a single instance of sadism or even malevolence from any of the ""parasites"". They are fervently trying to survive and equipped with sufficient cunning to achieve their goals and can you blame them?<br/><br/>After an hour of receiving the earnest nature of the message of parasite, I recognized that the movie is not particularly expressing a message about meritocracy. If there is a central element of this movie it is social mobility or the lack thereof. The Kim family was attempting to survive, yes; they deserved better circumstances, maybe, but their main juncture was the fact that they are attempting to progress and elevate themselves in the social hierarchy: social mobility. Anyone with a modicum of empathy can empathize with the ruthless suffering of the lower class or underrepresented = the Kim family. The director tries to demonstrate in creative forms the insensitivity of the wealthy class to the precarious nature of the poor. The movie is basically a metaphor of class struggle with comedic, dramatic, and violent gestures.<br/><br/>How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances? This is, in straightforward terms, the dilemma of the movie. I am going to be your parasite, because you do not respect me nor help me, quite the contrary: you think I'm lesser than you, dirtier than you, and smellier than you. As a parasite I will inhabit your body and nourish myself taking advantage of you, while possibly murdering you. It's a harsh message, but a real one. Many people are living in untenable conditions, while the wealthy class excuse themselves with meritocracy while they enjoy their opulence.<br/><br/>In the movie as the Kim family understands the crude reality of social mobility they eventually become desperate, violent, and homicidal. The inhumane elitism of the Park family becomes more apparent even after traumatic situations happen. This is one of the morals of the narrative. Elitism will usually triumph against the working class and the myth of social mobility proliferated in class struggle might have to be debunked with bloodshed and imagination. There is a line in the movie that expresses the other moral really well: ""If I had all this money and freedom, I would probably be a good person. Heck, I would probably be a much better person than Ms. Park"". Finally, Ki-Taek reflection after escaping the flooded house is the last moral of the movie: ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."" In this case, Ki-Taek reflects on his situation and tries to justify his failure by habituating his son to a life of no strategy, plan or ambition. He wants his son to love him, but in his desperation he is also habituating him to failure: make them believe that chaos and degeneracy is their only option, and they will attempt to live happily within their exploitation."
"ronansilke","10","3","5","8 March 2020"," Absolutely incredible.
","I've never been moved by a movie more than this. At times I was shouting at he screen and pulling my hair, practically jumping out of my seat. If you have ever wanted to know how to build tension in a movie in a subversive way, this would be the guide.
Don't even get me started on the cinematography, either. From the physical symbolism to the beautiful shots and angles the composition was majestic in a way. Like watching a master hunter track and slaughter it's pray, the viewer, who is completely unaware of what is about to unfold.
Not to mention the statement it's making about the class pyramid. The ending illuminates that part of the film perfectly; it feels as though it all comes together then. The story, the statement, the cinematography, and the symbolism. It all creates that beautiful ending that helps the audience truly piece it all together.<br/><br/>What a masterpiece"

","Oscars best picture, Cannes winner, lauded and acclaimed, and a good and engaging film from beginning to ending. Good in most respects but mainly it has a catchy hook. An engaging premise. A peculiarity in its treatment of subject and theme.<br/><br/>I would not agree that such novelty of idea makes, by itself, for an award winning finished film and certainly in this case I am fairly confident that the film as a whole is much less than the ""vigor"" of its animating conceit; it's 'reason to be' (made).<br/><br/>Ancient issues of human inequality of life invested with a catchy and up to date arrangement is a neat idea, hardly groundbreakingly original in world cinema, but it's a neat idea.<br/><br/>Essentially a pursuit, in dramatic film, of the degree to which ""upstairs-downstairs"" conditions the life choices, circumstances and outlooks of people caught on opposite sides, how it warps and differentiates lives lived to ultimately decide whole human lives without their own input.<br/><br/>This ""have and have nots"" and ""how the other half lives"" drama is not new and indeed it has precursors in western and eastern film and broader fiction.<br/><br/>The manner of this drama is in two stages: firstly the ingratiating ""invasion"" of the rich households retinue by the Kim family; eventually completely usurping the established retainers and then secondly the heightening of the old household staff reappearing and ultimately revolting against their disposition; all transpiring almost entirely under the noses, and beneath the awareness of the ""upstairs"" 'haves', the Park family.<br/><br/>That's it. That's the best idea. The enervating treatment of an old dramatic theme of rich and poor.<br/><br/>It's a good film in its runtime: reasonably written except in certain unbelievable characters and relationships; an insistence on a highly risky full assault on employment opportunities by the Kim family that I baulked at whilst watching; and a missed opportunities to illuminate the 'host' family of 'upstairs': the Parks.<br/><br/>The acting was usually reliable although few actors were required to display much range in their performance. A major problem was scenes of drinking, 'drunk' acting was unconvincing.<br/><br/>Direction and editing were certain if uninspiring. Technical virtues included a sympathetic use of sound design and a well chosen pallet of colours plus an interesting main location at the Park's house.<br/><br/>Certain limitations in writing include the Kim daughters character, who I found utterly unconvincing and unbelievabile as presented: she is intelligent, resourceful, outgoing, manipulate, skilled and also beautiful, young, female and single.....and yet none of this seems remotely relevant to the young woman we meet at the films inception...was she being kept in a freeze dried bag until the day before the narrative opens? How can she exist in her environment without these character details having very pertinently pressed upon her life?
As the film proceeds she serves to help other family characters but otherwise she is a doll in a costume after that.<br/><br/>The Kim mother is barely recognizable as a full human character with genuine characteristics and a independent life. Her marriage is seldom testified to, is it good to bad, or bad to good, how do they feel to each other and about each other, what little closenesses do they share unique to them....I dunno.
Compared to the Kim men the two females are badly nourished as characters and conspicuously so in the case of the daughter.<br/><br/>The Park's family hints having real human people in it but by the end of the film even the husband, who seems quite human at times, is left uninteresting and unconsidered. The idea that they have a real life with skeletons in cupboards was absent. Only the phrasing of the husband to relate about his main encounters with the Kim's father to his wife, with phrases about ""crossing the line"" and ""subway people"" seemed to expand their humanity.<br/><br/>There are 3 marriages featured in the film plus a teenage relationship and only the third and final couple, of the displaced housekeeper, actually seem to have a ""lived in"" married life that feels like it proceeds the story concerning the film.<br/><br/>The full attack upon maximum employment by the Kim family seemed to me to be an extremely ungainly insistence for the film to impose on my disbelief but it had to do it to develop it's plot line.<br/><br/>Finally, in passages the film hints at metaphorical depths such as its talking about ""light"", it's use of rain storms and catastrophic floods, underground dwellings and the rock ""scholars stone"". These metaphors interact with the upper class airy people and the ground dwelling lower class people: but here I would have appreciated some 'second unit' type environmental photography to tie the human story with the metaphorical levels with the films physical reality. I'd have accepted an extension of the runtime to achieve this extra footage on the edit.<br/><br/>In summation I rate at a lowish 6/10 and I would reserve my agreement that this film deserves such rewards as it has garnered for what is basically a neat idea for a particular treatment of standard themes and subject matter which is amiably delivered on screen but suffers from varied failures in execution in the writing."

Likewise, the way it tackles the social themes is so intriguing and done so extremely well even if the theme has been done many times before. The entire cast is amazing and honestly not even one of them getting a nomination for best acting is quite the robbery. Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats. Finally, the film is absolutely entertaining with the way it incorporates contrasting genres, black comedy and thriller, into one surprisingly cohesive and exhilarating movie.<br/><br/>THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

"lucy-95505","9","3","5","21 February 2020"," Incredibly powerful and detailed.
","Parasite was one of the best films of 2019. It engaged the audience by building tension slowly throughout the first half, then having everything come crashing down throughout the second half, as if in slow-motion. One of my favourite aspects of this was that, as Mr. Kim says in the latter half of the film, there was no plan to their actions. This way, the audience doesn't know what's happening until it's over, and that might suggest that the Kims don't either. Still, the rush that I felt when I figured out pieces of their plan is difficult to find in most films. Two examples of this are when Mr. Kim poured the hot sauce onto the tissue, to trick Mrs. Park into firing her housekeeper under suspicion of tuberculosis, or later in the film when they hide under the table from the Park family. I'm pretty sure I audibly gasped when Mr. Kim lifted up the tissue with 'blood' on it.
An important thing to note is that the film, though made in Korea, represents the futility of the American Dream in a way that I've never seen before. When I say 'American Dream', I mean the ideal that if you work hard enough, you can become rich and successful. Both the Kims and the Parks, I would say, are living in fantasy worlds of this ideal. The Parks believe that they've worked hard to get where they are, and therefore deserve household employees who don't smell like a basement. The Kims, on the other hand, hold the belief that working hard will someday get them where the Parks are, figuratively and literally. No one believes this more strongly than Ki-woo, the son of the Kim family. This is shown throughout the film, from even before he first gets the job as an English tutor, when he's trying to get a job with the pizza delivery driver. Once he gets the job, he believes it's his way out and he can save enough money for college. The worst part about this is that he still holds this belief at the very end of the movie, when he writes a letter (that he has absolutely no way to send) to his dad. The letter describes this exact ideal; if Ki-woo works hard and goes to university and makes money, he can buy the house his father is hiding in, and literally be where the Parks were at the start. Since he's already been rejected from college multiple times, and South Korean real estate is crazy expensive, it would be impossible for him to achieve this goal, but he still believes he can. This is, in my opinion, the saddest part of the movie. Since this is how it ends, it leaves the viewer contemplating whether he could actually achieve his dream of saving his father, which makes the film much more powerful."

It doesn't beyond a few obvious scenes of class resentment. It also shows the bad influence of Tarantino by ending the film with idiotic and meaningless violence. It is clear that Hollywood like the rest of America is brutal in the way it cuts out any real mention of class so a film that highlights some obvious aspects of class conflict is seen as something special. This film is not special and Snowpiercer was far better. The rich are too clueless in this film (the rich are never this clueless, they are savage in the protection of their wealth--just look at the state of the world). And things happen without reason. Why would the maid let the maid in at night who was fired? Why wouldn't the rich check references on the people they let in their house?

"ReelVillain","10","4","8","17 February 2020"," A different kind of infestation
","A Korean film that seemingly sweeping up at the awards seasons? It can't be that good, can it!? Did the judges not see 1917! Is what I hear you cry as you even read the title of this review. From the mind of Bong Joon-ho comes a drama about class and home invasion, but truly can it be THAT good? Lest we forget this is the mind behind the uncompromising vision of Snowpericer and the unsettling onslaught that was Okaj... but even still, it can't be better than Joker? Right?<br/><br/>There is a surreal kind of desperation that follows you while watching Parasite, you want to see the ultimate fate of our protagonist sooner than is given. The real tilting point of the movie comes around the halfway mark when a troubling discovery is made, this propels the film from contemporary melodrama into an all-out descent into madness, this is where Bong Joon-ho thrives. In the chaos, in the distress, this is where Bong Joon-ho forces us as an audience to be.<br/><br/>Parasite has a rare kind of delicacy to it as if Bong Joon-ho doesn't want to upset us too much, but what's to keep us unsettled. He wants to make us dread for the next turn of events, and as the final curtain falls, you know you have just seen a masterpiece. However, I am unsure if this would not be better suited to a stage production rather than the grandiose of a film.<br/><br/>The movie has nothing in it which makes me feel like it must be seen at a cinema, but perhaps that is to its ultimate asset. A film that transcends how you view it and is outstanding on its own merits.<br/><br/>The most adequate comparison I can make for Parasite is a Shakespearean play. The film has moments of levity and comedy, blended in with horrible and tragic scenes, and is divided into acts. It has deep pathos and there is something overall cathartic about the whole experience.<br/><br/>This is the first film of Bong Joon-ho's that is set in a reality which is current and we (as the viewer) inhabit, despite this, there is still a surreal and other world quality to the proceedings, not unlike Alice In Wonderland. Bong Joon-Ho beckons us through the looking glass.<br/><br/>Perhaps Parasite's strongest suit is its characters who are exceptionally well balanced, there is nothing as obvious as a villain or hero in Parasite. No, the film leaves this up to us, as the viewer to pick out who we feel was correct in their actions most. Make no mistake Parasite's is a world filled with fallen humans. To make such deep characters takes a lot of talent and each of the actors give performances that could have easily lead to their own awards nominations.<br/><br/>Parasite is a true master class in film making, while totally different from everything else on the market, genre and even world it might just deserve all of the awards it's getting.

","First I'd like to say that I really liked this movie. It had a plot that instantly drew me in and characters that were easy to root for. It told a difficult tale about class struggle without turning the main characters into 2-dimensional heroes. It even ended with an unexpected intensity that I seriously doubt anyone saw coming.<br/><br/>All of that said, it underwhelmed me. It repeated things over and over again, which was a plot device, but made some parts really drag. Moreover, the film's failure to assign winners and losers in its conclusion made it intriguing, but also left each character unlikeable- and when all the characters end up being unlikeable, it kind of leaves you feeling like the time you just invested was somewhat meaningless. I probably wouldn't feel that way if I had gone into it with no expectations- I may only focus on the good, but unfortunately I only watched it after everyone said it was the best film of the year and after it became the first foreign film to win best picture at the Oscars.<br/><br/>I can only pass along my own, subjective experience, and that was it. 🤷‍♂️"
"slightlymad22","8","4","8","14 February 2020"," Great Movie, Deserved The Oscar Win
","I just got out of my second viewing of Parasite. I first seen it back in November at an advanced screening.<br/><br/>I think anyone watching this after the Oscars will probably think it is over rated (I certainly think that about Gladiator and Silence Of The Lambs) and 1917 should have won. I'm not one of them, I loved 1917, but I loved this equally as much, and I was totally fine with it winning. If movies with subtitles bother you, this will not be for you.<br/><br/>For me thought, it is 100% original, you'll never know where it is going, the acting is great by all concerned and it is darkly funny.<br/><br/>I have to say, It was a lot more effective on its first watch, as I knew nothing about the movie (which is how I think it should be seen) and it simply blew me away. That has now been taken away now, but it is still a great movie."

","This is the latest movie from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho, director of The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer and more. This is only the second movie of his that I have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! This movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. The performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! My only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. This is good writing, and I feel like I missed some of it. I'm a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. And yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. If that's an issue for you, don't see it. You won't enjoy it. Otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie!

Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film.
For me it deserves the Oscar for Best International Movie and best Original Screenplay but the best movie of the Year?? CMON...
This is the most overated movie of the Decade, it is a good movie sure, with a good Critic to society...
Showing the struggle of the classes, the Decay of the Rich who lives their plastic lives, and the Poor that must fight back and rise against opression and Tirany.
The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long...
The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking.
The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story...
The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job.
This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better.
It is far from a masterpiece, so my review score is a 7 out of 10.
P.S: Loved the Critic to Kim Jong Un Regime, the Menace of the Power of a Button is as Powerfull as a Atomic Bomb LOL"

"jacobywarner","9","5","11","26 November 2019"," Modern Day Metropolis
","This is a must see film packed with tons of implied meaning tackling many social issues focussing on the wealth gap. However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment. No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles, but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie, I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience.<br/><br/>I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist. I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two, but at the base of this there is one single theme; The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them. Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can't take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film. So that being said I gave this movie a 9/10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film."

"clockworkorange13","7","2","3","13 May 2020"," Not terrible but clearly overrated
","Parasite is a highly polished and pretty-looking movie but it falls short in a few ways. My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities, and the rich family are basically clueless airheads. I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of ""tonal whiplash"", meaning the tone was all over the place. Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously, like a straight drama.<br/><br/>Also, in the last quarter, the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose. This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised.<br/><br/>The movie also has some glaring plot holes, like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home? I guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film."

"Ritam_Podder","10","2","3","10 May 2020"," Stunningly original tale of rich and poor
","Bong Joon-ho's masterful film Parasite is a wicked and brutal satire about wealth disparity. The film's setup has a poor family, the Kims, infiltrating the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks, by becoming their new employees. Kim Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) is legitimately a tutor for the Parks' daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso), but he uses his standing to then usher in his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park), who poses as an art tutor for the Parks' young son, Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung). The Kim kids then frame the Parks' driver for being a creep, which allows them to bring in their own father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Sang), for the job. Finally, the family gets rid of the Parks' housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee), by making her seem sickly due to a peach allergy, which paves the way for the Kims' mother, Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang), to get the gig. The Parks don't learn that the Kims are related, and everything seems to be going fine until they learn that Moon-gwang has been hiding her husband, Geun-se (Myeong-hoon Park), in the Parks' basement.<br/><br/>What makes the twist in ""Parasite"" so great is that it's as predictable as it is impossible to see coming. The basement in question is featured only twice in the film for less than a minute before its actual role is revealed. But it's a twist that doesn't feel out of question, as we've seen it happen already, just through the eyes of another family.<br/><br/>What makes ""Parasite"" so perfect is that it understands the rules and power of storytelling. Everything on screen has a specific purpose and a meaning that transforms the story as it unpacks. And it's ironic that, as brilliant as Bong's plan for the story is, the genius of ""Parasite"" lies in the 10-minute sequence where an entire plan is demolished on sight."

"charlieamargolis","10","2","3","22 April 2020"," One of the best films I have seen to date.
","Solely based on social inequality and the consequences of capitalism, 'Parasite' is a film that demonstrates indirect friction between opposite social classes. Bong Joon Ho was writing in an attempt to reveal that Korea isn't as glamorous as one would think this is shown from the massive social gap between the Parks and Kims (from one of his press interviews 'but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair'). I think this is quite ironic as we saw the younger individuals were more likely to proceed into becoming slightly successful as they were the ones that secured the jobs for their whole family, also going back to the statement about the poor widening, but what stood in the way was another poor family who had the same idea but in the end both had different morals which ultimately lead to the demise of both poor families. This is just one of the reasons why this film was so incredible because even just talking about it sounds poetic and satisfying."
"Semisonic","10","2","3","19 April 2020"," Up and down the ladders
","Some stories are plain and simple, a line from A to B. Some are convoluted mindgame mazes that force you to solve riddles or to stay forever lost. And then there's this film. A traditional Asian gift of layers upon layers of wrapping, each concealing and disguising not just the shape but the essence of what's inside. And in the end, the gift might not be what's in there, but the act of unwrapping itself.<br/><br/>I'm amazed how Bong Joon Ho tricks us into believing that this is a cheap con artist comedy at first. It was almost natural to shout ""No way! This can't be the film everyone's raving about!"". Had I recalled that this man has also written Snowpiercer, I would not have been so simple. Just like the rich family whose house the parasites have invaded, naive and gullible, ready to call the number on the first business card given, we fall into the traps of easy interpretations, and Bong knows it well enough, giving us all these hints we understand only after a while.<br/><br/>Parasite is definitely not about the action, and maybe not even about the visual brilliance, although the scene of running down the stairs, equally physical, social and psychological, under the rain is a phenomenally executed message, just like a scene of an elevated toilet bowl regurgitating back what it's fed up taking in is an image only a person who made two Oscars kiss could come up with. In terms of graphic expression and witty dialogues, Parasite could make both Tarantino and Miyazaki proud, all at the same time.<br/><br/>This is no doubt a fancy wrapping, but the best thing about this film is what you feel through it. From condescending disbelief, to light interest, to full engagement, to the sense of watching a social message play within a movie, to feeling as if no borders of genre or common sense exist at all, to feeling dumbfounded and uncomfortable, to a sudden calm. As if a petty half-penny story has taken you into a Zen parable.<br/><br/>In the end, nothing remains. An experience that leaves you blank as a mountain side under the snow. So if you do see a light in the distance, don't rush to decode its signals. Just enjoy the scenery while it lasts. After all, it's what you came all the way up for."

They try all sorts of small, odd jobs to earn their living until the son in the family gets a job as a highly paid private tutor and the life of this family changes drastically. With him, he pulls along his family and their fate changes.
As drastically the good changes take place in their life, it falls apart quickly too. In a night, everything changes. Bong Joon-ho does magic here.
From the very beginning, the movie starts with a dark undertone and ends in a manner no one would expect it to and that's what makes it worth all the hype and praise.
The story-telling is amazing in the movie. The climax of the movie cannot be anticipated.
This movie gives it's viewers so much to think about, wonder on. It very well justifies the title of the film and the viewer gets their perspective clear at the end. The drastic differences in the lifestyles of the characters is very well portrayed. Inspite of that, how each character has maintained the part they played is commendably shown.

"MooWoolf1","6","2","3","30 March 2020"," Probably the first proper review..
","Let's start with that I've seen a lot. It's all public.
In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb.<br/><br/>I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is.
The whole movie was made like ""Rope"" except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated.<br/><br/>Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior.<br/><br/>Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good.<br/><br/>So I just watched Parasite too.<br/><br/>It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that.<br/><br/>The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess.
If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic.<br/><br/>The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation.<br/><br/>It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason.<br/><br/>Other factors of the movie are no special neither.<br/><br/>Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect.<br/><br/>Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all.
For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting. Also it's genre is drama/thriller. There was not a single second in the movie that was comedic!"

The money was the iron, and it smoothed everything out.
They surf the Internet, live in basements, and do whatever it takes to get a job.

Mr And Mrs Park look silly, but they are getting richer.
The Kim family is brilliant, but they still can't turn over.
You think a good job and a good salary will lift you out of poverty.
You can wash the sweat out of your clothes, but you can't wash the smell out of the basement where it has melted into your blood.
You've climbed ten floors, twenty floors, and you've probably just arrived in someone else's basement.
They are worms, so they have a hard life;
They're bugs, so nothing can kill them."

","Captivating, intelligent, funny, unique... at times Parasite feels like an opera with its majestic score and visuals.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things about Parasite is its sharp plot. The way that the Kim family plot their scheme and enact their plan is brilliantly devised, and shot in the most extraordinary way. I really liked that the plot didn't bog itself down in the morality of their actions. There was no dithering about from the family and no pause for a discussion of whether what they were doing was right (which I feel an American film would have bogged itself down in). Bong Joon-ho trusted us as an audience to immerse ourselves in the world of the Kim's and just roll with what they doing.<br/><br/>The themes of Parasite were also very layered, some more subtle and complex than others, but all intricately connected and well thought out. The messaging throughout the film was so rich that it remained constantly engaging.<br/><br/>From the little I knew about this film going in I was expecting a dark thriller, so the comedy took me completely by surprise. Choi Yeon-gyo stole the show for me with her comedic scenes standing out the most, and she was perhaps unlucky not to get greater Academy recognition.<br/><br/>I can't sing Bong Joon-ho's praises enough for his direction on Parasite, creating such an eerie atmosphere while also nailing the black comedy. The minimalist design of the house, the bleak colours and tones, all holding their own meanings, really emphasised the messaging of the film and cultivated a constant atmosphere of unease, at times descending into full on horror.<br/><br/>After a second viewing/dissection I'm sure I will have more to say, but for now I will simply say that Parasite is a must watch. Intriguing from the get go and spot on with its dark humour, Parasite is sure to pave the way for a greater visibility of eastern cinema in the west."

","Parasite comes to us in an age where the intersection between art and politics seems to be reaching fever pitch; the moving screen has become a battleground for representation and polemic, and the arguments that stem from the validity of just that become their own dogfights. Films wrest for their spotlight via the award season. The media chimes in with their own ceremonies and ribbons. Every man and his dog and his dog's twitter account has a voice, and those tweets may well qualify for Rotten Tomatoes critic status. And at times, the noise surrounding a film can impair our ability to discern its true qualities.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips' Joker made the biggest splash throughout 2019, with an array of voices vying for control of the narrative. Some critics derided its dangerous allure to the Arthur Flecks of our time, ticking time bombs waiting to pull their own talk-show stunts, whereas the director himself bemoaned the 'woke culture' that had ruined the comedic genre. While he's not wrong about the disconnect between imagined violence and real crime (in the end, no clowns armed with AR-15s showed up at the premiere), surely Phillips has to realise the slippery slope of interpretation that his film endorses. As a straight-forward character study of Fleck's descent into unhinged derangement, it's sympathetic enough, if not clumsy in its social commentary, mimicking the aesthetic of its Scorsese inspirations from the New Hollywood era in exchange for diluting its contemporary relevance. But as serious critique it's laughable, simplifying society's sickness to a scattershot of seriously specific symptoms. These range from a gang of teenage hooligans hunting clown sign holders (and only clown sign holders) to a pair of cruel Wall Street bankers who coinkidinkily happen to know a full verse and chorus of Send in the Clowns, a song that has zero relevance to the scenario other than its title - that's Glee level, Todd. While Scorsese's camera turned away out of embarrassment for Travis Bickle, Joker revels in its final triumph, consoling its audience's edgiest sympathies. A brief glance at the YouTubers serenading the 167th Street stairs confirms this. It's brand store nihilism, broad enough for anyone to latch onto with their worldly angst.<br/><br/>Relatively, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is more consistent in its overall delivery, spinning social parable from the familiar yarn of a classic whodunnit. The moral is solidified in the final frame, where the immigrant carer surveys her new estate (a labyrinthine, Clue-esque mansion) from its top balcony, towering above the former employers who held her family ransom. But although its interactions strike truer (it's gratifying to see the Thrombey clan cajole Marta as 'part of the family', only to sharply change tack when she is granted their entire inheritance, exposing their actual priorities), the story places the othered outsider on such a pedestal that it feels obligatory to side with her. Marta can't even tell a lie without vomiting, wielded by Johnson as a clever plot device, and yet also a characteristic approaching noble savage levels of patronising. The spatial metaphor isn't dissimilar to that of the staircase in Parasite, but you wish that it had a shade more nuance, and that she wasn't just the straight character in a pulpy film where the rest of the ensemble seems ripped out a 21st century version of Clue. In this edition of the board game, Marta wins by playing the moral high ground at every turn. But real life isn't that easy, or that simple.<br/><br/>As far as Bong Joon-ho is concerned, politics has always been entwined with the big screen. Because the latter is designed to captivate the popular audience, surely it must be a reflection of their general wants and needs, universal concerns and priorities. Some of his more pointed 'monster movies' take direct aim at the injustices of the world: the ramifications and pitfalls of American exceptionalism in The Host, and the cruel disregard for animal rights by multinational conglomerates in Okja. From his worldview, profit rises above the rest, leaving all behind. But Parasite isn't as straightforwardly didactic, or as easy to summarise. Just when you think you have the film's measure, that the Kims have beaten the system by assuming their mantle on the throne of the Parks, it swerves violently to the left.<br/><br/>From the very beginnings of his career, Joon-Ho has been taking genre films and twisting them into social satire, and while the first half of Parasite could operate as a straight thriller on its own, the latter half upends its foundations beyond a merely literal sense. The cast is uniformly excellent, and it is through the Kims that Joon-Ho begins to form his thesis; that class is performative, that being is a constant state of code-switching, and that anyone could find themselves at the bottom of the basement or the top of the stairs, at one point or another in the twisted prism of capitalism. There is an entire wealth of nuance in the formal and informal registers of Korean that will be forever lost to foreign audiences, but their body language and tone tell a whole story of their own; how Ki-woo is seduced by the allure and esteem of a university tutor and in turn seduces Ji-so, feigning aloofness while in awe of her status, or how So-dam's dialogue pokes through upper class formality (while her father fails to bridge this gap), or how Chung-sook swells above the former housekeeper when she talks down to her, scolding the unemployed for not knowing their place. When the new head of house nudges the old aside as if she were nothing more than a pesky mosquito, our laughter is smothered quickly by the crack! of her head against concrete, a testament to both the film's careful drip of dark humour and the lateral cruelty inflicted at the bottom tier of society, driven by a desperate yearning to ascend and escape.<br/><br/>Joons-Ho's visual style is a slick, almost insidious thing, willing you subconsciously in the direction of the narrative and to where the power resides within the scene. Consider the opening shot of his debut, Barking Dogs Never Bite, which pulls back from an idyllic forest line to trap the protagonist within the frame, imprisoned in a cage of unemployment and yelping neighbouring dogs. The closing shot pulls the same trick, presenting his success at scoring the coveted title of a university professor, before pulling back to replace the old bars of his apartment with a new set. He has won, but at what cost? Parasite begins literally below ground level, showing you the world as the Kims see it, the veritable vermin of the underground. The camera squeezes in with them hunched around their dining table, the long lens compressing the planes, evoking a feeling of claustrophobia. When Ki-woo makes his initial ascent, the frame expands, dwarfing him in the gated community of the Parks, bathing him in angelic natural light. Only when their gambit is exposed do they scurry back into their murky sewers like rats, flushed out by the same waters that preserve the pristine pastures of their employers. And yet, they commit the same sins, and are guilty of the same transgressions they scorn the Parks for.<br/><br/>Parasite finishes with a door slam of an ending, exposing the elusiveness of social mobility as absolute. In truth, I prefer the agony of the close in Burning from compatriot Lee Chang-dong, which achieves the same order of anguish that Joon-ho tapped into with Memories of Murder (its impact somewhat lessened by the recent revelation of the real-life perpetrator). In the end, it is infinite obsession which reigns over the resolution of the plot's puzzle, laced with the poison of class envy; it matters not who Ben really was. Parasite more or less deals with a similar crisis of identity, in which the working class protagonist eventually succumbs to the lure of the nouveau riche and their shiny new world. If you pull back, you'll see that this doubles for the broader anxieties of a country coming to terms with its rapid economic and social growth after civil war. Winning the nation's first, second, third, and fourth Oscar in one fell swoop is a significant boon for Asian representation in the West. And as for working class representation? Perhaps not in the gilded, gated halls of the Academy. Even in fantasy, Ki-woo's triumph barely nudges the status quo. He merely wins by joining them."

With that being said this review is an advocation for research and stepping out of the confines of ones comfort zone. In the words of the director of this incredible film Bong Joon Ho ""Once you get over the 1- inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.""

","Parasite is a movie that has been recognized and given really good reviews, anyways to me it wasn't the best movie ever. This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising."
"calderonp8","9","2","3","23 February 2020"," Woah
","After watching Parasite, it's hard to describe what I felt when ""Kevin"" finished writing the letter for his father. The film itself is entertaining to watch, it keeps you thinking and when you look for the deeper meaning within, you find a hard theme to display on a screen yet done brilliantly in Parasite.
In my opinion the movie is a direct metaphor for dreams, and even for the concept of the ""American Dream"". In the film, the ""Kim"" family is struggling from the beginning, they have dreams, especially Ki-Woo (Kevin) and his sister (Ki-Jeong) to go to college. When Kevin heads out to his job interview with the Parks, he tells his family that he doesn't think of the forgery of the documents as a crime. He is just getting these documents before time, because he will go to college. His sister also seems like she wanted to go to college and seems frustrated that she couldn't because of their situation. At the end of the film, Kevin imagines himself overcoming and finally having money after he went to college. He then would be able to buy the house where his dad would still be trapped in the basement room. The sad part about this is that Kevin really thinks he will be able to save his father, but because of what has happened, he won't be able to.
An interesting metaphor used inside the film is how the levels in the different houses represent the social classes. For example, to get to the Park's house the Kims had to walk up a hill, and to get back to their house they had to walk back down a long way. Even inside the Park's house this can be seen with the hidden basement room, in which one of the ""parasites"" lives.
The film for me started out almost as a comedy, all of the sequence in which the family works together to fire the Park's workers in order for them to be hired is great and I really had fun watching it. Where it all changes is when the two ""parasites"" face off against each other to stay on the surface (literally and figuratively), while the losers are thrown back inside the basement. From this point the whole movie changes dramatically and it all goes downhill, as represented by the flooding of their apartment. What really seems interesting to me is how when the Parks were at their highest point; dining and drinking acting like they own the place is when their downfall begins. This probably represents how in many cases the social class lines are set and those below don't belong above.
Mr. Parker is the one who is above all the others, he is the man of the house. In two occasions Mr. Kim tells Parker that he loves his wife, to which the first time Mr. Parker responds, ""we'll call it love"". This probably shows that in truth he doesn't love her and the only thing that he really loves is well, money and power. In an intimate scene between the two, at a point Mr. Parker looks even uncomfortable adding more to why I believe he doesn't love her at all.
When the Kims first meet the Parks they think between themselves that they are nice people and look at them as their equals. This all changes in the scene where they become trapped underneath the table and overhear Mr. Park telling his wife how Mr. Kim smells like radishes with great disgust, as if he weren't even human at all. This greatly upsets Mr. Kim, as if this smell makes him less than them. Later, this explains the reason for him killing Mr. Park in the final act of the film.
Overall, the film is complete and a realistic portrait of a struggle between classes and a commentary on how not everyone can accomplish their dreams because of how our society is built. It has various moods that I honestly really liked, from the comedic, to the dark and psycho parts of the film. The thing that this film has made me think the most about though, is the dreams part, because that can come like a brick to the face, to know that what you want the most in the world might not come to you."
"6Brothers","8","2","3","22 February 2020"," Solid film in the genre of Fargo.
","I just saw the film and I went in unsure if it'd be as good as the hype. The film was enjoyable; everything was solid from story, character development, cinematography, editing. The film had a good flow and plenty of surprises. There certainly was deeper meanings to the film and great exposure to the Korean culture. The problem with this film isn't the film at all but those reviewing it. For those that swoon about the film or those that call it awful are way off base. The film is neither; and it certainly isn't a Tarantino violent style film. It is a good film I'd probably see a couple more times to find all the different angles of this complex story. It won best picture for good reason but it certainly didn't bury the competition; any of those could have won depending on what the viewer was looking for. It's a good film and should be seen and likely more than once."

","I can understand there are a lot of people who really enjoyed the movie. It has good pace, there's a lot of tension and some unexpected twists. But honestly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is a masterpiece, despite it flaws. And it has many flaws, unfortunetly most of them are in the story itself. For me they spoiled the movie. I was asking myself questions almost from the beginning of the story:
Why a smart, young, good looking, english speaking guy cannot find at least decent job?
How his sister, without experience or art/psychological education manages to conduct tutoring to the boy, with whom - as his mother said, couldn't stand any art teacher? First lesson we can see even the boy bowing to ""Jessica"" - did she hipnotize him or smth?
How she knew about trauma the boy had?
The fathee could drive modern, expensive car without proper experience or training. They were poor, so he does not drive at all, and as he said his only experience with merces cars were during short work as a parking worker. How he could play experienced driver?
How it is possible a woman without proper experience knows how to run modern house and how to behave as a housekeeper for a rich family? And how she could prepare a dish she did not even knew the name of in just 8 minutes, while being drunk and in a kinda hostage situation?
There is a scene with the Da-Song sitting in a tipi, writing the message of ""HELP"" that the husband of the former housekeeper is sending with morse cose via the lamp. The movie never addresses that later. Why the boy did not inform parents about that. And why nobody cared about strange behavior of a lamp, and strange patterns of the flashing light?
How it is possible the rich family did not know about a dungeon under their house and a man kept ther for 4 years????
There are just some of the questions I had. Main two ones are: why a family of so resourceful, inteligent and determined people live in a basement in a poorest of districts? With their talents they should be or on the top or in prison. Second - ending suggests we should sympatize with a father and his son. I have no idea how we can do that - they cheated, murdered and caused some innecent people to lose their jobs and reputation - honestly, there were no people in the movie I would like or had any sympathy for."

It's a movie. It's meant to entertain, to move, to inspire, to question. People dont get what the purpose of this movie was I dont think. For me, personally, it was meant to leave us torn. In a place where no real sides were taken, so that we question it constantly, never really reaching a definitive stance. The characters are not ones to necessarily sympathize with or hate so clearly but rather there to open our eyes and really think about how incredibly ruined and beautiful this world can be, simultaneously.

As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.<br/><br/>It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.<br/><br/>However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times.

","If the process is to let all families living at the bottom of the society get rich first and then get rich, and slowly let all members of their own families become housekeepers of the rich family to teach drivers all living positions, the ending is somewhat unexpected. The late night visit of the original housekeeper completely broke the beautiful dream of the family. Of course, even without this, it may slowly show its feet over time. Because in addition to the two tutors, parents on the job because of their lack of quality slowly tried on the edge of the master. It was originally believed that the goodness and goodness of the rich couple and husband originated from wealth, and life was free of wrinkles. The poor woman said that if she had money, she would be kinder than the rich couple. However, this is not the case afterwards. I dislike the different tastes of the poor. It would be more sensation to use cheap panties left by the hostess, and at the end, I only care about my comatose son while ignoring the murderer and frequently assassinating myself in my yard.

","Saw Parasite yesterday. Something that we missed out during MAMI. What a brilliant gripping tale this is! It is a class-conscious thriller that you wouldn't want to miss.<br/><br/>To start with, it makes you laugh with its comic rendering. When you see the entire movie it defies all your expectations along the line. Bong Joon-ho crafts an intricate look at modern-day social hierarchies. He keeps you flipped on one mood then drastically changes it to the other while delivering some brilliant thematic elements. When you spend 132 minutes seeing this movie you encounter and experience: clever, humorous, dramatic and every other kind of emotion.<br/><br/>It is also a hilarious and irreverent take on South Korea's class warfare. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls.<br/><br/>It is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages. Its final moments are so unsettling, and so unforgettable and impossible to estimate. It is a test that you undergo yourself and you're most likely to fail! ðŸ˜Š"

","When I started watching this I thought well here is a caption film and I haven't watched one in a while. I fully expected that because of the captions I would lose track of the story. Then, as I got into this film, I realized I was being drawn into the social fabric of South Korea. I appreciated it more and more as the film moved on.<br/><br/>We have a desperate family living in a basement. The son has a friend whose leaving for college in America. His friend asks him to tutor his girlfriend while he is away at school because he trusts him. The girlfriend has a wealthy upper middle class family. So on his classmate recommendation he gets the job.<br/><br/>Then the son finds he can get his entire family jobs with his new employer as well. So pretty soon the desperate family is all working and getting involved with the employers family. The social consequences of this become more and more complex as the desperate family is not telling their employers they are all related to each other. The wealthy family has many issues of it's own as well.<br/><br/>Character development here is excellent and key to this as their relationship becomes more and more complex. Everything is going well until one week-end when the middle class family is taking their youngest son camping for a week-end. Then we find out some dark hidden secrets of their house as their employees decide to have a party at the employers house. Then the employees find out about a dark hidden secret in their employers house and everything starts falling apart for both families.<br/><br/>I don't want to get too technical here because even though I warn for spoilers, I would rather the complexity of these social interactions are better if you see them for yourself, than my getting too detailed describing them. This is great writing and direction of a very complex social order story. It teaches the viewer about South Korean Culture and South Korea in a way that is unexpected, but very welcome. While the results of everything coming apart might not make some viewers happy, the way it happens when things come apart make total sense. There is some mild adult material here, but it is done milder than many R rated films.<br/><br/>All the cast fit their roles and get plenty of chance to act. They really make the viewer feel what is going on and where complex relationships have to wind up. The title is a give away in that the desperate family does become parasites to the wealthy family. The way it happens is what makes this movie special. Kudos to all the folks who have given this movie awards. It deserves all of them. The film takes the viewer into a different world, and does so in a unique manner."

"abhishekjha-79309","9","1","1","2 May 2020"," A Movie about differences between different class in our society and climate change
","South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. Certainly Parasite might feel uneven to some audiences because of its radical shifts in tone -- from clever comedy to violent, dark tragedy -- but it's more likely that Bong has executed everything as planned. Each insignificant detail, from the young boy Da-song's love of Native Americans to a peach allergy to the Kim family's sad little half-basement apartment, has been planted for some specific, exacting reason.<br/><br/>Cleanly and slickly constructed, Parasite takes perverse pleasure in scamming the rich during its leisurely, funny first half, and that pleasure is contagious. When the second half comes, it's not only a narrative shock, but it also forces viewers to ask hard questions about why the first half was so enjoyable. In earlier films Bong slyly explored the impact that humans have had on our environment. In Parasite, he looks at an even bigger picture. He wonders why humans tend to look away from, or insulate themselves from, others' troubles and suffering. In this movie, reaching the high ground is certainly desirable, but those occupying the low ground aren't going anywhere."

","After a long time watched a movie which can go into so many different genres, making it a masterpiece. Being a non-English film winning an Oscar sure explains it. This starts out as an entertaining casual comedy but with the surprising plot twists this dives deep into a strong comparison of the wealth gap and the psychological states between social classes, especially portraying the rage of the lower class.<br/><br/>Other than those, the cinematography, lighting, foreshadowing of events, the plot were outstanding. This film gave me a feeling similar to that of the ending of Breaking Bad.. Won't give out any spoilers, this is a must watch film for anyone!

Towards the end, it taps into a thriller. Displaying rich people is pretty simple. They have no problems. Unlike poorer people. Filming the film is brilliant. The film operates with very strong images. The atmosphere is breathtaking. The movie hangs in front of the screen all the way. The turns are screwed. They ignore the clichÃ©s. Simply put, this film has been well-deserved because it raises and answers social questions that are very serious today."

"pathaknilanjan","10","1","1","24 April 2020"," Parasite looks Totally Different Lives .
","Parasite looks at the totally different lives of kim and Park families and incidents that change their lives totally.
Kim lives with his family with limited facilities where they search for wifi all around the house in opening scene.Park family lives a luxurious life with high paid workers all around them for everything.
The best thing is how the director potrays the class division and the relation between families of different extend.
Starting as a usual story of struggling family, Parasite navigates through relatable dark humour and ends in emotional note.Conversations between the park couple too show their attitude towards the kim family.
Director uses rain to show the difference in situations between the families.Rain is shown as beautiful view of nature in Park's house (nice frames too in park family scenes) and as destructive devil in Kim's house.
Director aptly uses objects to connect the story.For instance, After an incident, young kim throws a rock that his friend gifts to bring prosperity to the family.That scene shows the kind of superstitious beliefs still existing within us.Look out for the final Kim father-son conversation scene.
Technically,bgm enhances the dark satire aspect and conveys the emotion towards the end.Cuts made sure that viewer isn't detached from the progression of the movie at any point once the plot gets interesting.
All just performed excellently except Mrs.Park.Her emotions were a bit over-done .
I can't justify the final twist where Mr.Kim kills Mr.Park without clear justification and that sums up the only major drawback after watching the movie.
Parasite sums up to be the resultant of the script duo's work in the thin plot and some smart execution that makes sure that viewer forgets to think about the wafer thin plot"

","""If you make a plan, life never works out that way"" A classic line carved in the frame of new concepts and innovative structure of new cinematography. ""Parasite"" belongs to drama? ""Parasite"" belongs to psychological horror? Minute by minute, my mind and thoughts weren't able to keep up with the con family's plan. Through Boon Joon-ho's symbolic symmetrical following shots and a strong narrative all the way till the family dinner at the upper-class house. What lies between those wines is something that the audiences wanted but never expected? There was a shot of the former housekeeper shutting off the light of the basement stairs when it was placed between Kim Ki-jung and Mrs. Park, with a flip of a switch, the mysterious curtain of the house opened. Clearly Boon Joon-ho knows the fine line between a soap opera and a drama. Carrying those anxious and bubbly fragile plans of the con family, I was able to look back and reflect with the father, his emotional status is the needle that penetrates and pinpoint the map of this story. Class between class, what do we expect from wealth and what do we despise from the poor. When we look at these two family, what I noticed is the ""benefit"" that the poor family acquired from the rich gradually shifted into hate later on. By using Mrs. Park's ignorance and her pursuing of reaching a certain hierarchy in her specific social status, and Mr. Park who is the main income source of the family but constant absence of family. Preciousness runs through the upper-class, their vanity of stepping stone to those who truly has exclusive and graceful lifestyles. Surprisingly the story of ""Parasite"" never used something as tangible and as cheap as money to be the bait of desire in the film. Instead it used something as common as daydreaming and curiosity, as we can see, the poor family came to the house with a purpose of fulfilling a purpose of living in quality and wellness. They never planned to harm or manipulate the Parks, all they ever want is sunlight and a clean space with each other. But their plan was jeopardized by another similar family that longs for a stronger purpose - shelter which is conflicted and somehow shifted their impression towards the Parks. To them, the Parks are the emotionless snakes that harvest their effort and their goal of being well in the same society. The scene when two families revealed themselves was tremendous, seeing the Parks reveal what's behind their deceptive looks and words, and seeing the Kims burst with a stronger bond and unity between them is such a horrifying and realistic comparison. Then when we think about it, did Mrs. Park pass out for her husband or for the end of her ""class"". Or we can ask was Kevin's dream of eventually moving into the house realistic or just another anguishing and beguiling plan of his"

Film Rating-8.5/10<br/><br/>This is such a good movie. After hearing so much buzz about this film at the Oscars, somehow I still had no idea what the movie was about going into it.A great moment for Korean cinema and an extremely thought provoking film.
Parasite tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family.
If you want to be told a story, but without too much detail upfront that would give it all away, sit down for this one.Boong Joon Ho directs this Oscar winning movie about the disreputable behaviour of a Korean family who infiltrate the home and lives of a wealthy couple by gradually taking over the roles of domestic helpers.The Parks family is the opposite of all of this.Naive,not so much - probably just out of touch with the real world. The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed.The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened.
The actors were great, the plot was super strong, and I can't say enough good things about how beautiful this film is just to look at.Though I really did enjoy the film, I personally, didn't think this deserved the Oscar win for best movie as although a strong and powerful tale, for me, there were better films in the preceding year. I also do not think this is the best of Boong Joon Ho's movies. However, the fact that it did win is to be applauded as a massive step forward in the recognition that there are movies made outside Hollywood.<br/><br/>
It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the real world, the destination is always uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.
Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them.<br/><br/>Taking everything into account,Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece."

The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years, and the last scene is hopeless for the poor, which is the reality of society."

"zkonedog","7","1","1","24 March 2020"," A Solid Metaphor Film
","Let me say right away here that ""Parasite"" may very well indeed be even better than a 7/10 star film. For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, ""Parasite"" is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between ""clans"" is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative.<br/><br/>On the surface, ""Parasite"" is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie.<br/><br/>More importantly, though, ""Parasite"" is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze.<br/><br/>Like I said in the opening paragraph, ""Parasite"" may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to ""sneak up on me"" as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the ""deeper stuff"" from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better).<br/><br/>So, as of right now, I'm giving ""Parasite"" a 7/10 ranking. A solid film that I enjoyed, but not necessarily amongst my personal all-time favorites. Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal/social climate, it will climb the ranks further. It certainly won't go any lower."

","Generally interesting if you bookend the acts and scenes.<br/><br/>Interesting that it's coming as a series as it seemed more suited for such. As if there was more to see which would make it more compelling. I've had that recently where a poor or neutral film would make a better series.<br/><br/>For instance, the whole process of the poor family getting themselves jobs took up too much time in a movie. Although they are introduced quickly and are likeable, I didn't get the full sense if they were just struggling or were grifters. My guess is grifters. But I shouldn't be guessing. I should be told.<br/><br/>The second half when the former maid shows up felt very manufactured. Why did they let her in? The underground bunker was original but how we got there was more it trying to write itself out of a corner. But both would have worked in a series.<br/><br/>The maid turning the tables on them was fine once you were in the underground space, but arriving there was forced. Then the rich family returning was a bit much. Plausible but a bit much.<br/><br/>When the maid is kicked down the steps, I thought she was dead from the head wound. So it was odd when the poor husband said ""Thank God"" when he checked if she was breathing after seeing the blood on the back of her head. Conversely, being that she was bleeding but still breathing, he didn't take it seriously enough.<br/><br/>The element of the rich father saying the poor father smelled like radishes was a set-up for the ending, but it wasn't enough. When it came, I didn't buy it.<br/><br/>The sex scene between the rich couple was awkward and unnecessary.<br/><br/>I did see the motivation of the underground man attacking the poor family. But like I said before, I didn't see why the poor father would attack the rich man. And it was obvious where he went afterwards.<br/><br/>Not sure why the mother and the son were prosecuted as I didn't see any direct evidence against them. The underground was still unknown to the police. Confused if the rich man died. The father's morse code attempts were very awkward, much less the son seeing them.<br/><br/>In the end it was very well made but whatever the message was muddled. Clearly suggested classism but only touched on it at best. I've seen Bong Joon Ho's Snowpiercer, his segment in Tokyo!, The Host, Memories of Murder and Mother. (Surprised there was so many when I looked him up.) Thought about the same of those: well done but not seeing the hype."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","10 March 2020"," About class boundaries and human division
","Ever since his first film, director Bong Joon-ho has been interested in class divide. And nowhere is this more apparent and poignant than in Parasite, where a low-class family of four, down on their luck, infiltrate an upper class household, each posing as a separate helper. One is a tutor to their daughter, another a driver, and so forth.<br/><br/>And that alone would be plenty entertaining and fascinating. Each of the four members of the Kim family are a fully realized character, brimming with personality, hopes and aspirations. Sure, what they're doing is questionable and even immoral, but the film is told from their point of view and you can't really hate them for trying to reach for those stars. It's not like they're hurting anyone. Initially.<br/><br/>But then the story takes a turn and suddenly it's deadly serious, fiercely intense and full of high stakes and suspense. Before that twist, Parasite was already a great film, but afterwards it became a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It also helps that Bong is a splendid director. Each scene, each shot, is measured, beautiful and poignant. The whole film look amazing, but I especially enjoyed the scenes where heavy rain is falling. Such an impactful scene. For the rich, it's just a night of rain drumming their roof. Kind of relaxing, actually. They don't have to worry about it. But for the poor, it's a night of nightmares, floods and loss. For them, it's the end of their lives as they knew it.<br/><br/>Parasite earned it's Best Picture Oscar and I'm so glad that the Academy is finally acknowledging these foreign films. It's a film full of heavy themes, brilliant acting moments and enough content to keep you wondering for weeks. Heavily recommended."

I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie.

","This is where I get all smug and talk about how I remember when ""The Host"" was released, and in fact I've owned the DVD for well over a decade now. And at that time I wanted to see ""Barking Dogs Never Bite"" as it starred Bae Doo-na, who was popular among me at the time; and I'd heard ""Memories of Murder"" was worth a watch, but my limited attempts never found an available copy - a film that now seems criminally under-promoted in the UK. But after the release of 2009's ""Mother"", as I am neither a Netflix or Jamie Bell subscriber, Joon-ho Bong's name hasn't been in my consciousness a great deal over the last decade.<br/><br/>Until about a year ago, when talk was of his latest work being really quite good - tipped, and then fulfilling promise, to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Now South Korean cinema is all popular and that and Oscars are being won - breaking new ground along the way.<br/><br/>But, despite my interest in his first two feature length films, I have still yet to see either. ""The Host"" was an entertaining film, but is somewhat clunky in parts; and the dancing on the bus finale from ""Mother"" stayed in my memory, but I had to re-watch it to have my recollection of the rest of the film restored - a tidy little film. But, while good, he was not a director blowing my mind, and after a relatively meagre last decade in terms of the volume of output, I was surprised by both the hype surrounding ""Parasite"" and its ground-breaking achievements. Is it really all that and a bag of Oscars?<br/><br/>Well, the premise, is a nice one.<br/><br/>The Kims are a poor family living in a basement flat, looking out at the rest of the world from street level. They are more-or-less living in the gutter. Working by pre-folding pizza boxes for a local takeaway, they steal wifi off their neighbours or local businesses - the toilet their wifi hotspot. The son, Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi), has two things going for him: while completing his military service, he learnt English to a good standard; and his friend Min (Seo-joon Park), a suave and sophisticated young gentleman about to travel abroad.<br/><br/>While he is away, Min asks Ki-woo if he can take over his role as the wealthy Park family's daughter Da-hye's (Ji-so Jung) English teacher. Ki-woo will be able to pass as an English teacher, and as a failed college applicant, poses little threat to Min's designs on Da-hye. Enlisting his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park) to forge college certificates for him, Ki-woo goes for an interview with Park mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo), exploiting her simple, wealthy naivety.<br/><br/>Quickly, Ki-woo learns that the son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung) also needs a new art teacher and recommends his sister for the role, though denies their family connection, of course. Through mischief, Ki-woo and Ki-jung soon get their father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song), recruited as the father Dong-ik's (Sun-kyun Lee) driver and their mother, Ching-sook (Hye-jin Yang), as housemaid. Soon, the Kims occupy the splendidly modern house as much as the Parks, unbeknownst to their hosts.<br/><br/>But ousted housemaid Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns when the host family are away, finding the Kims enjoying a night of luxury, unearthing a dark secret kept within the house. Complacently, their cover is blown, and the Kims must do what it takes to keep their real identity, among other things, hidden.<br/><br/>As stated, ""The Host"" was an entertaining film, though like any comedy, can have moments where the script feels a little clunky/awkward/Swiss cheese. ""Mother"" was a step up in overall quality, with better storytelling, while maintaining entertainment value. With ""Parasite"", Bong has created a near perfect balance of good storytelling with entertainment value. The first hour is an introduction to each of the nine central characters in what is quite a light comedy drama about con artists.<br/><br/>But throughout, Bong leaves subtle references to what will become the film's climax. These start off small, but gradually become more frequent, and when literal push comes to literal shove, the bubbles rise to the surface and boil over. Tension is brought in as we switch to the second half of the film, when the Kims start to enjoy imagining themselves in a life of luxury - another subtle hint, perhaps. Happy-go-lucky tricksters soon become criminals, with Bong pacing this development well.<br/><br/>In their showhome advert for the way of life of the mega rich, the Parks are not portrayed as horrible for it. Yeon-kyo is nice, if a little slow, and the Kims recognise this; Dong-ik is complimentary enough; and the two children are normal kids - Da-song deserving of some sympathy. The Kims are more relaxed and likeable, but also manipulative and criminal in their work. Here, the poor appear more immoral.<br/><br/>But, as things progress, the Parks begin to show their disgust at those from poorer backgrounds. What start off as seemingly minor comments about how Ki-taek smells, become more frequent references to it, comparing it to the smell of people on the subway, and we all know what that means. Ki-taek is increasingly disturbed by these comments, repeatedly hearing it on a stress-filled night, returning home to his flooded basement apartment. Dong-ik refers to Ki-taek getting close to crossing the line, and returning from his fantasy to his reality, it may be time for that move to be made.<br/><br/>Despite exploiting them, the Kims initially liked the Parks; but the more they get to know them, the more they realise the Parks will never truly like them back. The stunning view from the window of the Parks' house is contrasted by the view from the gutter the Kims have from theirs, with Kyung-pyo Hong's cinematography telling a story in itself. As the Kims are punished for their crimes, sympathy grows for them, and indeed their whole neighbourhood destroyed by flooding. While they try to rescue their children from the floodwater, the Parks casually watch over Da-song as he sleeps in his teepee in their garden - it won't leak, it was ordered from America.<br/><br/>Both families are left scathed by the end, but which do you feel more sympathy for? Who was really exploiting who? Bong weaves these questions in subtly throughout, sucking you in.<br/><br/>Now, where's that subsequent ""Early Bong Blu-Ray Boxset"" we all know is about to come?!<br/><br/>politic1983.home.blog"

Was it the fact that it was filmed in South Korea? Maybe people are so used to the K-pop fluff garbage coming from SK that when something of actual artistic substance is produced via their pop culture it gets blown out of proportion, when compared to their usual fare.
Let me say now, Parasite is in no way a bad movie. It has something to say, the plot is decent, and it is well shot. But the plot line and story itself isn't really saying anything new or different that hasn't been done via Hollywood in the past. I also felt like some of the performances weren't A+ material, probably why the film wasn't nominated for any actual acting awards. The main male child and dad did good enough work, the daughter and mom, and the members of the ""rich"" family? Not so much. Basically throwaway performances.

"StoryArchitect","6","6","15","11 February 2020"," MONSTER IN THE HOUSE (And Fakery Afoot)
","Crime doesn't pay. Just ask the sociopathic poor Kim family featured in the dark tale PARASITE, an overrated, B/B- slasher film dressed up as high art: the latest runway walk sporting the Emperor's new clothes.<br/><br/>First the perps hoodwink a nice wealthy family, taking out the nice poor chauffeur and loyal kind poor housekeeper along the way, then make life a living hell for a third nice family. Ouch. Don't get in this ruthless mean family's way or you'll be sorry.<br/><br/>I am.<br/><br/>I liked the movie's opening shot. Painterly. Black writing appears on the right window pane of the Kim family's semi-basement hovel. For a while, everything was going OK. I liked the first act. Then WTF. Talk about bad choices. What an artistic, intellectual, sense-and-sensibility nose dive.<br/><br/>Tough to give this harsh and disappointing mean-spirited flick higher than a 7. Because even if I give it a 7 for FORM (nice production values, acting, and visuals, but an achievement of FORM at best only slightly better than the architectural quality of the deluxe modernesque house that PARASITE features as the main stage set of its story), I can't give the movie's STORY more than a 6.<br/><br/>Which averages a FORM & STORY score of 6.5.<br/><br/>That's about where it left me when I left the theater: pleased on an emotional and artistic level about 6.5, a bad taste in my mouth, feeling played. But at least I know what all the hyperventilating groupthink hype's about.<br/><br/>But then the filmmaker didn't give himself the awards. The overblown fanfare isn't his fault. He just wrote, directed, and made the best movie he could.<br/><br/>And a 6.5 isn't a bad score or in any way derogatory in my book, especially for a story that feels like a stage play more than a motion picture. For me, any movie that gets a 7 is darn good.<br/><br/>So. Enjoy. See PARASITE over and over if it's your cuppa tea and you find the movie relevant to your life, your vision of the world, your artistic aspirations and work. Different strokes for different folks.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: Actually, all we know for sure is that PARASITE may not have been--and most likely wasn't--the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters' first choice for Best Picture but somehow still managed to eke out a win for that misleading category. PARASITE may have merely been the majority of the 10,000 Academy voters' second and third place choice for Best Picture, thanks to the complex ""preferential ballot system"" (Google it), pushing PARASITE over the top to KO works that may have gotten more first place votes.<br/><br/>How else can we characterize this non-transparent balloting paradigm, based on non-disclosure of the balloting results, than Fakery Afoot?<br/><br/>Or to steal a line from THE GENTLEMEN, ""F*%@ery Afoot.""<br/><br/>The Academy won't tell us the truth. How many first place votes did PARASITE get? How many first place votes did the other 8 nominated movies get? Why won't the academy show us the math?<br/><br/>We can handle the truth.<br/><br/>Instead, the Academy treats us like sheep, preferring to keep us in the dark, misleading us, relying on our gullibility and the necessary illusion (as they see it, in their screwed up marketing way) that PARASITE was the top vote getter for #1 film.<br/><br/>Maybe.<br/><br/>But unlikely.<br/><br/>I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.<br/><br/>Show us the math.<br/><br/>Truth be told, who knows (other than The Academy's Threshold Guardians) how many other so-called Best Picture award winners since 2009, when the Academy expanded the number of nominees from 5 to as many as 10, won an award not for what we're led to believe, Best Picture, but for a category that would be more accurately named Top Consensus Picture.<br/><br/>Or, oxymoronically (and moronically), Top Second and Third Place Picture.<br/><br/>Or how about Most Preferred Picture.<br/><br/>Academy Awards are a self-promotional corporate crap shoot, fueled by politics, social trends, self-interest, personal biases, PR, hidden agendas, mass mind meld, and money. PARASITE simply reflects the latest Academy enabled intellectually dishonest connection between the secret and screwy preferential balloting system results and the name of the award--the fake connection between what goes on behind the curtain and what goes on in front of the curtain in the merry land of Oz.<br/><br/>In other words, to use an analogy: Like our federal elections for President, the Best Picture award doesn't go to the popular vote winner. The award goes to the Electoral College winner. But in our elections for President, though we might not like the set up and feel it's unfair, at least we know how the system works, it's fully disclosed, and the vote tallies do not remain behind closed doors.<br/><br/>My hunch?<br/><br/>PARASITE, true to the meaning of the word, ironically enough, benefited by deriving nutrients at the expense of other movies.<br/><br/>I suspect that PARASITE landed the award for Top Consensus Picture/Most Preferred Picture not by leading in the number of first place votes but by siphoning off lots of second and third and maybe even fourth and fifth place votes, thereby outflanking films of more surpassing quality like LITTLE WOMEN (8.0) and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (8.75).<br/><br/>Again, I ask the Academy to prove me wrong.<br/><br/>Show us the math.<br/><br/>I don't know which force-feeds us a bigger Monster In The House, PARASITE or The Academy of Motion Pictures.<br/><br/>At least PARASITE's ugly monster roams the house out in the open.<br/><br/>(Aside: For Best International Film, PARASITE oddly beat out the brilliantly written, shot, and acted, truly modern and original, artistically and socially astute no-false-note gritty LES MISERABLES (8.5). I haven't yet seen Almodovar's PAIN AND GLORY, also nominated for Best International Film, but I'm guessing I'll like that more than PARASITE too. And, by the way, how did the Academy manage to overlook the remarkable unnominated edge-of-your-seat film-wonder UNCUT GEMS (8.5)--too cutting edge? Not good enough to make the empty 10 slot? Really? And you got robbed Adam Sandler.)<br/><br/>PARASITE not only trots its monster, the downtrodden Kim family, out in the open, painting the family with a thin brush, hiding nothing, and therefore leaving little if anything surprising to foreshadow, reveal, or shock us about their inner life, history, motivations and what makes them tick besides inept pizza box folding, manipulation, high jinks, and greed.<br/><br/>PARASITE also does another thing really well, which goes hand-in-glove with the story's two-dimensional nefarious family. PARASITE reminds us that pressure reveals character--and the arc of the parasitic self-serving Kim family's character is simple.<br/><br/>None.<br/><br/>Nasty family starts out F'd and poor. Nasty family hits the jackpot through fakery and fraud but hits a snag. Nasty family turns violent then becomes poor again and more F'd than before.<br/><br/>Unrepentant.<br/><br/>Unchanged.<br/><br/>And all an empty way for the filmmaker to set us up for some nasty, gratuitous horror and gore.<br/><br/>I was almost ready to accept the poor family's mooching off the rich family as an inspired metaphor for capitalism mooching off society, doing whatever it takes, including lie, cheat, steal, smile, swindle, and kill, to parasitically feast off our commonwealth.<br/><br/>But then capitalism wouldn't likely end up back in the basement.<br/><br/>...........<br/><br/>One final thought. PARASITE tells a story about rich and poor that goes beyond the obvious economic one.<br/><br/>The story takes place mostly inside of a house. A house is a metaphor for human character: Character is a house. You have your interior and exterior. I speak as an architect when I say that in terms of the quality of architectural design, the house has a rich, developed interior but a poor, undeveloped exterior. And I speak as a screenwriter when I say it's the opposite for the quality of the character design: PARASITE's characters have a rich, developed exterior but a poor, undeveloped interior. They are little more than paper-thin characterizations.<br/><br/>The movie's building architecture and character architecture are reciprocally related, creating a kind of symmetry, conflict, clash but not a pleasing kind--because in Story Architecture, what matters most isn't the quality of the stage set design but the quality of the character design. And that's where PARASITE fails most glaringly as a work of art.<br/><br/>The filmmaker created a monster, patching together a subpar exterior building architecture and subpar interior character architecture to create a FORM & STORY 6.5 Frankenstein."

Americans must not have seen any Korean movies before because this tone is very common. There was nothing exceptional about this film but it probably surprised American audiences with many aspects unfamiliar to them.

"slammerhard","7","4","9","16 January 2020"," Don't Read This Review Unless You've Already Seen the Film
","I liked this film even though I consider it overrated. There were several things that I found stupid while watching the film.
The idea that someone is living in your home and you don't know it is not something new in Korean cinema. It has been explored before in Kim Ku Duk's 3-IRON.
Having worked as an English teacher in Asian countries for two decades I found offensive the notion that someone with no credentials and no English skills will be able to pass off as an English teacher. Sorry folks, rich people are not that stupid.
The same thing applies for the dad when he buys the Benz. The director seems to have forgotten there is something called background check and tax declaration. This film is nothing but pure fantasy.
The ending where the daughter dies but not the son, reminded me of the ending of The Host. In Asian cultures the male offspring is more important than the female therefore its okay to sacrifice the girl if it ensures the survival of her brother. The director seems to respect tradition instead of opting for a far messier finale.
The final scene where the dad is trapped in the house in quite stupid and does not make any sense. It's more like a scene from a metaphysical horror film. The movie ultimately fails as a depiction of class struggle because the rich people are more likeable than the poor. The fact is that in Asian countries there is no class struggle. It has been replaced by the ""Let's Get Rich"" mentality. No matter rich or poor everyone is equally greedy however the low class peasants are generally looked down upon not because of their origin but because of their poor taste."

"spookyrat1","7","3","6","6 March 2020"," Over-rated!
","Parasite is a fine example of Korean cinema and an entertaining, cross-generic piece with overt Hitchcock influences, but the best film of 2019 and the best screenplay? Well, I'm sorry I don't think so. Not by a long way.<br/><br/>It's very professionally made and the main themes of class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity are hard to miss. But that's the thing; for a film that's won an Oscar for best screenplay, there's precious little subtlety or nuance on show. Mrs Park is simply depicted as an air-headed social matriarch, with Mr Park, who's supposedly had the brains and initiative to start up a successful multi-national company, not much better.<br/><br/>The Kims on the other all seem exceedingly bright, sharp as tacks, in spite of their living conditions which can only be described as basement third world in a first world economy. I'm not doubting the existence of the banjiha, but seeing the Kims continually lob up to work, so fashionably and immaculately dressed in clean pressed clothes and so intelligently well-spoken hardly rings true. This is before and after their abode (and presumably their wardrobes) have been entirely flooded with sewage.<br/><br/>For me, all the best storylines generally have more distinctive shading of characters and behaviours; not the absolute stark contrasts between the haves and have nots, on display in Parasite. And I need to emphasise here that I'm talking about intelligences too, not just material possessions and finances.<br/><br/>A film such as 1917 dazzled me in places, to the extent, that I was wondering ""how they managed to do such and such a sequence?"" I was entertained by Parasite, but never enthralled, by what many critics were and are still saying is a ""near-perfect"" picture. I can't agree with this sort of summation. Having said that, I must confess to having a leaning towards seeing the black and white edit, that is supposedly going to be on offer later this year. I am intrigued to see whether a look at that might alter my perspective somewhat."
"x-04621","10","3","6","1 March 2020"," Best picture winner- or at least deserves to be.
","Parasite is a masterpiece. From it's funny, engaging opening, to it's shocking, sudden end has beautiful cinematography and great hidden meanings throughout the movie. I need say no more.

"evefarion","10","3","6","27 February 2020"," Hell, if I had all this money. I'd be nice, too.
","Parasite is a monumental picture that changed the perception of foreign films forever. It was less of a film, and more of an experience. Bong Joon-ho has created yet another masterpiece that will never leave your mind. Everyday you learn new things and immaculate details about the film that you never noticed, such as his use of lines throughout the film to represent the split in class and ""crossing the line"". His attention to detail is a huge factor in why this movie is so beautiful, but his knowledge of Korean culture and social class is what really makes this film outstanding. Knowing that the film is an accurate representation of the class structure in Korea is a huge eye-opener to those from other countries.<br/><br/>The greatest part about this film though, is that it speaks to everyone in some way. To Koreans and even other parts of Asia, it's great Asian representation in the media and especially the film industry, considering how well it did. To film lovers, it's a combination of immaculate details and concepts put together in beautiful shots and scripts. To other viewers, it's a great tragic/comedy/thriller full of many twists and turns, leaving you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Parasite connects many different people and cultures through marvellous story telling. Their strive for what could possibly be seen as the ""American Dream"" certainly connects to a younger audience who have the same goals; Go to a great school, get a well-paying job, get rich and start a family. Teens who have been raised to strive for those same goals in life (including myself) can relate to their struggles to reach that goal, which is almost impossible. The acting in this film is impeccable. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik are such a powerful duo and bring light to their characters. Yet again, the performance by Kang-Ho Song is outstanding. His exemplary portrayal of a Korean father trying to take care of a struggling family while saving face is accurate and beautifully done.<br/><br/>Parasite is exactly like it's name. It catches you off guard, infects your brain and never leaves it. This film is something that's never been done before. Breaking records, shaking up the film community and making a huge name for itself. Parasite has completely changed the game and set a huge bar not only for future korean films, but for future films in general. Bong Joon-ho is a master of his craft and I cannot wait for his next film."
"neerajatumula","9","3","6","26 February 2020"," One of the best movies of recent times
","It says it on the trailer,"" you expect this movie to be one thing', but it turns out to be something else"". This film shows an excessive amount of multilayered symbolism and all the ideologies portrayed in the film mainly revolved around the central idea of class distinction. At first glance, the theme may seem quite simple,, but then you start to understand the true nature of the film. The film is filled with finesse in terms of direction. Every little thing has a meaning behind it and all the credit goes to the director ( Bon joon ho) for depicting things so beautifully. The title,""parasite"", suggest how a parasite ( in the film- underclassmen) devours the host. But the movie shows how even in something so nether there are feelings and emotions present. The part where the blood falls onto the pale bread is a masterpiece in my opinion as it perfectly summarizes the movie and it has such depth of meaning behind it. I was trying not to give away too much and that is the reason the review seems quite awkward but honestly, i do not words to describe Bon Joon ho's depth of thought and make sure you add this film in your watch list right now."

","Parasite is a film that represents that cinema is best as a collective experience. From the beginning until the end of the film the audience was silent, without being distracted, immersed in the reality that the film presents.
The script, in terms of structure, works like a clock: the characters, the scenarios, the conflicts are raised, and each element will influence what happens next. The staging is magnificent: an exact combination of photography, editing and direction that manages to maintain attention and tension in each sequence: the way in which each member of the family is gets work at the house, the sequence of the arrival of the family after ""the camp"", the children's party of the climax ... They are very well executed sequences and together they manage to maintain a rhythm as I have rarely seen this year in the cinema.
The message of social class difference is clear but very in your face, especially when what happens after the storm is evident.
My only buts are that there are parts of the plot that feel forced to cause impact, and although they work, they are not entirely convincing. And that in the cinema I seek to leave inspired, not with my head down, and this film is very entertaining but ends up overwhelming the mood.
Even so, for provoking that community experience in a movie theater through the extraordinary use of cinematic language it is worth the recommendation."

The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up.

However in the end director is sending a different message.<br/><br/>The rich family is somehow ""parasiting"" on the poor family and the director tries desperately to depict them as stupid and naive people that only care about themselves even though the poor family lies, steals, and kills.<br/><br/>Through this film, the director shows his childish views of the world where income inequality must never exist and if you're poor it's okay to commit crimes because boo-hoo I'm poor give me money.<br/><br/>It is a shame because it starts as a promising movie but it ends up too political."

Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn't have time to read them.<br/><br/>The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand, particularly the mid-movie plot twists.

","I finally gave up and watched this movie. There was so much hype around it, I was definitely intrigued.<br/><br/>After a careful watch, I think we are in front of a weak movie. From a technical point of view, nothing to say about it: nice craft, beautiful photography. In-house scenes are delightful. The flood scene is perfect. Very interesting camera angles. Nice analogy by putting the poor in the bottom and the rich on top. This is clear when three members of the poor family are leaving the rich family house after the coffee table scene: they are headed home under the rain, and they go down and down and down till they get home. Corporal odor references are clever.<br/><br/>My point about this movie is that we don't have a real story here. Instead, it's a social gag. The movie starts very slow and for more than one hour something that should not be possible at all (the poor family becoming a parasite of the rich family) happens in front of us in form of a perfect plan that works as a charm. The pace, though, is very slow and the whole situation is unlikely to say the least.<br/><br/>After that, something unexpected happens (the housekeeper re-appears) and the whole story kind of accelerates. Couple of funny things happen, but Bong Joon-Ho looks a little bit lost. The plan, apparenty, is to set up everything so we can fit the usual ultra violent scene that every movie/tv show needs to capture the audience's attention. The strategy of the poor family moves all of a sudden from perfect to disastrous, the climax scene (fortunately) is short enough so we can easily forget about it and after that even some more weird things happen (the scene in the hospital is almost stupid, so it is the ending). Some characters are over-used (like the rich family mother) and some others are almost forgotten when they are super interesting (the young kid of the rich family), ... Even the sequence order in the second half of the movie is in my opinion wrong.<br/><br/>Parasite is not a terrible movie and we live in a society full of people that will enjoy the main metaphor being depicted by Bong Joon-Ho, but by no means we are in front of a masterpiece."

Did the director direct a gang of ghosts? The message of the film is politically correct, and although I agree with it, I see this as just another ""Green Book"" cop out.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","4","10","15 February 2020"," A nearly perfect heist/comedy/horror/drama hybrid that is a testament to South Korean cinema.
","If you haven't discovered South Korean cinema yet, Parasite (2019) is a fantastic introduction for the uninitiated. Director Bong Joon-ho has been hard at work over the last 20 years, helping craft films that are thoughtful and horrifying. Movies like The Host (2006) and Snowpiercer (2013) give a sense of his artistic style. Parasite merely takes his ability to shed light on class conflict and molds it into a masterpiece that's half heist-comedy, half horror-drama, and all suspense. If it weren't for the somewhat lackluster ending, I'd give this film the full five stars it deserves.<br/><br/>At the base of Parasite is a conflict between the impoverished and the rich. This theme could be easily applied to any country with a wide income disparity, which is probably why it works so well in the United States as well as in South Korea. To survive in these environments, the poor must do their best to polish their image enough so that the rich will hire them. Sometimes, this requires an elaborate series of prepared and practiced cons to break into financial success. Of course, the threat of being uncovered as charlatans is what drives the comedy and suspense of Parasite.<br/><br/>My only qualm with Parasite is the uncertainty of its ending. There's a point during the climactic incident where I thought the movie could end, and it would be a perfect kind of ambiguity (mostly because there was a finality to it). Instead, there's a little bit tacked on that covers the ""where are they now?"" which-while being an adequate way to show the cycle of dependency continuing-still doesn't give a wholly satisfying conclusion. Regardless of this, I found Parasite to be a fantastic piece of cinema and one that I believe will stand the test of time like other South Korean films like The Housemaid (1960) and Oldboy (2003) have.<br/><br/>A nearly perfect heist/comedy/horror/drama hybrid that is a testament to South Korean cinema, I give Parasite 4.5 stars out of 5."
"chomp15","8","4","10","12 February 2020"," Enjoyable movie but acclaimed for the wrong reasons
","I have serious issues with this movie.<br/><br/>Not because it isn't incredibly well-made, acted etc. I've seen some bad reviews of it which I don't agree with, but I understand where they are coming from. Because at no point is the audience given even the slightest hint about why any of this is happening. Why are this rich family hiring an art tutor for their eight year old? They must have more money sense. Rich people are stupid. Look at this smart but poor family taking advantage, it's all good. Well no it isn't actually. Scamming is a massive issue in Korea. Voice-phishing, molka cams, car insurance scams are an absolute plague and they are, in many ways, uniquely korean issues.<br/><br/>But that isn't why this movie leaves a bad taste. At no point is it addressed why this family would need to be hiring tutors for their kids. This is a very Korean issue, and it isn't something that is exclusive to rich people. It is in fact the norm. It's just much easier when you're rich because no personal sacrifices need to be made. Maths tutors for 4 year olds. Piano teachers. Ballet lessons. Learning 3 or 4 languages. This actually happens. Yes at 4 years old. So an art tutor for an 8 year old really isn't anything to bat an eyelid about if you live in Korea. Which is why most young Koreans would do anything to live in Europe or the US, it's just a constant grind every single day.<br/><br/>This isn't a film about inequality. In fact, Korea is well down the list of most unequal societies. Elderly poverty is a big problem in Korea. Inequality is not. Seoul is just a city, like London or New York or San Francisco that has very expensive districts and houses/apartments. But unlike those other cities, schooling is a large part of the reason for that. Everything comes back to education yet here we are blaming it on 'inequality'. It's fashionable of course. There's always something with the best picture oscar these past few years.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's good to see a Korean movie doing so well. I would rather it have been Old Boy winning the big awards but I have no issue with this kind of entertaining fluff winning awards. Korea deserves recognition as they are producing some fantastic TV and films."

","'Parasite (2019)', like many South Korean efforts I've seen, essentially starts out as one thing and ends up another, constantly tightrope walking a razor-thin tonal line. Indeed, this balance between light and dark is probably its best aspect. The piece delivers moments of humour alongside moments of horror, each as genuine as the other. It's always entertaining, whether comedic or unsettling, and it's very well-made, to boot. Interestingly, the focal family aren't really all that empathetic once they start taking things a little too far, attempting to usurp the innocent and hard-working staff of the rich family they're 'scamming'. This isn't really detrimental, though. It's a distinct decision meant to keep us questioning who is really in the right, no matter whose perspective we're in. What it also does, however, is dampen the impact of the picture's proposed theme. Its comments on class don't really come full circle - at least, not in the way you'd expect. Another issue is the fact that the initial protagonist sort of gets lost once his family moves further into the picture. Again, this isn't too detrimental as the flick plays out in an ensemble fashion and the initial lead still gets a decent amount to do. Each member of the focal family has a decisive personality and their dynamic is believable. For me, the movie's second half - marked by its biggest tonal shift - isn't as successful as the first, despite it being the 'real beginning' according to director Bong Joon Ho. Things become more suspenseful and off-kilter, but the pacing takes an ever-so-slight hit and the more enjoyably inventive filmmaking kind of takes a backseat. Of course, the film is always compelling. It's astutely crafted, too. Despite a few issues, it's an entertaining experience throughout. 7/10"

Give this one a watch and you'll see what I mean. Masterpiece!"
"LansTaylor","10","4","10","26 October 2019"," SO GOOD!
","Although Bong Joon-Ho's American movies have been subpar, his Korean movies still continue to be must see, especially on the big screen. His direction and attention to detail is something to marvel at. Every scene has a plethora of minuscule features hidden in plain sight of the background, which most certainly was not put there by accident. If you have seen Joon-Ho's other film, you would know that Bong punctiliously puts all of these portend in the back drop of his scripts.
Honestly, this is one the few movies in a long time that I can appreciate the emotions it put me through after watching it. I can't stop thinking about all the excitement, agony, disturbance, turmoil, and sorrow that was brought upon me. Bong did a tremendous job creating the atmosphere with the music and complexity of his characters. It certainly deserves the Palme d'Or (I haven't seen The Lighthouse yet) and all the praise that comes with it. I hope Parasite gets an Oscar nomination for best picture but I'm most certain it won't because it's an international film (bunch of cowards).
This film is a great social commentary of the economic gap between the rich vs. the poor (a common theme for Korean movies). At the beginning, the Kim family seems to be like hearted and content on being good people. Later on, after making money beyond their wildest dream, they slowly started to change. For example, before when the drunken guy was peeing in front of their house, they were content on keeping to themselves and let him be. After the money had been rolling in, they decided that they had enough ""status"" to throw water at the drunken guy and kicked him out. Not to mention that they were willing to kill the maid and her husband just so they can keep their image.
My favorite scene is when the sister is sitting on top of the flooding toilet smoking a cigarette. For some reason that scene just resonates with me. She had been putting on this act for so long and just found out that her home had been flooded. Her home, the place where she can drop her act and truly be herself is now gone. So she sits there on top of a toilet that's now bursting with back flow of fecal matter and septic waste. She takes a puff from a lit cigarette in between her fingers hoping that for just one minute she can drop her guard.
The dad tearing up as he carries what little belong he has left from his flooded home was my second favorite scene of the film. He had for the longest time, wanted the rich home and forgot where he came from and what a home is to him.
From what I just said above, I feel like an unspoken character in this movie is the rich house. Everybody strives to get to the house for no other reason than their selfish greed and appraisal for a higher status. The basement is where you can go and hide to get away from your mistakes. The son, after he gets out of the hospital, went back to the house to check on, I presume, the girl. They are all drawn to the place.
As a cinephile, I was pleased to go into this blind. The less you know, the better and the more suspense you will feel. There are so many layers that keeps getting uncovered at each act. The twist and turns in the third act is worth the price of admission alone.
The only drawback I have for the US release is, the film was very limited in my area. It wasn't too bad for me but from what I read, other people said that the closest theater playing Parasite for them was over 50 miles away. I know that not a lot of Americans care for foreign films, but you are really doing yourself a disservice by demarcating yourself and not seeing it."

","Joon-Ho Bong is a true master of story telling. The concept of Parasite is tremendously original, yet feels simple and close to life, and as the story progresses, unexpected twists and imagination are around every corner. The entire film is well chiseled in every aspect. The use of color and the overall cinematography/editing of the film is top class not just for an Asian film, but for any Hollywood blockbusters. Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale."

But that is just because I hadn´t seen it beforehand and didn´t know if it was that good as they say. But I guess I didn´t consider it to win anything much, because in my opinion there were so many wonderful movies represented this year and especially for the Oscar for best movie. There were so many gems and yes, I had my favourites that I was rooting for. I was extremely disappointed when I found out that Parasite won best picture. And then I felt bad and thought to myself well it is not right for me to judge this movie without even seeing it, maybe it is genius and excellent and so much more than the Joker or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. So yesterday I finally got around to watching the much praised Oscar-winning Parasite.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was abysmal for me. Maybe because I just didn´t quite understand how to feel about it, how to relate to it and was trying to think where would the story go. There were some good moments and I liked the camera work, the angles and a few comical incidents. But mostly I couldn´t wait for it to get to the point. I know some people said exactly the same about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as well, that it was boring during the first half. But in that I don´t agree, I was fully enjoying the director´s vision in that, the actors, the dialogues, everything. But in Parasite I couldn´t really find those things to enjoy. I am not saying the acting was bad, but I also cannot say it was excellent in some way.
The second half got interesting for me. I liked the way the story progressed, how things started happening, how people showed their true colors and how human nature is sometimes just awful. And there were a fair amount of suspenseful moments where I actually held my breath a bit and wanted to find out how the scene is going to play out. So, this is all good, this is what a movie is supposed to do - entertain you.
The ending - in my opinion it was good (not mind-blowingly excellent) and morbid (also not a bad thing, but makes you think and analyze). So all-in-all it is hard to even give it a score that I am sure of.
At first I thought I will give it a 7, because as I said, at least half the time I was interested and invested on the storyline. But I guess I am a bit biased since I am still a bit shocked about the whole Oscar thing and it irritates me a bit. In my opinion a Best Picture movie should be amazing, with a wow-factor, with outstanding directing and acting, storyline - it should have it all, it should be the best of the best that there is. Compared to all the nominees for that award, I just don´t see how Parasite would or should win and why it did, I guess I´ll never know."

"kms1592","5","5","14","17 February 2020"," Sadly, Woke Culture Comes to Korea
","After watching the similarly overrated ""Host"" a couple years ago, I wasn't keen to jump on the bandwagon for this one. But so many people told me how ""amazing"" and different it was and kept recommending that I see it. So after it won all these awards and they put it back in my local theater I broke down and saw it. Well, that was a waste of $13.50 and two hours. It's billed as a genre bending comedy/drama, but in my opinion it misses on both fronts. There's nothing especially humorous in the dialogue or even the situations. Poor family scams rich family for jobs and money. Ooh, that's so original, except that it's not. The fact that the poor family is so unsympathetic makes it just unbearable. They're vile and annoying. Is it a clever commentary on class structure in Korea? Not really. Just hamfisted platitudes. The rich couple come off as far more likeable in fact. As for drama, there really isn't much. Yeah, they try to take a dark turn towards the end and there is a feeble attempt to make things dramatic, but I just kept looking at my watch wondering when this bore-fest would end. Then it just kept dragging on.<br/><br/>And for the record, I spend lots of time in Asia, including Korea. I've seen lots of Asian films. I have Asian relatives and an Asian spouse. It's not cultural misunderstanding here. I just think, like that similarly shallow representation of mental illness in the even more boring ""Joker"" film, people want to praise something that they think brings attention to some uncomfortable issue. Guess what? Variations of this class structure have existed in Korea for hundreds of years. Things are better now than they were. There are plenty of options that don't involve scamming and murder. But if you can feel better about yourself by claiming to empathize with the lower economic stratum by suffering through this film, more power to you."

","Since many critics and the Academy are swooning over this Korean film, I was compelled to go to the theater, pay my admission and be ready to read English titles for over two hours. I kept an open mind and found the first third of the two plus hours to be interesting. Mind you, none of the characters were especially likeable--the lower class basement dwellers or the upper class snowflakes living in the architectural digest modern mansion.The lower class family were the true parasites, smelly low class leeches looking for and finding every possible way to become what they weren't--classy.<br/><br/>After the son, the daughter, the father and then the mother managed to become tutor, analyst, driver and cook, the plot thickened and to me went off the rails. A hidden bomb shelter, a husband living in that tomb for four years, a biblical rain storm miraculously not causing anyone of the submerged characters (with hundreds of electrical wires floating overhead) to be instantly electrocuted, cell phones to continue to work after being equally submerged. Not at all believable. And then........<br/><br/>The skies cleared and a gala lawn party was planned at the modern mansion. Here's where I could see Jordon Peele becoming royally pissed. Wasn't all the crazy knife wielding and weird stuff done in Get Out? Yes, it was! So the Academy voters had to make amends for not giving Peele the Best Picture Oscar. Instead they gave it to this two plus hour Korean gab fest.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling absolutely empty. Not moved, not caring, but wondering just why did the performers all have three names?<br/><br/>Avoid if you haven't already given your valuable time."

I spent a lot of time looking at things on my phone during Parasite.<br/><br/>It's a somewhat entertaining movie and it's kind of interesting to see how people live in Korea but it's not believable and certainly not a great movie. The Tarantinoesque bloodbath at the end just makes it even less believable.<br/><br/>LIke I said - I don't get it."

This has been covered in literature and film countless times and often better than this. In this case the poor family are (with the exception of the daughter) listless and dim, not at all sympathetic. The fact they ruin the lives of two people who actually do their jobs is forgivable apparently. In contrast the unlikable rich are in fact a clever entrepreneur and his wife who, though not smart, dotes on her children and wants nothing but the best for them. Not sure why the somehow deserve to be exploited by a family of indolent grifters. And apparently the father's distaste for poor grooming is deserving of homicide. Great.<br/><br/>In any case the movie is predictable except where it introduces 'deus ex machina' plot contrivances.<br/><br/>The finale is idiotic. The father is desperate to drive his kid to hospital. The car keys are under a dead man's body. While attempting to move the body he notices that the man has body odor and pauses to, in a particularly demonstrative fashion, hold his nose and roll his eyes.

","I often watch Korean movies, and they do have a style that is proper to them. I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art.

But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine (who's working in Korean affairs). I gave it a shot ... and ... i was right ; ... i didn't like this movie.
To me, i didn't find the ""humour"" amusing (although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour).
The story itself was pathetic (however that is the point with a title like ""Parasite"").
The end (which for me started at the point they were getting hammered) was overly long and messy.
All that being said though, the actors are really good ; the screenplay is most times well done (although too many close ups) ; but frankly ... it is overhyped.
I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois."

","""Snowpiercer"" is certainly the most competent Marxist allegory I've yet seen, so I looked forward to ""Parasite"" as a more ground-level discussion of how vast wealth warps society and leads to dire results.
It's class struggle, of course. But here it seems that Bong wants to put the lens over a peculiarly American idea: ""trickle down"".
""Trickle down"" - here it is, in color. Here it is: in detail. Complacency and entitlement at the top. Desperate scheming at the bottom.
Just what Regressive politicians all over the world say should happen.
There is even a scene with an expensive table covered with crumbs - crumbs which are then swept on the floor - crumbs from the rich man's table, which are what the Kim family is supposed to be happy with.
But they're not happy, and anyone who believes ""trickle down"" is a workable system should watch this story unfold and ask themselves: Is there dignity here? Is there peace of mind? Or is this all just leading to a terrible collision?
A strange choice for the fat cats of the Academy to mark as Best Picture - but a story that everyone needs to see."

","Parasite is a masterpiece, worthy of all the praise and awards it has received. The title alone has about 4 different meanings depending on your interpretation of the story.

Production design, editing, score, cinematography; they are all top class. The script by Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han is superb, covering a spectrum from dark comedy to social commentary. The direction by Bong is absolutely brilliant too.<br/><br/>However, my absolute favourite thing about the film is the seamless tonal shifts. The film covers most genres that you could think of; from comedy and drama to thriller and even horror and it does all of this without feeling out of place for a second. Some of the tensest scenes I've seen in a film are contained here and they are utterly brilliant. No matter your interpretation, there's a clear message here, from an examination of money (or lack of) and beyond. The movie is spectacular and will undoubtedly go down as a classic."

Is also an ""out of the box"" movie, not for all tastes, I recommend to the audience to expect little and then you´ll be surprised by the script.

"haroldareynoldsIV","8","3","7","11 February 2020"," Depth and metaphors weren't abundant like suggested
","This movie has lots o technical merits from writing to music to cinematography and editing, directing and acting. The story is interesting and weird, but in a good way. It was different and fun, funny, and suspenseful.<br/><br/>But the implied suggestion that there was depth inside of the movie was not very accurate since the movie never really identifies exactly who the parasite is in the class dichotomies; common sense would assume it's referring to the poor people living in the basement or that just finagled their way in, but if the movie was really trying to be artistically grey or ambiguous, it didn't do a good job of portraying the wealthy as that bad of people.<br/><br/>For example, the only thing the wealthy did wrong was imply minor drug use and make fun of the way the man smelled, and frankly, who doesn't like good hygiene? They weren't overly mean about it. They were paying the man good money and were professional and nice to him. And for the drugs well, there are all kinds of drugs and it's not uncommon for any classes of people not to experiment once in their life if not more. So if the film was trying to suggest rich people are equally abhorrent as the poor people in the movie, it didn't really stand out.<br/><br/>No, to extrapolate that kind of conclusion, one would have to step back from the movie and just analyze the title itself, Parasite, and then evaluate, speculate, and rationalize on their own in a way the movie only grazes, yet doesn't facilitate. Since the wealthy family is simple hard working and earned their wealth and all they are trying to do is make their children happy and healthy, there is nothing wrong with that. They earned their money through hard work. The other poor family was mostly lazy. Sure they had some bad luck with the economy, but they weren't seeking work until the son started the whole scheme.<br/><br/>To say that both families were Parasites based on what was shown would conclusively be erroneous, as a result. However, since the movie does raise the subject, perhaps not the Parks themselves, but apparently wealthy people can be parasitic; yes, they may earn their wealth despite having a leg up head start in the world with wealthy families themselves, but that doesn't make them perfect or overall good people. They can abuse and exploit poorer people, or in this instance they can feel no empathy for a family like the Kims whose circumstances were originally based on bad luck, or the byproduct of the bad economy. In other words, the film doesn't really portray the concept accurately, but yes, there are wealthy families worse than the Parks who despite their money are also Parasites. Not sure the movie was trying to metaphorically or ambiguously hint at this, but it didn't do a great job of it, although it does raise the subject.<br/><br/>It was a good overall movie though nonetheless.<br/><br/>8/10"

There are grifters and then there are likeable grifters like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), The Grifters (1990), and Heartbreakers (2001). This movie in a fascinating way has similarities to a ""evil"" version of The Pink Panther (1963) or a more frightening chilly version of The Ice Storm (1997). Over time, the movie does seem to increase in its compelling mystery including a number of well-done tense scenes and twists. It's problematic though that such talented grifters would be living in such a disheveled, shoddy accommodations almost as if the director scripted it that way for dramatic effect and the father's outrageous behavior at the end seems a little overall the top without real sense of consistency with the storyline, except again to adhere to some dramatic script design to impress critics or audience members.

"Cineanalyst","9","3","7","11 December 2019"," Geography Classes
","A lot has been made of the social commentary, the message, of ""Parasite,"" but I think the picture is effective because the message is not overly blunt and because the structure--largely geographical--supporting it is congruent. Plus, it's unpredictable genre-mixing entertainment otherwise. That's not to say the social commentary isn't obvious, though, and rather nihilistic. There's ambiguity and complications as to which characters are the ""parasites."" While one suspects that our sympathies are supposed to be with the lower-class Kim family, they are the ones conning the upper-class Parks. In one sequence, to deter detection, they even hide, crawl and slither about like the insects that infest their own home. But, then, the Parks often come across as a vacuous family of privilege who tend to hold their employees in contempt. In effect, they're all parasites--even the former workers that the Kims replace by tricking the Parks into firing them. Every major character tries to exploit or debase others in some way or another. The Kims get others fired, forge their own qualifications and take advantage of the Parks' trust. Conversely, the Park parents mock the smell of Kim Ki-taek, and they pretend to be slumming it for sex roleplay. Their daughter is more interested in her tutor as a boyfriend instead of as hired help, and even the young son misinterprets a cry for help in Morse code and is a fan for the cultural appropriation of Native Americans.<br/><br/>The only other Bong Joon-ho movie that I've seen thus far, ""Snowpiercer"" (2013) is more heavy-handed in its depiction of class. In it, the rich exploit the poor; it's as straightforward as the continuously-running train. ""Parasite"" is more steeply layered. The upstairs-downstairs class stratification is reflected in Seoul's geography. The Kims live in a semi-basement in a crowded urban area. We only ever see them arrive home by descending stairs, whereas they ascend them to work for the Parks in their luxurious suburban estate with a backyard. While it rains at the Park's home, that of the Kims is also flooded by sewage, including feces raining on them from the toilet. A drunk urinates outside their window and even tries to literally piss on them at one point. Others of poverty turn out to inhabit spaces even lower--in a hidden bomb shelter below another flight of stairs. This further references the larger line of demarcation separating North and South Korea, which itself mirrors Mr. Park's condemnation of ""crossing the line."" Even the hope of upward mobility is represented in the landscape--by a stone.<br/><br/>Besides reflecting the message, all of this geography also serves the narrative. What begins as a black comedy and con-artist film, with actors playing actors, turns into a mix of suspense thriller and old-dark-house horror beginning with one stormy night. Characteristic of the haunted-house subgenre, there's already the aforementioned secret bunker, and there's also a ghostly, mysterious assailant (and the figure of the youngest Park's supposed trauma reflected in his artwork). There's even fantasy in the Kims' son's dream of upward mobility and a grand guignol finale. It's also a well-composed picture, with an exciting score and amusing performances. And, to top off this multi-layered message movie, there's the Morse-code messaging. Messages inside a message... genres upon genres, actors within actors, characters within characters, haves among the have-nots--all underlined geographically."

The smell of the poor family is the same (because of the house, as the girl said, because of the level they live in) and also the rich family. The end was so iconic.
Best actor was Kang-ho Song (the father of the poor family) he gave us A-Class acting. And also the others were so good but that man was something else.
The director and the writer Bong Joon Ho made history. They say films are the history of our age and that man created such a great history here.
On a mid day cinema with five other people in it, it was a great day when booked that ticket."
"gbill-74877","9","3","7","3 December 2019"," Powerful
","Such a powerful allegory for the increasing wealth gap in the world. The scenes in the basement were chilling, especially that first one. The poor scurrying like cockroaches when the lights come on, swimming in their own filth during that flood scene, and turning against one another ... it was all devastating commentary on the position they're in, and the struggle. The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party. This is a message film that works on both levels, as it's hard to know how it will play out, and while dark, it's entertaining. The ending is brilliant too."

","I saw the movie Parasite quite blindly, I hadn't seen the trailer and had barely read the synopsis, but I knew that the director and cast couldn't disappoint me, and the interesting cover attracted my attention to see the movie.<br/><br/>And I made no mistake. Parasite is a quite particular and diverse work, which is responsible for building a story original and charismatic, attractive and yet slightly disturbing, but in a way that leaves us a strong emotion at the end of seeing it. With a fairly solid and interesting start, the film takes a complete turn in half and becomes even more entertaining and fascinating than it seems at first, showing a quality good enough to attract my attention, the unexpected.<br/><br/>However, it's not just the interesting plot, but the provocative narrative and beautiful cinematography that builds the characters in a deep and realistic way. Creating palpable characters full of mistakes and at the same time humanity. Finishing with a strong and emotional escapeist ending, a unique film that is sweetly welcomed into the small collection of original and fantastic 21st century films.<br/><br/>PS: Korean cinema never ceases to amaze, how great."

","This is brilliant satire. I laughed a lot, like a looot! The jokes are better than most comedies I've watched in the past 10 years. The story is captivating. There is nothing in this masterpiece that will leave you bored, dissatisfied, or wanting more. Bong Joon-ho has been on my radar for years, I've seen his best work and so far I have never been disappointed.<br/><br/>There are only a dozen or so perfect movies, and Parasite might be among them. It's a comedy, a drama, a thriller, a documentary in some way. It's amazing. It's my favorite movie of 2019, and that despite Once Upon A Time in Hollywood being one of the best QT and 2019 movies. Do yourself a favor and watch it! It's an easy and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>I know lots of cinematically uneducated people think this is a pretentious, boring film, but their opinion is biased from all the ADHD, sugar and corporate advertising in their brains. They also don't like subtitles. Anyone who knows their movies will truly appreciate Parasite.

","Perhaps it is a ""dark comedy"" that is ""hysterically funny"" as some reviewers wrote. Well, for me it ain't so. The pure nastiness and bloodletting in this movie reminds me of Fargo, which I loved but didn't find funny either. Come to think of it, this movie could have been written by the Coen brothers. It is very long and ultra creepy and I left the movie feeling slightly sick, kinda the way I felt after watching the Dutch version of the movie ""The Vanishing"".
Is it a good movie? In terms of story telling, imagery, and acting, I suppose it is. Should you see it, expecting a good laugh? Definitely no! Even ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is funnier than this movie. Want to laugh? Go see ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday."""

<ul><li>It is quite dragged. (Despite being curious about how everything is gonna end we had to stop and watch the last 30ish minutes of the movie the next day.

Another thing is that the husband of the first housekeeper would have died starving in the bunker, without even attempting to go out and get himself some food, despite the fact he was not locked in, if his wife had not showed up after many days to check up on him, finding him all weak and hungry. And how did Chung-sook manage to clear all the mess so that the Parks did not notice anything if not when they arrived then when they woke up in the morning?</li><li>The movie has quite a suspenseful plot, nicely done, but asides from that it is just not entertaining enough. And here I found myself divided, on one side really wanting to see what is going to happen, and on the other side just dying from boredom because despite of all of the happenings it is simply just not entertaining.</li><li>As for the cinematography, I liked the movie. It is nicely filmed, nothing spectacular, but fitting and suitable to the plot. I especially liked the flood scene when Ki-jeong is sitting on the toilet, that was hyper-realistic and remarkable.</li><li>Altogether, okayish, I would give it a 7-star rating.</li></ul>"

"rhett-46260","10","2","4","11 April 2020"," I Don't Give 10's, I Had To Here
","When I look at a movie as a whole I'm more focused on story then execution first, and am always pleased when the films execution is excellent too, like this film. I went into this movie with very low expectations because it seemed confused and I wasn't convinced the thriller part of the film would work because I set a pretty high bar there. I also never give out 10's because a project can always be improved. In this case, it reached at something instinctual that has only happened a few times, where at the end of a film or book, I immediately, almost impulsively want to experience it again.<br/><br/>Parasite succeeds in a big way for a couple of really important reasons. The intelligent wit and comedy of the film draws out great empathy from the viewer without them even realizing it, and brings you along just enough to be fully invested in the characters. The family is relatable, poor, and have their sense of humor and love for each other that has great reach for those watching. As things take a dark turn into its thriller act, the transition is natural and a part of you wants that playful interaction to come back, but as things unfold you know there isn't a turning point and that it's about to get worse before it gets better. At this point in the film, the meaningful narrative on wealth inequality and its impacts quickly take a full cast you enjoy together and almost seems to divide them against each other. By the end of the film, you've been fully primed for the message and will probably feel a bit torn towards the protagonists and plot as a whole. That feeling is coming from the reality so many have experienced, and for it's masterful strokes I found myself completely hooked.<br/><br/>There isn't a single negative I can think of with this film. From direction to acting, costuming and screenwriting, this film was highly intelligent and used genre as a way to paint new aspects of the story rather than relying on tropes or frameworks within a single genre. The changes from comedy to tragedy itself compels the narrative and that achievement alone makes this an excellent film!"

Secondly, all cast showed the great performance, I believed them. Thirdly, I want to line cameraman's work, the frames looks awesome. I think that some scenes are too long, it's a reason why I didn't rate it more than 8.
So, it's wonderful film about our society, family values and, at the end, love."

","Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises.

Brilliant social commentary with a masterful ability to finesse.
As far as ""Parasite"", like I said, it was just good. What keeps it from being great, in my opinion, is the fact that there were no likable characters. I didn't care at all about any of them. Big miss. There were many glaring plot holes, but I could have overlooked those if he had given me just one character to root for.It's like eating at a high end restaurant where nothing on the menu looks appealing to you.

With the precision and perfect aspect of the rich family, is the perfectly omnipotent framing, camera movement and composition of every single shot.<br/><br/>The static nature of the camera for most of the film shows how normal and static the status of the family is, in contrast with the family that starts to work there. The family that takes the place of the housekeepers, driver and tutors are shot with more fluid and quicker camera movements, to convey their status and attitude.<br/><br/>I could talk about this film for days, so I will finish this review by discussing the ending. The emotional nature of the families connections to one another is perfectly encapsulated through the last line, and the last scene.

It is brilliantly filmed and well acted, but when it comes to its script, I can think of many more efficient, more subtle, less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment. Indeed, Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field, and they did it with fearless gusto, caustic laughs, perverse subtlety -and no artificial twists like in Parasite. I can watch over and over ""Bread And Chocolate"" (1974, with Nino Mandredi) or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period (try ""Ugly, Dirty and Bad"", 1976, for great fun!).

After it won the Oscars,I checked and found the local Odeon was at last showing it, leading me to finally extracting the parasite.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Descending in the opening shot to the Kim household, co-writer/(with Jin Won Han) directing auteur Bong Joon Ho reunites with cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and builds a foundation which continues to explore Bong's major recurring theme of class, gliding upwards to the decadent Park household, balanced with long tracking shots down to the dirt-poor ground of the Kim's.<br/><br/>Astonishingly building the Park house by scratch, Bong and his regular editor Jinmo Yang work in perfect synch with each other, as Bong's ultra-stylised panning shots over the reflecting surfaces of the Park's house are pinned by Yang's fluid editing slicing off the peel from each level of the Park house the Kim's begin to inhabit.<br/><br/>
Housing a magnificent ensemble cast, the screenplay by Bong & Han wisely avoid the option of the Park's=bourgeoisie scum,and the Kim's=the angelic poor, instead going for a more thoughtful study of class and capitalism, (major recurring themes of Bong) lit by wonderful con artist thrills, which get baked into a hauntingly bitter final bite.<br/><br/>Covering the skyline/screen with the Park house, the writers open the door to the house being at a level of wealth which the Kim's (and others) will never be able to cross the divide to reach, leading to a intense doom-laden scramble to secretly retain control on the lowest level of the house,inside a location where everyone's attempt to keep a firm grip on their cut, leads to them all being parasites."

","I heard about this South Korean a few months before its release, the title itself sounded interesting to me, but I also knew it was predicted to do very well during Awards Season, in fact, it went on make history at the Academy Awards, from Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer). Basically, the Kim family: father Ki-taek (The Host's Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), live in a small semi-basement apartment, have low-paying temporary jobs, and struggle to get by. Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock, which is meant to bring material wealth to whoever possesses it. Min-hyuk is leaving to study abroad, before leaving he suggests to Ki-woo he should take over his job as an English tutor to the wealthy Park family's daughter, Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Ki-woo poses as a university student and is hired by the Parks; Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) decides to call him Kevin. Subsequently, the Kim family begins to infiltrate the Park family home by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated but sophisticated skilled workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with Da-hye. Ki-jeong poses as ""Jessica"", an art therapist for restless young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Ki-jeong frames Mr. Park's chauffeur Yoon (Park Geun-rok) for having sex in his car, and suggests her ""uncle"" for the job, so Ki-taek, a former valet, is hired. Finally, the Parks' housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) has a severe allergy to peaches, the Kims exploit this and convince Mrs. Park that she has tuberculosis, and Chung-sook takes over. When the Parks leave to go on a camping trip, the Kim family take advantage, living in the empty luxurious mansion. The former housekeeper unexpectedly returns, claiming left something in the basement. The Kims are shocked as she reveals a hidden entrance to an underground bunker, created by the famous architect and previous owner of the mansion. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae (Park Myung-hoon), has been secretly living underneath the home, to hide from loan sharks, for the last four years. After realising the truth about the Kim family, Moon-gwang threatens to tell the Parks their secret if they do not, in turn, keep hers. A brawl breaks out among Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. They are interrupted when Mrs. Park calls, they are returning home early, the trip has been cancelled due to a rainstorm. Geun-sae is dragged back down below, while Moon-gwang is fatally wounded when pushed down the stairs. The two are trapped in the bunker, while the Kim family scramble to clean up their mess. After Chung-sook serves her dinner, Mrs. Park tells about how Da-song had a traumatic experience years ago when he saw a ""ghost"", Geun-sae, emerging from the basement. The remaining Kims hide underneath the sofa in the living room, Mr. Park complains to his wife about a smell, which is Ki-taek. The Kims, after some failed attempts and near misses, eventually manage to escape the Parks' house. Returning to their apartment, they are devastated to find it completely flooded due to the storm and are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other people made homeless. The next day, Mrs. Park decides to host a party for Da-song's birthday. She invites Ki-jeong and Ki-woo, while Ki-taek and Chung-sook are required to be employees. During the party, Ki-woo heads down to the bunker with the scholar's rock intending to kill Geun-sae. After accidentally dropping the rock down the stairs, Geun-sae attacks him, bludgeoning him with the rock and escaping. Seeking revenge for the death of Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jeong with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers a trauma-induced seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out, until Chung-sook kills Geun-sae with a skewer. Ki-taek tries to help Ki-jeong, but Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek takes the kitchen knife and fatally stabs Mr. Park before fleeing the scene. Weeks later, Ki-woo has survived the attack and wakes up from his coma following surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation, Ki-jeong is revealed to have died from her injury, and Ki-taek has vanished and is wanted for Mr. Park's murder. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. The Park family home has been sold to German family, but Ki-woo continues to scope it out. He notices the flickering light in the house and recognises it as a message in Morse code. It is a message from Ki-taek, who is now living in the bunker, which he decodes. Still living in the semi-basement apartment, Ki-woo responds to his father, vowing to one day earn enough money to buy the house, free his father, and the family will be reunited. The film's title is a double meaning, it can refer to the poor family manipulating their way into the lives of the rich family, or the rich family themselves in terms of labour, leeching off others to do to the work, it could also refer to the sinister character beneath the house. This film works well as a satirical and intricate examination of class conflict, and as a film of two halves. The sneaky set-up is a savage social commentary with an impoverished family conning their way up, and then it completely shifts gear with a darker tone and surprising moments that will get under the skin. It is the first film from South Korea to gain Oscar nominations, it became the first foreign language film in history to win the top prize at the Academy Awards (beating big contender 1917 from Sam Mendes), and the first to win Best Picture and the foreign language category together. At a time where the lack of diversity is debated, this film will hopefully pave the way for changes, it is a fantastic dark comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han, and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and it was nominated for Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!"

","Great movies often stay with me long after I watch them. Parasite is a great movie and one that I found myself thinking about over and over, days after I watched it in the cinema. For those that haven't seen it, it's very hard to describe what sort of movie this is. Part heist, part thriller, very 'Hitchcockian', it's incredibly tense and often very funny. It's amazing how invested you can be in a film with no clear 'good or bad guys', no one in this film is a hero.<br/><br/>Parasite is laden with social commentary, some subtle and some not so! At times it walks the line between believable and unbelievable and will have you questioning every characters morales at one point or another. It is perfectly paced and wonderfully shot. I didn't love the very end, that's not to say I didn't get the message it was portraying, I just didn't think it was quite up to the standard of the rest of the film.

"Explosionman187","9","0","0","12 May 2020"," Simple put, a truly great film. One to watch for anyone interested in the art of filmmaking.
","This is one of the rare times I whole heartedly agree with the Oscars. Since I saw this film yesterday, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and it still have left a feeling in my gut and its visuals still lives in my mind. This is what movie making is all about, it's artistically beautiful, it's entertaining, it manage to capture your attention and is interesting and thought provoking. It makes you feel and think, simple put.<br/><br/>It reminded me a little bit of Get Out, even if very different movies also. I haven't seen that many Korean movies, 5 perhaps, and some of those are some of the best movies I've seen, so perhaps should check out some more Korean movies? And Kang-ho Song has been in 3 of them I've seen, so I must believe he's a very famous actor in South Korea, but I wouldn't know. Anyway, the cast of this movie is fantastic, a bunch of very likeable actors, that portrays the absurdity, darkness, drama and comedy of these characters and situations, in an excellent way. This movie is entertaining because of the absurdity of the situations, that these people come to be within, but also still so impactful, beacuse it at the same time it all feels so realistic in a crazy way. The film, with all it different events and character projection, flows perfectly and also with beautiful, just delicious cinematography and set design. Some visuals of this picture will be in my mind for a long time.<br/><br/>And, off course, the underlying meaning of the the film, as I think everybody knows by now, even those that haven't seen it yet, it's about class, poverty VS wealth. Something that has been going on in this world for thousands of years. As present today as it ever been, I suppose. The gap between rich and poor, it is very much a gap, that alienate the classes from each other. And what this film so intelligently does, is that it isn't hitting you over the nose with this message, it's just there, embedded in the story in an obvious but at the same time sublimely way. I think that's masterfully done by the director, beacuse I think that's a hard thing to acchive. To make such a strong comment on society and the human condition, without being obvious or preachy. Just beautiful actually.<br/><br/>There is sympathy and distaste to be found against the personalities in both familys, with distaste perhaps being a bit of a strong of a word, their human, their very very human, and you can understand both sides. Humans are selfish by nature and both sides just does what's in their best interest. No one sets out to be, or wants to be, immoral or evil, people just live in their own worlds, their own bubbles, and only cares for their own immediate occurrences and problems. Why wouldn't they? Why shouldn't they? Not being either rich or poor myself, I can relate to both sides in this movie. This movie also portrays so well, how different these lifestyles are. How the living conditions of the poor family (don't remember their last name) is just straight up unhealthy, and how secluded and oblivious the luxurious conditions of the rich family is, from the travasties of the poor, the contrast of these two extremely different living conditions is shown again and again, but mostly by imagery in subtle ways, but also so obvious in their subtleties, so it's even more obvious and impactful. On top of that, the film is dark and humorous for entertaining purposes. Witch great acting.<br/><br/>And also, without giving anything away, how the occurrences unfolds towards the end, is not only to give the movie an entertaining and impactful climax/conclusions. It also portrays the real tension of the underlying currents these gaps and problems in society creats. How the big differences and separation of living standards for people, can lead to drastic and devastating outcomes even. But think this movie can probably be interperted in many different ways, and these are just my own interpretations."

","Bong Joon Ho (writer/director} is usually known for bashing the rich and powerful.. In this film he takes aim also at the poor who are depicted as conniving, immoral grifters.

"davidmvining","8","0","0","5 May 2020"," Tragedy
","Who is the antagonist? This question popped into my head after I finished Bong Joon Ho's Parasite and as I read some snippets from Bong himself. He consistently refers to the film as a tragedy, and, as I wondered who the antagonist was, I remembered that in Greek tragedy, the fall of the hero always stems from a flaw within themselves. Then the answer clicked. The antagonists are the Kims.<br/><br/>So, the Kims are a poor family of four, struggling to make a living in Seoul and conning their way into life's niceties. In the opening scene, we see them clamor up to the corner of their bathroom (where their toilet is elevated above the rest of the room) to steal wifi after their upstairs neighbors put a password on theirs. The son, Dong Ik, gets an offer from a friend to cover for him as an English tutor to a daughter of a wealthy family. Dong Ik uses his position to get one for his sister as an art teacher/therapist for the younger child, a position driving the patriarch for his father, and the position of housekeeper for his mother. The first two positions are simply open and require nothing more than convincing the mother of the house to give them a shot, but the house already has a driver and a housekeeper. And that is where the con takes another level.<br/><br/>Ki Jung leaves her underwear in the car when the driver drives her home, creating the impression, when the patriarch finds them, that the driver was having sex with women in his car. He gets let go, replaced by Ki Taek, Dong Ik's father. To get rid of the housekeeper requires more planning, since she had been with the house from the house's previous owner. They end up having to take extreme measures which include convincing the mother of the house that the housekeeper has tuberculosis and triggering the housekeeper's life-threatening allergy to peach fuzz. The Kims are not good people. They're deceptive, cruel, and dishonest.<br/><br/>The Parks, on the other hand, are a mixture of detached, thoughtless, and unfeeling. They're not really good people either. They dismiss the driver without asking him about the underwear, fully believing the worst of him based on a single piece of evidence while discounting all the time they have spent with him. They cast off the housekeeper without even asking her if she actually as tuberculosis.<br/><br/>The key is that both groups are their own destructive forces. It's hard to get into how that manifests late in the film (essentially past the halfway point) without digging into spoilers, so I'll speak in generalities. It's the Kim's duplicitousness that gets them into the situation that undoes them. It's their lies that keep them from finding solutions that will actually work. On the other side is the Parks whose thoughtlessness and lack of feeling brought in the destructive force into their homes to begin with. There are no heroes or villains in this story, only flawed people who can't grow.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with imagery as well. From the scholar's rock that Dong Ik carries around, meant as a symbol for wealth, to the constant vertical motion of the characters. There's a large sequence where a torrential downpour hits the city and the Kims, after having been trapped in the Park's house because of their presumption that the richer family would be out of town all night, run down the hills of Seoul to their half-underground dwelling that's been filled with water, the toilet spewing a black substance because of the messed up pressure. The Kims left their window open that allowed the water in. Would they have left it open if they hadn't spent the night at the Parks' residence? The rain isn't the fault of either the Parks or the Kims, but it affects both families very differently. Atop their hill in their mansion, the Parks simply watch it from their window, appreciating the aesthetics. The Kims get wiped out and end up abandoning their home to sleep on the floor of a local gym along with the others who were displaced.<br/><br/>It's an interesting and highly entertaining look into the class differences present in South Korea. It's alternatively extremely funny, horrifying, and even touching. It can be all three in seconds, and it ends up working because the tone never really jumps. It's evenly and expertly filmed with an eye towards black comedy and tragedy mixed into one package."

","The writer/director of ""Parasite"" , Bong Joon Ho takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected Wi-Fi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film ""Snowpiercer."" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described ""Parasite"" as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. ""Parasite"" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers."

","The allegory of Parasite is well understood by everyone. The rich live in a big house and enjoy a prosperous life. The poor live in a semi-basement, exuding the smell of poverty. The poor imagine that they can also be the masters of the big house , Can also climb relatives of the upper class, but do not know that there is a more desperate place in the underground of the mansion, the bottom floor does not see the sun, live a cockroach-like life, the upward path has been sealed, and the downward path is like a black hole Clutching you like that. The film shows an almost epitome of life in a contemporary society in an almost absurd and desperate style. At the bottom, the upper class is a kind of almost Stockholm-like worship, but resent the poor who live better than him. The dream of breaking the class barriers shattered and fell into the abyss of fate, but the son dreamed of buying that house so that one day his father could walk up from the ground and into the sun. The plot of his son's letter was filled with the most desperate emotion in the film.

","I've been watching Korean movies for more than 10 years. The only people who think this was a great movie are people who have never seen a Korean movie.<br/><br/>South Korean movies are edgier and smarter than anything Hollywood produces.
Parasite:
There was no class discrimination in this movie. What I saw was a bunch of pariahs preying on a very trusting, very naive family, ignorant to the plot unfurling at their expense. These people ruined the livelihood of nice people who had job security. They lied to this family. And the family paid the price.<br/><br/>As for the man who held his nose, wasnt the parasitic family in raw sewage the night before? That said this movie will keep you in suspense. But again it's not the best Korean movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good korean movie watch The Man from Nowhere or Handphone. or A Company Man. You can watch Oldboy or Mother. These movies are all available on prime. You to see how parasite pales in comparison to just his hand for the movies. Hollywood, take note."
"Seni_uvu","9","0","0","30 April 2020"," The Brilliance of Parasite is anything but a Parasite!
","Parasite is a film that sends a deep message about people, especially the class system of Korea and maybe the world. The story follows two families that are in great disparity, The rich but Naive Park Family and the Poor but Cunning Kim Family.<br/><br/>Kim Ki-woo (Kevin) the son from the Kim Family is the main protagonist in light of the fact that the plot focuses on him finding work for his unemployed Family. quite arguably my favorite character because of how his arc ends, from an unambitious blameless teenager to a determined,decided deceiver with a fleeting glimpse of wealth. His character is lesson in how innocent people must commit repulsive actions in order to protect their loved ones (from what I interpret at least)<br/><br/>The Story is written tightly since each setup has a payoff. This is because Director Bong Joon-Ho has written a screenplay that is heavy on Dialogue and the importance of Character Interaction. He further Succeeds by filming scenes with immense detail. The Cinematography is lush yet intentionally metaphorical, for instance when Kevin's Father Drives Mr Park for the first time there is a brighter atmosphere but as his relationship with Mr Park deepens it is intentionally much darker. Close ups are key in presenting the provocative nature of each character especially during the end.<br/><br/>Overall I will say this, I have always been a fan of Bong Joon Ho ever since Snowpiercer (2013) became a part of my all time favorite films and Parasite just extends his talented abilities to write and direct entertaining and thought provoking films.<br/><br/>Korean Cinema has successfully entered western Cinema and I pray that more foreign films embellish the art that is Cinema."

"a_chinn","9","0","0","28 April 2020"," A comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains
","Writer/director Bong Joon Ho (""The Host"" ""Snowpiercer"" ""Okja"") has been on a roll of late with thought provoking genre films with underlying social commentary. From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With ""Parasite"" he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film ""Snowpiercer."" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described ""Parasite"" as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. ""Parasite"" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers."

"forwardls","10","0","0","24 April 2020"," An International masterpiece
","Why is this movie a masterpiece? Why did it become the first non-English-language Oscar-winning film? Why is it ideologically universal and international?
The poor slaves of North Korea evoke sympathy. The poor of South Korea at first - too. Until impunity and the prosperity that fell on their heads made them pigs, monsters, parasites that can't stop from greed. But what spoils their ""raspberry""? A sudden spark of sympathy that had been awakened in the new housekeeper's heart for the old, drenched, ill, and undeservedly turned out of the house and work - for the ex-housekeeper who had come to feed her husband. He lives in complete isolation, in prison-like the North Koreans, but, temporarily gaining the upper hand, they begin to mock the exposed family and, at the same time, Kim Jong-Un. Or the moment when the driver (for some reason?) he kills his master and the young entrepreneur just before he dies suddenly says: ""I recognized you!» (that's why!). North and South Koreans - both rich and poor-suddenly become so similar! What's it? National Korean mentality? Unlikely. So you think: the USSR and modern Russia, slave-owning America and modern superpower, Nazi Germany and the modern locomotive of the European Union-are they not mirror images? In the sense that on the other side of the mirror glass - they are the same, simply inverted.
Money didn't make rich people happy. They become indifferent and blind to someone else's misfortune, but turn into such blind suckers that it is easy to trick them around your finger.
Family values (""banana"" for a hungry husband) are beautiful, but their absolutization makes people sectarian, shackles them with a series of crimes in the yoke of circular bail.
In the age of technology, miracles happen when you suspect that all the teachers (a couple of phrases in English and OK), doctors (who put on a white coat becomes the doctor), lawyers (observe the formalities and enjoy yourself) + photoshop, arrogance and skill - all these professionals are just as fake as, for example, a housewife (I don't know what it is - I'll cook it according to the instructions on the label), not to mention art therapists (surf the Internet and that'll do), coaches, psychologists and other shamans.
Everyone plays, lies, pretends to believe, or wants to believe, but everyone follows the rules of the game. Until something happens that violates these rules: the spark of empathy I was talking about; an ancient stone (""it's so metaphorical!"") that is supposed to bring material well-being, and then slips out of your hands at the most inopportune moment and breaks the conspiracy, and that the hero can't tear away from himself. The smell of a basement that you can't get rid of. The flood is a natural disaster that you expect, but it always comes unexpectedly.
And the film turned out to be light. It talks about values that people neglect, but which nevertheless remind them of themselves in symbols: nature (flood), ancient traditions (stone), belonging to one's social class (smell), family relations (the banana, playing Indians), sympathy (helping a person who got wet in the rain).
A sure sign of a real work of art is motivation, non-randomness of EVERY DETAIL, which creates a harmonious ambivalence of art."

"alexbouf","9","0","0","17 April 2020"," Parasite sucks you in from the very first minute...
","With the likable struggling family trying to make a living in a rough world and then keeps you attached with it's unconventional twists while using subtle symbolism to get its anti-capitalism message across.<br/><br/>As an American who believes in the free market, and the ""American Dream"" of working hard, saving your money (the step people struggle the most with), then investing your money, and shooting for your goals with everything that you have, I appreciate it when movies that are critical of the economic system of capitalism which allows for their to be a larger wage disparity between the rich and the poor then other economic systems, doesn't feel the need preach its beliefs to you with elaborate speeches, but instead opts to let the story do the talking. However, the one exception in Parasite to this was the conversation in the gym that Ki-taek had with his son about plans. And it's this quote that really sticks out to me:<br/><br/>""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. No plan. You know why? If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""<br/><br/>This is an absolutely heartbreaking outlook to have on life and it can only truly be believed by a man who has let his circumstances defeat him. But at the same time, some people are just given the short end of the stick in life. They grow up in a bad situation and often times lack the education, the capability, the direction, drive, or the opportunity to pull themselves out of it. In the case of Ki-woo and his sister Ki-jeong, they clearly weren't lacking in capability or drive, but the lack of opportunity was implied which was why Ki-woo's friend Min-hyulk was a godsend to the family when he presented Ki-woo with the idea of him taking a tutoring position.<br/><br/>What I find funny is that the father ends up acting on impulse when he hides in the basement and the situation of the film with a poor person living in the shadow of a rich person remains the same. On the flip side, the son says he has a ""fundamental plan"" in which he will go to a university, and make enough money to buy the house so he could free his father. At first, the movie tries to trick you into believing that he was able to do so and he is able to see his father again, but then it is revealed to be a more realistic and melancholic ending with Ki-woo hoping that he will be able to actually set out and do it, but never actually being able to do so. This is suggesting that in a capitalistic society, those on the bottom have a hard time of rising to the top even when they have the drive and capability to do so.<br/><br/>But me being the optimist that I am, I cannot accept such an ending. The reason that Ki-woo fails isn't because his dream isn't attainable, it's because he doesn't actually have a plan. Saying that you are going to go to a university and make lots of money is not a plan. That's a dream. Plans need to be thought out with smaller attainable goals set as stepping stones to reach that dream. And judging by the way Ki-woo was raised, he probably never had anyone show him how to break things down to properly execute a plan. That pains me because once Ki-woo gets some direction, he'd be able to find an opportunity to help get his family out of the rut they're in. Of course, in some cases, it's better for you to worry about #1 and to not let your family drag you down with you which is something that I've had to learn the hard way in my life...<br/><br/>Overall, I am happy that this film won best picture, It was an original film with a brilliant script, great acting, and likable protagonists despite all of the horrific stuff that they do. But what I think is even more noteworthy is that Parasite is an anti-capitalist film which portrays rich people as people. And I respect Bong Joon-ho for pulling that off especially when I felt that the biggest flaw in his previous film Okja was that he was anything but subtle with how he portrayed his antagonists. Parasite doesn't have antagonists. It has a working class of characters that are struggling to make a living and a higher working class of characters that is oblivious of the struggles of those that are beneath them."

","As a fan of foreign films I was excited to watch this after its Oscar success, but unfortunately it collapsed in its second half -- so badly I had to abandon viewing it.<br/><br/>The opening of the film, introducing the starving Kim family and their machinations to secure work as the household staff of the Park family. It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums, with superbly executed plots to get the Parks' existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims. These plots become progressively more cruel, showing the Kims' slide into villainy.<br/><br/>The complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house. Here the Kims truly become villains, manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position. It is here that the film loses its way.<br/><br/>Though certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make, they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel. Each faction needs to remove obstacles, of course; each faction shows no restraint, fine. But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long, the audience becomes estranged to all of them. We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters; we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives.<br/><br/>The failure of this film (as with so many of the last few decades) is in the writing and editing. The sets are beautiful, the camerawork superb. But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor. The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society, and desperation makes villains of us all, but this is not a documentary. This is meant to be entertainment, something people can enjoy. Angela's Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience."

","Originally, the Kinkize family survived quietly, poor and undignified and without any hope. However, taking advantage of an accidental opportunity, the Kinkize family gradually drove away and replaced all the former servants of the chief family of Park Society. After becoming the new servant of President Park's family, the material quality of the Kinkize family improved rapidly. (after making money, the Kinkize family became stronger than before and dared to go up and teach them a lesson in the basement where they lived. The drunk man who peed on it). Moreover, the President and his family are very good people, are quite polite to the Jin family, and are full of service to the Jin family.
Sounds like a harmonious story that each side needs.
However, President Park's politeness and satisfaction with Kim Keze are premised on, that is, Kinkize cannot cross the line. In a modern society that promotes equality for all, everyone generally maintains superficial equality and respect. This family would never think of a poor proletariat.
A man is equal to himself, just like a slave
The master and aristocrat will never think of slaves as slaves
Li, civilians and themselves are equal.Yeah. The realistic status and life of the two Convince both sides that each other is by no means equal.Wait. President Park has nothing to do with Kim Keze.To make it clear, but to ask Kim Keze to abide by it consciously.

","But the biggest highlight of this movie is the symbolic meaning behind his plot. The family relies on excellent performance skills to mix into a high-income family and become a parasite life. Although the means are despicable and cheating, with deceit,overall performing is immersing rich families. Until the emergence of another parasitic family, the whole movie entered a dark and bizarre plot. The final vicious murder, and finally the plot of concealed communication by the Morse code, made me feel suffocated."

","Finally a movie comes what matches Hollywood's standards of cinematography and direction # Ideally a very simple tale of a struggling family trying to make ends meet thru a con job when desperation becomes the hour & that goes horribly wrong at the end # but what makes or let Parasite deserve the Best Oscar Movie award is the drama that unfolds in each of these characters justified to their suitable roles , epic dialogues and role play give a definite meaning to the film , but what Boong John Hoo could have done is continued the timeline after the climax unfolds since he stretched it this far to get the message of class divide thru a comical yet satirical approach thru a con family trying to meet ends and justified the true purpose of the movie , that backstabbing in the climax got a bit too far and took away the message of the film and instead the previous climax when it rains showed the true perspective, should have continued with that & with the character of Kang Ho Song proving his loyalty and finding out the true thief in the end and make it thrilling with a twist with still ends to meet like they ended up where they started at the grave end of things # Beautiful Movie shows a degree in Direction of Cinema does hold weightage # So ideally it's nice publicity for a Foreign Film to win the Oscar to gain worldwide audience and throw light on a different culture as this year I dunno Hollywood couldn't live up to its directorial concepts despite big names , Well done Bong Joon Ho could have ended up well and more insightful had it thrown light on other subjects in the city but certainly a great attempt # Korea @ Parasite #"

There is no part of the film where we see any real in-depth look at poverty coming from the mouths of the characters, only their superficial actions which lay against a strict blueprint to propel the story forward to the climax which is the crazy guy coming out and killing everybody, So let's talk about the story: it's literally an infiltration movie, similar to heist movies like Ocean's 11 with much better cinematography. And this is where I give the movie an okay rating, because of the cinematography and overall directing which was done pretty well.

"owanitall","6","3","8","3 February 2020"," Felt for everyone except the protagonists
","Parasite starts out with a rather familiar gritty arthouse vibe. Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the ""host"" family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone. And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie? Not completely gone in the second, but you have to look for it."

"ferguson-6","8","3","8","8 November 2019"," brilliant cinema
","Greetings again from the darkness. At least once per year, a movie really hits a sweet spot ... something that is fun to watch and not really like anything we've previously seen. Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's latest film is this year's cinematic surprise. It's filled with interesting characters, social commentary, a unique setting, a creative and twisty story, and enough tension that we are left stunned as the end credits roll. There have already been a few excellent movies this year, and this is surely to be a memorable addition to the best of 2019.<br/><br/>We first meet the Kims, a family in poverty living in near-squalor in a basement level apartment with one small window. That window is at street level and allows a bit of natural light to leak in, and also provides a too-clear view of drunks targeting the window as they relieve themselves. The family keeps the window open for free fumigation as the city sprayers drive past, in hopes that it will get rid of the pesky stink bug infestation (yes, there is symmetry to this later in the story). The Kim family consists of Dad (Kang-ho Song), Mother (Hye-jin Jang), teenage son Kevin/Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) and 20-something daughter Jessica/Ki-jung (So-dam Park), and they react strongly when they lose ""free hi-fi"" access from a neighbor's system. The family seems to make just enough money for their next meal despite somehow underperforming at their family job of folding pizza boxes for a local vendor.<br/><br/>Fortunes begin to change for the Kims when one of Kevin's friends ask him to take over tutoring a teenage girl for a wealthy family in town. This sets off an ingenious and sometimes quite funny chain of events that result in all four Kim family members working in some capacity for the Parks, the aforementioned wealthy family. The Park's home was designed by a famous architect and it is a stunning modern hillside home with lush garden and a window that stands in stark contrast to that little window in the Kim's city apartment. Mr. Park (Sun-kyun Lee) is a 1% tech titan married to a high-strung woman who is an eternally anxious and over-matched mom (a fantastic Yeo-jeong Jo). Their two kids are lustful teenage daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung) and hyperactive young son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung).<br/><br/>It's fascinating to watch how this family of schemers infiltrates this gullible and vulnerable upper class home, and how they so are easily trusted thanks to photoshop skills, Google, and a street-wise understanding of how to read people. The script, co-written by the director and Han Jin Won, explores the co-dependency as the rich depend on the poor for service work, and the poor depend on the rich for jobs and a living wage. Given the film's title, we soon realize that a ""host"" may have more than one parasite at any time ... something that plays out in what has to be the wildest film twist of the year, thanks to an all-out performance from Jeong-eun Lee as the Park's long-time housekeeper.<br/><br/>The social and class commentaries are spread throughout, and in addition to the window comparisons, you'll also notice that the walk is uphill to the Parks' home and downhill (and flood-risky) to the Kim's apartment. There are multiple layers within the stories and within the individual characters. What begins as a devastating social satire morphs into a wild and crazy time of violence ... without losing its general theme. A comedy of familial con artists bursts into a violent class thriller - the price to pay for unearned comfort. The film is not just unpredictable, it smacks us with a jarring twist.<br/><br/>Bong Joon Ho has become a well-respected filmmaker for his previous work: THE HOST 2006, MOTHER 2009, SNOWPIERCER 2013, and OKJA 2017. This latest elevates him to a whole new level. The film is darkly humorous and unpredictable, with excellent performances throughout. It's also quite something to look at. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong works his magic, and it should be noted that the Park's home is a complete set built solely for the film. I challenge you to notice this - I sure couldn't tell. The film won the 2019 Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival, and it is likely headed for many more accolades."

","To beat Scorsese,Mendes,Tarantino and Philips AND to beat The Irishman,Once upon a time...,1917, et al - I really was expecting this to be something special. I saw it with an afternoon audience who were mostly in their ""twilight"" years and the majority of comments at the end expressed puzzlement that this was the best picture of 2019. Lack of laughter during the performance implied that the film missed its' mark as a comedy. Perhaps its' role as a satirical social commentary of the gulf between the poor and the rich in South Korea might have been hitting targets but surely that would only be appreciated by a minority audience.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt that Ho had been given a box set of Ealing comedies made by the likes of Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer and Henry Cornelius and simply transferred the tone to a South Korean environment. Of course the influence of Hollywood's ""wild man"", Quentin Tarantino,had to appear in order to appeal to a modern audience and of course it is there in the second half. I can only imagine that nowadays, the voters at Cannes and the Academy are made up of people too young to remember films such as ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"",""Whisky Galore"",""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""Hue and Cry"". Otherwise they would have realised that what is being exhibited is not ""new"" and different but is a retread of old classics.<br/><br/>I've watched ho's ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"" and can't help but feel that he has potential but is not the maestro some,usually sensible, film critics claim. For one thing he needs to tighten up the pace of his storylines and keep to a central theme without going off at a tangent. There is also a whiff of patronisation here which implies that everyone in the ""industry"" were surprised that a South Korean could come up with a global hit. The moneymen are surely thinking that this is not a breakout hit for Ho but a breakin hit into a lucrative South East Asian market. Would it be the same hit if it had not been awarded ""Best Picture""? I doubt it very much."

","I've never been a fan of watching sub titled foreign language film. It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films. Anyway with it's success at the Oscars, Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch, so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago.<br/><br/>Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me. The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent. Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though. The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands. The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you'd feel yourself yourself in the scenes.<br/><br/>It's well worth a watch and if you don't share my dislike of subtitles you'll probably love this movie."

","I'm sure I'll get hated to the hill for this, but this wasn't a masterpiece. It was well acted, from what I could tell. Without knowing Korean, it's certainly possible I'm missing nuances of language that I correct in my own mind through the subtitles. I've seen others defending the second half of the movie, but that really is where it goes off the rails. We were enjoying it up until the party started. Then nothing makes much sense. It completely separates the plot into 2 distinct movies, the 2nd of which isn't that good. The movie explains most of its ""nuance"" and ""message"" with plot devices that work out ""just right"" to explain themselves. But they're just plot devices. And the end plays out as if we're supposed to be happy at the reunion? He killed someone that did nothing to him, except tell his own wife ""he smells.""<br/><br/>Snowpiercer and Train to Busan were better movies, tho they suffered from the same ""poor ending"" problem. But those endings were 5-10 minutes long, not 30. All in all, I really wanted to love this like everyone else does, but neither myself nor my wife did, come the end.

The first half is extremely uninteresting and it is difficult to not be sickened by the actions of the family, despite their poor economic background.<br/><br/>There is some intrigue at the second half but to be honest I found the overall structure of the film's plot to be too chaotic and convoluted. compelling enough. As a result, there is something missing from the film. The events that occur within the film are quite surreal and hokey. Some are the scenes are downright bizarre and made you wonder why the character said that in such a melodramatic, unrealistic way. This affects the believability in what you're seeing, thus negatively affecting any sense of connection with the characters.<br/><br/>Forgettable."
"lukas-ingel","5","7","29","10 February 2020"," A very bland and overrated film
","At this point - and I beg you, if you are not going to read all of my arguments, don't just downvote this so that others won't see it - Parasite has become highly overrated. It has got a lot of stuff going for it in a masterclass manner such as the editing and beautiful production design (as well as just people's curiousity, it being an acclaimed foreign film suddenly sky-rocketing in attention worldwilde). But overall the story is bland. It is extremely unrealistic, especially! at the end.
Like, I suspended disbelief with a lot of stuff in this movie to enjoy it, and it's fine, we all do that sometimes. When that certain character was still alive at the end, being able to go out unnoticed by police or really anyone, and understand and perfectly read a huge monologue made by morse codes from a lamp. The amount of just-the-right timing and ignoring common sense in terms of movie logic and even character logic... It's insane. You can suspend disbelief and have a good time, but that is beyond ridiculous. And to be frank, it was unneccesary.
The point the movie wanted to come across was already made at the climax, so giving us two long final monologues arguing them again was more than not needed.
It's also shallow with its message, and missing the point of having something specific to say. At the end, the message becomes something like ""plans are not good, you'll fail if you're from a low social class either way"". Yet in the beginning, their clear laziness yet cunning way of corrupting the rich family is what got them into this mess. Not that lacking a plan and staying the same (feeding off of others) would've made it better. It's really just that the plan they did make was unbelievably insane and not very long-term sustainable. So, what is the point and message again, and how does it count here? I'm sure you can spend hours yourself coming up with some different things which are taken out of this scene and this scene and make sense, but the movie is just too unclear and too unspecific to really get it across overall as a story. Especially! since the situation these people make up (and weren't even forced into) is not really related to how low class people actually deal with stuff such as their place in opposition to the higher class. There's been cases of this, but it just doesn't fit with the point and have any moral or commonsense value. It seems more than anything than an attempt to make us feel pity for people who were low and somehow got themselves even lower. (Which, making us feel pity succeeds, but please, pity is one weak goal for a story when you leave behind the actual fight to get past it. Then what is the journey? For one, I don't like the Joker comparisons, but in this case the main character in that movie tried to get out of the pity before he became corrupt, hence making a point of the hopelessness; no matter how he did the right thing, he would've ended up like that. This?...)
It felt like Suicide Squad writing in the way of moving from one point to another, an explosion here and a twist there, enough to keep you from figuring the whole movie out, but when one sequence is introduced (peach sequence) you quickly figure out that the end of that is going to be the whole family taking over, and these sequences keep happening over the course of the entire movie: *Surprise* *oh so this is what's happening* *Surprise* *oh so this is what's happening*. And it doesn't make for much organic, fluent storytelling overall, or delivers a message along with it, although the smooth and undeniably masterful editing and rhytm will try and convince you of that.
The symbolism is also very in-your face and sometimes outright stupid. The whole going up and down stairs thing to demonstrate class system etc. is cool enough especially watching it as a brilliantly mood-grabbing visual, although obvious (and seriously unavoidable considering it's just how you go down into a basement, and rich people houses usually just live on the higher grounds). Throwing in a rock and leaving the audience to come up with something to say about it is, to me, disrespectful. I've looked up so many interviews with the cast and Bong himself, but they don't seem to know or care about explaining it themselves, they never dig into the actual symbolism, they just go ""here, this is symbolism, it's great right?"" and go to the next thing they love but appear humble about in their movie. A lot of saying that there is symbolism and meaning in everything, yet being very hollow about it, or it's something that is obvious and you'd do in most movies to get a point across. Then I looked up audience interpretations of everything from the rock to the weather and dialogue, and there's nothing mindblowing nor very impressive about it. Especially that rock and what they do with it in the movie, it's just...wow, thanks, makes sense.
A lot of people are praising this movie so highly, yet it's a very decent film without anything too much to say, and an unbelievablity factor that's offensive at last. I don't know why people praise it so highly. If it's just the momentum it's been building up. Rated #22 movie of all time over Silence of the Lambs, The Green Mile, The Usual Suspects and a dozen of other classics which put so much more obvious work into their scripts and therefore the solids of their movies? Winning Best Picture *and* Best Director over 1917, a cinematic war piece you'll simply never see at the same level again, and Joker, a movie that was actually clear with its message - that there is a certain hopelessness in class systems no matter how hard you try? It literally makes no sense except for the momentum and everybody downvoting and ignoring anyone who has got anything negative to say about it. Scary stuff.
Parasite worked on multiple levels, but to me, the writing simply tore much of that apart. It's very sad that other masterpieces were almost completely or completely ignored at the Oscars, while something like this gets away with not only the biggest prize of them all but also several other big ones (Best Director and even Original Screenplay), when there are major issues in all of those departments.
That said, the Oscars are known for doing what it takes to stay relevant and out of too much danger, as well as voting with sometimes anything but commonsense. I hope that in time people will calm down, step down from their high horses and actually take in some of this. And I really hope that some of the other movies which didn't get the same amount of attention and praise at the Oscars, will live on greatly.
A sad disappointment. Thank you sincerely if you've read this much. I appreciate it whether or not we've come to the same conclusions."

Parasite is based on a poor Korean family who thanks to their son tutoring a family's daughter con there way into a rich family's life but not everything is great as it seems. WOW what a movie, one of the best films and some of the best directing I have ever seen, so many good things to talk about here so let's get started here.<br/><br/>First of all, the performances and the Kim family were very interesting. Everyone's performances here was fantastic and I am surprised the actors are not getting more recognition here. Everyone did a very nuanced and excellent job at showing the cleverness of the characters and how far the characters will go not to get found out. I also found the Kim family very interesting. I loved how they were slowly one by one making their way into the house, and the whole family had completely different personalities which I also appreciated.<br/><br/>Next the film-built tension really well and used gore effectively. This film balanced so many tones well, but I think it balanced the tenseness very well. Due to being confined to the house for a large majority it was very claustrophobic for the characters. And some of the camerawork when the family was hiding was truly fantastic and made you feel tense in general but also for the characters involved. They also used gore very effectively as well. It wasn't overused but it didn't need to be, but it was used enough to leave an impact in the perfect way. They happened more out of nowhere which was excellently executed and very startling.<br/><br/>Next the films cinematography and set pieces were fantastic. Wow this film was an absolute feast for the eyes, whether it was the attention to detail through the camerawork or using normal props like peaches or tents in a completely different way this film was just so detailed and masterfully filmed it was insane to watch. The set pieces were also fantastic, I loved the deliberate sharp contrast between the rich and the poor house and both were explored very well, the poor house of the Kim's was extremely cramped and they gave you a good visual representation of what living in the slums would be like, but the contrast of the rich families house was fantastic, it had so many different components to it and each part of the house was explored well it was a great playground for some fantastic and cleverly put together scenes.<br/><br/>My next two positives would be the humour and the fantastic final act. Parasite had a fantastic comedic undertone to it that worked really well the dynamic between the Kim family really worked and they had some great comedic moments together that reminded me of my own family in places, similar to the gore it wasn't overused and I am glad it wasn't as otherwise the film wouldn't of worked as well but it was used enough to get a few good laughs out of me. I also have to commend Bong Jun Ho for a truly fantastic final act that was completely unexpected. I didn't know what was going to happen which was fantastic and left me wanting to know what happens next, and where they ended up going with the film took me by complete surprise but in the best way possible, huge respect for Bong for his masterful directing here.<br/><br/>My final two positives that really made the movie phenomenal was its exceptional script and deep and truthful themes about the class divide in today's society. Wow I think this film had the best script I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The amount of amazing comments on society and clever ways to develop the characters I was in awe of the films cleverness. The films messages about the class conflict in today's society were so insightful it really made me stop and think which is what a good movie shall do. How the film portrayed the naivety of the upper class and how unaware they are of the struggles of the poor was excellent. The ending was also showed the harsh brutality of where the poor is places in society and that is sadly underneath the rich which was really impactful for me I gave this film 99 only because it took me a fair amount of time to realise the true message of the film instead of straight away. But there was just so many little messages that were conveyed so well it really made you think.<br/><br/>Overall parasite is one of the best films I have ever seen, with masterful directing, cinematography, screenwriting and performances which leads to an exciting rollercoaster of a film that will leave you shocked and make you think more deeply about the state of the world class system."

"jay_eh","9","2","5","27 February 2020"," Parasite:Crawling up the Ladder
","There is hardly any doubt that with every discovery and innovation we are inching towards a drastic change simultaneously progressing as well as transgressing. Some people like to call this the end of the human race. However, there is a lot of churning and grinding that remains before one finally reaches the highest level of degeneracy or supremacy. To put it succinctly, Parasite is an animated movie with humans as lead characters and in fact, it is a movie with 'animals' as its prime audience. And animals don't 'see' ; their primary sense is instinct and avoiding all sorts of dangers, their major interest. The question that needs to be posed here is not who is blind but to what degree is one blind. Parasite can't be seen. This particular movie poster is interesting as everyone is blindfolded somehow implying that everyone is blind.
Subterranean Views
On the surface the Park family has a prosperous life; they possess a huge villa along with a driver, housekeeper and tutors. The Teks, on the contrary, stay in a sub-basement infested with pests. Both their dwellings have severed ties with the outside world and provide an incomplete picture - the sub-basement only allows visual access to the lower half of the lane where passer-bys mindless of the fact that corners where they were so shamelessly urinating could be a home to a family whereas through the French windows of the villa, one has an idyllic panoramic view of the pruned garden which in its own way is a slice of manufactured reality as it is guarded by high walls on all sides.
Picturesque Panorama
The movie does explore the disparity between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' but not simply in a matter-of-fact way; it goes beyond realistic depiction and shows how in this post-modern day and age the dividing lines between these two classes become blurred. What seems as a prosperous household is in fact rife in conflicts.<br/><br/>Basti-esque
One of the rudimentary manifestations of this can be seen in the rich son, Da Song who is supposed to have internalised the American Indian, the essence of experience that he captured from his previous expedition. This in any case would have been any other nine year alone indulging in make-believe; however, for Mrs.Park this seemed to be erratic behaviour which had to be kept under check. She likes to think of his artworks as 'Basquiat-esque' and justifies his eccentricity as genius. Neither the mother nor the father try to address what could be the root cause of this problem, instead they keep hunting for a tutor. On the other hand, his sister, Da-hye doesn't seem to be a predominant subject of parental concern.
Da song as American Indian
Ki-jeong and Ki-woo act as foils to the rich siblings as at least superficially they seem to have a better control over their lives, it's the lack of resources wherein they are challenged. In spite of not having completed their studies, they are quite adept to take on the world. Needless, to mention here that Ki-woo invests a lot of faith in his father's plans unlike Ki-jeong about whom the family unanimously concurs that she doesn't belong with them and was meant to be the first deserving candidate to acquire a higher strata.<br/><br/>Mrs.Park comes across as a docile homemaker ,the centre of gravity of the household but that partially is shared by the housekeeper as Mr.Park says that his wife had no talent for housework and that she was bad at cleaning and her cooking was awful and he was thankful to have Ms. Mun Kwang who cooked awesome braised ribs and kept the house in order. On being asked by Ki Tek,if he still loved his wife ,Mr Park sneered it off by saying let's call that love.<br/><br/>The husband is highly class conscious and and in his interactions with his driver he makes it evident that he doesn't like his workers crossing the line. Unfortunately for him,the smell that Kim Ki-tek's family reeks of, doesn't adhere to the class boundaries that Mr.Park is vehemently determined to keep intact.
Subwayers' Stench
Kim Ki-Tek, the poor dad, on the contrary, is not class conscious but oblivious of his reality as a result of which he keeps coming up with make-shift plans, plans that lack planning as a cure to the daily problems that his family has to grapple with. To put it very crudely, he is a hopeless romantic who up until the climax retains his calm and composure. Soon, he is at the verge of losing this presumptuous pensive facade post climax when the story takes a riveting turn.
Plan is a common thread that runs throughout the movie especially for the working class family that is the only hope that keeps them going on in their lives, However, the nature of these plans are to be questioned as they are short term, based on addressing immediate needs and oblivious of the cries of posterity. Ultimately, the so-called plan boils down to its nascent state and ceases to exist as Kim-ki Tek says that the kind of plan that never fails is to have no plan at all.<br/><br/>Therefore, Parasite is an apt title for the movie as it shows how the bourgeois as well as proletariat family exist as parasites, in case of the working class it is quite evident and the complete transformation corporeally too takes place on the night when the Parks' birthday plan to take Da song for camping fails and they have to return home and we see the Tek family hiding under the couch and they have to crawl out sneakily. Also, in the first few scenes when Ki-jeong and Ki-woo are hunting for the wi-fi signal, they sit huddled together in a corner beside the pot is also a visual simulation of pests hiding in a corner. Perhaps the underlying rule of the coexistence of these two classes bourgeoisie and proletariat is that they remain blind and follow their routine day in and day out."
"marcello-scattolini","9","2","5","25 February 2020"," Afterall, what is the parasite?
","First of all, all this opinions are personal and can only be applicable to this especific movie. From now on, I will open my mind how I perceived the movie and how it touched me, not necessarily being a= universal truth. So, read it with open heart.<br/><br/>Photography of the movie is brilliant, as well as the story line unfolding.<br/><br/>Before jumping into what I think is crucial, I just want to remark some romanticized/false assumptions employed in this movie. Life it is just not like that:
1. rich people is happier than the least well-off
2. richness comes out of nowhere, so those people can party all the time
3. every mechanism is valid to get poorness behind, such as scams or tricks<br/><br/>In the other hand, I wanted to remark some authentic premises:
1. Yes, Richness is loneliness
2. Yes, too much money destroy relationship between people. Capital is a relationship solvent
3. Yes, scarcity does not allow people to reach their potentials
4. No, not all poor man is willing to dedicate himself to honest work, and therefore, avoids the burden it brings as challenges
5. Yes, people established in life do rely on strange arguments, as long as they converge to the ""goumetization"" of life style
6. Yes, all people want to feel special somehow special
7. Yes, simplicity is key for happiness<br/><br/>Some thoughts on the characters:
1. One family represents scarcity, first two levels of Maslow's pyramid: what caught my attention was that despite of being poor, they were not dumb. The boy could have being a genius of design, the girl a successful artist. Instead they deliberately opted for schemes and dishonesty. They laugh virtually all the time, validating each other's mish-mashes. They struggle together and they are happy to share meals together. Poorness in the movies is always romanticized, put in a box where everything is excusable. To me, what defines poorness is not the lack of resources or money, it is thinking the whole life by half. This means, understanding how the world works, what are the underlying rules and how to fit on the scene.<br/><br/>2. The other family represents richness, the top layer of Maslow's pyramid. They went beyond the average. Abundance, excess, distance amidst family members, the need to seek everything specially tailor-mad for them (what I call GoT ""gourmetization-of-things"", consumerism. Have you notice how few lines between these characters are there? Compare the number of lines among poor family members vs rich family members. Maybe God lives in what is common, collective. Sometimes I there is a natural, intrinsic trend to attribute to richness what is often there. Let us see why. To provide to the family, the father is almost always away. It is not shown on the movie, although I assure you he has many, many, problems to tackle on a daily basis. Being rich does not happen by accident, it is more like being placed on the top of a pyramid of marbles. As the time goes by, if one is not careful, the marbles start to spread all over the place. It takes a lot of effort to put them organized again. The mother is trying to protect the kids with the weapon she has. Daughter and son seldom touched their parents. There is a hidden cost on the mentioned topics. The cost of absence, which is never depicted in movies.<br/><br/>3. The housekeeper it is a symbol of order. She manages to close some family gaps. Always attentive she keep the ball rolling with excellence. Of course, later on the movie, we realize she is also interested on serving because of a personal condition.<br/><br/>4. The man on the basement, could be seen as ghost and glory. Ghost because of subconscious issues we might carry in life. Glory because he live with little and even though is respectful to those who brings him subsistence.<br/><br/>5. The children, might be seen as the ones suffering the consequences of social contrast. On one side, the overwatch and undercaress. Remember the boy receiving the walkie-talkie? Might be the concrete symbol of father-son distance; on the other side, the being close to their parents, whoa re incapable of showing a constructive trail.<br/><br/>Some other core elements on the story line:
1. The smell: it is a way to show arrogant and pedant rich might be. One of the reasons why the driver stabs the father of a family<br/><br/>2. The special club for VIPs: demonstrates how fragile are the rich family, taking decision on shallow perceptions. Being subject to any kind of narrative<br/><br/>3. The houses represent contrast<br/><br/>4. The stone: symbolizes superstition, something that will not make dreams come true. Also, when analyzed the scene on which the boy is stoned, it denotes the tragedy of poor, how it can come back to those who bet chips at it. The wrong way<br/><br/>5. The booze: a psychological help to make rich life bearable<br/><br/>6. The party: more than being the stage of gore violence, it is a stage where one rich family demonstrates its power (id est status, ego, vanity) to other ones<br/><br/>7. The knives: the killings with knives give a more personal and physical aspect to the attacks, something the guns cannot emphasize. It was necessary to the characters to drown their own hands on the victims and provoke the blood shed<br/><br/>In conclusion, at a first level of reflection, the parasite is the poor family, ""invading"" the house by applying weapons are sensible to.
On a more deep analysis, and I do not even know if the director intended to do so - that is the beauty of any kind of art -, I think the parasite is the alienation, the way people stop seeing other as human beings. This the major common fact orbiting each and every character. It allows the social shock to occur, it allows the contrast to become laughable, it allows greed to flourish, it allows precocious endings and loss of opportunities."

As the story evolves it become certain that this will not end well - and because of the birthday party, unlike any I have ever seen on screen, that happens.
The ending is tragic except for one member - I won't say who. The film is a tragedy on as many levels as there are in the home.
The star of the film for me is the home of the rich - confusing writing of the film - one place states it was a set built for the film and another talks about the house as though it was not.
I have to be very honest about this film - I would never watch it again. I strongly feel that it probably deserved the international film Oscar. But as for best movie Oscar - no."
"BandSAboutMovies","6","2","5","19 February 2020"," Questions
","There's been some anger over this movie winning an Academy Award. It's hard for me to judge if a movie deserves to be considered the best film of the year, because the majority of movies that I love always end up being Italian end of the world movies or Mexican ripoffs of American horror tropes. Who am I to judge quality, I asked into the abyss, ignorant of the fact that I've created an entire site where I do exactly that.<br/><br/>The idea for Parasite comes from Bong's own experience: he was a tutor for a wealthy family and imagined what it would be like to infiltrate their life. The title, which the director argued for, has a dual meaning. Sure, the poor servants are living off of the rich, but the masters are living off the labor class. They've lost the ability to clean and even move around for themselves. Everyone is a parasite in their own way.<br/><br/>Instead of taking an existing home, the house was specially made for the film. That's because each character has a place that belongs to them and another place that is secret to them. Boon also spent considerable time storyboarding the entire film, as he believes that he must be ready for everything before the cameras start capturing footage.<br/><br/>There's a phrase in South Korea called Hell Joseon. It means many things - unemployment, economic inequality, excessive work hours, the fact that poverty is inescapable for the lower class and that the system is rigged for the rich - but it generally means that life is hellish and hopeless.<br/><br/>This is not a phrase that is unique to South Korea.<br/><br/>What spoke most to me is that the history of the world - major battles and the plight of Native Americans - have been reduce to party table formations and the hobbies of disconnected children. The poor have been reduced to, at best, slave labor and at worst, ghosts. A ghost that appears to ruin the illusion that money and status seems to afford, but any man, no matter his station, can ruin and end the life of another.<br/><br/>I've always realized that no matter how good or bad your life is, there are always people with a status above and below you. But I'll lean in and show you my hand. If there is any group that I'm prejudiced against, it's the rich. Yet it's hard to be for the family in this movie, as their machinations only prove that when they get the status they want - even for one fleeting night as they steal whiskey and a view of a yard that can never be theirs - they still hold down and destroy the lives a level beneath their own, only to then learn that their home has been flooded and taken away.<br/><br/>There is no escape for any of the Kim family. The ways that they try to defeat the system through their attempts at grifting. But the system was built by people with far less scruples and morals. The home that promise luxury is also a prison, offering none of the comforts that Ki-taek dreams of, only a place to sneak out of at night and take his own life in his hands just to steal food.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, I felt worry for each character and knew they were all doomed in their own way. They are all trapped, whether by death or hope or the house itself. No one gets a happy ending, even if we wished for one to come true. Is having hope in the midst of Hell Joseon worth it? I'd like to think so, even as this film doesn't.<br/><br/>Is it the best film of the year? Is it worth the hype? Is it worth watching? I can't answer the first two questions, but definitely can say yes to the third. It takes time to get to the point when the staircase to the basement is revealed, but the movie had me from that moment.<br/><br/>It did make me think, as all good movies should. Is everyone a parasite, unable to function alone in this world? Should a father's pride come in the way of his freedom? Should children be overindulged? How crazy is Morse code? These are the real questions I had."

"nambivp-33248","7","2","5","9 February 2020"," A disturbing story of class struggles
","In the opening scene of Parasite, a family struggles to get the WiFi signal in their phone. Ki-Woo gets on top of the shelf and manages to catch the singal. This scene describes the entire film: a family of poor people trying to reach the top. They devise a cunning plan and the entire family gets into the house of a rich family, fooling them in the process. What follows is a story that sometimes struggles to maintain a brisk pace.
The film is loaded with metaphors. Beneath all those metaphors, is the concept of disparity between the poor and the rich. The rich, oblivious to the plight of the people who work under them, continue to lead a life sucking on the blood of the poor. This is shown in the scene where a man hiding in the basement of the house of Mr. Park switches on the lights in the stairs everyday when Mr.Park comes home. Mr.Park however believes that is the work of the motion sensors.
There is even the fight among the poor to get their hands on the wealth of the rich. The entire second half of the film is not about the tensions between the Parks and their servants. It is between two groups of servants of the family, each trying to suppress the other.
The idea that the Parks live in a house unaware of a man living in their basement is an allusion to the perpetual, simmering tensions between the working class and the affluent.
The final moments of the film are a complete mess with violence and bloodshed. Critics of Joker should have spoken about this too. The hate the poor have towards the rich is more pronounced in this film than in Joker.
Leaving aside the social commentary, the pacing of the film is very irregular. There are scenes that bursts with energy and freshness and there are those that test the patience. Also, the reason why Mr.Park gets killed is obscure. May be, Kang-Ho song was pushed to his limit. May be, Mr.Park crossed the line, which Kang-Ho song didn't. May be he was anguished when his daughter gets stabbed. May be, it is the combination of all those reasons.
Parasite is a disturbing film that will leave an indelible mark on you. Still, the screenplay loses its focus in a many scenes."

","This film was the winner of the Palme D'Or at Cannes. One can imagine a lengthy standing ovation being given by the elite, wealthy, rich attendees who wished to laud this condemnation of their ilk. Clearly, that is what some reviewers garnered from their viewing of this interesting film. But on the other hand, there are others who view this film as a balancing act, where there is no clear hero or villain. As such, it is a film that asks more questions than it answers.<br/><br/>One thing is certain: this film is a visual treat. Its portrayal of wealthy society and poorer culture pays great attention to detail. Spaces are wonderfully composed and scenes are so well framed, it is tempting to get lost in the visual details.<br/><br/>But there is a story to tell and it is compelling, even if it is sometimes confusing or even inconsistent. The point of view of the director is unclear until the ending. And even then, one wonders about the final lines, which might contradict what has gone before. The best clues to the intent of director Bong Joon Ho are his earlier films, like ""Snowpiercer"" or ""Host"", which feel less ambiguous."

","This was a clever and amusing dark comedy until it went way too dark and kooky about two thirds of the way into the film. The first two thirds of the movie very enjoyable if somewhat of a clichÃ© view of the social classes in South Korea. It was much more disparaging of a low class family though. It portrayed them lazy, slovenly, dishonest amateur con artists waiting for their next victim. It was funny if you don't take it seriously. I wonder if the director actually wanted you to believe he is saying that this is a depiction of a typical lower class family in South Korea. His portrayal of the upper class family was also clichÃ© if a bit more muted and of course overly simplistic.<br/><br/>The horror slasher ending segment seemed like a completely separate movie. I think it was totally unnecessary and thrown in for shock value only. I understand that the characters and the plot around the dungeon husband and his enabling wife was also added on to the story s a weird twist. The twist of their predicament was amusing if not pretty far over the top. I suppose was a hint of the really crazy stuff yet to come. It really went downhill for me when they tied up the couple, throwing the former housekeeper down the stairs. It looked like she was dead. And then it really started to go off the rails when the Parasite son went into the dungeon with the rock to do what? Kill the couple in the dungeon??? Come on! From there on it was bloody ridiculous.<br/><br/>It just seems to me that the director was just not satisfied with making a fun dark comedy and had to add a silly teen slasher segment for shock value.

"yoggwork","8","4","14","18 August 2019"," Money is so kind, and money can iron everything
","1.General review
South Korea has been leading for 30 years on the road to pursuing art and resonating with the audience.
The traditional view is that literary films are films that are more reflective of profound thoughts, but they also mean a good and tangible experience. Commercial films are just the opposite. Nowadays, the Korean film industry has already had a work that combines depth and perception.
At this time, Chinese movies are still drifting away in the mud of money.<br/><br/>2.The appearance of breakthrough represents more mature thinking
The film depicts mainly class differences and divisions. But the most core breakthrough is the opposite of good and evil.
In the traditional film of the reaction to the class, the rich are always portrayed as rich and poor, and the poor are always diligent and kind. The film is the opposite. The rich man is a hard-working woman who has a family and his children are not awkward; the poor are savage and sneaky.
The reconciliation of this character image shows that the film's creative thinking is more mature, and it is no longer necessary to deliberately highlight the theme through class opposition. And through more realistic role positioning, with the plot, to communicate with the audience.<br/><br/>3.Understatement and into the wood
This film is used to distinguish the class, the most important thing is the smell. You don't need a luxury shoe bag, you don't need to travel Shopping, just such a label that has been neglected and yet vivid, has become a finishing touch.
What is the smell of living in a dark and damp basement for a long time? The film gives a more appropriate description, ""cooking the taste of the rag"". This distinction does not help the audience not applaud.
The whole film did not deliberately render the hardships and hardships of the poor. It's just the smell, with the long ladder in the rainstorm, the sewage filled in the basement, it seems to be understated but it is three times.
As a negative example, you can compare the ""Taste of Money"" (2012), I believe that everyone will be able to feel the shackles of spilling the screen, how boring.<br/><br/>4.Calm, is the biggest gap
After completing the division of the two classes by smell, how to show the gap between the two classes? The director gave a unique answer: calm.
When the male master stood at the window and looked at the hilarious party on the grass outside the window, he could not help but tell the difference between the two classes: calmly.
The version of the poor is given from the father's mouth: ""People should not have plans, and they will not go wrong without planning.""
This kind of contrast is not obvious when you look at it, but when you are fine, you understand the difference in attitudes between life and the scorpio between the two classes.<br/><br/>5.Performance, icing on the cake
The performance of the two actors of the father and mother in the film can be said to be the icing on the cake.
Song Kangxi In the basement and driving, the deliberate expression of self-esteem can make the audience feel the inferiority of the inner character of the wrapped person, and thus can end the anger and stab the president. This is the anger of the little man who was dismissed. In particular, the one that turned back after the president of the thorny center was full of confusion, confusion, and helplessness.
Zhang Huizhen's mother, when she was drinking in the rainy night, had a very wonderful performance. The expression was in a few seconds from scare to anger to fear of the last laugh, and every trembling of the face muscles was a play.<br/><br/>6.Not perfect, there are also disadvantages
The whole plot is divided into three sections. The plots with some fine details can be trimmed in the middle, and the main line is not helpful.
In addition, I don't really like the end of the film. Father escaped from reality and how do you know when to pass information? Reuniting the sun seems to be a reflection of the darkness of reality, but the actual painting is superfluous.<br/><br/>7.Written at the end
There is a stone in the play that symbolizes the flow of class, which was eventually discarded by his son.
For the contemporary society, poverty is the only disease. Stone is not an antidote."

","Dear movie freaks, watching this Koran movie does not make you die hard Korean fans, so take it easy. This movie becomes popular in my country because the news telling that this movie had won Cannes Palme d'Or 2018. For the very first of the scene, it took us on the daily live of lower class in Korean big city, how they survive, how they are growing up, and how money comes to them. Then the audience will surprise with the originality of the story and will never know the ending. The movie has not plot twist, but still will make you close your eyes in some scenes. I believe all the actors here are very talented theater players, because the words, expressions, and how they interpret the story are so natural, then also will make you laugh in some serious scenes. The title ""Parasite"" will be understandable if you also concentrate on what the core idea of the Director wants to deliver, about being a family, a partner in crime, group of friends, etc. Even people clap their hands at the ending of the scene. Now my curiosity have been pay off and still I am wondering this movie could be new standard of Asian irony-comedy. Irony because of the originality of idea and comedy because audience can still laugh while Director put them in some critical scenes. Palme d'Or could be a very good step for Director career and also Korean film industry. So congratulation."

For no reason at all, during the second half, the comedy is completely gone and the movie becomes a sociopathic nightmare. Everybody starts killing everybody with no reason, without any sense and with extreme violence and graphic gore.
WTF???
Why did they abandon a good comedy? Could they really not find a good finish? What is the point?
I have lost any faith I still had for the Oscars. We know they are half political. But best movie of the year? The movie is quite bad. So why did they give it so many prizes? Because it shows a social separation and those movies always win big prizes for some reason. Do the Oscars judges feel a social obligation? Does it make them sleep better at night? Are their lives so miserable that they need to smile on the less fortunate for a false sense of altruism? Or is The president afraid of Corea?
This social inequality might be shocking to many people but it happens everyday everywhere. You just have to want to open your eyes.
It's a shame. Parasite won best picture because it IS a strong critic the the difference of social levels, that many countries in the world suffer. But best picture? It's no even a good picture. It's not even a mediocre picture. It's dumb. senseless and a waste of time.
To be put bluntly, it sucks!
Total shame on the Oscars. Specially with the fabulous movies it was competing against."

","Well, I guess I am just a consumer who doesn't know movies but I thought this was a bow wow. Unrealistic, too many subplots and little respect for cause and effect. Take for example the flood, the next day they were all dressed like Jeff Bezos in pressed and clean clothes. If you saw the scene of the flood - no way! Not that it matters but the movie portrayed the actors as people I hope to never meet. Maybe the older housekeeper I would like and her husband. Do you believe the underground setting as even close to something that is really, not me.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the visuals of the movie. Nice angle shots and perspectives. Good framing and all the yada yada stuff you should expect from films these days.<br/><br/>I just don't see this as a stellar movie. I also did not like the feeling it left me with for South Koreans, yes it is a movie and I hope it only represents a portion of the people in this country but this could really be an issue. If this movie represents only a small portion of the people, what is the relevance, if this type of culture is pervasive enough to make a movie which ""meaning"" then there is an issue with this society in my opinion. I hope it is just a shock and awe movie in a format to surprise people, draw them to the theatre or dare I say the streaming services. After all Friedrich Nietzsche is gone and maybe this movie stands in for him, wouldn't that be good. The movie Nietzsche would make - see it now!.<br/><br/>I hope the South Koreans are not really like this. Oh by the way, nice house except the dungeon. After the awards I am surprised the number of people who in general conversation mentioned they turned the movie off part way through. Maybe the ying and the yang of what constitutes quality and how we view societal relationships is the real discussion here and the perspective we all bring.<br/><br/>I have to say it made me think but after all said and done as a movie did not fulfill what I had heard and I did not really care for it.

","Parasite is a film that is so well crafted, so well told and original that I was left thinking non stop about it for days. Parasite is a film that you should know as little as possible about before watching as it weaves such an interesting and compelling narrative that will have you hooked in minutes. It is occasionally funny, often tense, sometimes shocking and always interesting. Within ten minutes of watching the film I figured out that this would be a slow burning film where the tension rises until everything comes to ahead and it did not disappoint. The film isn't shot in a flashy stylish way but it is still beautiful to look at and is shot superbly and subtly. The acting is good across the board with all the main cast getting moments to shine. The characters are all well thought out and three dimensional all having their own desires and motives. Parasite also has a strong social commentary to make (that I wont discuss for spoilers sake) but is not heavy handed and is slightly present at the beginning before it hits you hard towards the end. This film is so close to perfect but is let down by its ending. If the film had left the ending more ambiguous and finished 5-10 minutes earlier I would have given Parasite a ten. After seeing the film there is no question on why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and is one of the best films of 2019 by far."

The movie was aesthetically beautiful and shot in a way that I have not seen before. However, the premise is preposterous. The rich family were very rich and somewhat naive, but on the whole they were nice people. The mom doted on her kids and wanted the very best for them even if she did not always understand them. The father worked long and hard hours but appeared to always come home. They treated all four of the folks they hired to help as almost family. And the movie made a point about identifying the supposed insults that the rich family made about the poor family but the ""insults"" were not particularly harsh. But I guess we were supposed to hate the ""evil rich family"". Meanwhile the poor family got an innocent driver fired. Caused the existing housekeeper to suffer a severe allergy attack several times and invaded and jacked up the rich family's house when the family was away.<br/><br/>It wasn't a movie depicting the differences between the ultra rich and the ultra poor. It was a movie identifying the differences between an idiot family and a successful family who got rich."

Restrained, and incredibly drawn out, Bong Joon-ho letting too many scenes drag their heels, with the ending taking an eternity to arrive.<br/><br/>In short, definitely worth a watch, but a serious contender for best picture? Surely not."

"kormoskrisi","8","2","6","11 February 2020"," Thrilling and sometimes gullible at the same time
","Parasite is undoubtebly an outstanding movie. The plot is clever and jam-packed with twists, the actors do a fabulous work, the concept and the story is ambitious and it is all held together by a crippling atmosphere. It is alltogether thought provoking, it exposes our societys fundamental problems and contradictions.
While not arguing Parasites worthiness for all the nominations and prizes it has received (including the four Oscars), I must point out one weakness (I might be amongs the few considering it one), that made me give it only eight stars. In some scenes, I have found the movie just as gullible as Mr. Park and his wife. One example for this the way Kim and his family get out of the house after the owners come home. It is so naive that it would perfectly fit into a Home alone movie. I know that this senselessness is an essential of the movie and is supposed to bring a grotesque balance to it, but it also makes the film quite predictable.
But even this predictability is not able to ruin this work of art, and that makes one realize how marvelous Parasite is despite all if its flaws."

"ruwimalpathiraja","7","2","6","25 January 2020"," A moving though contrived dark satire
","The aptly named Parasite is a movie with a message, one that permeates through every frame and colors the interactions between characters. The class struggle between the upper and lower echelons of society (in this case the rich and their servants), is a common concept in most Asian societies and placing this dilemma at the heart of the plot is, in my opinion, its undoing. Although the idea itself is worth exploring through a work of art, it lacks the striking, bizarre and mystifying elements that make other thriller flicks appealing.<br/><br/>Perhaps my misgivings about the movie are mainly a consequence of my expectation that the plot would contain some major twist and supply a mind-blowing climax in the tradition of the classic thriller. Although the tale does end on a violent note, it is far from being unpredictable and even a fairly attentive viewer could foresee a similar denouement halfway through the film.<br/><br/>More of a satirical drama than a wild ride, Parasite moves at a rather sedate pace, and the clever con tricks that prompt a chuckle in the first act turn predictable and even lose credibility, with most supporting details seeming artificial and contrived.<br/><br/>The characters, though well portrayed by a talented cast, suffer the ubiquitous flaw of being agonizingly one dimensional, merely tools in the hands of the director, designed specifically to bring about certain sequences of events. Barring a single incident in the climax of the film, the characters seem to lack a will of their own, the overarching concept of class inequality embodied so perfectly in each person that they appear more like an ensemble of caricatures.<br/><br/>Yet praise should be doled out where it is due, and no element of the film deserves more praise than its cinematography. Despite the shortcomings of the plot, the wonderfully filmed scenes make up for them to a certain extent, the symbolic staircases, architectural secrets (wink wink) , floods and lavish garden parties yielding a veritable visual extravaganza. The score ebbs and flows beautifully with the pace of the film and complements each scene powerfully.<br/><br/>In summary, despite deserving some credit as a timely black satire, if a good old crime thriller is what you're looking for, Parasite is certainly not up your alley."
"Manirakiza29","8","2","6","31 December 2019"," Very entertaining until...
","Make no mistake, this movie is hugely entertaining. Until it turns macabre without a warning. Minutes to the end, things took a sudden twist for the worst, leaving me to wonder ""what in the world just happened?""<br/><br/>I naturally rooted for the ""parasite"" family. They're shameless and wicked to the bone, and some of their tricks were so hilarious I nearly choked laughing.<br/><br/>In this kind of movies, it is expected that the fall is never too far from the rise. I sort of knew that our heroes would run out of luck sooner or later and things would turn sour. Alas throughout the late turmoil, I anticipated some sort of silver lining which, sadly, never came to pass.<br/><br/>Call me naive but how, why should a movie this good leave such a bitter taste in your mouth?"
"frankde-jong","7","2","6","8 December 2019"," A strange mix of genre styles (social drama, thriller and comedy all in one)
","The appreciation for ""Parasite"" is I think partially dependent on the expectations that you have in advance.<br/><br/>I expected to see a movie in line with ""The handmaiden"" (2016, Chan Wook Park) or (an older example) ""The servant"" (1963, Joseph Losey) where the servants gradually take over the power. My expectations where also rather high given the ecxellent South Korean thriller ""Burning"" (2018, Chang Dong Lee) that I saw recently. Both films share the same cinematographer (Kyung Pyo Hong).<br/><br/>My expectations where not fulfilled. There is no slow change in the power balance between masters and servants but the cunning servants overwhelm their naive masters in a breathtaking tempo. In this stage the film has a caricatural / comedy element in it that was not to my taste. It is rather difficult to combine the crime and comedy genres, and only the Coen brothers (for example ""Fargo"" 1996) are able to do this job well.<br/><br/>One can also see the film in an entirely different way, namely as a social drama about the gap between rich and poor. In ""Parasite"" the rich and the poor are geographically seperated. The poor are living downhill and the rich are living in the upper parts of town. In film such a setting has ancient origins. Think about a classic as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Frits Lang). The subject of the gap between rich and poor is however still actual (think of the writings of the economist Thomas Piketty). At the same time as ""Parasite"" the latest film of Ken Loach was released (""Sorry, we missed you""). In ""Parasite"" the underdogs of society are not so honest as in ""Sorry, we missed you"" and (controray to the combination crime / comedy) the combination social drama / comedy works well. It makes the film less moralizing.<br/><br/>I like to mention one element in the film that is easily overlooked but has for me a symbolic meaning. At a certain point in the film the masters notice that their servants all have the same stuffy smell. This smell comes from their damp apartment downtown. The symbolic meaning for me was that the servants are judged after their origin and not after their capabilities. In this way there is no upside social potential and the society becomes static. Success is inheritable.<br/><br/>The youngest son of the masters is a bit strange and likes to be in the garden when the rain is pouring. Visually this gives rise to some scenes that made me think of ""Prejudice"" (2015, Antoine Cuypers)."
"stevendbeard","7","2","6","29 November 2019"," Who Is The Parasite?
","I saw ""Parasite"", starring Kang_Ho Song-Snowpiercer, The Good The Bad The Weird; Woo_Sik Choi-Okja, Set Me Free; So_Dam Park-Fukuoka, The Priests and Hye_Jin Jang-Mothers, Marine Boy.
In case you couldn't tell by the actors names above, this is a South Korean movie with sub_titles. It explores the question, exactly who is the parasite? Between the rich and the poor, either group could be considered a parasite on the other one. Kang_Ho is the father of an unemployed family in South Korea. When an opportunity pops up for his son, Woo_Sik, to be a private tutor to a rich family, Woo_Sik gets an idea for employing the rest of his family, including his father, Kang_Ho, his sister, So_Dam, and his mother, Hye_Jin. There are complications, of course, which come to a head as each member of his family takes the place of a former employee and before it's over, blood is spilled and people are dead.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD, but it would be a good rental."

","PARASITE was the most unique movie I saw in 2019. (The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended."

","PARASITE
RATING: 4.7/5<br/><br/>Heard a lot about this movie, so i finally decided to check it out. The name implies a possible horror movie, hell, even the main poster feels horror-ish. In reality, it turns out to be a twisted dark comedy that comments on the disparities between rich and poor families, and even how the gap between them keeps widening.<br/><br/>You're following this dirt poor family who struggles to just get by. However, there's no doubt that they all love and support each other. Miraculously, the son gets a job tutoring English for this rich family's daughter, despite not really having the qualifications. At this point, the son starts scheming up ways to get his family involved in taking advantage of this rich family, and hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a straight up comedy as this poor family takes advantage of the rich family, that clearly doesn't know any better. My theater was laughing up a storm, regardless of the subtitles. Reviewers, and the director, keep saying that a twist happens in the 2nd Half, which should be kept secret. However, i thought it was just par for the course, and was not surprised at all when the supposed twist happened. As you enter the 3rd Act, things start getting kinda serious and questions start being raised about who's in the right. You have a rich family that's out of touch with the world around them. On the other side, you have a poor family doing whatever it takes to survive. There's even a small discussion about how easy it is to be nice when you have tons of money.<br/><br/>This movie has layers upon layers in what it says about the rich and the poor. Where Joker held up a mirror to society and said ""You are to blame for what happens,"" Parasite presents the good and bad between the families and kind of asks the audience, ""Who's worse?"" Yes, the rich family has it easy and seems to have it all together, but they fake almost everything about their life and are borderline disconnected from each other, and society, while even looking down on others, and not realizing it. The poor family is tight knit, but you start to wonder if they keep each other down because of how close they are. Even when the idea is presented that the brightest family member could easily transition into the rich lifestyle, the movie makes you ask if they should, as that world has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out. There's even a moment where someone in the poor family tries to make an emotional connection with the rich family, after going through a traumatic life changing experience, only to be reminded that they're nothing more than a lowly employee.<br/><br/>Honestly, this movie is great. It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and you wouldn't really be wrong, no matter what you took from the movie. This is a high recommend from me. If you hate subtitles, suck it up because this is a movie that's definitely worth watching."

The theme of the movie is quite interesting and seems to be preoccupying more Korean directors (cfr. Burning from Chang-dong Lee) : the abusive crossing of social class lines... Too bad for the ending. My rating would have been higher would that have been subtle too. Still the movie is good and enjoyable."

You don't kill people because they don't like your smell and crying in front of the picture of the man you murdered won't be a redemption. Writer tried us to grow sympaty for him but it didn't work for me.This kind of unjustified things pushed me a bit and ending wasn't satisfying that much. Acting and cinematography took credit of my rating. Thanks for reading."
"Chandan_Rawal","9","5","23","13 August 2019"," I am not an OLDBOY fan anymore.
","Korean films are doing really well on International platform in this century, we saw how good films like BURNING and OLDBOY was and now it's PARASITE which has surpassed all of them in achieving the degree of how to grab the audience from the real world and put them in the virtual world which they ignore around them.
Parasite is a story of below average income Korean family who really love eachother which is a characteristic feature of poor families. The love to exploit freebies whenever they can...they always use others' WiFi.
The story takes a turn when one of their friends' visits their home and give them a kind of meteroid out of his grandfather's collection and tells that there is a need of english tuitor in a wealthy household. The family agrees to the contract even if they have make fake college degrees. The story will really make you engage once you will sit to watch this movie. There is no way you will be dissapointed by the story telling and characters.
No wonder this movie won Palme d'or since it has stood the test of every variables which are involved in a perfect thriller.

I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there.

","It's a movie from an unfamiliar part of the world(South-Korea) that paints an uncannily familiar picture. But, be warned there are no victories in ""Parasite"" and no one gets away unpunished.<br/><br/>The ""parasite"" of the title applies to every character in this film the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" introduces us to the Kims, a South Korean family of four living in a basement apartment. They're so poor they can't afford Wi-Fi ,they leech it from nearby cafes and earn their meager income folding pizza boxes. A gift from the son's friend, a heavy stone that promises wealth to its owner, works its magic when the son, Ki-woo lands a job teaching English to a wealthy schoolgirl, Park Da-hye. She's part of the Park family, that looks like the negative (or maybe the positive) image of the Kims, living comfortably in a modernist mansion high on a hill.<br/><br/>The Park patriarch Dong-ik is a tech CEO who's barely home, while his wife Yeon-gyo is fluttery and fragile. She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son. He specializes in angry, rebellious scribbles.<br/><br/>It's into this shiny, hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves, after the son Ki-woo is hired as an English-language tutor. He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the family employed in the Park family. Their schemes are exhilarating, clever and intricately plotted.For much of the film the audience is swept up in the thrill of the con. We see them forge documents, invent aliases, and carefully rehearse their lines.<br/><br/>Much of this story, however, isn't told in words, but in the use of space and the way people move through it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit. They're a united front in this battle. The Park family, meanwhile, always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" moves effortlessly between capitalist parable, horror film and situation comedy as the natures of the two families are revealed: The Kims, grasping and greedy yet unfairly stigmatized by poverty (even in their newly bought clothes, they give off an odor that can't be masked), and the Parks, harmless and well intentioned yet coasting through life on the backs of others."

","Hollywood's ""foreign"" classifications should be immediately done away with. What does the designation tell us about this extraordinary movie to call it ""foreign""? Foreign to whom and in what way? Yep, I get it, not made in America (Hollywood) and not in English. That designation means nothing used for a movie of such universal themes so easily accessible to the viewer. The director has observed the Kurosawa principle about balancing all the elements of the film's language, in addition to keeping to his own approach of keeping the narrative and dramatic aspects simple. Even with subtitles I was laughing out loud at the humorous bits. Can western movies claim that when they're subtitled in other languages? This sublime simplicity results in a movie so finely calibrated that it wipes out in one fell swoop the tiresome arthouse talking head cinematic tradition of the west. The South Korean film isn't ""foreign"", it's smack in the middle of a filmmaking tradition that respects the story, the viewer and the very medium of film. Think Kurosawa, again. How sublime in their simplicity are his movies? Critics carry in about what genre it is? What political and sociological commentary the director is trying out. None of that matters when a movie is so tonally pitch perfect. The ""change"" of pace about half way through is so seamless, one gasps long after the last frame that it couldn't possibly have gone any other way. It's the power of the impeccable story telling via the medium of film that elevates this movie above the fray.
Editing, acting, cinematography are all pitch perfect. Hollywood, go cry in your pretzels, with your endless commercial blockbusters and franchises. The centre of gravity has shifted and you are now the ""foreigner"" while the South Korean holds court in the center of the global cinematic universe. Thank you for giving it the ""best"" picture award full stop. It is one of the greatest films of all time in its tone, seamlessness, simplicity, and both the humour and tragedy of the human story it depicts. A great, great, great cinematic experience. Ten stars barely begins to convey the greatness."

","Wow! Parasite is a great ride!!<br/><br/>Although there was some grimness, it's not a horror flick, but a psychological thriller.

","The acting was great on the part of the con artist family. Mrs Park was just pathetic. Her character was played like she had an IQ of 50. I thought the story line as a whole was clever, but the very end was predictable. I knew exactly where the father Mr Kim went. I didn't like that he stabbed Mr Park. I didn't think that was in character, and it wasn't deserved. The poverty of the other family was not the Parks' fault. Their wealth inequality was just circumstance, and they were at the worst just ignorant. I couldn't root for the poor family because I didn't feel sorry for them. They could have used their wits to make better more honest choices to try and get ahead. Instead they chose to dupe people and take advantage of them. I liked that they showed the son at the end sitting in the apartment saying ""someday"" he will have enough money. A happy ending like the one they teased wouldn't have been fitting."

","So far I've watch Jo Jo Rabbit, Joker, The Irishman, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, and Parasite. Parasite deserves the win because it's only out of those movies(plus a few I haven't seen yet) but that's grading on a curve. It's not a great film. It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant)."
"cgcastanedo-75966","7","1","2","8 April 2020"," ""The Parasite Case""
","With a light comedy tone and a very insightful vision, Bong Joon Ho begins an agile story about social classes, their differences and paradoxically their similarities, with great sharpness he also analyzes the legitimate aspirations of social promotion... But at what price?
From this thesis, many themes and subtopics emerge: simulation, lies, threats, which lead to stronger ones: revenge, hatred.
Bong Joon Ho brings such control of his film that he even turns technologies (cellular) into one more protagonist, who will always be present throughout its history.
So far so good, but the climax of ""Parasite"" its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning, the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and / or terror, only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement.
Consequently the film reduces its intensity and interest with which it started, becoming confusing and anticlimactic.
""A case of parasitosis that quickly went viral and spread to Hollywood itself, who began to distribute prizes...""

","Parasite (South Korean) review :<br/><br/>A lot has already been said, debated and critiqued about this film which wowed not just the jury at the Cannes but also walked away with four Oscars this year including Best Picture - the first non - English film to do so.<br/><br/>As for my take on it, two scenes stayed with me long after the movie ended : One is the Kim family relaxing in their employers - the Parks- mansion after they go on a picnic. The Parks are unaware that the driver, housekeeper, tutor and translator they hired are all one family - the Kims having cunningly manipulated them to seek employment.<br/><br/>Talking about the scene, Father Kim remarks that their madam is a nice lady. Rich yet Nice. To which his wife corrects him saying She's nice because she's rich.<br/><br/>In yet another amazingly conceived scene, the Park couple is now lying - incidentally on the same drawing room sofa - and Mr Park observes how driver Kim is a well behaved guy who doesn't cross his limit yet he hates his stink. He smells like an old rag!!<br/><br/>In those two scenes, writer director Bong Joon-Ho makes a solid statement on class divide which may not be seemingly apparent but exists and thrives universally at mind set level.<br/><br/>Parasite is a highly relatable drama - blending comedy in to serious situations - culminating in to a cracker of a bloodied climax. Infact, it won't be an exaggeration to say that it explores myriad human relationships like no other film and leaves you wondering at the end who exactly is the parasite here!!<br/><br/>Watch it online on Amazon Prime. The film has English subtitles.<br/><br/>Regards

Adopting certain aspects from all his other movies while creating a uniquely critical film for ages to come, he has added his name into the directors hall of fame. He won the Oscars for best director, best original screenplay, best international film and best picture matching a 67 year old record set by Walt Disney.<br/><br/>If you plan to watch it, don't read about it, just latch on to the host and don't let go."

"aspamir","9","1","2","16 March 2020"," Timely and poignant
","Bong Joon-ho's Parasite takes on the age-old theme of wealth and poverty and human fate and what a take it is. Artistically powerful and captivating, it throws the viewer into the middle of a very modern and ugly problem: stark wealth inequality and how an individual's life is worth only the size of his wallet. Yet, the film shows how fragile these lives are, whether through the invocation of missiles from neighbouring nuclear power (cornered by imperialism like the husband in the basement - a Frankenstein inadvertently or maybe inevitably created by Mr Park), or other hazards from which even the wealthy have no protection.<br/><br/>The film offers a damning critique of capitalism, which benefits the upper classes of the world, and is ultimately tied up with the global hierarchy of power and wealth - a global system that benefits the rich and powerful. The same way as the damned basement-dweller worships the rich Mr Park for what he believes is ""feeding him"", the working class of the world has been led to believe that it is the Jeff Bezos, Jack Mas, and others who are the wealth creators, who feed the talentless 98%. The film is also a direct critique of the colonised mind, which aims at the Korean (and other) society's worship of the capitalist and colonialist West. The obsession with the English language, their replication of the normalisation of the genocide of Native Americans - ""Indians,"" references to studying abroad and the relentless pursuit of mastering the English language as essential social capital is not unique to South Korea or culturally closer Asian countries, notably China. It is virtually every other country that is in Muhammad Iqbal's words ""have been hypnotized by the West,"" yet fail to see, like the members of the Kim family did before taking a closer look, that beyond the faÃ§ade of extravagance and cash, Mr Park is an impotent man and his wife is a naive woman with no distinction from the rest of the society. There must be something rotten in the system then.<br/><br/>The film has sacrifices: the younger daughter dies amidst the drama in the backyard of the bourgeoisie, the poor goes back to the basement. His son gets his Morse-coded message but rescuing him from that place remains a dream. This is a depressing and hopeless take of Parasite on our modern world.<br/><br/>The film sells as a black comedy, but I didn't even smile - not once. This is perhaps I was absorbed by the poignant subtext. Secondly, I don't see a solution is offered. But I welcome the open-endedness: we can choose whether it the Parks family who is the parasite, or the global capitalism of the 2%. But, it is the hopeless aspiration of the son, that is to become rich enough to buy the house is built upon the his father's prison, that is the most depressing part? If this is the solution, we are at a deadlock."

","Parasite combines multiple genres through a captivating story and interesting characters. The contrast in lifestyles between the Kims and the Parks is portrayed through the amazing camera work and the incredible set design.

","The 2020 best picture winner is a sleeper hit that started to get some buzz last summer, translating positive word-of-mouth into Oscar gold in February. 'Parasite' may be the first foreign language film to win the honor, but it's fair to say it isn't the best foreign language film to make an impression on audiences.<br/><br/>Still, there's no denying the cultural impact Bong Joon Ho's dark family thriller has had since making the rounds at film festivals and theater chains. The two families at the center of 'Parasite's plot deserve much credit for what they were able to deliver - a gripping thriller that also serves as a social commentary on modern South Korean society. Aside from the acting, the execution of the plot, filled with more twists and turns than you'd expect from a best picture honoree, is top-notch. And then there's the climax - talk about a series of events that were not expected. Understandably, this earned Ho a ""best original screenplay"" award - and for that, 'Parasite' did deserve the recognition.<br/><br/>While it is not the highest quality film released in the past year, 'Parasite' is a edge-of-your-seat, original effort that borrows some of the best elements from previous releases in the genre and takes things to another level."

","I like movies that start normal and small actions add up to twists and drama later but in this movie it was everything very predictable. Nothing new. They're just a poor family that starts lying their way out of poverty. By the way it seems unbelievable that they would be such good actors and so coordinated with each-other. The next obvious thing is that the truth will leak somewhere and I kept hoping for some genius way for it to unfold. But it didn't.
It had many great moments such as the little guy being a genius or when the house was drown in sewage water but none of those moments developed further or had anything to do with the story.
I kept waiting for a twist but all I got was a hot mess. Maybe the twist would be if the nice rich people would turn out to be not so nice and naive; or a strange collaboration to happen between the family and the poor couple.
I know that most of the things that happened have a symbolic meaning that try to convey the differences between the rich and the poor but they didn't have a good logical excuse to happen the way they did."

"dchipoco","10","1","2","12 March 2020"," All in one!
","Amazing film, completely worthy of the Oscars it won. It did not follow the typical three act story, instead, it is like watching two movies in one: the first part, a comedy or satire, the second part was more like a thriller. However, the screenplay and the photography made both parts feel as a whole. During the 132-minute movie, it put the audience through many different emotional states. It is a movie that develops many topics resulting from the capitalist world and the increasing difference of the wealth of the rich people and the misery of the poor. It explains the differences between the social classes, emphasizing not only how the opportunities are different for both, but also how climate change affect them differently. However, is not the typical movie that romanticizes the working class, but rather show them with disunity among them and as people who live from the wealth of their masters and do not hesitate to smash others for a little bit of wealth. Moreover, both classes do not seem to understand nor show some care among them. The wealthy people live from the work of the poor, while the poor live from the wealth of the rich...then, who is the parasite, are there more than one? Another thing the director shows in this movie is the social death resulting from poverty. All this is shown in screen through a complex yet understandable symbolism and the mood is perfectly settled with the music. The photography and editing is also really good, my favorite part was a montage with combined more than 20 scenes. A piece of art to enjoy!"

","I finally went along with OSCAR hype and watched the 'Parasite' (just kidding, I was going to see it anyways, I just never managed to get into the theater in the summer when it was in the cinemas. I'm not quite sure did seeing the movie after all the award shower enhanced the viewing experience, or left me with shoulder shudder. I will not say that 'Parasite' is not worthy of all these awards, but considering all the hype - I expected something, I don't know, more. Do I think that the film is overrated, or underrated doesn't matter? What matters, is that 'Parasite' is a wonderful movie. I must give the highest praise to the actors. The story was intriguing with several layers, and it contained some unpredictable twists and turns along the way. I have a hard time to find perfect words to praise the cinematography - the camera (literally) danced with the actors and with the story. Yet, it was all so subtle that if you just didn't turn your attention to awe at the cinematography, you almost didn't notice it. Same thing with editing. The magnificent aspect was also the way the story was told - it started like absurdist comedy, then turned to quite spicy satire, then all of the sudden gory thriller and then ending this all with a nice touch of morale, but without preaching. The change in the atmosphere didn't ruin the pace or make the film lose its focus. The characters were clear, each one of them perfectly fleshed out. At least, the best original screenplay award is well earned.<br/><br/>Besides being visually poetical and masterfully acted, the movie raises some poignant questions. People praise how good of overview 'Parasite' gives on South-Korean society, but to be honest - all the 'First World' countries are dealing with the same problems. No matter which economical class we are, people ale too self-absorbed, that they don't see the faults in themselves - everything is someone else's fault. While different people struggling for the same goal, rather than becoming allies and work together, they start to compete, and that usually means, that both sides will lose (that is just philosophizing, it is not a spoiler).<br/><br/>Was it the most important film in 2019? Well, I don't know, because I haven't seen most of them, but 'Parasite' is most definitely a rare masterpiece that can be entertaining and what most important, thought-provoking at the same time."

","The Best Picture win for ""Parasite"" finally convinced some local cinemas to me to give it a whirl. Though I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I know genuinely know enough about South Korea class systems to be sure that I fully understood it. (Also, I apologise in advance for butchering South Korean Nomenclature in the next paragraph)<br/><br/>Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) lives in a subterranean apartment with his family. One day, he is offered the chance to tutor English to Park Da-Hye (Jung Ji-So) the daughter of a wealthy family. Spying the opportunity to exploit the family, Ki-Woo brings in his sister Kim Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) as art tutor to Da-Hye's younger brother. His father, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) replaces the family's chauffer and most importantly, his mother, Park Chung-sook (Jang Hye-Jin) replaces Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) as the families trusted housekeeper. All is going well for the Kim family, until one night when the Parks are away - the former housekeeper returns and requests access to the basement, to collect something she's left behind.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Parasite"" a lot. The performances are great. Kim Ki-taek is probably the standout but there really is nobody who lets the film down. The direction and cinematography are excellent. I enjoyed the story, and particular, not knowing exactly where the film was going to go. I'd seen ""The Host"" before, so I know that Boon Joon-Ho is capable of taking his films into B-Movie territory so I had all sorts of potential horror/science fiction plots in mind. I don't feel like the film suffered in the second half although I accept that for some the switch from a confidence trickster movie to more of a revenge thriller might be a bit too much for some.<br/><br/>My problem was that I really don't know much about how South Korean society works. I'm assuming that he film is parable about the tiered levels of class and money in Korea. That the ""Parasite"" of the title can be considered both as the Kim family scamming money from the Parks, and the Parks living of the labour of their lower class employees. But again, I feel like I'm guessing this, rather than being sure.<br/><br/>That doesn't really affect my appreciation though of an excellent film and a worthy best picture winner this year."

","This is a fun, different movie. But, to be totally honest, as a lover of Asian cinema, not that different. For example Thirst by Park Chan-Wook is off the charts different. But, an ok, if somewhat erratic, sloppy dark comedy nonetheless.<br/><br/>Full of unexpected twists and turns. Some plot points go nowhere unfortunately. Quite a bit of focus at one point in the movie is on the fact that the previous housekeeper's face has been beaten. In fact, the question is specifically raised as to what happened and yet.... never answered. WTF?<br/><br/>A quirky look at the class divide. I found the wrap up at the end a little long and unnecessary, and honestly found some of the final scenes discordant. Switching to a narrated jumpy set of scenes with a dream scene thrown in for good measure. It all seened very amateurish. Which is sad because the first 3 quarters were great.<br/><br/>The individual buttons for the individual stair pendant lights? Really? A ridiculous prop to build in the morse code prop which, in itself, was trivial and silly. Also the master architect designed his escape bunker to resemble a horror set with no egress to the outside world? Very very incongruous and illogical.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy? I definitely don't agree, but there you go.<br/><br/>An amusing non Hollywood movie but so so when compared to its Asian peers.

This combination of different genres across the film with really good measure makes the film to be really entertaining, and at the same time artistically profound due to the cinematography and use of minimalistic environments and shots that creates a good atmosphere really quickly<br/><br/>I think this movie shows perfectly how we shouldn't believe in the american dream, because the higher amounts of drawbacks that we have against us, it is very likely that we aren't going to reach the ""dream"", and this is really obvious at the end of the movie.

"gcsman","8","1","2","18 December 2019"," A clever, very modern tragicomedy.
","I'm not sure I would have seen this film without my wife's prodding, and it's partly because of the title. It's accurate enough to the storyline but as an English word it's a bit creepy in tone. I think it needed a somewhat different translation from the original Korean. But on to the film itself: obviously it's a labor of love for Bong Joon Ho, who's the writer, director, and producer. I didn't know any of the actors beforehand but they are all just fine, and they do a great job at making each one have distinct personalities among a fairly big cast of speaking roles. I also like that in our theater we got subtitles rather than some clumsy dubbing. (and the subtitles are the best and most accurate I've seen in recent times.)<br/><br/>For lack of a better term I would describe this as a tragicomedy. A slum-dwelling family of four in an unnamed Korean city live by their wits on odd jobs. Through a series clever little twists they find a way to gradually insinuate themselves into jobs as servants to a young rich suburbanite family who never suspect what they're getting. (The young family are indeed rich enough to pay a whole coterie of servants including a driver, tutor, housekeeper, and nanny, but they're not uber-rich like the Crazy Rich Asians -- they actually do work hard and have their own issues. Not knowing any better, I'll take it for granted that their ultra-modern Western-style home and garden are realistic depictions of that class.) For about the first half of the movie this plotline is played for a good deal of humor. But then through another series of twists this house of cards comes down and things go sideways , leading to a rather shocking final scene. Quite a lot hinges on the maybe-improbable presence of a hidden underground bunker and a key character introduced very late in the story (no spoilers). There turns out to be more than one ""parasite"" at work, and it's more than just the young rich folks who don't know what they are getting into.<br/><br/>It's a complex, multilayered story (2:12 run time) and the director throws quite a lot at us. But there are no wasted or unnecessary scenes. A prominent example is during a freak torrential rainstorm. The rich folks (on the high ground, as we notice for the first time) just sit inside their beautiful garden, while the poor slum dwellers cannot save their pathetic basement flat from being washed away (complete with raw sewage in the streets). It's excruciating to watch, and this is where the message hits home. Basically decent people are forced into doing things they shouldn't do by their own circumstances and there is in the end nothing they can do to escape. The message that class determines destiny was quite a bit more overt in Bong's previous effort Snowpiercer, but it's present here too throughout.<br/><br/>At the end, everyone is left damaged, but we're given a wistful little coda that holds out just a tiny ray of hope. That's only human."

","We've only been through the middle of 2019, but I think that I can mark the fact that I experienced the cinema event of the year, or at least one of the important events of the year in movies. This is the film by Korean director Joon-ho Bong, 'Gisaengchung' / 'Parasite'. It has already received 'Palme d'Or' at the Cannes festival, and this time I believe that the jury's choice is extremely appropriate. 'Parasite' is a profound and complex cinematographic work, which does not hesitate to ask painful questions about the huge differences between the social classes and the deep prejudices that divide them in today's world, but it does so in an elegant and expressive way, with images. and characters who have a chance to remain in the memory of the spectators for a long time, causing them to reflect but also engaging them with a captivating story.<br/><br/>At the center of the story of the film are two families from today's South Korea, located at the two extremes of the society. The Parks live in a spacious and luxurious villa, full of works of art and surrounded by green landscape. He is the CEO of a large company, she is a spoiled housewife, the kids, a girl and a boy are even more spoiled. They are all surrounded by servants, drivers, tutors for children. The Kis live crammed into an unhealthy half-underground flat. The parents are unemployed, their children are smart young people, but with little chance of overcoming their social condition because of the poverty. The homes of the two families play a significant role in the story, the luxury and order of the Parks' villa hides secrets, while the claustrophobic disorder of the Kis' family home is similar to that of the family in the movie 'Shoplifters' of the Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda. The destinies of two families accidentally intersect when the boy in the poor family becomes (with the help of forged references) the private tutor of the daughter of the rich family. As relationships intensify, cultural differences seem to diminish, the less fortunate family being equal or even superior in adapting to life and in the cultural interactions. Until about halfway through the movie, the audience is watching a social satire in a light style, a kind of 'rich family vs. poor family' story. And then everything changes.<br/><br/>A few weeks ago, writing about another Korean film, I noticed that many of the films that came from there defy genre cataloging and combine different styles into original and surprising mosaics. 'Parasite' is yet another example in this regard. We have here manifested social satire, melodrama, humor, love among teenagers, horror in the Gothic style, comments on art, a natural catastrophe, neo-realistic poverty and soap operas wealth. Stanley Kubrick and Yorgos Lanthimos are quoted. The natural tendency of the spectator to take the part of the oppressed in the class conflict that takes place in front of us is put to the test by the events that happen on the screen. 'Parasite' is an excellently acted movie, filmed in style, a story with many ramifications and meanings, which will not be easily forgotten by the spectators and which gives them material to think about the society and the world in which we live."
"dealignment","3","8","46","11 February 2020"," The most over rated movie I know
","Mother in 2009 is one of my all time favorite movies. This movie was weak with a terrible & predictable ending. It only won an Oscar the downward slide of Hollywoods unoriginality"
"ed-walker263-547-984370","7","4","18","11 February 2020"," Don't (completely) believe the hype
","I think the only reason I was mildly disappointed with this film was all the hype, including of course the Oscar win.
If I'd stumbled upon this foreign-language (to me) film, I would have been, I'm sure, thoroughly delighted and surprised.
But given that it's supposedly THE BEST FILM of all those released in the last 12 months, well, I find myself in unexpected agreement with Joan Collins, an Academy member, who on Britain's morning GMB show said she thought it was a good film; just not The Best Film (although she also admitted to not having watched the last 20 mins, as it got a bit 'dark' - I assume she meant emotionally, not visually - and she was having trouble with the subtitles on her apparently tiny TV screen. Get a 60-inch, Joan, if you're being asked to vote!)
It surely does twist and turn, and goes from a light-hearted, almost Ealing comedy vibe, into a slasher in the woods horror flick. The acting is great. The characters, on the whole, believable, but as the closing credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.
Why?
Well, I'm probably in a minority with Joan here, but I guess it was the whole story arc that left me unsatisfied. I would have been more satiated with an ending that allowed the nice, though slightly moralistically-challenged poor 'parasites' to get their rewards, while at the same time allowing the rich, privileged class to see the error of their ways. The rich folk here were, as far as I could see, perfectly nice people, apart from objecting politely to the smell of their poorer employees. Did they deserve all they got? I don't think so.
That's perhaps just a reflection of different story-telling techniques around the world. Maybe here in the UK/US we expect Disneyfied Hollywood endings, and this was not one of those. I still can't see quite why the dad/chauffeur decided to stab his employer to death. I can't see how the son of the poorer family survived two enormous blows to his scalp with a sizeable rock, with nothing to show for it than a temporary frontal lobe syndrome that made him laugh and smile uncontrollably, until, for no explained reason, that symptom disappeared when he was looking at news footage of the 'crime scene'.
Those details left me feeling uncomfortable, and less than satisfied.
Was it just the Hollywood zeitgeist that got this film the Oscar? Let's give it to a foreign language film for the first time, they said. That'll - if not silence our critics, then at least give them something to chew on. That's probably unfair, but, for instance, Rocketman sent me on a far more roller-coaster emotional ride than Parasite did. For me, it was easily a better film."

","I became mildly interested in this movie when a student mentioned it in my horror-film class. However, I became skeptical when the film went all mainstream by snagging the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>I was right to be hesitant. This movie has some strengths, including its cinematography and stunning musical score, but its story line goes wildly astray in its second half.<br/><br/>Here we have the story of an impoverished family of freeloaders who ingratiate themselves into the lives and home of a wealthy family. Just when it looks like they'll get away with their scam, everything is threatened by the return of the family's fired homemaker.<br/><br/>At this point, the movie careens into thoroughly unlikely territory that is slightly reminiscent of recent horror movies like ""Get Out"" and ""The Hostel."" There are indeed moments of high tension, such as when the family has to sneak out of the house when their hosts are sleeping nearby.<br/><br/>A Noah's Ark-level rain shower and flood is good for its special effects but does nothing to advance the story.<br/><br/>The movie's maudlin ending is the weakest part of the film. By the time the movie reaches its denouement the audience doesn't like what remains of the family and doesn't give a fig about its Morse Code messaging.<br/><br/>To me, the ending seemed haphazardly slapped on because the producers didn't know how else to end this work. Anti-climactic to the max!"

","I watched Parasite with an open mind. I deliberately avoided reviews (far too many fake ones out there) and even the trailer. After sitting through it, a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three, then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought, I'm astonished. Let's begin with the positives though - cinematography was good, acting was okay(ish)... and that's about where it ends. The negatives are considerable though: A weak script which often made little sense or logic, more plot holes than Swiss cheese, ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel. In reality I'd probably rate it a 4/10, but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8.5/10, which is farcical given how weak this film is, I'm giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense. I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it's down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or, more likely, that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we've all been subjected to over the last decade+ that anything, ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of ""Best film EVER!!!"" Thirty years ago this film would've been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel, but in today's distinctly subpar cinema offerings it's now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty. Utterly ridiculous. For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread, go and get yourselves a film education. A good place to start is Claude Berri's marvelous 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon des Sources' to see how it should be done.

The social message of the film has also big problems which bothered me during watching it. A low class family manipulate a rich family to infiltrate, taking advantage of them, lying and cheating, doing harm to other poor people, letting lose their jobs, is not a way to show a way to get attention to the class differences.

","I think it was a film director who said that fiction is asked to make sense, when reality often doesn't. This film must be very real because it is absolutely senseless. Where does the parasite family get the fancy clothes and the cultured and educated ways? Where do they learn, from one day to the next, to behave like refined people? How do they foresee the reactions of the parasite victims to the millimeter and not fail in their plan? Wait, by the way... where does the plan come from? The plan is never created, never plotted, simply the sister takes off her panties (by the way, a hundred dollar panties) in the car and everything is already organized and everyone agrees. That's nonsense to me. There is only one thread, which must have seemed interesting to the writer, which is the smell, but then nobody pulls that thread and it gets lost. Everyone already knew that rich people are stupid. Why make a whole movie just about this? It reminds me of those movies from the 1940s where the woman protagonist to fool someone only had to dress in men's clothes, hide her hair and put on a false moustache.

","The story is about the interaction of two Korean families, poor and rich - Park.<br/><br/>In both families, fathers are the lazy guys. Classical now.
The kids are mostly autonomous and self-made due to the laziness of their parents. Classical as well.<br/><br/>The interaction starts with a lucky meeting of an old friend by the young man from the poor family which allowed him to start his work for a rich family. This is normal and gives him big money and now he can help his family.<br/><br/>But he lied to the Mother of the Park family to create a position for his sister. The sister has strong greed and asks a high price for her work from Park's family. And then created a plan for how to put all her family into a rich house by kicking out all old stuff. Greed can kill you, remember it until the end episode.
Also, there is a question, why Mother from Park family is simple? It's unsafe. And why Father from Park family didn't join the family decisions? Probably he has problematic pride. And they are both lazy and it's also can kill you, remind it as well.<br/><br/>
In conclusion:
Don't be lazy and control your greed. As well as part attention for your partners or other people whom you délicate something or who affections on your life.<br/><br/>If someone is dominated and another is submission in will kill one in them. Beca careful and pay attention."

","Life in the dregs is unpleasant. One must learn, adapt, and get their hands dirty just to maintain life's basic necessities. All the while one must cope with the knowledge that there are those that will look down on you because of circumstances that, whether deserved or undeserved, can chip away at ones spirit.<br/><br/>All societies have their strata, and one method of survival at the bottom of the rung is to cling to those at the top. Such relationship can be mutual, but it can also be parasitic. I assume anyone reading this can guess the kind that forms the base of this movie.<br/><br/>Director Bong Joon Ho does not need me to sing his praises, but I will say this, Memories of Murder is one of my favorite films of all time. He has created a host of other good films as well (see what I did there) and Parasite is no different. His direction is a compelling and methodical dissection of two worlds. One if for the poor where they live surrounded by concrete and wire, and below peeing drunkards. The other is a beautiful triumph of architecture surrounded by trees and sunshine, a house worthy of a success.<br/><br/>Parasite was a roller coaster of a watch that never lingered. Keeping the viewer engaged, the movie shifts tone at various points, and the direction never misses a step. As the two worlds collide, thanks to the machinations of the downtrodden, I was kept of the edge of my seat not quite able to sense what was coming next. Accented by some fantastically comical scenes towards the beginning, the movie manages to maintain a sinister tone. Performances blend into scenes as characters playing other characters dance around and play off each other seamlessly. It feels grimy and unsettling to watch, both because of the conditions the poor are subject to, but also at the levels they will stoop to. There is something violative about watching a family's intimate space be invaded. The forecast does not look bright for any party involved.<br/><br/>The picture painted here is detailed and rich, and full of superb performances, especially from the youngest members of the poor family. As for criticisms, I have very little. Did I love it as much as Memories of Murder? No, but that is more a result of this film, while feeling extremely relevant in this day and age, hitting on a tone that has been explored to high heaven before, the haves vs. the have not. That is not to say Parasite has nothing new to say, although that case can be made, it just lacks a certain kind of rawness.<br/><br/>That being said, Parasite weaves through its plot with frighteningly good execution. Through all the twists and turns we the viewer witness how one's class can sticks to them like a smell, unyielding and betraying any façade they put on. Sometimes you have to get dirty before you can get clean. And then sometimes people just never quite find a way to fit into their circumstances. There is much here to like and I recommend it wholeheartedly."

Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but 'Parasite' never felt in danger of that.<br/><br/>At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas, something as fresh as 'Parasite' is always welcome. The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes - this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement.

","One of the things I liked about the film ""12 Years a Slave"" was that it punctured the idea of the ""happy slave."" Some slaves had the luck to experience better living conditions than others, but none of them was ever allowed to forget that they were property. If they had a ""nice"" master, they might smile and exchange pleasantries, but the seething resentment of having a master in the first place never went away.<br/><br/>A variation on the ""happy slave"" concept still exists in the world of today, I think, but it's been transferred to the serving class. There's this pervasive notion that those who struggle economically are happy just to be employed by those who have more. Maids, nannies, chauffeurs, doormen -- what do they exist for but to make life more convenient for the wealthy, and as long as they're well treated and paid for their efforts, what do they have to complain about?<br/><br/>This dynamic is explored explosively in ""Parasite."" It's almost impossible to talk about the film without revealing its secrets, and this is one film that works best the less you know about it. It's funny, scary, suspenseful, sad, sometimes all at the same time. It's playful, yet serious. Director Bong Joon Ho clearly has a ball playing with genres and constantly upending our expectations. The fun of this movie is never knowing where it's going to go next. It creates a metaphor for the increasing divide between the haves and have nots in Korea specifically but the world in general by presenting us with a filthy rich family that remains blithely unaware of those who, in their eyes, exist to do things for them, even when those people are (literally) right under their feet. There aren't good guys or bad guys, heroes or villains. At times you despise everyone in the movie, at other times you feel compassion for almost all of them.

","Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics.<br/><br/>Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact.<br/><br/>The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible.<br/><br/>He will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's ""Joy House"" (aka ""The Cage of Love"") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons.<br/><br/>Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre.<br/><br/>Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the ""contribution"" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism ""The Revenant""), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year."

Some scenes provide laughs and eerie feeling, but it's not escalating until the second half, when more bloody scenes are showing, but not with much explanation.<br/><br/>Since the second half aren't that long, I found that as an audience we must dissect the nature of the action, making a real difference than the light first half.

But there are too many plot conveniences and unrealistic character behaviors to really class this as ""The greatest film of the decade"". Not by a mile.<br/><br/>Having said that I found the movie had several interesting threads and themes going on, some of which resolved, and some which were probably the most interesting went nowhere. ie the young 'rich' kids role, among other things. That was slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>I think the so called 'class divide' commentary was there, but not to the extent that everyone raves. It showed more that there is not such a simple black and white difference between the two, which I appreciate. But I think the 'class divide' actually provided more a part of the organic scenery than a driving force of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm glad I saw it, but I would have rather just watched it at home, than paid to see it in gold class.

"zkiko","7","2","8","23 February 2020"," Will the real parasite please stand up?
","We see a family that gradually starts to feed off of a privileged family which is clear. But at the same time it showed us how it is actually the opposite, the privileged depending on the lower classes in a very disturbing way. The rich generic family needed a 'help' for almost everything in their life. For tutoring the kids(and much more than just tutoring academics), for making food, for supporting the mother who actually has no idea on how to live her life or form an opinion, for driving the father etc and even...for the dynamic between the husband and wife. It showed that most of their conversations were about the 'help'. This is in fact what most of the very privileged people do in society is depend a lot on the people doing work for them, and not see them as actual beings with their own families and lives.
It is a form of usage that goes very far and the usage of the underprivileged in a very disproportioned power structure creates a co-dependant relationship. (E.g. The man adoring the master). And many times it costs a lot, for the underprivileged. The poor classes have no choice but to invest so much time in someone else's family, instead of in their own, because they need the salary. The upperclass knows this very well and abuses their power for this.<br/><br/>The dynamic of the 'poor' family in the movie was very enjoyable and pulled me in the movie. The story started out very interesting, but - to me - it fell flat towards the end. It could have been so much better , with a better storyline. Im not saying I want a happy ending and definitely am not a lover of clichÃ©s. I just wanted it to develop more. It feels that right in the middle of the development of the story it suddenly went flat.
A nice movie, i don't care about awards (its all politics anyhow), a good one time watch, and maybe a rewatch to revisit the crazy antics in the beginning and middle of the movie. Favourite character : the poor dad."

","""Parasite"" is a Drama - Thriller movie in which we watch a struggling family doing everything it can in order to succeed. Since they are all unemployed they don't have anything to lose and they risk everything. After an opportunity that shows up they find themselves not only interested but a part of the wealthy and glamorous Parks. But everything changes when they get entangled in an unexpected incident which they couldn't even think of it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie because it was very unexpected and full of surprises. It had a lot of suspense and many surprising moments. Regarding the interpretations, Kang-ho Song who played as Kim Ki-taek was simply outstanding, Yeo-jeong Jo who played as Park Yeon-kyo was equally good and Woo-sik Choi who played as Kim Ki-woo made a very good interpretation. The direction which was made by Bong Joon Ho is simply amazing and in addition to a very interesting script makes this movie not only interesting but something very different and unique.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""Parasite"" is a surprisingly great movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and if you haven't read any critics or reviews for this movie yet I am sure that you are going to enjoy it even more."
"robertrutledge","8","2","8","3 November 2019"," Bravo
","Captivating, thrilling, appalling, stomach wrenching. These are words used to describe Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. At first a seemingly witty and somewhat-vulgar comedy, it slowly evolves into something much more. The movie is in Korean with English subtitles. While some subtle cultural differences are noticeable, this movie can be enjoyed by Korean and American audiences alike.<br/><br/>The movie centers around the lower-class Kim family, consisting of a man and a woman and their young-adult son and daughter. In the beginning, they are just scraping by, assembling pizza boxes for meager pay and living out of a less-than-desirable underground apartment in a run-down neighborhood of urban sprawl. Then one day, their fate changes: the son's friend, who is about to go overseas to study, hands off to him his job working as an English tutor for the high-school aged daughter of the wealthy upper-class Park family. The Parks reside in a remarkably modern house designed by a well-renowned Korean architect. Think the Frank Lloyd Wright of Korea. The house is gated and surrounded by beautiful luscious greenery: a far cry from the run-down apartment of the Kims. The Park family closely resembles the Kims in its composition: a husband, a wife, a son, and a daughter. However, the children are much younger. The young Kim, upon providing a falsified college transcript, is hired on the spot by the remarkably naive lady of house.The house goes on to become the main setting for the rest of the rollercoaster ride that is Parasite.<br/><br/>One-by-one, through their crafty use of deception and by playing a few dirty tricks, the rest of the family succeeds in invading their way into employment in the extravagant Kim household. The family rejoices in its new circumstances, having made this elegant house their sanctuary and having turned their financial situation around by milking the cash cow of the Park family. However, this sense of wealth and prosperity proves to be ephemeral as the dark secret of the house soon-after is revealed in a torrential whirlwind of events.<br/><br/>This movie made me somewhat envious as to the Kim family's unity. My brothers, parents, and I have never been as close to each other as to what I witnessed in this movie. Even if the motivations of the Kims are ill-willed, I couldn't help but to empathize with the family. Their crude behavior is quite entertaining as well. From my own experience, I have never had to face poverty in the way that they did. Perhaps because of this, my family is not as close to each other as theirs.<br/><br/>The inequality between upper and lower social classes is a major recurring theme throughout the movie. While at times a bit over-dramatic in its stark contrasts, the movie's cinematography is ingenious through its use of space. It is quite clear that the Park family's house is unnecessarily large, but it never feels quite as luxurious or over-the-top as a mansion. This concept of space lends itself to another major factor: the Park family's socioeconomic privilege and inherent disregard towards people of the lower-class, especially observable through the actions and mannerisms of Mr. Kim. This is a pertinent and powerful theme which makes the movie all the more interesting and intriguing. Similar themes can be observed in Warner Bros. and Todd Phillips' recent box-office smash-hit Joker. Sadly, there will always be the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots,"" for better or for worse, and discussion regarding the capitalist system in which the people of South Korea and we in the U.S. reside could go on for days.<br/><br/>The film's soundtrack is very tasteful. The beginning section of the film is accompanied by pleasant percussive sounds. As the plot thickens, the music grows in intensity, mirroring the looming atmosphere of uncertainty. Stringed instruments such as violins and cellos become much more prominent and are cleverly implemented to express sentiments of unease and for a peculiar ominous effect.<br/><br/>All in all, Parasite is a very thought-provoking journey which takes the viewer to unexpected places. As a sociological commentary which will surely be looked at differently by different people, this film may not be particularly agreeable with everyone who views it. I do not wish to spoil anything, but I will say this: it is not for the faint of heart. This film is an accomplishment in the international Korean film industry, and its commercial success will hopefully lead to more Korean movie-screenings in U.S. movie theaters. I hope the movie will make people here who were not interested in learning Korean (or any other foreign language, for that matter) more motivated to embrace the amazing and fruitful process of learning a new language. Above all, I am not necessarily aware of anything I wasn't already aware of after having watched this movie, and I don't believe it to have changed me or my beliefs. It also leaves a few unanswered questions. Overall, it was an indulgent, aesthetically pleasing, and even at times surreal experience. I would definitely watch it again, although it might not be my first choice."

"tuchka","6","3","15","2 February 2020"," Visually stunning but messy moral message.
","The film keeps the viewer in suspense until the very end. Visually stunning, with the actors' play easy to believe.
However the moral side of the message the movie is trying to deliver, if any, is less clear. The plot contrasts two families, poor and rich. We do not know the background of their social status so the viewer cannot judge them based on it.
Both families want the best for their relatives, they are kind to them, they both presumably want to work to earn for their families (the rich wife does not need to).
This is where the similarities end. The dividing line between the families is not that that one is cunning and the other is mostly naive, not that one is squeamish and the other is untidy. The difference is that the boy from the poor family is ready to kill his competitor hidden in the basement and the father of the poor family does kill his counterpart for what he perceives as a top-down view based on social inequality.
Despite such drastically different moral standing, the movie equalizes the families by leaving one member of each family dead. Of course, it does not happen in life that the evil is punished and the good is rewarded. However the movie leaves the feeling that everything is random and pointless."

"enacycle","9","4","23","14 August 2019"," Realistic Family Drama Portrayal became a Blockbuster!
","First up, the movie is overrated, mostly by film critics. From a critic's point of view, it deserved a 9/10 solely for the great manipulation of scripting, acting, plot design and pace-setting.<br/><br/>Plus, I would understand why film makers/ critics are crazy about this movie as the Director successfully played the audience, tricking them to accept a typical family, class-climbing drama with the simplest of tools and minimal resources into a blockbuster. Thus, I rate it as 9 as well.<br/><br/>However, from one's own enjoyment as an audience, it is just hanging between a so-so 7/10 and probably, a better 8/10 as there are some solid and memorable moments that I truly enjoyed.<br/><br/>Still, there are many reasons to why this movie has not done enough to justify a perfect score or rated as a masterpiece from a production point of view, especially since it did not deliver enough punches to make it relatively great in the big screen.<br/><br/>The GOOD,
Its success mainly lies in its ability to engage the audience (I would not say to all but mostly with South Koreans and foreigners who is interested with their culture) and my greatest applaud for it would be the deliberate shift from a classic cliche of Poor vs Rich. Instead, the two sides never collide in a direct manner, that is the only refreshing point of the typical plot and that in itself, is REALISTIC.<br/><br/>The BAD,
the movie does not live up fully to its title, Parasite as the effect of parasitic relationship would be to cause its host, harms to certain degree of annoyance.
However, the host family in this movie barely felt any sense of hostility or annoyance or discomfort from the ""parasitism"".
In fact, the accident to the Host family in the end just is completely unrelated to Parasite theme of the movie.<br/><br/>Is it easily a fine line between cheap drama, shot well in terms of cinematography and a great classic as there are no elements of a blockbuster tool or shortage of an A-list cast to match its perfect score rating.
In my opinion, instead of the camping twist that everyone is talking about, the impressive note that could have been a game changer would be the flood scene. Unfortunately, that was not well played and became a redundant scene instead.<br/><br/>Still, the director is a genius, I would call him the Magician of the Cinema world as he effortlessly got everyone hooked into this illusion of a drama turned blockbuster.

"arungeorge13","8","4","24","15 August 2019"," No one does it quite like Joon-ho Bong! [+84%]
","It's safe to say the Joon-ho Bong is one of the greatest original storytellers of our generation. The man's filmography speaks for itself. Barking Dogs Never Bite, Memories of Murder, The Host, Mother, Snowpiercer, Okja, and now, Parasite - that's the kind of portfolio to be proud of. Now let's talk about the movie in question here.<br/><br/>Parasite is a darkly funny social satire that paints a subtle (yet not-so-subtle) picture of different social strata. On one hand, we have Kim Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), an out-of-work driver who lives in a dingy apartment with his wife Choong Sook (a mighty effective Jang Hye-jin) and his two college-age kids Ki-woo and Ki-jyeong. On the other, we have the well-off family of Mr Park that comprises of himself, his wife Yeon-Kyo, and his two children Da-Hye and Da-song.<br/><br/>A series of events leads to Kim ki-woo getting employed by the Park family as Da-Hye's tutor. Then, we come across the master-plan executed by Kim Ki-woo to get each one in his family employed by the Parks. This stretch of street-smarts versus rich-naivety while engaging and funny, still seemed like it was missing the 'element of twist' commonly associated with Bong's films. But what awaits you beyond the first hour is utterly inventive. It's indeed twists-and-thrills galore, with performances by every single cast member rising to the occasion.<br/><br/>Parasite, as a film, should claim a rightful genre to itself. It's a masterful blend of so many genres: comedy, family, drama (plenty of it), survival thriller, satire, horror (rarely), and many more. The social inequality trope isn't used for stirring extra sentiment. Instead, Bong cleverly plays around the concept and shows how intelligent film-makers can tell a story revolving around every section of the society without pandering to either. Most of all, Bong's attention to detail is impeccable and this pays off in several scenes.<br/><br/>The film boasts several scenes (not moments, scenes altogether) that are worthy of further discussion. The subtext is impressively underplayed, with the second hour leaving no stone unturned. The climax is the best thing about Parasite (as is the case with most of Bong's movies) and it makes a giant statement - both in terms of storytelling and as a cinematic finale. Parasite is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings; a second or a third viewing will reveal even greater context about each of the meticulously-created characters. Also, two thumbs up for the production design and cinematography departments for making everything in the film appear so very real.<br/><br/>Verdict: This time around, the 'monsters' are human, and they're more than fierce! A MUST-WATCH!"

","Alright so I see a lot of words like BRILLIANT and PERFECT being thrown around and I have to admit.. going into the movie I had some pretty high expectations. I love the suspense Korean directors/writers are able to portray in their movies and tend to create some pretty memorable and surprising endings.
Having said that I watched Parasite with the anticipation that I was in for a wild ride.
First half of this movie I was mildly entertained. I thought to myself okay this seems to be more of a comedic approach to a subject that has been explored countless times in movies. I then thought to myself, wait a minute, the main characters are actually kind of evil. And the rich folks, beside the remarks about crossing lines and Mr. Kims funny smell, seem pretty naive yet nice.
I wasn't sure who we were suppose to like in this movie as i quickly found myself not really rooting for anyone. I didn't really connect with anyone. I just kept thinking they were smart enough to pull off this scheme but were not smart enough to think ahead at making the best of this opportunity?
Instead pride is what seems to ultimately lead to their downfall... They basically lived in a gutter before all this...
NOW sure we can talk about how beautifully it was shot and no doubt the acting was excellent but while this was a good movie it was far from being excellent. Its a good movie. Lets all calm down..."

The story is very original and smart. You'll find yourself questioning who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. Is it the poor who will do anything in order to survive, or is it the rich who live their life standing on top of others, ignorance of the people under them. While the film doesn't dive into the background story of the characters much, you'll still be able to grasp the motives of each characters through their expressions and subtle hints within the dialogue spoken.<br/><br/>Moreover, every scenes shown within the film is well thought out. The contrast between the two very different social classes within the society is well hinted throughout the entire film. I'm really impressed with the efforts the filmmakers put into these small but significant moments.<br/><br/>The casts are also excellent (and of course, that's include my favorite actors, Song Kang-ho).

","I found ""Parasite"" problematic to watch. The subtitles were often difficult to read and were put on too fast. Some were posted white on a light background. That was hard to read. Subtitles take away from the visual of the film and in this case the visuals of what was happening were paramount.<br/><br/>The good part, in my opinion, was the social commentary of the disparity between rich and poor. The difference is extreme. The poor were depicted there living in filth and squalor. The way the poor live in Korea not being able to get jobs is mind numbing. I have read that many in Korea live as the pictured in the film. The film showed effectively social class dichotomy.<br/><br/>What happens to the rich when the poor invade their home surreptitiously is ultimately extreme violence. It is nothing short of mayhem especially at the end. Not sure if it would be everyone's cup of tea. I don't think so.

I think the film's resonation with White American audiences speaks to this point even more. It won the Oscar because it is a criticism of Korea, not of America.

The tiny details you will find upon a second viewing or the tiniest bit of research will blow you away. The message behind it is clear but not too obvious.

","Parasite is one of the few movies that live up to the hype around them. Getting all the praise in the world from audiences and critics alike, it's being called the movie of the decade. On top of this, it has won 4 Oscars including Best Picture. But I assume you already knew that, in which case I apologize for wasting your time. But if the hype and those Oscars aren't enough to convince you to watch this then maybe reading on further will.<br/><br/>Parasite doesn't stick to a single genre but is a mix of drama, comedy, satire, mystery and suspense. All this fit into a 2 hour movie without causing a hitch in the seamless transitions between those genres. Fueled with incredible performances from each and every cast member, the movie ,despite being a thriller, involves a plot which is so believable, that it's frightening.<br/><br/>Wildly unpredictable, the title of the movie will only make sense after the ending and till then, you'll only be left guessing. Not revealing the details, but the movie seems to be going in a certain direction at which point it takes a sharp turn into complete madness. Things pretty much escalate from there, revealing a clearer picture about the intention of the movie.<br/><br/>The more praiseworthy thing apart from the flawless camera work and near perfect direction, is the display of the disparity between the rich and poor using symbolism and other It paints a picture about what it's like to be on both sides without the presence of any heroes or villains.<br/><br/>I personally think that movies have become such an inherent part of our lives and their global presence has at least touched if not influenced a lot of people. And not using such a powerful, widespread medium to communicate about a social cause ( of which we have plenty) seems like a wasted opportunity. So kudos to director Bong Joon-ho for taking on this issue and yet finding a way to make it entertaining!"

","The film made me feel different things while watching it, like anguish, anger, fear and even joy. It is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. The film is full of super well done scenes. It is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. The perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . I never thought I'd be in any doubt if I hoped someone would do well or badly in the story. I loved the experience, I loved the film and the social criticism it proposes about class difference, showing in a very discreet way the privileges of some and the lack of privileges of others.

","Bong Joon Ho's one of the best masterpiece of portraying social class division with twisting plots are nothing but incredible.<br/><br/>The concept of the movie starts with showing the difference between upper class and lower class people lifestyle and their dependency. It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here.<br/><br/>The first half of the film follows the family living at a semi basement apartment in poor locality. After the son is given an opportunity by his friend to teach as a English Tutor in rich family and came to realise that although he is earning more , his family is getting what they deserve. As they are not as bright as the son , so son decides to make a plan to employ their family in that house where he teaches. Sooner they become wealthy as they all working in different positions in the same house.
The first half may look flat and give some impression of the base of movie .
But when it comes to the second half there is a major plot twisting. It clears the display of showing the struggle of poor within the unjust society and hence this sudden joyful life comes into tragedy.
This cast members brilliantly performed their role. The cinematography and background score of make the audience more focused!
Its funny , thrilling, emotional and moral based script makes it a masterpiece !<br/><br/>No doubt, it is one of my favourite movie and I am strongly recommend it to watch ( although it is an S.Korean movie )."

And this uplifting charm helps so much more for the impact of the second half of the movie.

","From all Asian countries South Korea is definitely the country that releases the best Asian movies. I've seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far. I was surprised (and not) it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards. He made quality movies before, like Snowpiercer for instance, so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition. In Gisaengchung (Parasite) the acting is very good, not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they're always mad at something, so for that alone it's worth watching. The story is catching, well written, and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The difference between the poor and the rich, the envy, the jealousy, the scamming, it's all very entertaining. It never felt like a long movie because it's just well made and it's a refreshing story, not one of those stories that has been done over and over again.

"deepakdst","10","1","3","19 March 2020"," Black mirror of this society.
","This movie is the real picture of this society. Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars.
Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place.
That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them.
Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'"
"Quannianjiexia","8","1","3","19 March 2020"," The decay of capitalism is inevitable
","To be honest, the family 's three views and one word are difficult to solve. It 's really a problem. Like a parasite, the family sucks in others. Don't say it 's disgusting, even if it 's low. If something goes wrong, you still want to solve the problem by killing people. In the end, your father killed the little girl 's dad. At the end, he was still completely regretful. He did n't lose the little girl. Then this layer of class gaps and gaps that are determined by social status and money need not be portrayed. Such an explicit irony is only ironic. Such a direct description not only does not perfectly show the poverty at the bottom of this society. The destiny of the gap between cheap and social class seems to add to the picture, but it is indeed a masterpiece of the feature film."

","It was also a well-completed and well-expressed popular film, but the palm did find it unworthy. I don't deny it at all, but I do n' t think it's necessary to retell it. I think there are great shortcomings in three aspects :1, the development of the plot is not logical. 2. expression means symbolic meaning is too straightforward, low-level. 3. theme is not deep.<br/><br/>First look at the first, generally speaking a story is very strong film for the development of the plot in line with the basic logic is a minimum requirement. Of course, I fully agree that there is a de facto logical sacrifice required for thematic expression and dramatic effects. But the parasite's sacrifice did not achieve the same thematic expression, which is not ok. For example, the placement of four family members into wealthy families, which accounts for almost one-third of the films, was dramatic and smooth. When the first day of the male master's visit when suddenly the spirit of his sister when suddenly put forward, I feel wonderful, feel very clever, because after all received a salary more than the previous tutor, it is normal to double this salary. But then it was arranged a little bit, and it was so smooth. Second, if the smooth entry into the mansion is needed for the development of the plot, then these people can also be qualified for the mansion job seems even more fake. The rich's nannies and drivers are n' t so good, especially nannies, who have been working with former builders for years to get used to the job. And the whole conversation and manner, the slum environment living in the old couple can not be unmasked. Of course, the director did not fail to take this into account, adding Song Kanghao at home rehearsals and the male owner complained about Song Kanghao on the edge of the play. But it is still not enough, and the overall logical rationality is very fragile. Third, the night of the camping scene, drink all know four people in the living room drink wine and even broke over the wine cup can taste it, the hostess did not even notice, even on the sofa hit a shot, all over the glass residue was only a sweep of Kim Kiting a simple treatment, also unaware, this is basically intolerable illogical. There are a lot of such examples, I admit that some are necessary, but in the overall advance, the director did too much to advance. In particular, the final garden battle, frankly speaking, is it necessary, this ending does not feel a little abrupt, this is the director stall spread out there is no way to solve the outcome of the conflict created by the climax of the solution ah. And the end of the garden battle is the same, leaving the people in need, one to stay in the basement to write, the other to receive letters outside. And Song Kanghao also did not know when his son can come to see, so every day to knock on the Morse code, that lights flash all night our German residents do not find someone to repair.

","I must confess to a long time bias against sub titles, like many lazy Americans, I felt like having to read while I watched a movie was just asking too much. Then, a few years ago, I sat down and viewed a DVD of the fully restored SEVEN SAMURAI, and really understood what I had been missing out on for too long, especially when it came to Asian cinema. So when Bong Joon-ho's PARASITE won the Best Picture Oscar, I didn't feel any of the dread at having to listen to a foreign tongue while reading along with the screen that might have come a few years back. Now, after watching last year's Best Picture on Blu Ray, I say that for me, PARASITE is so good, I wasn't aware that I was reading anything after a first few minutes.<br/><br/>Set in South Korea, the film works both as a thriller, and at times, a comedy of manners, along with a strong social commentary theme. I could see strong influences of both Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder in the script, which centers on two families, the Kims and the Parks. The former are stuck in poverty, living in a cramped basement apartment, while the latter are quite wealthy, living in a spacious house, attended by a housekeeper and chauffer. When the Kims' son manages to snag a job as an English tutor to the Parks' teenage daughter, the family has a foot in the door, and soon the rest of the Kims, under false identities, have infiltrated the household, taking over the jobs of therapist to the ADD afflicted younger son, housekeeper and chauffer; finagling to have others fired from the last two jobs in order to obtain them for themselves. The Kims are soon enjoying a newfound prosperity at the expense of their obliviously self absorbed employers. But their deviousness has consequences, and when the former housekeeper shows up one night when the Kims have the Parks' house all to themselves, the story takes a turn no one sees coming. Giving away anymore of the twists the story takes would be unfair, needless to say, this is one of those films that goes in a lot of unexpected places.<br/><br/>There were some things that really stood out for me in this film. One was how well it works as a suspense film, liberally borrowing the situational irony that was a hallmark of Hitchcock - a scene where three of the Kims have to hide themselves in the Park house and attempt to sneak out while Mr. and Mrs. Park go about their intimate business is a great example of this, along with Hitchcock's patented voyeurism. Characters practicing deception was one of Wilder's signature themes, with the consequences of such deceptions playing out in the finale. Second was the theme of class warfare, how the Have-Nots, with their cunning and guile, easily manipulate their supposed Betters, while the latter feel wholly invincible in the superiority their wealth has brought them, making them easy marks. Third was how well the characters are written. The Kims commit reprehensible acts in a cold blooded manner, yet they really do love each other in a way that makes it impossible to totally condemn them. Even the fired housekeeper, who is revealed to have a skeleton in her closet, is motivated by love for a family member. I love films with complicated characters who are more than what they appear to be. The screenplay, written by Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won is a masterpiece of storytelling, especially in the way they introduce a plot twist late in the second act that has only been slightly foreshadowed, and how they get so much story out of small everyday things, like a food allergy, the Morse code that a Boy Scout learns, and the musty scent of a damp basement. This puts me in mind of Vince Gilligan, and his masterful TV shows BREAKING BAD and BETTER CALL SAUL. Lastly, if there is a theme to PARASITE, I would say it is that no matter what the difference in culture may be, human nature is universal.<br/><br/>The acting, especially Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin, Choi Woo-shik, and Park So-dam, as the devious Kims, is exceptional. But real star is director Bong Joon-ho, who won the Best Director Oscar for his work. My choice for Best Picture would have been ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, but I can't be too bummed out when my favorite lost to a movie as good as PARASITE."

"moustens","10","1","3","8 March 2020"," Very very as in VERY good!
","It's actually perfect for an international scene, because the theme is relevant in every society but also because it plays with the western world view of how we all think Korea is regarding everything American= cool. Yet at the same time it's making fun of all people in the West at the same time. It is like a giant f... finger in our face, this is how a movie should be composed, so go back to your banal, predictable styles and continue as you were. You have not seen this one coming. It's clever and cute in its persona gallery. We are sitting there waiting for someone to hate but somehow come to like all the characters. 5 min into the movie you have forgotten that it's a Korean cast and the language is unknown to you. Something that impressed me. The sad ending is somehow terrible because it's real. This is life and it's Hollywood to think it would be any different. I truly love the originality and full circle of the script, it's like if you write a master thesis that just hits home where you were able to tie all knots elegantly and with great content. I loved this movie. And I actually can't remember if I ever saw something this original and mind blowing
which was not sci-fi."

","Not sure if it's because of coronavirus but I find this movie seriously disturbing. Definitely rank it as dark comedy. Because it is not the hilarious kind. Funny in the 1st part but not that funny in the last bit. Subtle I guess but not that subtle either. Sad was the feeling I got after seeing this movie. Social cast type."

"realalbertbarrios","10","1","3","29 February 2020"," A masterpiece that's not from America.
","Parasite is a fantastic film made by the wonderful Bong Joon Ho. Every single frame is beautifully crafted and the story was investing throughout the entire two hour runtime. It is very darkly hilarious, smart, and overall excellent. It also has without a doubt one of the most realistic endings in film history. With a single flaw in sight, Parasite will be perfect for any movie-goer."
"lvanderwindt","10","1","3","28 February 2020"," Just perfect cinematography
","A lot of people don't think it's fair that parasite won at the 2020 oscars. But you know what, I think they absolutely did. The cinematography is just out of this world. And just when you think you got the plot all winded up your finger the thread spins right off and the movie takes a MASSIVE turn. Like holy the fact that the old maid came back was weird but when her fricking husband was just chilling in the basement.... DAMN. The script is just so gorgeous and detailed. The way were everything is planned out, the way it should be with a good movie. Each line fits perfectly in every scene and everything is so balanced out. From the beginning of the movie i felt like everything had already fallen into place. The actors are so good. Obviously i'd never heard of them but omg... so good. You should really watch those cheesy videos about '10 things you've missed in...' but in this movie it's actually really interesting. Like the part where there is always a slight 'line' in shots between the wealthy and 'poor' people, which makes sense to the line that the rich dad said 'he always seems to cross the line but ends up to just not do it..' It's a small detail but when you pay attention to it it all starts making sense. Or the realisation point in the end where Kim was now hiding in the basement was so mesmerising. The way they played back every move he took to get there. Also when they needed to get rid of the maid, every scene perfectly balanced out with the previous and next one. Everything fitted into everything. Just perfect!"
"Kiki_Cutter","9","1","3","25 February 2020"," It was great!
","For someone like me who barely knows anything about movies and films, this was spectacular to me. In the beginning of the movie, at first I thought it was a little slow-paced because I was under the impression that something big would happen after a couple minutes in as most or some movies usually go. However, it was an opportunity to achieve a deeper understanding on who the characters are and their lifestyle, which is something I don't usually pay attention too. The way the movie was created is clever, it builds up the tension throughout it and gives foreshadowing before the climax happens and everything starts going wrong for the family. Meaning that the small conversations they make can have a meaning in what they say or do in future events. And when the climax happened, I was on the edge of my seat and whispering words on what they should or should not have done, showing how invested I was in the movie. At the same time I loved it how smoothly the transition was, as if everything clicked all together. Even though I was frustrated with the characters actions, they were portrayed really well on what's going on in the world and in society. How unfair it could be and how hypocritical we are once all that ""good luck"" begins to get to our heads. One that's well off would say how blessed we all are, while those that are struggling to get by would call it hell and how their lives are simply unmanageable without financial or other kinds of aid. I like how they portray that in the movie, the portrayal of human nature.<br/><br/>Not to mention the amount of comedy in this film. I was just laughing at certain parts that I struggled to keep quiet.<br/><br/>I would give it a 10/10 but me being stubborn I'm still frustrated about the characters actions despite it being well done 100%<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great movie and I'm glad it got the attention it deserves. Props to you all!"
"parkerg-g","9","1","3","25 February 2020"," Amazing Attention To Detail
","Parasite is one of the best movies I have seen. This is not an arguable fact at this point, it is so well made and the story line is brilliant. The attention to detail in this movie astounds me. Every single thing has meaning, from the levels of the house to even the portrait that Da Song paints when he is younger, which looks more like Geun-sae than a self portrait. I really appreciate the commentary on the different classes, and how their perspectives are changed through dialogue, through clothing and even through lighting. The whole idea of how the upper class will only take action when something affects them is so prominent, with the Parks not even aware of the troubles of their workers until it affects them. And, even when they do find out, they only do what will help them and their kind, picking up Da Song and even stepping over a girl who has just been stabbed. It's such a stunning movie and I give it the utmost praise.
Another thing this film comments on is the idea of the American Dream. At the end of the film, Ki-woo has an idea of working hard and buying the house that his father is trapped in. That is what the American Dream is, the idea that if you work hard and get an education, you can achieve everything. However, this will probably never happen for Ki-woo. It's mentioned at the beginning that he has been denied from schools in the past, but he thinks this time will be different. But it's the tragic truth that it probably won't be different. If it were, the film wouldn't end with that being a dream. It would cut off one shot earlier, with the father hugging his son, and then it ends. But there is that final shot, establishing that it's just goal that he won't be able to achieve. And so he starts off how he did at the beginning of the movie, socks hanging above his head and him sitting at his kitchen table in a basement."
"dada2000","9","1","3","25 February 2020"," The film that starts almost like a comedy but it expands into mysterious drama.
","In this film the author captured the ratio of lower social class in South Korea. Even though he portrays the family in a very comical way, he managed to show us their desire for a better life. It shows how they are able to do anything: lie, cheat just to achieve their dream.
On the other hand, we have another family that stands as a representative of a higher class, they employ Kim Ki-woo' s family as a servant in their house. We can see big differences between social classes.
The storyline of the movie changes drastically when Kim Ki-woo receives a stone talisman as a gift from his friend. This stone is supposed to provide them with happiness and money. And the boy believes in it, he puts all his faith in the stone, leans on it, and carries the stone with him even in the most difficult moment. He thinks that everything good in his life is due to the stone. Woo-sik Choi perfectly portrayed the character of a boy who looks innocent on the outside but hides a cunning plan inside.
At the end of the movie Kim Ki- woo said : "" Dad, today I made a plan - a fundamental plan. I'm going to earn money, a lot of it. University, a career, marriage, those are all fine, but first I'll earn money. When I have money, I'll buy the house. On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard. Because the sunshine is so nice there."" Which seems like an American dream. To study, to marry someone and be rich. That's what he wanted the whole movie. But we all know, that's never going to happen. It's just a beautiful lie. And American dream is a beautiful lie as well."
"u_review","9","1","3","25 February 2020"," Watch this Movie!
","Parasite includes drama, mystery, comedy, romance, thriller and a few more genre, which makes it so multilateral, that everyone will find his part. Some people say it could be compared to the ""american dream"", which isn't wrong, because a lot is about raising money and work hard to get into a college. But this is not the only background story. The whole movie is filled with metaphors, what makes you thinking over it and realizing parts a few days after you watched it. The pictures and camera angels aren't just good, they also imply a great many symbols, which makes it even more interesting to watch it. Sometimes it was a little too much for me, that's why I gave only nine stars. Anyway, if you want to see a great movie, Parasite is a good choice."
"thardman-1","7","1","3","24 February 2020"," Really enjoyable film but not quite the classic I thought it would be
","This is my first experience of Korean cinema (although I have watched many foreign language films). The subtitles may put off some but I care more about the story.<br/><br/>This is a really good film which is equally funny as it engrossing and then nearer the end quite moving.<br/><br/>The tone is a tad all over the place, which I'm sure is likely the aim but for me it makes it harder to land that emotional pull to make you really emphasise with the characters.<br/><br/>I would argue the film translates to me that family and belonging are the themes to take away.<br/><br/>So overall I would say I enjoyed the film and would say go see it for the experience, but if I'm honest I wouldn't choose to add it to my collection."
"funtasticfour","8","1","3","24 February 2020"," A very unique and fun movie!
","I tried going into this movie with as little information as possible, and I'm glad I did. The title definitely threw me off, thinking that it was a horror of some sort. Turns out it had a lot of comedy and drama. Great characters and very original. I wasn't a huge fan of the way it ended, it felt like a bit more time could have made a difference, but overall I think it deserved a lot of the awards it got."
"luizatavares-41290","9","1","3","23 February 2020"," unic
","Parasite is very well written and filmed, having many twists and scenes that leave you in complete shock wondering how someone managed to think about it, Bong Joon-Ho film has several genres within it, it goes through a very sarcastic comedy, for a terror, with a lot of suspense and tension involved, still being able to deal with social drama. This movie is stunning and completamente amazing, You need to watch at least two times to get all the inside things that this movie brings
It is so interesting when someone it is able to do something knew and stand out this days, with the internet it seems like everything has already been done, and this movie was definitely something knew, the way they told the story and the shoots made watch the film much more unic.
Beside all the action that this movie brings they also made a criticism about the differents classes, showing us the upper class and the lower one, how maybe a raining day was good and calm for you, but for others could be the complete opposite."
"vurchu","8","1","3","19 February 2020"," A good movie even with subtitles

"sac-09612","10","1","3","17 February 2020"," A Grifter Great
","When you write a review this late into a movie's life, post-genre busting Oscar, nobody will read this stuff, so here goes nothing.
I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here.
I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color."
"cekadah","7","1","3","17 February 2020"," Mainly visuals

"JankiSharma","7","1","3","23 January 2020"," schemes & smell of poor
","The movie Parasite directed by Bong Jon Ho focuses on rich and poor, haves and have-notes. Unemployed and poor Kim-ki taek and his wife Moon-gwang live in very small apartment with their 2 smart young kids, son Kim ki-woo and daughter Kim ki-Jung who will go to any part, any height of apartment to get WiFi/internet connection. The conversation between son Kim ki-woo and his friend Min who wants him to tutor a rich girl Park Da-hye is very touching . Min sees Kim ki-woo as a weak competitor and prefers him to his smart, rich friends who may make advances on Park Da-hye. Then pretty, smart daughter Kim-ki Jung starts teaching Art to rich girl's younger brother Park Da-song. With lies and deceit, the 4 members of poor family end up working in same beautiful rich house owned by successful young man Park Dong-ik and his beautiful , simple wife Park Yeon-kyo. Differences between the rich and poor and the conversations between rich husband and wife describing smell from their new chauffeur are very touching. The constant reminder of class distinction keeps reinforcing humiliation and disrespect of the rich for the poor and the 4 family members from poor background lose control. Excellent Direction even though the story is far fetched. Entire cast did very well. 2hrs 12 minutes too long. Really got bored with story."
"leonardo-32522","9","1","3","8 January 2020"," Not as good as Oldboy

"dallasryan","9","1","3","7 January 2020"," Karma
","I agree with a lot of the reviews for Parasite. Parasite is a wonderful work of art that is open to many interpretations. One interpretation that I haven't read yet, which I found throughout the film is...karma.<br/><br/>The poor Kim family struggles to make it in life. However, the Kim family cuts corners i.e. they lie, manipulate, cheat, etc. And as the old saying goes, 'you only get what you give in life', and that's kind of why the Kim's are where they are. The Kim's are good people in some way, as Mr. Kim demonstrates, expressing his shame about the driver they got fired. The Kim family has a conscience and they have some values, as most of us do.<br/><br/>However, if you cheat, lie, deceive--it will always come back to get you i.e. the scene in Parasite where husband Park and wife Park are on the couch thinking of the underwear and they start sexually going at it while Husband Kim and daughter and son Kim are hiding under the table, listening to this. How awful that must have been for father Kim to hear that with his children right next to him. How embarrassed husband Kim must have felt at hearing he smells terrible, from husband Park, in front of his children--and how their was nothing husband Kim could do about it as he and his son and daughter were hiding under the table. The metaphor being that most of us in life can do nothing about it.<br/><br/>But the Kim's did manipulate and cheat their way to the top, therefore their karma came back to bite them. And oh how it bites the Kim family in the very end. And it bites the Park family too. As the Kim family uses the Park's, the Park's use the Kim family for cheap labor--which in turn is a metaphor for the class war and for the war of employer vs. employee and how we all except such crummy wages and demands as a part of our society.<br/><br/>In one scene, Mr. Kim says, 'no plan is the best plan.' Which is the same as the old adage, 'If you never have any expectations then you will never be disappointed.'<br/><br/>Also, you could look at the stone like the story 'The Monkey's Paw.' Just like in The Monkey's Paw, the stone brings the Kim's good fortune...but at what price.<br/><br/>Parasite is brilliant on so many levels that it's really a film you need to see two or three times to take it all in. It's a film that demonstrates that there is always someone worse off and Husband Kim gets his ultimate karma by taking the place of the person who was worse off than he was. Karma. It will always get you. And Parasite demonstrates this beautifully.<br/><br/>Wonderfully acted and spiritually directed in the genre's most clever form. Parasite is not only a must see, it is a film you will not forget."

"daemonxhun","8","1","3","1 January 2020"," A great movie, but it also lacks something (for me) (only minor spoilers)
","Parasite is a great movie. It's very well paced and structured, and has an interesting and constantly evolving narrative. From a filmmaking standpoint, it's on a very high level.<br/><br/>In the end though, I still felt it left something to be desired. I felt that the movie didn't have as much of an impact on me as I had hoped. The ending wasn't as cathartic to me as to others and I quickly forgot about the movie shortly after I watched it, even though I usually think about movies like this for days after I watched them.<br/><br/>Maybe this can be attributed to the fact that I found it genuinely hard to really sympathise with the characters for different reasons and I didn't form a strong emotional bond with them - and without it, how am I supposed to care about their fate?<br/><br/>It's sad what has happened to the hiding guy and his wife, but they were introduced so late in the movie and their characters didn't really get fleshed out.<br/><br/>The big family (who the title probably refers to) got fleshed out quite well, but the more I learned about them, the more distant and unlikeable they became.<br/><br/>As for the rich family, they are somewhere between the previous two. They had some character development, but not much, and they were neither liekable or unlikeable - so basically, I didn't care about them at all.<br/><br/>Overall, I would still say that it's a pretty strong movie, but it lacks some kind of soul that would elevate it to a much higher level and make it truly stand out.<br/><br/>Therefore I also think that the 96/100 Metacritic and 8.6/100 IMDB scores are undeservedly high. This movie is an 8.0-8,5/10 for me, which means that it should be somewhere around 80 on Metacritic and somewhere between 7-8 on IMDB."

","If you consider the Oscar as a prize for movie making quality and not a political sham, then Parasite did not really deserve the highest praise. However, it was a good movie. Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho's movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it. The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones.<br/><br/>Bottom line: movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography. Probably that is why this movie didn't really impress me too much. It is a good movie and very well made, but the story was just... meh."

Its a beautiful film and I loved the comedic storyline. However, I did not like when they introduced the ex-housekeepers husband hiding down in the basement. I felt like that whole plot felt messy. Like they started something and didnt know how to finish it so they just did something random. Maybe that was supposed to be the point, but it messed with the comedy that the movie began with. Parasite went from being witty and funny, to trying to be a suspense-horror film and it just didnt go well together."

PARASITE concludes just like another 2019 film--JOKER--with the onset of a long overdue Kill-the-Rich Movement."

","Boon Jong ho's parasite is a slow burner 2hr film telling a story about two families (actually3) whose lives gets entangled within a house. Although the last half hour movie do make out of the lost time initially where the story takes some time for the build up.
The mansion has a special eerie feel throughout the film and you will know why it feels like that later on. The background score supports the eerieness. I watched the film in Korean language using eng subtitles edited by a Korean guy who knew only handful of English. So there were scenes where I had to literally assume what had happened by looking at the frame alone.
Overall you won't regret watching parasite ,infact it's a must watch for people who likes seeing unpredictable films"

","I liked this movie. Actually, when i first heard it's a joint collaboration of Joon-ho Bong and Kang-ho Song, again, it was a must watch. And then, I was observed with the film's roll once I started watching it. How climax crawled from a creepy space to reveal itself was fabulous.<br/><br/>The film shows a slum family with obvious big dreams from all its family members while a totally opposite side of hyper rich family with lost kids and bizarre wife. Film showcases smooth turns and in a real well crafted way of how those Four family members occupy their positions in new Employer's house within few days. Apparently, things all go well until an unexpected situation turmoils everything. Story, I would say, did ended OK. Maybe I expected something more out of it but that's OK.<br/><br/>Now, why come 8/10. Their are a couple of glitches which apparently din't convinced me. Like for example:
<ul><li>Why wasn't a single scrutiny done of the remaining fellows other than Kevin. He gave so good impression through his way of teaching Da-song that everything was cool after. I would have appreciated more if some more work was done. Like before hiring a new employee, his/her SSN or some other proof submission is atleast required. Ya, they could forger those proves too, but again, did they? I think people in today's world, especially Rich, are more superstitious and overcautious. Wouldn't they want anything like that or atleast give a hunch to get some background check? Or their friends could have opened their eyes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Once Kevin gets recruited within a few days, like within a wink of your eye, all the other problems in old workers start forthcoming. A nanny cum maid working from 4 years never showed a single sign of TB in her whole stay and all of a sudden, she started Coughing and splitting blood. Again, I won't say its not impossible but i wasn't much getting into it. Means, isn't the onus on me to alteast listen her up?</li></ul><br/><br/>Those two above points were thin thread, if broken, the whole climax is gone into toss. Anyways, above expectations for Director's creative work, cinematography, chilling thrill and a different aspect of story."

","First time I watched Bong Joon Ho movie was The Host, a Korean sci fi about the rise of the monster of Han river. The star, a stupid, low class but determine man played by Song Kang-ho. I fell in love with this movie, and then I look for another movies starred by Song Kang Ho, I get Memories of Murder, Taxi Driver and another movie about world war 2 between Korea and Japan.<br/><br/>The I realized, most of Song Kang Ho's best movies are directed by Bong Joon-ho, which are not much. This guy is about quality, he doesn't make movie every year. It took 3 years hiatus from The Host to direct the next one, Mother, and it took another 4 years before Bong Joon-ho directed Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton.<br/><br/>But Parasite is another masterpiece. It's easily considered as the best movie of 2019. Forget the noisy blockbuster Hollywood action flick. Parasite is a gem, a real gem that only movie lover can appreciate. Carefully directed, smooth dialog, the theme about the class struggle, the acting, the plot, the craziness, the comedic situation, all you could not easily forget.<br/><br/>I fall in love with Korean movies because of Bong Joon-ho and Song Kang-ho."

If you are rich, you must be richer than you; if you are poor, you must be poorer than you.
The gap between rich and poor is like countless walls, dividing people into three, six, and nine.

","This film got a lot of praise going into the Oscars season this year for not only being a commentary of society in the same way Joker does, but doing it through the lens of a Korean family. by doing this it forces the film to have a different feel from any film of its type. Many Americans don't understand the class system of other countries, and getting to see another countries class system being represented on screen gives the film a very different type of feel.<br/><br/>In Korea there are a lot of stricter gun laws that stop people from getting to them so in order to make a kill you would have to use other methods, and that does play a role within the context of this film and adds to the complete and utter fear that can come from it.<br/><br/>There are also a issue for more flooding for the poor in Korea in which this film also addresses in a lot of big and massive ways throughout the film as it becomes the catalyst for why the family makes many of the choices that they choose to make within it.<br/><br/>Parasite really does manage to capture the essence of what truly matters in our society for the poor and the rich and their differences"

"deepika-75289","9","1","4","25 February 2020"," Great story; outstanding screenplay
","**Spoiler alert**<br/><br/>Winning an Oscar despite being a foreign language film is remarkable. Inspired by the Oscar win and the surrounding publicity if you watch the trailer, it will intrigue you enough to feel an urgency for watching the movie.<br/><br/>That this is a class war movie will be evident by then. That there is a parasite central to the story is implied too but who preys on whom is still subject to interpretation or is at least a twisted discovery you make as the story unravels.<br/><br/>There is a rich family, gullible & nice but also self-centered and afflicted with class divide enough to dominate everyday decisions in their high-ground lives.
There is a poor family struggling for food and shelter in their below the ground apartment life and yet reveling in their laziness and short term merry making of whatever bounty they can get from odd jobs.<br/><br/>When an opportunity comes knocking, promising an easy way of pulling them out of their pit, they pursue it full throttle morality and legalities be damned.
The momentum of their success builds up for a while and descend begins as they encounter a secret and fraud of another kind threatening their new found prosperity.<br/><br/>As they discover people like themselves who have stakes in uncovering their frauds, they have to win the fight to not slip back to their below the ground existence. The unfolding of surrounding events also leads to a realization that the idea of their affluence is also just a mirage. After all the stench of the basement remains in them and rich people will forever pinch their nose in disgust as their stench wafts through the rich people's perfumed houses.<br/><br/>There is a moment of irony too when a few hours after they had savored the rainfall as they lay usurping the living room of their bosses and pretending that they belonged their after all, they realize that unknown to them the same heavy rain had filled up their basement house with dirty sewer water, destroying their belongings and rendering them homeless in real life.
The pretense of being rich as a part of their rich bosses life suddenly becomes exhausting and together with the chaos of meeting their possible nemesis shocks them out of their reveries of affluence, shatters all their future planning and leads to a complete meltdown a day later.<br/><br/>The final scene plays out amidst an ominous setting. The feeling about an impending tragedy is strong. It still manages to be darkly-funny as Geun-Sey plays out his murderous streak with a comical frenzy.<br/><br/>The movie won an Oscar for original screenplay and is as much a masterpiece as implied by that accolade. It talks literally and metaphorically about the chasms in the society and leaves the viewers to decide if there are any heroes or villains at all.<br/><br/>The movie shows self-imposed helplessness that poverty brings along, how the urge to come out of its grips fast and easy often pushes people further in to its throes. That the need for escapism is so strong that precious reality is lost and often the only way out through education, a steady job is completely lost.<br/><br/>Ki-Woo often promises himself and others about the rightful things he will do and achieve, but often leaves it to a later day. At present he is too busy forging the documents, fencing off his day to day struggles or later, longing for the good days that happened, and this is likely to be his way of life throughout in the absence of any supportive surrounding.<br/><br/>That is also how the movie ends, with a promise by him which he is sure to never fulfill and so the longing, the aspirations, the needs will remain along with the helplessness of never quiet achieving them.<br/><br/>The parasite in the meantime could either be the one who had resigned to an underground life living off the bounty stolen from his rich savior as long as he lived, or the one who is still alive and hiding in the same underground hell albeit with a hope of one day coming out of it.
Or it could be both of them or all the poor men in a hurry to attach their woeful life to those better off around them and be like parasites by the awful choices they make or maybe as a natural order of things or a bit of both."

","One of director, Bong Joon Ho's favourite cinematic ploys is to mix up the genres. I remember being most unhappy watching his earlier Host (2006) when a perfectly acceptable horror film was interspersed with social comment on the various family members back home. There are great films and great genre films and I can enjoy both but they are different animals. Mr Ho seems to want to do away with the thoughtful script and writing needed for the former and use a mixing of the genre to make up for lack of depth. With Parasite we have, for about an hour, a very decent story building, even if it is becoming more and more far fetched. The big surprise certainly surprised me but not as much as the change that then befall the film and my mind began to wander as all the seriousness fell away. We have a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer. Writing is clearly not his forte and his urge to slip off piste needs, in my opinion, to be restrained so that his wondrous cinematic chemistry can cook away without losing the plot."

","The stories about the social classes, have been interestingly often explored in the books, television series, movies and so on. Especially to see how the main characters, would get through their difficulties by facing them, in the line between poverty and wealth. These stories often explore the theme about hope, to see how the main characters, who have so much will in their souls, would try in all the way to help their family. Some of these stories would end, with the main characters who become wealthy, to help their family with satisfaction. Other stories would end with the main characters, who are still struggling with what they are facing to, without losing any hope even it would take a long time to accomplish something important. The auteur filmmaker Bong Joon Ho have been interested, in making a story which explores this theme. As the audience have been really curious, what the new movie of the filmmaker would be about, once it has been announced. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Parasite by Bong Joon Ho with Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik and Park So Dam. The movie's plot: The unemployed Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) takes the opportunity, to work as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park Family. Then Kim Ki-woo would slowly bring his whole family, his father Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho), his mother Kim Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin) and his sister Kim Ki-jung (Park So Dam), to get each of them a job in the Park Family. Until something unexpected is going to happen, to get a dramatic consequence. From the beginning to the end, the movie would surprise the audience, through the most unexpected twists, especially if something wrong is going to happen, then the Kim Family must find new solutions to not get in trouble. In the same way, the movie gets emotional to see how the Kim family, is so united to never let anything to divide them. The monologues and dialogues were elaborated, to see how the main characters would find new plans, for what they are looking for. Also to let the audience feel the deep meaning of the dialogues and the monologues, especially between the Kim family when they talk about important topics. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in ever single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, to make the sequences look like paintings needed for the Mise en scènes. The editing was specifically elaborated for the narration's rhythm, without ruining it, as well as to build tension in the most unexpected moments. Song Ka Ho was extraordinary as Kim Ki-taek, who would be then the one to tell his son about the meaning if it is necessary or not to have plans. Choi Woo Shik was excellent as Kim Ki-woo, who once works for Park Family he would try to make sure his family have a better life. Chang Hyae Jin did a very well done job as Kim Chung-sook, who would do anything just for her family and not for anybody else. Park So Dam was excellent as Kim Ki-jung, who in the course of the story would just do whatever is necessary to take important decisions. The score by Jung Jaeil was elaborated, to let the audience feel the thrilling moments as well as the emotional moments, to be unforgettable in every single musical notes. Parasite is one of the best movies of 2019, as well as one of the greatest and most unique masterpieces of all time."

","In an unnamed South Korean city, a family of four (a middle-aged couple and their adult son and daughter) all struggle with low-paying jobs to get by in the cramped basement apartment in which they live. After the son has the good fortune of getting a well-paying job in the home of a wealthy family, his other family members manipulate their way into similar good fortune. Massive chaos follows.<br/><br/>Among universally acclaimed films, ""Parasite"" is unique: it is actually worthy of its acclaim. It could be described as bizarrely amazing or amazingly bizarre. Maybe both. The first half succeeds as a farcical comedy before going dramatic with many plot twists and turns, suspense, thrills, and a class war to top it off. The film also wins with its flexibility and mystery as to who are the potential villains. And it has a climax that must be among the best of all time.<br/><br/>While most of the dramatic surprises are welcome, some seem unnecessary and over the top (non-spoiler hint: the scene with the aftermath of a huge rainfall); there are also a few false endings. But these pale compared to the film's many assets the best of which is its uniqueness and originality. The cast is great too especially Song Kang-ho as the patriarch of the poor family. His face registers so much pent-up emotion. And director Bong Joon-ho has talents that are comparable to those of Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>It is easy to compare ""Parasite"" with last year's ""Burning"", another South Korean film that digs deeply into modern class conflicts in explosive ways. While these are only two examples, it seems South Korean cinema leads the way in acknowledging contemporary class struggles - a problem that has exacerbated everywhere for the past three decades or so. Hopefully, these fine examples will inspire many more film-makers in all countries."

","I have never seen a movie which shows so skillfully how the poor (literally) tear each other apart in capitalism. But it goes much further than this, is much more creative, and imagines a story way bigger than just a critique of our society.
Starts as satire, turns into a thriller, and ends as splatter / drama / comedy. Brilliant all the way through.
Only the dialogues might take some getting used to for Western audiences at first."
"jadepietro","9","1","4","8 November 2019"," An Ongoing Metaphor About Class Struggle
","GRADE: B+<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Brilliantly directed, Parasite is a dark satire about class warfare that burrows into your moviegoing pleasure and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Korean director Bong Joon-ho is a very versatile talent whose work is always visionary and highly personal, but not always successful due to his penchant for overstatement. His film subjects most always deal with social issues and oppressive forces against the common man. Yet, his films can range to a host of genres, from horror film to surreal sci-fi to political satire. One cannot easily pigeonhole this director and even his lesser films which become borderline contrived, still contain powerful messages about greed, consumerism, and class struggles.<br/><br/>Parasite may be his best film to date. It is a thrilling and complicated tale that keeps the moviegoer guessing its outcome. The film starts out as a dark comedy, then suddenly veers into pure satire before finishing its journey as a crime story. It is an exhilarating ride. Dare I say, very twisted, metaphorically speaking.<br/><br/>The literate screenplay by Han Jin-won and co-authored by the director contrasts two Korean families: the Kims, a clan of poor grifters living in squalor in a sub-basement apartment doing menial low-paying jobs just to get by, and the Parks, an affluent and dysfunctional family that take their wealth unwisely for granted. The Kims' work their way into the Parks' lives through their lies and deceptive action, all resulting in tragic events.<br/><br/>The script cleverly weaves The Kims' greedy scheming against the Parks' naivety and shallowness to a crescendo of mayhem and violence. The film does have one too many anti-climatic endings and needed a bit more concise storytelling for stronger impact, but Bong Joon-ho masterfully conveys his raging vision of the working class and the elite at war.<br/><br/>The cast is wonderful. Song Kang-ho is the impoverished patriarch and Jang Hye-jin is his shrewish wife. Choi Woo-shik is their idealistic son and Park So-dam is their wily daughter. They battle Lee Sun-kyan as a haughty businessman and Cho Yeo-jeong, in a scene-stealing role, as his fragile and dim wife.<br/><br/>Strong production values reinforce the sharp divide between the classes. Visually, the dirty and cramped cluttered apartment contrasts dramatically with the sunlit contemporary Architectural Digest prototypes created by designer Ha-jun Lee. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong lenses the two settings, lighting one home in dark umber hues and claustrophobic low angles while using bright intense lighting to imply the stark formal symmetry of the other dwelling in order to establish the imbalance of both families.<br/><br/>Parasite is insightful and excels in its execution. Bong Joon-ho creates lasting images that correspond directly to his narratives. His film has much to say about the ongoing power struggle between those who have and those who have not. Simply put, it is one of the year's best films."

","I feel like I've said this a lot this year, but no matter the quality of the finished product, if I can confidently walk out of the theater and feel genuinely thrilled that I experienced that film in a theater, it's an achievement on its own. In today's ever changing streaming world, it's important to keep the theater experience alive. Parasite does that immensely well. Captivating, thought-provoking, unsettling, but above all entertaining, Parasite is one of the most unique films of the year. Much like Get Out a few Oscar seasons ago, Parasite manages to reach a wide audience with its shocking direction, while also broadening the scope of your brain through its incredible intelligence in storytelling. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the last 20 minutes, otherwise this could be flirting with a 10/10.<br/><br/>9.1/10"
"aslisonceley","9","1","4","1 November 2019"," On pure innocence
","Set against an urban background bathing in pollution, floods, and the North-South tension as an ever-present echo in people's psyches, Bong Joon-Ho achieves a revelation of pure innocence of simple humans that are puppets of their circumstances. The relentless positivity of each studied family, even the little basement couple's, their love and dedication to each other keeps the audience in all the way through. It's hard to point the finger at any of the characters as the victim or the perpetrator, except the outside forces or the cutouts posted in the hiding place of the Housekeeper's husband. A Korean tradition by now, masterfully applied in the Wailing and The Chaser, there is an effective tonal play coating the baseline with humor which intensifies the suspense."

"dpers","9","1","4","29 October 2019"," Precise, thoughtful, and awesome twist. SEE THIS IN THEATER
","I had high expectations for this movie, considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year, and it exceeded them. It's a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary, as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family. Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family, and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes, the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation.
Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments, and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter. The intertwining of suspense, humor, and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out,"" so it's a blast to see it in theaters. At a time when originality is lacking at every corner, ""Parasite"" comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well. Great movie!"

"gortx","Null","1","4","23 October 2019"," A wild tasty class satire by Bong Joon-Ho
","There are many wealthy people who have taken short cuts -- legal or not -- to get their place in society. The Kim family in Seoul is of the underclass, but, they see no issue adopting the 'ethics' of some of the very wealthy to claim a piece for themselves. The Kims are living in a below street level hovel barely scraping by, but they aren't without certain wits and skills.
An opportunity falls in their lap when their son Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) finds himself tutoring a sweet teen daughter (Jung Ziso) or a successful tech entrepreneur Park Dong-Ik (Sun-kyun Lee) and his lovely if simple wife Yeon-Kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). Before long the Kims all but move into the Parks' spacious architectural marvel of a home (each couple has a male and a female child).
Director Bong Joon-Ho who also co-wrote the screenplay (with Jin Won Han) takes his time to set up the story. As seen in his previous work such as OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, THE HOST and MOTHER, Bong isn't the most formal filmmaker working today. His movies often seem wildly inconsistent in style and tone. Seeming leaps in logic and form abound. But, what makes his work so consistently invigorating and exciting is that if one looks past the seeming chaotic structure, Bong plays fair with the viewer. The extended set-ups are a means to an end. There is a 'Bong Playbook' that he is setting up and he abides by those rules.
PARASITE is an exemplary case of the Bong Playbook. Once the dominoes fall the scabrous satire can cut deeply. Class warfare isn't an original concept in and of itself, but Bong continually upends expectations and circumstances here. Making it all the more interesting is that he doesn't set up the rich Park family as cartoon villains. Heck, they are so banal that one feels more sympathy for them. You shouldn't want them to get their lives disrupted -- but, you also can't help but cheer on the disruptors (the Kims).
Bong takes PARASITE to some dark places and quite visceral places. There's some razor sharp allusions to the works of the great Luis Bunuel (DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID, VIRIDIANA), Chabrol's (CEREMONIE) as well as, most pointedly, Gorky's The Lower Depths, but, it still remains firmly the work of Bong Joon-Ho. Without a doubt, there are some allusions to provincial matters in South Korean society that will escape domestic viewers, but, Bong's scalpel cuts broadly and deeply enough for most international audiences (it won the Palme D'or at Cannes). It's a wild nasty ride. Take it."

"rockman182","8","1","4","15 October 2019"," Parasite (2019)
","There is a real insurmountable hype surrounding Bong Joon-ho's latest film. Playing only in one theater in NYC and it was sold out all weekend. Luckily, I was able to go see an early showing of this film on my day off. The hype is real. I enjoyed this film and was glued to the screen for the entire duration of the film. Its, funny, smart, violent, and socially timely. Whatever, you do please go see Parasite as it is going to be one of the best films of the year and is one of my favorites already.<br/><br/>The film is about a poor family who live in a shabby basement and need money and struggle to survive. An opportunity comes for the son of the family as he forges documents and gets a job as a private tutor for a very wealthy family. Soon the rest of his family begin setting up situations where each of them get hired for the family. The family keep their identities hidden but soon come across dark situations and they must go to great lengths to protect their secret and their new found wealth.<br/><br/>Bong Jonon-ho's films are usually very well shot and there is no difference here. Everything is so pristine and each small detail tells a story. The script for this film is a mix of comedy and thriller and it works so well. The leading family in this film are desperate and in poverty so you want to identity with them but then you realize that this family do some terrible stuff for their own greed, even if it means hurting innocent people.<br/><br/>The film goes into the depths of exploring class differences and the gap between the wealthy and poor. It doesn't matter the country, this is just ever present everywhere. Its underlying and subtle at first but the theme resonates, especially through the patriarch of the family, portrayed by Song Kang-ho. I'm trying to find something to criticize about the film but am struggling to find things I didn't like. It is a fairly long film but it zooms by because of how entertaining it truly is.<br/><br/>This is of course the final season of the year and Oscar season is in full swing. Parasite should really be up there with a Best Picture nomination and I'd say is a strong contender for being the best film of the year. Its so mesmerizing in all regards. I might need to check out more South Korean films as I greatly appreciated Burning last year. I'm gonna reiterate, go and see this film.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication.<br/><br/>I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography, taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind. Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects, and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation.<br/><br/>
This movie portrays a lower-class family, making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world, by skipping into the higher layer of society. Although they have less to show, they are more of a family than their higher-class counterpart, living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together. In a way, it blends and clearly separates these two worlds, similair in essence but completely different in reality.<br/><br/>It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall, where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer. Because of this, you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow, or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich.<br/><br/>In the end, one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives, taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life's purpose as it pleases?"

","Parasite will go down in history as one of the best comedy and international films of the century.The film stars Korean celebrated actor Song Kang-ho as Kim-taek the head of a poor deprived Korean family living in a basement; with his wife and two children.
The film tells the story of a poor family living in a basement without access to basic utilities. The head of the family is Mr Kim. He wants the best for the family. But he cant afford the cost of university education for his intelligent son, Kevin and brilliant daughter, Jessica. Min is a friend of Kevin. He also wants the best for his friend. He recommended Kevin to take his place as a tutor. Kevin became the personal tutor of Da-hye, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Kevin was able to grab this life changing opportunity. First he brought in Jessica as an art teacher. The two worked intelligently and perfectly by bringing in their dad and mum as driver and househelp respectively. But nothing is so perfect in this world. What would happen it comes to knowledge that they are related as family?
The film is set in suburbs and high class residential area in a typical Korean city. This gives it the affluence versus poverty touch that underlines the theme of the film. The script was suspenseful and full of excitement. The performance of Song Kang-Ho was spectucular. He blended emotions with intelligence. Directing wise, individual performances raised the bar.Everyone knew what they were doing and delivered with aplomb. The quality of the film's video editing gave it a polishing and glossing visual impressions. However, I was not impressed with the films dialogue. It did less than enough to convey the theme of the film to its audience.

","Of the films in contention this year, I think I would have given Best Director and Best Picture awards to Quentin Tarantino and ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD - a sly 'revisionist' take on Tinseltown at the far end of its Golden Age. I can see that PARASITE is highly original and filled with ironical social commentary, but Best Picture? Nah.<br/><br/>It's hard to write about it without spoilers, but it's a tale of two Korean families, one rich and living in a hilltop mansion, the other struggling in a grimy basement below the bottom of the same hill. Crafty as well as envious, the poor people slowly (a bit too slowly, IMO) infiltrate the lives of the rich folk. When the plutocrats take off for a camping trip, things start to unravel.<br/><br/>The theme of the working class subverting the Upper Crust was brilliantly explored in Joseph Losey's THE SERVANT (1963), which did not morph from Social Drama into Horror territory. I think PARASITE has to be judged as a horror movie, since that's where it ends up. Set against the standards of Class-A horrors like PSYCHO and THE EXORCIST, I would not put PARASITE in their league. Good, yes, and clever, beautifully shot and edited (and acted), but not up there with The Best. Sorry!"

However, this film has been held aloft like Simba by all concerned within the entertainment industry as the 'thing' you need to love and that makes a rebel without a case like me peg my nose."
"CelluRob","7","1","5","18 February 2020"," A film of two halves...
","I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie. The premiss that a family of grifters manage to infiltrate a pretty vacuous wealthy family by pretending to be, initially, a qualified English teacher, then an off-the-wall art teacher; a chauffeur and finally a housekeeper is original, funny and harmless. The humorous and mischievous way the family gel with their ambitions for a better life is a testament to the excellent performances from the four the principal characters. Regrettably, however, the second half descends quite rapidly into a farcical story that drags it down. Their harmless deception takes on a far more sinister - and implausible - guise as we quite literally discover (living) bodies under the stairs. It's now almost slapstick; ultimately violent and Bong Joon Ho now just seems to have lost his way. Yeo-jeong Jo is good, too, as the wealthy wife and I would heartily highly recommend this film, but it is - in my opinion - nowhere near as good as ""Mother""."

","Just seen the film. Yes, it is good piece of cinematography. Telling story of different worlds people live in. Separate social bubbles. But what afterthoughts do we have while leaving the cinema?<br/><br/>""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer""? Obvious truths. Nothing new we didn't knew about. Sterile environment of upper class, cockroach life of underprivileged. Dullness of these which have and hopelessness of these which don't. Characters without depth put into roles they were born into.<br/><br/>Some symbolism justifying incostinant and improbable plot, but is there enough reason for its application? I see very little."

","The first half hour is promising. Then it turns into a catastrophe. No one can believe, even with simpletons as employers, that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who've been unemployed for so long, obviously because they're good to nothing. They're irresponsible heartless. The movie is overlong and mostly boring, the characters are unlikable. And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie. The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese. If I were Scorsese I'd resent it as an insult."

I found the dialogue between the characters quite exaggerated a lot of the times. All in all, it is a pretty good movie. But not worthy the extreme praise given from a lot of movie critiques, and not really worth the very high rating given here by the users of IMDB."

It has some pretty good twists, but there not like twists in Us, Sixth Sense or Book of Eli where on second viewing things make so much more sense. It's more of a twist like in the first Saw. The movie is also a little slow. The first half is funny though, and it's always very intriguing. Good acting, great cinematography and a good ending.

The film focuses on ""crossing the line"" which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re-visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it."

"heyitskeane","9","1","5","7 December 2019"," It'll make you laugh, cry and probably check your basement
","I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.<br/><br/>It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances.<br/><br/>The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too.<br/><br/>The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere.<br/><br/>In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me.<br/><br/>Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."

","I'm not usually a fan of Korean movies, but this one got me very interested from the very beginning, it's not the first time a movie makes us root for someone even though they're not necessarily doing the right thing, but it makes us question once again, what is the right thing? I really loved the representation of society in this one, it shows a whole different side.. even though the family was very poor they still had energy and were clever enough to actually go out and try and change it.
The movie was dramatic, funny, scary in all the right ways."

","What a masterpiece that was. Being familiar with the korean cinema and the overload of fantasy it carries every time, I wasn't really prepared for this rare gem. It's mix of pretty much every movie genre and a hell of an emotion ride.
It all starts very smooth and simple, kinda funny too as we've been introduced the family. You can easily assume It's a family
comedy drama. So far so good.. From the moment that the boy gets into this rich House and then, mess an chaos surrounded the place. It all turns into a crime, soft thriller mood and It's getting darker and darker until it explodes. I don't wanna say much because it will destroy all the fun. In my opinion you should not read or hear anything about the plot, before seeing this movie. The only useful tip, is good to know is that after the first 15-20 mins, starts a wonderful ride and you will definitely love every single minute of it.
Spoiler ALERT
Here in Greece we say ""The one who always searching for the Big fish, turns out losing and the small one (he already got)"". So never be greedy guys. Be thankful with what you have and always work harder if you wanna do better.

Another one is; -still under the coincidentiality umbrella but with a slight twist- a common issue that I tend to realize in above-average-budgeted international movies. They sometimes want to tell too many things when they didn't really need to, which ends up muddying up the overall balance of the main story.<br/><br/>An unemployed family of 4 infiltrate into a rich family's household."

","Bong Joon Ho once again delivers a great film with unexpected twists along the way. Parasite is a film about a poor family of four that slowly but surely worms their way into a rich family, by mostly luck and subtle persuasion. The son becomes an English tutor to the rich girl, the daughter becomes an art therapist to the young boy who can't sit still, the father becomes the driver for the successful man of the house and the mother becomes the housekeeper for the rich family.<br/><br/>It's a family affair of course and things are well for a while as their employers are none the wiser. Then the old housekeeper comes back and it's revealed that she has been keeping her husband in the basement for about 4 years. Then, well. Things go downhill from there. There are death and murders.

"justinwfirestone","8","1","5","27 November 2019"," A perfectly cromulent film
","The obvious question, which might not have an obvious answer, is who or what is or are the parasites in Parasite? Maybe it is easier to determine who or what is or are the hosts? The first hour plays as though Adam Sandler had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about the poor serving, or parasitically suckling upon, the rich, separated vertically so those on high do not, or even cannot, observe the filth of the lower classes as they struggle to acquire the most basic necessities, such as a good and free wi-fi signal.<br/><br/>The second hour plays as though Sam Peckinpah had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about desperate times and desperate measures, uncertainty about belonging, and a lesson about the fleetingness of a good situation. The mood of Parasite runs somewhat tangentially to that of A Serious Man, a slightly anarcho-nihilistic tone that despite anyone's good or bad intentions, or even lack of intent entirely, there is a dark hole tugging at the back of our brains whispering sweet somethings of impending, unavoidable, and utterly passionless doom.<br/><br/>Given this background, one might argue that there is no message, no meaning to a movie like Parasite. At the least, it is an investigation into whether a host or parasite can change its behavior for the better or for the worse."
"truemythmedia","8","1","5","26 November 2019"," One of the Best of 2019
","I'm a fan of Joon-ho Bong's films, although I haven't seen one of his most famous films, ""Memories of Murder."" I was very excited to see this movie with my wife, who, uncharacteristically, was interested in a foreign art film.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in this movie so I am afraid my own exploration of it here, will only scratch the surface of what there is to say about it. I'll only briefly mention the cinematography which is just wonderful. This is Joon-ho unleashed from the bonds of entertainment that are part and parcel with a film that is released on Netflix (Okja) or in American theaters (Snowpiercer.) Here, he can luxuriate with height imagery ranging from subterranean staircases to winding city streets descending into the slums in order to sub-textually communicate ideas to his audience and he does it with subtle panache'.<br/><br/>What I think the average movie goer will appreciate most about this film is the dichotomy of humor and terror in the characters, acting, script, and general 'feel' of the film. It is certainly the most jarring turn of atmosphere I have seen in a film this year and one that I like to imagine every one who watches this film will enjoy and experience as a true revelation.<br/><br/>The themes of class struggle and survival all writ large in this film. From the beginning where we see the poor as they seek to find the means to sustain their lives by abandoning their true identities to be whatever the rich want them to be in order to glean scraps from their table to the dismissal of the poor for even the hint of an offense rather than actually getting to know them and their place to the desperation of people being asked to sub-exist and their eventual reaction, this film stuns by not only displaying the benefits of a life linked to a wealthy person and the happiness that some find there but also watching that happiness turn to despair as time passes.<br/><br/>The humor and joy that is in ""Parasite"" is truly experienced by the audience so that the turn feels true as well when the rug is pulled out. This isn't a horror movie with a dash of humor, or a funny movie with a sprinkle of violent class struggle. It is both, one of the funniest movies I've seen all year and the terror inducing in the same way as the best atmospheric horror that $11.50 at your local cinema can buy.<br/><br/>All of this is interesting but, if done too heavy-handed, feels preachy or propagandist. Luckily, Joon-ho knows how to restrain himself from such blunt force methods as having someone scream something like ""Soylent green is people,"" or ""You maniacs, you blew it up."" (boy did CH ever corner the market on that.) By restraining himself it allows the audience to come to conclusions, ask questions, and discuss amongst themselves without the feeling of manipulation. It respects the audience enough to say, ""I'm not going to tell you how to think but check out this funny, crazy, and fantastic situation and let's hear what YOU think.""<br/><br/>I imagine there are a host of other interesting reading of this film and that is what makes it so fascinating and gives me some degree of comfort when I call this movie more than a movie. It is Art.<br/><br/>Not everyone is into art. I am. If you are too than you should definitely be searching this movie out, supporting it, thinking about it, and discussing it. I know I was thinking about it for days afterward. Weeks now, I guess."
"Lewis_Heather787","9","1","5","24 November 2019"," This film has everything !!!!!
","The only reason I watched this film was because of the great reception it got at film festivals this year and word of mouth from the indie film scene. I'm not going to lie I don't watch a lot, if any, non-English language films...........don't ask me why I don't know. However after seeing this my world has been opened to the possibilities of other films that could be out there.<br/><br/>Bong Joon-ho has directed a bloody fantastic film from start to finish............it is impeccable, I don't have a fault just praise.......His camera work throughout the film is ever changing, there is so much uniqueness to it.........I really don't think I've seen a film like it before. Coupled with some gorgeous cinematography, the film is amazingly beautifully shot............outstanding!!<br/><br/>I'm not going to name names with the performances for a couple of reasons, firstly they are all incredible for their own reasons and also the fact that I have pretty much no idea who any of the actors are. That last point is actually a major positive for me because I didn't seem them as actors I just saw them as people on the screen, there wasn't the movie star or famous face that I had to get past.........in all english language films there is a I'm familiarity with those actors. It can sometimes take a while to buy into their performances, but by not knowing any of them it meant I bought into all the characters and their relationships straight away.<br/><br/>The story is horrific...........but not in a gruesome way, this is the definition of a smart psychological thriller period. The story of a low-class family of con-artists who invade there way one by one into the lives of a upper-class family is genius, the film definitely deserves its english title. That is the central message of the film i think.......class and the gulf between the classes in society. Its not just spoken in the dialogue but subtly played on throughout the film, building towards a climax at the end. Trust me the end of this film is breath-taking and extremely clever. But not only the end there are so many twists and turns throughout the film that it always keeps you guessing..............especially the basement !!!!!!!<br/><br/>The film has everything, tension, comedy, drama, seriousness, addresses societal issues, family relationships, sad endings and happy endings. Plus a lot of Kubrick esque stuff throughout..............However it is definitely its own film by a long long way.<br/><br/>I am speechless after watching it and cant wait to watch it again 90% out of 100 it is simply brilliant from start to finish. Bong Joon-ho has opened my world to foreign language films...............my naive little British brain has been blown up. This film as well as its actors deserve all the acclaim and awards attention they get!!"

","I saw the film without any expectation. Sure, I watched the trailer, but thank god it was one of those rare unicorns that show the TONE of the film but do not anticipate the story line. Thank you for THAT, editors!<br/><br/>Bong Joon-Ho mastered the art of slow character development, complex world building and creating subtle tension throughout the story... yet I did not know what to expect (remembering MOTHER and SNOWPIERCER). I just knew: there will be a GREAT story inside - and wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Light, bright images, well constructed use of space and overall clean visuality suck us deeper and deeper into the character's game. They play it bravely, they risk it all. It never gets boring during 2 hours - many unexpected plot twists, executed well with the genre methods of suspense and thriller movies. He uses his main elements well. The story ends at a completely different point (perspective?) than where we started - I had great fun watching it.<br/><br/>I am still not sure if there's a political message or social criticism hidden behind it all - for sure it shines a light on individual fate and visible (and invisible!) differences between the rich and the poor.<br/><br/>Unexpected, thrilling and a lot to think about!"
"ursozen2000","9","1","5","19 November 2019"," A disturbing yet beautifully woven tale of social disparity
","Bong Joon Wo's 'Parasite' is a disturbing yet beautifully woven tale depicting the dehumanizing gap between the haves and have-nots. Metaphorically and figuratively, Ki Tae's family live below the ground of the haves. Their toilet is even higher than their dwelling ground. This is how poor they are. They struggle to barely crawl up to the surface of economic adequacy, resorting to scams and deceptions, scrapping to make ends meet. The seeming victims are the Parks, a well to do family enveloped in the world of luxury and complacency. Much of the depictions of Ki Tae's family members would initially make the audience think of how despicable they are. While the parks are portrayed to be adequately tolerant of the underprivileged as long as their life is not in any way imposed. Slowly but surely the movie unravels. The subtext of hopelessness of classism soon reveals itself, mixed in with a very well thought out plot twists. 'Parasites' shows a world where the underprivileged are too wrapped in their own survival to recognize the trap they are in while the privileged are too busy meandering the labyrinth of western luxury. One of the best movies ever crafted for sure."

","That was my reaction. Parasite starts as a sardonic black comedy about the relations between a poor family and a rich one in present day Seoul before veering off in an entirely unexpected, much darker, almost surreal direction.<br/><br/>The protagonists are the impoverished Kim family. Dad is a Micawber like optimistic fatalist, who has failed at numerous jobs but always expects something to turn up. Mom is solid and practical, a one-time high school track star, who keeps things together. The mid-20s daughter and college-age son are smart, quick, glib and nervy, willing to do whatever it takes, but they don't seem to have found their footing. They don't always agree, but they stick together.<br/><br/>The Kims live in a cramped, squalid basement apartment in the kind of neighborhood where drunks piss in the street. The scrape up a little money folding boxes for neighborhood pizzeria, none too competently. As we meet them, they have just lost free wi-fi because the neighbor upstairs has passworded her router. Dad advises the kids to hold their phones up and move around the apartment to see if they can catch a signal. They do, up on the ledge where the toilet sits. That's Dad's strategy for life in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Deliverance arrives in the form of Son's high school buddy Min, now in college. Min has a gig tutoring English to the 15 year old daughter of a very rich family. He's going to study abroad for a year, and he wants Son to hold his place till he gets back. Min intends to start dating the girl when she's old enough, and he figures Son will be a harmless substitute. Son did well on the English part of the college entrance exam, and Min assures him that he can bs his way through.<br/><br/>The rich family, named Park, live in a gorgeous, spacious modern mansion on a hill, formerly the home of a renowned modern architect who has since moved on to bigger things in Paris. The father is the kind of Korean global businessman who has been the subject of an admiring profile in the New York Times. Mrs. Park is described by Min as ""slow,"" which isn't quite right. She's an oblivious but nice lady, more ornamental than useful, who depends on a middle aged housekeeper and who dotes on and spoils her hyperactive 8 year old son. You might call her street dumb. The same is true of her husband, who knows his way around business but is not as worldly wise as he thinks he is.<br/><br/>The Parks are insulated from the realities of everyday life by a thick cushion of money, and they think the world works the way it's supposed to. Park is always concerned that the family servants ""don't cross the line"" into familiarity. He and his wife assume that anything American is automatically first class and, to show their sophistication, they pepper their Korean conversation with scraps of English the way Miss Piggy uses French.<br/><br/>With the help of a diploma forged by Daughter Kim on Photoshop, Son aces his interview with Mrs. Park and gets hired to give English lessons 2 or 3 afternoons a week. In short order, he and the girl are also making out when Mom's back is turned. Son sees the boy's weird paintings pinned up on the fridge. He suggests to Mrs. Park that the boy could use art therapy and that he just happens to know an American trained art therapist. Mrs. Park swallows the bait, Daughter Kim bluffs her way through the interview with a combination of arrogance and art therapy buzz words she's picked up on the internet, and in short order she's having regular sessions with the little boy. Now that they're through the Parks' gate, the Kim kids manipulate things so that the chauffeur gets fired and is replaced by Dad, and the housekeeper gets fired and is replaced by Mom. They never let on that they're all related. The Parks don't have a clue. When the little boy notices that the new driver smells just like his art teacher, Mr. Park brushes it off because all the people who ride the subway smell the same.""<br/><br/>At the halfway point, this has just been an amusing and quite enjoyable story of the clever, scrappy poor putting one over on the clueless, entitled rich. The Kims are making a very good living off the Parks and eating better than they have in a long time. Of course we know that the Kims will somehow screw up this honeypot and be threatened with discovery and disaster. Things do spiral out of control, but in a completely unexpected way. I can't say how without a major spoiler; let's just say that the Park mansion conceals some extraordinary secrets and that the injuries that the Kims have inflicted come back to haunt them. Their struggle to stave off detection starts as slapstick but gets more and more desperate, and it builds to a climax that you don't see coming but is completely foreshadowed and leaves you wrung out. Definitely worth it.<br/><br/>One sidelight for American viewers. Mr. Kim and one other character have each gone broke in the ""Taiwanese Cake"" business. I googled that. It turns out that there is a pattern in South Korean life of fads giving rise to a large number number of opportunistic but undercapitalized small businesses that fail when the fad runs its course. Taiwanese Cake was one of them, the equivalent of the US cupcake fad of 10 years ago."

","Often we come across this saying that ""Ignorance is not the same as innocence"" and another saying that ""Ignorance is bliss"". This film captures them both. On the one hand there are the Kims, a family of four living in sorrowful condition in a semi basement structure, on the other hand there's the wealthy Park family, living in a rich neighborhood uptown. But with riches, comes ignorance. An eventful twist in the tale for the Kim family, leads all of them being employed by the Parks and how they start to feed off their hosts, just like a parasite, much to the ignorance of the ignorance of the Park family. When all things seem to be settled for the Kims, there comes another turn of events which gives the film a deeper metaphorical narrative. Parasite is one of such pictures that makes you look into the society you live in, makes you uncomfortable at times and questions your ignorance. You may think that your housemaid is working for you but is she really? Would you trust your car driver? Or your child's tutor?"
"bankofmarquis","8","1","5","12 November 2019"," Strongly Directed by Bong Joon-Ho
","There are more strong film makers in this world than are just sitting in traditionally English-speaking Countries (like the U.S./England). One of the strongest - and a Director that I will watch WHATEVER he is Directing - is South Korean auteur Bong Joon-Hoo. His previous efforts (THE HOST, OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, amongst others) were all led by intriguing stories, interesting people and strong visual imagery, so I was very excited for his newest effort, PARASITE. I purposely did not find out too much about this film, for I wanted to be surprised by what was unfolding in front of me.<br/><br/>And...I was rewarded, greatly by another intriguing story with interesting people and strong visual imagery.<br/><br/>In Korean, with English subtitles, PARASITE follows a lower class Korean family that go to work for a high class Korean family and brings us on a journey for BOTH families. And that's all I'm going to say about it, for to reveal anything else would be to spoil the surprises along the way.<br/><br/>But, as is often the case with these types of stories, it is the journey, not the destination that is the treat of this film. Bong Joon-Ho regular Kang-ho Song stars as the Patriarch of the lower class family who, seemingly, is lazy and allergic to ""work"", but that is not really the case. Woo-sik Choi is the son of the lower class family that connects with the daughter of the higher class family and Hye-jin Jang is the matriarch of the lower class family and they both bring sensitivity and strength to their roles. But for me, the real star of this film is So-dam Park as the daughter of this family who turns out to be the heart and the brains of the operation.<br/><br/>Director Bong Joon-Ho brings his usual flair to the proceedings, not letting his camera shy away from the seemy underbelly of this society, but not lingering on it either, moving the surprising plot along at a fast (enough) pace to keep you guessing throughout. I see a lot of films, so when I run across a plot that I couldn't tell what was going to come next, it is satisfying.<br/><br/>And, satisfying this film is. Some are calling it an ""Oscar Contender"" and I don't think I would go quite that far - the film does drag a bit in the middle. But, if you can handle reading the subtitles, you'll be entertained indeed by the fervent mind of one of the better Directors working in film today.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A-<br/><br/>8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"benjyboom","8","1","5","8 November 2019"," Pros and cons
","Pros:
Great emotional beats, the three family units were all well written and the actors were great at communicating their roles and motivations
Entertaining writing, the conflict in the first half was genius, while the second half was very unique
Lots of moving parts, small stuff contributed to a larger society or culture
Themes of class, wanting and deserving were expertly communicated, characters and story did a great job relating to them
Very pretty settings, well shot throughout<br/><br/>Cons:
Second half is not as entertaining as the first
Morse code stuff at the end is a little silly<br/><br/>Best part: getting rid of the old housekeeper, height of clever writing, entertaining family unit, was a great exercise in making the viewer want bad people to succeed
Worst part: the mom threatening to involve the police with the underground people, I think they were trying to say the good life corrupted her to become a piece of crap, but it seemed out of character because of how quickly she responded like that"

","This film slaps hard- go see it fool!<br/><br/>So the music is absolutely fantastic, the direction, the technicality, cinematography, acting, script- god this is such a great film.<br/><br/>I had expectations set high because of the trailer I saw for the film. What? The movie didn't meet my expectations? It didn't exceed those expectations either because those expectations were for a film that simply doesn't exist.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I realize I enjoyed the film. Leaving the theater, I already knew I loved this film, but I keep loving it even more.<br/><br/>I simply can't recommend this film enough. There is a high chance you won't enjoy it as much as the hype is making it seem like the worlds best film of ALL TIME, but this one is a masterpiece. Go in with expectations, you will enjoy it.

","I can't help but think that if I were Korean, I'd somehow catch more nuances and details ... and end up appreciating this movie a bit more.<br/><br/>I kind of wish Bong Joon Ho called it something else. Since he's done several well-received sci-fi themed movies, I couldn't get it out of my head that ""maybe"" a sub-plot in the movie involved sinister parasites. Nope - it's purely a metaphor. And that's still fine.<br/><br/>I liked the movie and was interested to see how it developed. But I wouldn't say it was spine-tinglingly suspenseful, shocking or fully engrossing. There were a couple of plot twists that took the movie in new directions. However, I don't think Ho was able to fully capitalize and leverage the twists after the moment had past.<br/><br/>The story is unusual but I didn't find myself having any thought-provoking ideas after the show was over. No doubt it still was interesting to watch the story of two families from different socioeconomic classes interact.

"MrDHWong","9","1","5","3 October 2019"," A quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea
","Parasite is a South Korean black comedy directed by Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, OKJA). Based on a screenplay by Han Jin-won and Bong Joon-ho, it is a quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea.<br/><br/>In Seoul, the unemployed Kim family, led by Ki-taek, his wife Choong-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jeong try to get by in their cramped basement apartment. One day, Ki-woo's friend suggests to him that he take over as a tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family while he travels abroad. Over time, the rest of the Kim family start taking jobs offered to them by the Parks at their large mansion while masquerading under fake names so as not to give away that the four of them are related and eventually start to reap the benefits of the Park's swanky lifestyle.<br/><br/>With its unique Korean style, Parasite has just the right balance between dark comedy and family drama that it never bores its audience. It's just so much fun seeing how each member of the Kim family were adjusting to their new lavish ways in a house that doesn't even belong to them. This feels like a commentary on societal class in Korea, in how each citizen likely has their own perspective on how to live in the moment. Even better is the ending, which I will not spoil, but what I will say is that it concludes the story in the best way possible. If you watch one Korean movie this year, make it this one."

","Being an Asian myself, it feels great to see Asian films win the Palme d'Or for two consecutive years. Parasite has a quite unique style and tempo in telling its story. Most spectators, while watching the first half of the film, might well mistake it for a comedy that depicts life of a bunch of jobless social dregs. Well, the plot took some drastic turns when the parasite family lodged happily in the mansion of their employer. The second half is full of vehement conflicts, as if the masks that helped hide the impassable gap between their classes has suddenly disappeared. The stench felt by the couple is all too metaphoric. Educated and civilized as they are, the couple still could not withhold the disdain they held for the lower class in the social hierarchy. Clash of different identities finally turned into a catastrophe. Impoverished people, despite trying every means they are able to get hold of, be it wily tricks or honest labor, will always feel out of place up high on the social ladder. Maybe drinking beers in the damp and dark corner will be a happier ending than to spend life in disguise and despair."

"cappiethadog","9","1","6","15 November 2019"," Rear bushes
","The window looks like a movie screen. At the outset, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho immediately evokes Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", the 1954 mystery thriller about the man in a wheelchair who diagnoses a neighbor's murder plot against his wife from across the courtyard of an urban apartment complex. On a subtextual level, photographer L.B. Jeffries(James Stewart) is a voyeur; he glimpses scenes from ordinary people's lives that were never meant for his eyes. Film theorist Laura Mulvey, in her essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"", linked with moviegoing with voyeurism. We like to watch, more or less, is what Mulvey surmised. When Lars Thorwald(Raymond Burr), the surveilled man, does nothing integral to the cover-up of his wife's murder, Jeffries naps with his body faced away from the mini-dramas unfolding in each apartment square. Ki-woo(Choi Woo-shik), in ""Parasite"", the 2019 winner of the Palm d'or at Cannes, would rather squint at a tiny screen, as demonstrated by the camerawork, a downwards tilt, in which we see the young man staring into his phone instead at the world outside from the sofa of his family's semi-basement apartment. Just like everybody else, Kim Ki-Woo would rather watch a movie on a five-inch screen, instead of the communal experience you get from traditional movie exhibition. But Bong, for the sake of contrast, replicates Hitchcock, with four voyeurs, not just one, watching a man urinate in their alleyway, a nod, perhaps, to Italian neorealism. Later, the same man returns to relieve himself, but this time, Ki-woo's college friend, Min-hyuk(Park Seo-joon), defends their garbage area with thrown bottled water. Both projections of liquid, the water and retaliatory pee, are subjected to slo-mo, transforming narrative into spectacle.<br/><br/>Ki-woo is unemployed. So are his parents and older sister. To pay the rent, they fold pizza boxes; they copy the woman on the pizzeria's website. This repetitious task may look mundane, proletarian and unsexy, but there are people with fetishes, and these fetishists with a predilection for androgynous-looking women who convert cardboard into boxes are voyeurs, too. The Kims don't use Microsoft cell phones, but if they did, the Lumia would run Windows, an apt description of what Jeffries sees from his vantage point; open windows, which run in diametrical opposition to his rear window. Mulvery recognized that the photographer with a leg cast was a peeping tom. Jeffries ogles a woman he identifies as ""Miss Torso""(Georgine Darcy), who does calisthenics in what looks like a proto-sports bar. The moviegoer identifies with Jeffries; the moviegoer also likes to look at women in various states of undress in the dark. The ""male gaze"", as she coined it, because of wireless streaming, no longer, in filmic circumstances, is no longer confined to a theater seat; the female image went mobile and saw light. The woman who is good at making pizza boxes has no control over her own image.<br/><br/>Min-hyuk tutors the girl of a very rich family. Ki-woo's old high school buddy needs a replacement, somebody he can trust, while the English-speaking student attends college abroad, in America. To get the plum job, Ki-woo can't show that he's overawed by his luxurious surroundings. At the Park family's domain, he has to be Ki-woo in italics, an actor; a cool customer. Yeon-gyo(Cho Yeo-jeong), the girl's mother, insists on observing Ki-woo conduct her daughter's first, and potentially, last college preparatory session. When Da-hye(Jung Ji-so) errs on a practice test question, the tutor grabs this rich girl's wrist with two stern fingers, and reprimands her for lacking confidence, which, in effect, levels the playing field for Ki-woo by being the man made out chutzpah, not money. Ki-jeong(Park So-dam), Ki-woo's sister, hired as an art therapy teacher for Da-song(Jung Hyun-joo), the Parks' young son, is even bolder; she banishes the micro-managing mother from the room. Yeon-gyo would never guess that this pair of young adults live in the ghetto. If she knew how disparate the socioeconomic gap between both families were, both Ki-woo and Ki-jeong would probably be fired on the spot. Along with the meditation on voyeurism, ""Parasite"" shares with ""Rear Window"" the depiction of class-consciousness. Although Lisa Fremont(Grace Kelly), a Manhattan socialite, gives L.B. Jeffries an inferiority complex, this strained relationship withstands the photographer's emasculation, because the female fashion tastemaker, a seeming first lady of haute couture, believes that ""there can't be much difference between people and the way they live"". In ""Parasite"", however, it's not just class consciousness, it's class warfare, since money matters to both the Park and Kim family alike. Park Dong-ik(Lee Sun-kyun), an information technology firm CEO, talks repeatedly about lines that the ""help"" can't cross. The chauffeur, Ki-taek(Song Kang-ho), Ki-woo's father, overhears Dong-ik telling his wife that he smells; an odor which could be more metaphoric than literal. In ""Parasite"", all the compromises to fit in are made by the Kims, whereas in ""Rear Window"", it's Lisa who has to change, slumming she does, as exemplified by being interested in the book ""Beyond the High Himalayas"", for the sake of the fragile male ego. She has to remake herself in L.B. Jeffries image of an ideal woman. That's not how the world works anymore. All the splendor in this rich family's house turns the Kims into parasites.<br/><br/>The window at the Park residence looks like a movie screen, too; and this window is in the backyard, a rear window. Nothing but green grass, a perfect lawn with tastefully chosen plants and flowers at its borders. But then, after the Park family comes home from a camping trip ruined by rain, Da-song pitches an Indian tent, transforming the performative soundstage into a western. Now there is a genre film waiting to happen, a western, just like how ""Rear Window"" turns into film noir, when he realizes the machinations of Lars Thorwald. The point-of-view shots in the Hitchcock film all come from Jeffries' perspective; the audience never sees L.B. from Thorwald's vantage point. In other words, Hitchcock doesn't employ the shot/countershot when Thorwald understands that somebody is watching his every move. Joon-ho, on the other hand, shows the Park house interior, not as a POV shot, but as a reverse shot; an omniscient one, in which only the real audience, not a diegetic audience of one, sees the melee between the Kims and Moon-gwang(Lee Jung-eun), the former housekeeper, and Geun-sae(Park Myung-hoon), her husband, who lives in a bunker secreted away within the house. Although Moon-gwang and her imprisoned husband share the same class status as the Kim family, the ex-housekeeper, who once doted on the house's famous architect, judges not just her former employers, but the help staff, as well, for being philistines. Moon-gwang narrates a flashback scene in which we see herself and Geun-sae not just inhabiting the place like riff-raff, but experiencing the living room as aesthetes. With a great sense of nostalgia and loss in her voice, Moon-gwang describes the sunlight, when it hits the glass, the reflection then casts a lovely glow upon the entire house. It's coded talk for celluloid. A reminiscence that is starkly contrasted to the mis-en-scene, in which the aesthetes and philistines fight over incriminating digital footage on Moon-gwang's cell phone. You can watch ""Rear Window"" on a cell phone.<br/><br/>Ki-taek tells his son: ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all. Because life cannot be planned.""<br/><br/>Lisa goes off-script. Stella(Thelma Ritter), L.B.'s housekeeper, tries to stop her, after they discover no evidence to support foul play when they dig up the courtyard flower bed. She climbs the exterior staircase to Lars Thornwald's apartment. Lisa crosses the line, echoing Dong-ik's words, but in an extra-diegetic sense, as she transforms herself from spectator to subject; another actor in L.B. Jeffries' movie. He watches his girlfriend find proof, Ms. Thornwald's wedding ring, just before the murder suspect returns. Lisa's ad-lib results in the conviction of Lars Thornwald. Conversely, in ""Parasite"", the lay of the lawn is sandwiched between a rear window and, quite pointedly, rear bushes, where Ki-taek and his boss hide, dressed as Indians for Da-song's birthday party. Unlike L.B. Jeffries, his cross-generational counterpart, Ki-taek, despite being positioned as a voyeur among voyeurs(his wife and children), never was the spectator, because the relationship between spectator and subject is a fluid one, always interchangeable, the two positions. Technology transformed the world into a movie screen. The Park family is an aggregate of Lisa, but unlike the clotheshorse, Dong-ik, the IT CEO, especially, believes that there is a difference in how people ""eat, talk, drink, laugh, and wear clothes"". In the chauffeured car, Dong-ik sits in the rear seat, a barrier, but at the birthday party, hiding behind the rear bushes, without a visible barrier, Ki-taek knows that it still exists, even though they are dressed identically as Indians.<br/><br/>The voyeur doesn't have to sit in a darkened theater anymore. It's not 1954. The voyeur carries with him a cellphone. The Park living room, metaphorically speaking, is the theater. But nobody has to be on the sofa to watch the ensuing melee, in which Ki-taek crosses the line and stabs his employer in the heart with a large knife. Films are mobile now. The voyeurs are in the backyard, close to the murder; spectators and subjects, sometimes one, sometimes both."
"paul-allaer","8","1","6","2 November 2019"," South Korean movie is original, witty and storytelling at its very best
","""Parasite"" (2019 release from South Korea; 132 min.) brings the story of the Kim family. As the movie opens, we get to know the family: they live in a semi-basement apartment, and mom and dad are out of work, and their teenage son and daughter aren't in much better shape. Then one day, the son's friend Min informs him that he is leaving the country, and that it would be good if the son takes over for him as the private English tutor of a HS sophomore girl, whose family is well-off, if not rich. The son agrees, and before we know it he is now the English tutor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Korean writer-director Bong Joon-ho, best known for his 2013 ""Snowpiercer"" film. Here he brings a one-of-a-kind story that is so plot-heavy that I cannot take any risks in spoiling anything, so my comments will be brief. Let me say this: there is a good reason that ""Parasite"" won the top prize (Palme d'or) at this year's Cannes film festival, and I will already go on record that there is zero chance that this movie isn't getting an Oscar nomination early next year for Best Foreign Language movie. The movie is everything that Hollywood at its worst (with endless sequels, prequels, franchises and ""re-imaginations"") isn't: It's original, it's witty, and it's storytelling at its very best.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" got a limited release in New York and LA in early October, and has gradually been rolling out to more cities. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Man, I couldn't wait to see this! The Friday late afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (10 people), but I am quite certain that as word of mouth gets around, this will find its box office legs in the weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a top=notch foreign movie that is original and witty and will have you on the edge of your seat, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, to check this out, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

The characters tend a little bit to the stereotype (the naive rich wife, the spoiled children, and the hard working poor family) but enjoyable to watch. You feel attracted to them because you can understand their despair for trying to ""fit in"", especially the younger son.
However, I recommend this movie. Beautifully directed, with some nice shots (the last one when the poor father flees after murdering the wealthy father), convincing acting and a interesting subject about societal classes.
The only flaw is the characters who have a too stereotypical part but it can be easily forgotten."

","Written and Directed by Bong Joon-Ho, Parasite evolves into something so gripping and unusual. While this would be seen as a thriller by many, it's also a dark comedy. This can often a very difficult thing to pull of, as too many tones can often leave an audience confused and disengaged. It also plays to audience's expectations only to then completely subvert them when you think you know whats going to happen. Parasite executes this all of these elements amazingly through Bong Joon-Ho's incredible direction and writing. Dialogue has depth and sounds organic. The themes that Parasite explores really hit home by the end of the movie and takes us to some unexpectedly emotional resolutions of character arcs. The cast which consists of Woo-sik Choi, Hye-jin Jang, So-dam Park and long term collaborator Kang-ho Sang, are all at the top of their game here, with an especially phenomenal performance by Kang-ho Sang. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hung returns with might be his best work yet. The sound design is great and the score fits perfectly and helps add to the tension of the movie.<br/><br/>All of these elements combine to make an incredibly satisfying movie, while also being highly re-watchable.

I would most certainly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to handle something that is perpetually unforeseeable.<br/><br/>My only problem was the subtitles. I saw the movie tonight here in France with French subtitles. Half the time I could not read the white subtitles against a light or white background. It is so easy to put a black cartouche around the subtitles to make them always readable. Sure, you lose a little of the original image, but that's better than losing your audience for half the picture.<br/><br/>Something distributors need to rethink."

","There are countless reviews posted here that delve into this movie's themes. I've read at least 20 of them, and many are engaging and brilliant. But I'm going to do something different. I'll speak to the Tarantinoesque nature of this film.<br/><br/>There's a program on AXS-TV called ""The Big Interview."" Dan Rather spends an hour talking with noted personalities across all genres of pop culture. Several years ago he sat down with Quentin Tarantino (QT) and conducted a wonderful interview. I don't want to include spoilers here so I think that if you're a QT fan you will understand what Dan is referencing, below.<br/><br/>Late into the interview, without accusing him of being exploitive, Dan asks QT to discuss this: How does he have the audience laugh and cry all in the same film? How does he get an audience to view scenes of a horrific nature yet laugh during the movie or come out of the theater smiling?<br/><br/>QT's response: ""when a movie really, really does it to me, it's because it's made me feel very different emotions...I'm the kind of director that I want to play you, as an audience. I want to be the conductor and you're my orchestra. And (I conduct) the sounds that I make you to make, and the feelings that I get you to feel... And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings, and I give you something ELSE to feel. And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings and make you feel something ELSE yet again. Well, if a director can do that, if a director can pull that off...then you're a lucky audience member because you really had an experience that night. You went to the MOVIES; that was worth leaving the house.<br/><br/>I can't help but make my stuff funny because I think of things in a humorous way...but it's not all a big joke. I do like the idea that I can do this to the audience: Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. (snaps fingers) Laugh. And maybe that stop laughing is something horrific...(maybe it's) hard to watch."" He then cites specific examples from one of his movies where he said he needed to traumatize the audience.<br/><br/>I love a lot of what QT has done, but not all of it. This movie seems to follow the QT blueprint but then it veers off in one direction and stays there. I did not leave the theater smiling. Thus, my rating."

I don't know how the dialogues are in Korean but the English subtitle translation was average and didn't have the comic nature many times. The build up was slow but the movie picks up pace pretty quickly after that. After some shenanigans by the family, the real chaos which is at the heart of the story starts. The frantic events at the end didn't make a lot of sense. I think the end kind of soured overall impression of movie for me, for the sake of keeping review spoiler free I would not say which event exactly but you'd know when you watch it.<br/><br/>Another problem I found was that movie tried to be a lot than what story could have allowed it to be.

It wasn't that funny in the comedic scenes, and other than the social cass divide which is seen in many other movies it wasnt really deep either.

"aenvn","8","0","2","9 May 2020"," not bad
","(The article involves spoilers)<br/><br/>""Parasites"" released last year is a seemingly ordinary and profoundly won the Palme d'Or masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are some intriguing scenes in the movie, which is the episode where father Kize stabs President Park when his daughter loses too much blood. Indeed, a person who seems to be easy-going, why did he start killing at this juncture? Moreover, there is no sign of anger before the murder, let us analyze the large amount of information contained in it from this point.<br/><br/>Everyone also saw that part of the reason was the previous action-when President Park picked up the car key under the body of another bottom man, he pinched his nose. This is to avoid smelling the damp odor that he had been staying in the ground for a long time; and this behavior aroused the resentment of his father Keizer. Other than that, I want to say that this is not the only reason. Let us analyze one by one.<br/><br/>First of all, President Park 's aversion to the behavior that is temporarily called ""moisture"" seems a bit abnormal at this time: the tutor who was asked by his wife has been stabbed in the heart, and his life is punished. He is saving lives, but at this juncture he still has to avoid the ""bad smell"" of the people at the bottom. This seems a bit abnormal, and some people will think that this is a ""play"". I think this illustrates a point: he is more than unaccustomed, he strongly hates this taste.<br/><br/>This action caused Kizawa, who was originally in the camp of President Park, to fall to the camp on the side of the deceased holding the key. Yes, they tried every means to get themselves a job, become a ""parasite"", and gain wealth. They are all private animals, but their encounters are the same. Compared with President Park, he has a class gap.<br/><br/>After all, why did President Park strongly hate this damp smell? There is a reason for everything. One of my personal speculations is that President Park was born into an ordinary family, rushed into the upper class by his hard work, and married Mrs. Du who appreciated her talents. This requires a process, and after this process is finally carried out and succeeded, the person who has risen in status will feel aversion to the people in the relatively lower class before him. This aversion is often stronger than the people who are already in the upper class; not to mention him At the time, we were dealing with people from the bottom who were ""lower"" than the civilian class. This layer of disgust is in the bones, so it is so disgusting to smell that smell, which explains the ""abnormal phenomenon"" above. Similarly, the Kize family also experienced a change in status caused by a change in status. Before ""Parasitic"" came to President Park's house, when both parents were in the state of unemployed nomads, they saw that the drunkard outside the window did not dare to provoke peeing at home, or his son's friend, the drunkard roared away. But when they saw the drunkard again after they had a job, they fought hard, feeling that they had a bottom, and felt that their status exceeded that of the drunkard. This also proved that after the promotion of status, they would hate people who stayed in the previous class. Similar stories like Fan Jinzhong received preferential treatment after lifting, too much.<br/><br/>Let me say one last thing here. Why do you think President Park is ordinary? The above is just one reason, and many other small details can also prove this point, like being unfamiliar with aristocratic education, and finding tutors for the children are all controlled by Mrs. Du; like when the children are camping on the grass, they are willing to He slept casually on the sofa. Or if you find a foreign object in the car, you can carefully and rationally analyze its origin. This detail is a relatively important quality from the civilian to the upper class. Of course, these are speculations, and there may be other reasons behind these actions. If the personal assumptions are really set by the writers, it can be said that this movie is very intentional and has a lot of details.<br/><br/>Returning to the above, in addition to the strong aversion of Kizawa, which led to the scourge of murder, President Park 's behavior also has another layer of relatively comprehension, that is, the whereabouts of the Kizawa family will be exposed. The corpse in front of him was a low-level person before his death, and he could see it on the outside. The smell on his body was similar to the driver, nanny, and two teachers in his home-they could be elegant in appearance, but their heart and some behaviors could not hide their truth Appearance. In addition, Kize was very excited when introducing the babysitter, combined with his own meticulous analysis above, so that he could infer the secret of this ""parasitic family"". Keizer took this into account, so he could only destroy evidence that would prove that they were a family. Similarly, this reasoning also has a small problem. Because her daughter is almost dead, and the hostess sees her husband 's driver suffering from the serious injury of the tutor to this point, it also feels a bit strange. This matter will be exposed sooner or later, so kill Park The president has no way to hide the truth. Killing and not killing, neither of them can stay here for a long time. The grief of losing their daughters can't be restrained. It can only be said that under the circumstances, a blank brain did not allow him to consider so much. The pain and helplessness of Keizer on this frame of the play can be said to be shocking.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, there is a gap between strata. This is to say another point. Class differences are insurmountable. Before the homicide, Keizer asked President Park again if he loved his wife deeply, and then President Park took it seriously, shifting the topic and saying, ""Please treat today as an extension of your work."" There are subtexts. The president is unable to stay with his wife every day due to other reasons for his busy work, so he said how much he loved her, and he felt ashamed when answering this question. Being stabbed by someone lower than himself, he felt humiliated, so he said this. This sentence is actually meant to say: you are not suitable to evaluate me, you are not qualified, and it is your job to do your job. Keizer naturally sensed this meaning, he was angry, he was dissatisfied. He was dissatisfied that he had to be treated as a servant. He was dissatisfied with why he was not equal in life. The dissatisfaction with society eventually vented to the dissatisfaction with people, and this anger burned when President Park pinched his nose. Perhaps, at the end of the film, Kize didn't understand why he had to become a ""parasite"" in order to live a good life, and children like Duosong received a good education from an early age. He lacked effort or luck. Of course, he didn't realize that when President Park ""despised"" him, he also ""despised"" the drunkard.<br/><br/>I'm afraid this is the weakness of human nature.<br/><br/>Therefore, this whole tragedy is accidental and inevitable. Too many reasons, too many fetters, led him to the extreme. The main theme of ""Parasites"" is much higher than it seemed at first glance. Although the whole story is about the dialogue and style of partial comedy, there are some heavy pictures and deep themes behind which are worth thinking about. It is just three simple families, but it contains so many intrigues, which is really surprising and regrettable. Some of these details may never be discovered by us."

There were so many plotholes and missed opportunities. This film was extremely predictable yet offensive to whoever this film was intended for, rich or poor... who are you supposed to root for?

","Nothing special. Decent, but could have cast more actors that didn't look like they were acting. Kang-ho Song (Ki Taek) and Hye-Jin Gang (Chung-Sook) were great. Not one scene of theirs looked forced. Can't say that about anyone else as they all had moments where they looked like they were ""acting"".<br/><br/>I understand the metaphorical meaning and depth of the film which made it decent. I can handle ""can't-place-it-in-just-one-genre"" idea. However, there just is not enough there to make it Best Picture of the year. The powers that be were reaching to award something just to make their own point I think. It's not even in the same category as Joker and I typically don't like films that are gloomy and 70's-ish looking, but Joker was much better and was even similar to Parasite in some of it's lessons on humanity. I'm not saying Joker should be Best Picture either because I didn't see hundreds of movies last year to make that call, but it was the best I saw in 2019. If you can either understand the spoken language of Parasite or don't mind reading subtitles, then it's worth seeing--partially for the meaning, partially to say you saw it, partially so you can see for yourself that an ok movie can win Best Picture. Tune out the idea that you'll watch a comedy or a drama or a thriller or a horror movie--its a blending of a lot of things."

Daring, ambitious, and ingeniously handled by Bong Joon-ho (deservedly earning a best director Oscar) who manages to pull the rug out even when you're sure you've got things figured out. ***Â½"

"daveinpublic-279-224878","8","0","1","22 March 2020"," Original movie, Great directing, Smart writing
","What I love about this movie... it's a blast to watch, very original, and the directing is some of the best. The originality is a huge plus to me, because it feels like there's not much of it to go around right now.<br/><br/>But as far as the negative (I'll spend a little longer on this because theirs so much praise already).. I feel like all the best drama in the movie feels manufactured. I felt like the director had the poor father stab the rich one for a dramatic conclusion, whether it was justified or not, a mechanism to show the movie had some dramatic point. Almost hamfisted in, but never organically produced.<br/><br/>The rich family behaved like bosses in a typical work environment. Seemed dismissive at times, even gullible, but in many ways, incredibly generous and trusting, if not creating opportunity and doing more good than required. The director may say, there's no good guys and bad guys, but, shouldn't we at least feel like theirs a motive behind the final killing? I should have been thinking, I hope he doesn't kill him, I hope he doesn't kill him.. but instead I was just thinking, why is this disgruntled cab driver grabbing a knife to kill the rich father of all people? There's a murderer who just killed his son, who is being carried through the courtyard by the rich daughter of all people, trying to get him some help. The rich father commented that he liked the cheap panties, but that didn't relate to the message at all, he didn't even know they were the driver's daughter's. Seemed like a cheap inclusion to build motive for the dramatic killing. Did he look down on the family? Not really, he was a boss and was even caring, and didn't even know they were a family. The poor father stabbing him in front of everyone put his own family at risk and hurt their ability to function even further, and although you knew he was upset, it didn't feel like that level of aggression worked with his character at this point in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, the message didn't come across succinctly. I think the director would probably say, the rich should be more aware of the pains in the community. So no-one can ever have something nice, ever again, until everyone is rich. The only way this rich family could have over come their flaws, is if they had ensured that everyone in the world had a good day the day before.<br/><br/>If I want to get really critical, I would say that the director wanted to make a funny, political, and scary movie, and therefore threw in random scenes to sensationalize his script. Like when the old maid comes to the door... of course they wouldn't let her in if the movie was being honest. And that's what enabled all the incredible drama, was this poor decision made with unclear motivation. They're all hanging out inside, eating food, broken bottles on the floor, openly making a mess of the the house for the first time, this could blow their whole operation they meticulous planned, and were cunning and quick on their feet in every other scene, but they decide to let her inside always, oh well. Could have just told her to come back? So, then they find a poor family living downstairs, which is random and sort of unrelated to the story and the point of it... but they find a poor guy there and so the protagonist mother decides to turn them in. What needs to happen to create the next sensational moment? Well, if the family living downstairs were to just happen to discover the entire secret of the poor family before the mother calls the cops in 5 seconds, then we could have a fight to the death. What happens next? Well, the entire family comes tumbling down the stairs and the downstairs family gets video proof of them referring to each other by their family names, etc. If any of those random, highly unlikely, and unrelated elements don't happen in this short sequence, the entire movie ends with the family making a little money as an uber driver, a maid, and 2 tutors. But, the movie needed to go bigger. So, we have these unintuitive moments driven by unclear motives tacked on to ensure we get the killing and dark moments and dramatic political messages that can only be found in the second half. Now we've got the pieces, at the expense of depth. Almost seems like a fun, silly movie with random political narratives to increase the clout. Like it's a movie that's supposed to make you feel good, because you just got to watch a comedy, a thriller, and then became a better person because of the mechanically meaningful scenes. I mean, if this is how you make a great movie, you could literally use this as a template, because again, it could be a manufacturing process. But since the feeling of moral fulfillment comes by way of cheap design, and gives a bit of hollowness to the final experience.<br/><br/>So, I rate this 8! 8 because of the direction and originality. 2 stars gone because of the artificial nature of the climax. I don't like crapping on a movie this good, but it's off my chest now and there's plenty of positive reviews, so I'll leave some of that to them. :)"
"richarddillomes","8","0","1","22 March 2020"," From the same director that gave us Okja and Snowpiercer.
","For an average movie afficionado, I have to admit that while I liked Parasite, aside from the obvious I had to read up about the movie in order to fully appreciate the message it wanted to convey. On the surface, we know what's it about: the story about two families from extreme ends of the social ladder. The Parks with their high-tech mansion and luscious front yard that hides them from the outside world and the Kims with their sub-basement apartment and a window that allows them to look at their sad reality just enough to keep fighting and surviving. What is not obvious though is the why. What transpired in the movie is believable, but the why is what makes the difference. Maybe it's a cultural thing, where here in the Philippines as depicted in soap operas a million times over the Have-Nots are automatically nice people, hopeful that things will get better as long as they keep working hard. Meanwhile the Haves are depicted as calculating and manipulative, taking advantage of those that they can. In Parasite, it's the other way around. And this is very evident when the head of the Kim household commented that the Parks are rich but still nice. To which his wife countered, they are nice because they are rich. That money makes living easy therefore they are not as stressed, that's why they can afford and have the time to be nice. Which is true. I related to when she said that if she had what they had, she'd be kinder too. Of course it's not automatic though and there are always the exception to the rule.<br/><br/>Everyone were well-casted most especially Choi Woo-Shik (Fight for My Way) as the young Kim with whom the chain of events started. I mean I know I'm supposed to hate him but the combination of his cunning and naivete makes him appealing to me and even to the Parks. Cho Yeo-jeong as Mrs. Park was also a standout, playing a balance of a simple yet hands-on head of the household. You may also notice Lee Sun-kyun (The Coffee Prince) as Mr. Park and Park Seo-joon (Fight for My Way/ Secretary Kim) in a supporting role. The last character of note is the the Parks' house itself. It has a personality of it's own, commanding your attention whenever you're within it's premises.<br/><br/>Winning the 2019 Cannes Palm D'or award and besting 20 other foreign films, submitted to be South Korea's entry for Best Foreign film at the Oscars, a 99% Rotten Tomato rating and 8.5 in IMDB, you can not go wrong with this movie. It was well-written, the ""infiltration"" of the host by the parasites flowed naturally. The cinematography was beautiful, charming even in the squalor of the Kims' situation. For all that Parasite tried to do, at the end of the day the world appears the same, but it has definitely changed. For the better or worse, it will all depend on the next set of people assuming the roles of hosts and parasites."
"tomkori","9","0","1","22 March 2020"," Explicit imagery for what a parasite is and does
","The portrayal of a wealthy family getting ""infested"" by not only a poor family and their former housekeepers demonstrates the different faces of parasitism. First, the poor family is capable to completely get the trust of the wealthy family by being good servants though their motivations are dominantly evil from the beginning. A starting potential love between young members of the two families never has a true chance since it is always overruled by the evil inclinations. The thought arises that the wealthy house's architecture somehow supports the hidden presence of parasites. Now, there is a deeper level of the story: Mt 13:24-29 (The Parable of the weeds). The movie tells the story of many people in this world. It tells the story of indifference. We get good things in life and we are so indifferent and ungrateful for them, that at the end we get unworthy of them and only then do we start to learn the deeper connections of the world soul while we have to compensate for the suffering we caused with our indifference. We are never only poor sheep torn by the wolves. The wealthy family is as guilty as the poor one and a war of philosophies is launched that ends detrimental for both families."

","There should be such a journey in the course of everyone's life. It allows you to calm down and feel yourself and understand life. ""Aunt"" is not so much a comedy movie as a warm road movie. In the tenderness and tenderness, Xu Yan described the anxiety and wolf howling in the middle-aged man as a last resort and wolfberry in a thermos cup. Teacher Huang Meiying, who plays her mother, is both acting and funny. Every move makes people shout ""It's too subtle""! The most amazing performance is the part of Yuan Quan. After she separated from Xu Yiwan, the wife she played was wearing a trench coat and leather shoes, striding among a group of exotic faces. That was both the liberation and rise of a woman, and the best ending of the whole story. I really like this adaptation of Little Lady. As a kid (actually until growing up) I was obsessed with why Jo and Laurie were not together. Because it's too long apart, I can remember very few details, except for two places, one is Laurie's tassels on Jo's apron, and the other is the secret code of their pillows.
Greta edited the conversation between Jo and the publisher in parallel with Professor Jo Yuzhong, giving the director a personal explanation: this is the needs of the times, and no romance wants the heroine to end with an old rich spinster. And I asked my question in a publisher's tone: I can't see why she wasn't with her childhood sweetheart? I feel like Greta and I have the same confused childhood. (Well, because of this I'm willing to give this movie five stars, even if it doesn't meet my expectations in a few places.) Once again, I would rather embrace such an open ending. I accept that protestanism influenced the interpretation of American novels during that period, but I do n't accept whether I went to their puppy love and said that the professor is the most suitable person (to his sequel).
The genius of the film is non-linear narrative, which distinguishes the past from the present with different hue and light. Some transitions were very genius, especially the comparison between Beth's first scarlet fever and his last death. Jo was also awakened but the right thing was wrong, and it really made me cry. It struck off the deteriorating section of Beth's body in the book, which kept me upset. And using intensified continuity editing directly blasted the result like a heavy tear gas bomb (also Beth said write for me. Amy said Beth is the best of us). Through a story, it deeply tells the social reality, and will make you automatically, think of more social reality, and make you dissatisfied with all the rich and poor. Its ability to arouse empathy and extend the association has been achieved. What you and I come into contact with every day in our society and experience every day. What this movie does not talk about, all broke out through the perception of this movie. This is the real power of this movie.
The film finally leads to a very sad ending. In the end, fate returned to zero, and all changes returned to the original point. After getting his father's Morse code, Jiyu vowed to make money and then bought the house in an attempt to make his father see him again. Of course, all this was realized in Jiyu's dream, but can it really be realized? Not to mention whether it can make enough money, even if it is done, can Jiyu's father really see the sun again? Isn't it a real cage waiting for him? Don't forget, he is a murderer.
You will find that the real scary part of this story is why Jiyu's father, driver Jin, finally killed President Park. The social phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has made the poor intolerant, but the internal grievances are extremely deep, in this psychological and mental state. The slightest disrespect of the rich will cause a chain reaction of torrents and tsunami. He noticed that the uncle who rushed out of the basement waved his butcher knife towards Kiting, and driver Kim, after his middle-aged uncle fell, had nowhere to vent his anger. He eventually inserted the knife into President Park. However, killing President Park can really eliminate his anger? Can he reverse his fate? I'm afraid the answer doesn't need me to tell, everyone already knows."

Money is an iron, which irons everything. They scour the net, live in the basement, and do whatever they can to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, they are even worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into three, six, and nine. This wall, standing in the wind, the sun and the rain, stood still. The Park couple looked stupid, but they were still getting richer and richer; the Kim Ji-zee family was clever but couldn't stand up. You thought you could get a good job, get a good salary, and get rid of your poverty status. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that is already in the blood.

Even the homeless black con-man Billy Ray Valentine--who is a completely decent man--can work with privileged, out of touch white Ivy Leaguer Winthorp--who is a completely decent man--and respect each other, to beat the Dukes. An American movie: an optimistic, improbably fairy tale of the American Dream.<br/><br/>Parasite, on the other hand, has unlikable characters who have no way out of their predicament. The poor Kim family actually *aspire* to be like Billy Ray Valentine, because they have no choice in a culture like Korea's.

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I wouldn't normally be drawn to a Korean movie with English subtitles, and with a name like ""Parasite"", but because it won the Oscar recently for Best Picture, it seemed like a worthy viewing.<br/><br/>Well we found it very worthwhile. The story is pretty novel, it focuses on a family of four, dad, mom, son, and daughter, all living in a basement of sorts in a slum area and scratching for enough money to buy food each day. Definitely a lower class existence but also seemingly bright and well educated.<br/><br/>By good fortune the son is asked to become an English tutor for a teenage girl when his friend, the current tutor, is heading off to college. When he shows up he is fascinated by the fabulous home of this upper class family, the dad is a big executive and wealthy. The family hires a live-in maid, a driver, and tutors for the two children.<br/><br/>Quickly the tutor sees an opportunity and eventually all four of the lower class family members cooperate in a scheme. By different approaches they will cause all the hired help to be dismissed, being replaced by the various members of their family but hiding the fact that they are in fact family members. In essence they become parasites, sucking money off the wealthy family.<br/><br/>Of course things don't go smoothly for long, and things get really mucked up after the former maid returns to retrieve something she left in the basement. As I watched into the second half of the movie I was wondering how all this would work its way through and found the filmaker had a very interesting approach, in the very end not everything is resolved and one can decide what eventually happened.<br/><br/>Really good movie, the dialog is pretty quick at times and you have to read subtitles pretty quickly but overall it wasn't too big of a task."

"kaz_sofia","9","0","2","28 February 2020"," The ""parasite"" can be Kim or Park family and can be all of sentiments that kill people (envy and greed)
","With a great mundial attention, Parasite surprise evertyone win 4 orcars against favorites movies like 1917 (Sam Mendes) and The Irishman (Martin Scorcese), and all of this is not for nothing: Parasite is a refletion about politics scenario about misery, social inequality and other social problems that aren't be seen, mainly in a country like South Korea that is always showed like a technology and science power without any social problem (that is deny in Bong Joon-ho film).
Like as all movie that talk about humanities contrast and inequality, Parasite is a relation between Kim family and Park family: the fisrt lives in a house basement and the second family lives in a beautiful and big mansion in a elite neighbourhood. In addition focus in scenes that show the both ambients, the movie has another way to show the inequality between Kim and Park: Kim and Park are two of three of most popular and communs surnamens is South Korea, however, Kim is most commun (21% of koreans) than Park (9%).
The contrast in the reality not only in South Korea, but alround the world, is not realized by Kim family when they are work in many funtions in Park mansion, as like they are part of the Park family. The lack of class awareness in a group that feel privileged by an elite that always oppressed is showed when Choong-sook say ""she isn't poor"" to Moon-gwang, the last Park housekepper, when she founds Moon-gwang's husband in basement.
There'is a discussion about is the ""parasite"" in movie is about Kim family, that lives in Park home illegaly, or about Park family, that explore the work of Kim with the inequality. Actuallity, the parasite is about the actions of the both family and, in same time, is the envy, the greed and the preconception that kill Kim- jeong and Nathan Park. Therefore, Parasite has a many interpretations about an only mensage
All of the adventure vivenced by Kim started with a rock brought by Min, Ki-woo's friend, that is an amulet very commun in asian countries that bring lucky to families. This object is very important to undestand the movie because many events in movies is about it and it construct slowly the social context of movie: The first event is a Choong-sook commentary when Min brings the amulet, when she say: ""It would be better if is was food"", showing that the basic necessites is most importante than religion. The second event is when Ki-woo go down the basement to give the amulet to Moon-gwang and Geun-sae like a gift, but the man almost kill the boy blow to the head, and the third, and the last, event about this amulet is when the rock is returned to river, like Kim family is returned to misery after the happening in Dae-song party. In any moment in the movie, the amulet is showed like a religious object that can save somebody of poorness and misery, but is showed only like a material object, the same manner that capitalism sees the world and the same manner that inequality and poorness is in the world, a fisical and real problem. As Kim-Ki-taek said: ""That's the reason that people can't be have a plan. Without plan, nothing can't be wrong""."

As a movie, it is worth watching because I'm not used to the socio-political aspects of Korean culture. The film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. But actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the Park mansion. Going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and I feel astonished.

There is little doubt that as a loser family start to target a rich household, their early success cannot hold.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Korean films anyway, and so was relaxed about the various styles this film goes through. While the film is totally accessible, there are still enough references to Korean and Asian society to make it a little demanding on the viewer - which is why the Oscar success was nicely surprising.<br/><br/>The film does not perfectly handle it's different layers - the political message and the moral message rather wrap around each other awkwardly. The pacing doesn't always work either - the direction is relaxed in the house but pokes around nervously outdoors.<br/><br/>This is not the best Korean film I've seen - Old Boy and I saw the Devil were superior - but the setup, cinematography and the sheer chutzpah of the plotting make it a sharp witted success.

"rilemadi","8","0","3","19 February 2020"," Not my kind of Film
","Its many wins and Oscar nominations should be enough to summarize the film Parasite as it was put on a pedestal at this year's academy awards due to its incredible cinematography and well written script. Going into watching the film, I had many high expectations, as I was aware of its at that time many nominations and high praise by those who had seen the film. I was quickly let down to realise that although these many things were true about the film, I found it to be a very long two hours to sit down and watch the film. Perhaps this was because of its slow establishment at the start, or maybe the film was just not something that I would normally be interested in, but I didn't enjoy it. I was really disappointed by this, because it was clear that the incredible production that went in to the film was truly something to set it apart. As far as the movie goes, I thought that it was very strong, the script seemed to be very developed for its nature, and the camera work was beautiful. For me, the plot just didn't grab my attention, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys films of a similar genera. Above the high praise that critics seemed to pick out about the film, its main theme seemed to center around the American Dream. In my opinion I believe that the film did in fact summarize the American Dream. Not only did the characters acquire wealthy jobs, but they managed to stick together as a family. Although their financial situation could have been handled in much better ways, I believe that the bond that they created as a family is definitely the epitome of a dream, as money can't always buy you happiness."

I have seen the other academy award nominees, and although this movie was excellent - I think that Once Upon a Time was better. Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor - but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such.

","Parasite<br/><br/>Overall a very enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>This started out a black comedy and by the end morphed into something more sinister. We were shown a close knit nuclear family scraping by to survive in a slum-type basement dwelling. They were all universally hard working, inventive and inspired to get on in life, however it was inferred by the script that these attributes were not enough for any social mobility and that any advancement within Korean society was wholly dependent on the possession of family money from the outset.<br/><br/>The Director introduced several themes and ideas that he tossed around, never quite landing on any definitive conclusion. We, the viewers were the mouse and the Director the cat. It did strangely have the feel of an Almodovar movie, perhaps this style was an influence.<br/><br/>Lastly the obvious intention by the Director to infer wealthy people are parasites due to wealthy inequality was handled badly as it is these very wealthy people that provide currently any wages or opportunity for the poor. The real parasite is the Korean government who collect the taxes and make the laws and have clearly failed to create welfare structures or free education to promote a better society and social mobility. What would happen if all the wealthy people left and there was no tax receipts and communism has certainly not proved the answer.<br/><br/>What was good<br/><br/>The family bonds were well established, they were all in this together. This very much held the movie together.<br/><br/>This was very much a simple linear story and most refreshing in its delivery.<br/><br/>There was, for the first two thirds of the movie great dramatic impetus, we were all gripped, and I could certainly feel quite an atmosphere in the picture house.<br/><br/>The acting seemed competent from the entire ensemble but it was difficult to judge due to the barrier of the subtitles.<br/><br/>The subtitles were nuanced and comprehensive and seemed entirely natural.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great and the camera made us feel very much the fly on the wall, and very in keeping with this kind of story.<br/><br/>The musical score was great.<br/><br/>What was problematic<br/><br/>The Director inferred that wealth and opportunity were the way forward and a wholesome aspiration for advancement for the family, but then went onto infer wealth corrupts and perhaps the mere possession of wealth was obscene, this is muddled thinking as it cannot be both as the same time.<br/><br/>It was inferred that wealth isolates and anaesthetises you from the realities of other people lives, but the script so over simplified this observation it became irrelevant.<br/><br/>We had insufficient character separation they are were just voices of the Director.<br/><br/>It was inferred that oppression leads to revolution, I agree, but the family were not oppressed at the moment or indeed previously they were on the way up, so revolution, and this instigation for a bloodbath was flimsy.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, it lost its way in the last half hour and arrived at little redemption or conclusion. It really had little to say on the human condition, however it's great strength lay in its inventive comedy.<br/><br/>With regard to awards, I would nominate it for best foreign language movie and give the award to Pain & Glory by Almodovar."

Do we really believe that the father went back into the cellar? Taking the risk he would't be able to get food at all and die? And then, when they moved house, no one lived there, the cupboards and fridge empty for months... How did he survive? And do we believe that he used morse code to contact his son? How does he know that his son would watch? Wouldn't he search a different way to contact him? Call him at night?? And how can the son ever contact his father in the end, saying he should come out and they will meet again? The morse code works one way... So this ending is the only real flaw to this film.

Um... it's about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur.<br/><br/>There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal.<br/><br/>A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I'll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors.<br/><br/>Parasite is an absolute must see.

","A very pleasant surprise of how to combine something mysterious, and something with great horror elements but keeping it light with perfect black humor and not to give away too much at any point. The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone.<br/><br/>Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" at any given point during the movie.<br/><br/>This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category."

"andrewburgereviews","8","0","1","2 January 2020"," The fable and the heavy hand
","When it comes to social satires, directors often push their awareness to the viewers as if they are unaware they are preaching to the choir. Whoever saw Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" will definitely agree with the director's populist political stance. Now only if someone would've told him that as well.<br/><br/>Without spoiling, I can tell you that ""Parasite"" is definitely satisfying. This is a thriller calculated to the nano-meter, equal in precision, pressure, unease and focus. It revolves around Ki-taek and his family--poor, unemployed and living in a ""semi-basement""; some sort of small place halfway underground. Forcing the metaphor, I could argue that is placed symbolically to represent the clear-cut line between the lower and upper classes. They are poor, which forces them to be clever and witty in order to survive. So their plan is to ""attach"" themselves to a rich family.<br/><br/>For the sake of not spoiling, I will stop here. But know that ""Parasite"" touches on every single social point it tries to make. It is a well-defined story of class and the lack of social awareness. This works in the first half of the film, in which the naivete of the rich and the wit of the poor is augmented. This is not done to oversimplify but for the movie to properly present its parable which, by definition, is a ""simple story"". But if this heavy-handed approach pays off, by the end it pushes the characters into unnecessary, inexplicable, sometimes seemingly random explosions of rage.<br/><br/>""Parasite"" is undeniably cutting-edge and modern. Bong Joon Ho uses traditional fables to conceptualize and clarify the vagaries of modernity. Throughout its complexion, it looks decidedly simple as its frames wonder around the minimalist and polished performant Asian architecture of the privileged property where most of the movie takes place--a movie as harsh with its characters as it is with its viewers."

Parasite was amazing in the way that it was able to present twists and turns and shift genre and tone seamlessly. This film goes from pleasant comedy to a much darker film.<br/><br/>Parasite at its core is about economic class, family and the parasitical relationship between different members of society, and it does a hell of a job doing it.

Movies that take these interesting characters and puts them in environments that forces them to come to terms with life itself. It also reminded me of Billy Wilder.

"slideshowp2","9","0","1","21 December 2019"," A cruel allegory for the truth of society
","At the beginning of the close to the real life segment, is a very common introduction technique in Korean films. The long, slow shot passes through the cramped living space on the ground floor, and the characters are drawn one by one. In the cluttered and narrow semi-basement, the plot of searching for network signals and pizza boxes soon leads the viewer smoothly into the narrative atmosphere of life. The combination of deliberate camera speed and quick message delivery is so precise that it has proven the power of director bong joon-ho.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When stepping into the mansion that moment, ""parasites"" and the real story gradually away, but into the structure and framework of social fable. That doesn't mean the director has given up on story and suspense, though. It's certainly not the freehand brushwork of burning, which won critical acclaim last year but lost popularity, but it's similar to the metaphors and hints in snowpiercingly, and even to the themes of class and destiny. An undetected basement, like that set by many science fiction works, becomes a space device that isolates the class and tests humanity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The passage about family education can naturally get heated discussion from domestic audiences who are in the middle of anxiety. The depiction of high-asset families in the film is a kind of deliberate label misreading, which makes all members look silly and indifferent, which is obviously not true. But the director quickly deflects the viewer's confusion with exquisite technical expertise. First of all, the suspense and conflict in the script are constantly pushed forward, which makes the audience hardly pay attention to the serious injury in the life picture, which also becomes an important evidence to question its commercial genre. But I have to admit that this is the subtlety of the script, every character has realized their own appearance, deduction, transformation and account, every props given to the camera, whether stone, secret door, tea table or induction lamp, have been effectively used, become an important force to promote the story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>What is exquisite is the scene itself. The three important locations of poor families, rich people's villas and underground secret rooms are all arranged in a very real and rich way. The seemingly random close-ups can accurately present the emotions of each scene and the differences between each other. The stylization of the scene also serves as a metaphor for the theme, just like the ""strange smell"" that the host keeps saying, which is the smell of poverty and the significant difference of different living conditions. It brings out the heart of separation hidden under the surface of kindness, builds up estrangement and hatred, and finally promotes the explosion of the ending.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, technical sophistication was not enough to get the jury's approval. The emotional tension at the heart of the film comes from the characters' examination of their own lives, from the warmth and kindness that cannot dissolve the estrangement, from the tears in the eyes of a poor father as he looks back at his home in the flood, and from the tragic conflict facing the family of four after a brief period of joy. The film also jumped out of the suspense genre, with some depth to cause thinking. The mislabeling of the high class is also highlighted in these passages, which is an unavoidable wound in the film.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But like snow train, bong joon-ho has always been reluctant to disrupt the plot with lyricism and pauses. This preserves the tension and integrity of the story, but it can also hurt the meaning and attitude that the fable itself hopes to convey.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Butler's rainy night visit to the line and joy and sadness both before and after contrast so bright, even fantasy is over the boy out of the warmth of the segment, the film to be presented by the split, opposition and despair has carefully through setting suspense infiltrated the viewer's heart, it's almost no moralizing paragraph, but through the story of extremes, is like a knife cut the surface of society, will be more deep vein and the body.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When the story is over, who lives in a dark room and who travels in the sun like an insect, everyone may have found the answer. The reflection and emotion gained from the fable can also provide richer support for the following life choices."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","11 November 2019"," The Have and the Have-not
","While set in Korea, the main theme of this movie is as universal as the most basic of human nature, as in ""Se7en"" (1995). We saw the same sentiments played out in the French Revolution - the Have-not getting even with the Have. In the French Revolution, it played out as revolution and guillotines. Here in ""Parasite"" it plays out as a multiple con job turned ugly - no decapitation, mind you, but with blood and gore to match.<br/><br/>There are two remarkable things about this movie. The first is the change, abruptly at the mid-point, in tone from farce-like comedy to horror-like thriller. The other thing is the matter-of-course approach at both. Neither the comedy nor the horror is laboured or deliberately crafted. While the plot may sound outlandish, the delivery is so natural as to make it believable. A great deal of credit goes to the splendid cast.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a crispy introduction of a ""cheap"" family, in every sense of the word. Out of a cramped basement, riding on a lucky break, the four members successively and successfully con their way into the household of a slick, ultra-modern, luxurious mega estate. First, the son becomes the English tutor of a naÃ¯ve girl at puberty. He quickly gets his sister a job as the arts tutor of the girl's little brother. The father and mother, with the sibling's cunning plotting, soon replace the existing housekeeper and chauffer. The couple that employ them are unsuspicious, if not entirely gullible. At this point, nobody can fault you for thinking that the title refers, obviously, to these four.<br/><br/>Then comes the twist at midpoint. When the masters take their kids on a camping trip, the ""parasite"" family live like royalties, albeit transiently. But it turns out that they are not the only ""parasite"" because there is one that fits the description even better - living in the bowels. A sudden visit from the discharged housekeeper reveals a secret - she has been hiding her husband in a secret basement unknown to the masters. Then, when the camping trip is cut short by foul weather, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>While people may call this movie different things, the crux of the matter is the revelation of the resentment the Have-not harboured towards the Have."

","Wow. A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination. Much of the success is owed to the absolutely phenomenal screenplay which is one of the most intricately constructed in recent memory. Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup. And perhaps most importantly, despite its highly allegorical nature, the film never compromises on the entertainment value and emotional catharsis of its literal story and characters. It's not often you see a film realize its ambition this resoundingly. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>Strong 4.5/5"

","I have not seen such a movie that is so bold and daring in its originality in a long time, and that helps make this the most gripping cinema of the year, more so than any Hollywood horror and thriller movie.<br/><br/>Though the movie is not without flaws, such as the perplexing ending with inane logic that makes it hard to follow somewhat despite the shocking turns and twists, the director proves himself to be the master of the filmmaking craft by many years of experience.<br/><br/>Toward the ending, I had to think to myself, ""This director (I could not quite remember the name, but will memorize following the end) is a genius...whatta crazy movie"". That is a great compliment to the filmmakers who conjured up the most intricate structure of a thriller that also emphasizes originality.<br/><br/>I don't know about the political, social and economical situations of South Korea, but I imagine that the themes conveyed by this movie also applies equitably to Europe, Australia and North America, without losing the tonal cohesion and heart-rending message of supposed inequalities.<br/><br/>Parasite has to be one of the most original films released in the last decade, and I cannot remember the last time I saw an original movie without it being derivative, mildly, subtly or obvious. It's also the most daring in terms of urgent social messaging under guise of a dark satire worthy of Jonathan Swift's work, on par with ""Joker"".<br/><br/>Certainly, Parasite does not warrant the full accolades due to minor flaws that confound the otherwise hypercritical and jaded moviegoers like me, but the effort put into the structure of exposition followed by insane but carefully constructed twists is compelling as a gripping thriller that only this director Bong Joon-ho knows how to pull off effortlessly like the illusionist, and no one else, not even the veteran once-great-turned-hack American directors like Brian De Palma and Michael Mann, can try.<br/><br/>Just watch this movie without knowing ANYTHING about the plot.

It is a roller coaster of emotions, with lighter, more comical moments and more thrilling, suspenceful moments. And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together.

Starting out as a comedy, the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is. This brilliant script has an ingenious set-up, morphing into a full-on, devious thriller.<br/><br/>Initially innocent, the antagonist family's plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family. At first through subtle, seemingly innocent actions, but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place. The film has a few interesting twists. Kang-ho Song is excellent as usual. He is an incredibly versatile actor. I've seen him in comedies, action movies, horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints.<br/><br/>The setting in the big mansion is really awesome, versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from. The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated. Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic, the execution thereof is excellent, making this yet another classic, unforgettable Korean thriller."

"nikxatz","9","0","3","20 October 2019"," ""Call me by your Name"" meets ""The last of the Mohicans"" - a brilliant cinematic acievement
","""Parasite"" is freaking awesome.It is a comedy, a family drama, a thriller, a horror, a political comentery, a social drama, a an action piece, you have to watch it to believe it. It is just every cool, fun and clever movie shrinked into 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure and unstoppable laughter, some masive and engaging thrills and a story about the distinctio of classes and th edynamic of a family trying to make ends meet.<br/><br/>The cinematography is really distinct andI like that Asian films have a reather common but unqiue look and tone and creates a magical atmosphere and tone. The way the camera moves is so sweet and subtle, the framing, the long shots, it is just so fun to watch. The lighting is beautiful, the way certain rooms are lit give a darker or lighter tone. It never tries to show off and everytihng feels so organic that at one point you forget you are watching fictional characters and a made-up story.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another thing to praise of. Most of the tracks are classic music and although it often feels so contradictory to the film, the result is so great and so much personality was added to the movie.<br/><br/>The great thing is that despite that the characters have not such a deep arc or are given any major traits, I was able to connect with them in the end and the whole film feels like a big family struggle. You grow with them and graually start to care, in site of their anethical and cheaty choices and actions. Evey actor gives such an appealing perormance and some of their reactinons are really on spot.<br/><br/>The humour is there mostly during the first hour. It is seet and it feels genuine, it what family members would talk and joke about. It creates an intimacy and a fun time. Then we get a lot of shifts in the tone and the twists come and go and the great thing is that the film is constalnty on the go, it is always moving forward and does not waste any moment...and in the end the Parasite is a great story toold in the best way possible.<br/><br/>The political comentary is perfect. There is actually a film that was released last and I vastly enjoyed... ""Burning"". Biurning was about a trouble guy feeling mad that his friend is dating a ritch successful man and he has nobody and actually talks about class discretions in a fascinting way. Parasite does the sam thing but in a different way. In the movie, we see a poor family trying to work together to scam some narrow-minded ritch family that live in a huge house with their luxuries and all. It is what ""Us"" went for but done in a more clear nd subtle way. The ritch use the poor and the poor try to become the ritch. You either leave in a fancy house with a garden and a maid or in the ground floor with insects and a smell. It is like two different words that slowly destroy each other.<br/><br/>
I will not say more. Watch this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I laughed, gasped, fell into thoughts, I was moved and always wanted more. It is a genius fraud, it has several ""peach scenes"", a crazy artistic kid, a birthday party and just make a plan and go watch. In fact, don't make a plan. Just watch it."
