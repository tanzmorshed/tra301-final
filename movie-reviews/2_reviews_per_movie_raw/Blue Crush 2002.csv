"Buddy-51","Null","58","66","7 September 2002"," a touch of reality makes this better than expected
","The best we should reasonably expect from a movie like `Blue Crush' is that we will be treated to some stunning footage of surfers riding the world's greatest waves (along Hawaii's Pipeline, natch) to personal fame and glory. We certainly get that in abundance - but what we have less right to expect, perhaps, is that the film will offer anything else of any real quality. After all, we've been to these kinds of movies before, harking all the way back to those halcyon Bleach Blanket Bingo days when Gidget, Moondoggie and the rest of those addle-brained, teeny-bopper cut-ups aspired to nothing higher than a life of eternal youth spent wallowing in the bleach-white sands of Santa Monica or Malibu.  In the case of `Blue Crush,' therefore, I am happy to report that the screenplay - by Lizzy Weiss (based on a magazine article by Susan Orlean) -provides just enough touches of realism to keep this new film both life-sized and interesting.  And the majority of the credit goes to the film's protagonist, Anne Marie Chadwick who, much to our surprise, engages our sympathies from first moment to last. <br/><br/>
Anne Marie is no bubble-headed, bleached-blond bimbo with nothing on her mind but winning the big Pipeline competition.  Although that is, indeed, part of her life's plan, Anne Marie is, also, an intelligent, pragmatic young woman, fully aware of both her strengths and weaknesses and just trying the best she knows how to make her life work for her, the young sister in her charge and the two surf buddy girlfriends she lives and works with.  Anne Marie is also riddled with insecurities, as she struggles to overcome the fear instilled in her by a near-fatal accident in that very same spot a few years earlier.  Meanwhile, she and her pals work hard trying to eke out a living as maids at a posh hotel, earning just enough money to keep a roof over their heads and pay some of their bills so they will be free to head to the coast at the first sign of prime `Surf's Up' conditions.<br/><br/>
The acting in the film is really quite impressive.  As Anne Marie, Kate Bosworth lights up the screen with her subtly nuanced, poised and dignified performance.   She knows how to use understated facial expressions to convey the thoughts and feelings of the character she is portraying.   Equally compelling are Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake as her fun-loving buddies, Mika Boorem as her little sister, and Matthew Davis as the professional football quarterback who becomes her love interest.  Director John Stockwell, to his credit, manages to keep the majority of the scenes intimate in tone and realistic in nature, rarely allowing the narrative to wander into overwrought melodrama or teen-movie farce.  Even the obligatory fight scene is kept restrained and believable.<br/><br/>There are occasional weaknesses in the film  a gaggle of snooty football wives and groupies who snub Anne Marie for being too lower class for their tastes are the primary offenders  but, on the whole, `Blue Crush' turns out to be a much better film than its subject matter would ever lead us to expect.  That comes as a particularly pleasant and un-looked-for surprise here in the shank of the summer movie going season."
"TxMike","Null","35","44","21 April 2003"," A ""must have"" DVD if you also have a surround sound system with subwoofer.
","Critic Ebert has a very complete and accurate review, and I will not repeat any of it here. I bought ""Blue Crush"" as a used rental DVD, real cheap, and it is a perfect disk. The basic story has been told many times, but it is done here better than many. However, there is one thing that moves it from the ""ordinary"" to ""outstanding - the cimematography and the sound.<br/><br/>After most of the first hour of the film sets up the characters and the situations, we are treated to surfing the Hawaii ""pipeline"" by surfers. One DVD extra shows how they do ""face replacement"" so that the pro surfer appears to be star Kate Bosworth. With many cameras in the waves, and sometimes under them, we get a unique perspective of being on top of a giant wave, or being inside the wave as it is breaking.  All the while a very aggressive sound mix makes you feel like you are there also.  This is definitely a good DVD to have for demonstrating the quality of your digital 5.1 surround sound system with good powered subwoofer.<br/><br/>I suspect anyone who saw ""Blue Crush"" at home, on VHS or DVD, with sound fed into the TV speakers has seen a different movie. That's because the sound track plays such a key role. This isn't a great movie, but a very good one. I believe its most realistic IMDb rating is somewhere around ""7"" or ""8""."

","For all you wanna-be critics out there trying to be negative about the directing and cinematography, lighten up! This film is excellent in the fact that it does not try to be more than it is... a surf flick. Its obviously not trying to win an Oscar or a bafta. cant any of you simply enjoy a feel good movie? the filming of the waves and the surfing was top class and even though the acting was not Oscar worthy in any way shape or form i think it was impressive that they embraced the surfing culture and used local people in this film.<br/><br/>For all of you out there who like to just enjoy a films and don't feel that you need to be completely baffled, shocked or made to think you will enjoy this. Yes it is predictable but who cares its just a bit of fun.<br/><br/>For all of you who hated this film just because the plot was predictable and the acting was substandard i draw your attention to a gentleman named Sigmund Frued; ""Some times a cigar is just a cigar"""
"uberbrodie","10","42","57","23 August 2002"," a complete surprise
","i went to see this movie solely because i thought it would be horrible.  It looked so cornballish that i couldn't help but go if only to mock it from my seat the whole way through.  I was thus quite shocked to find myself actually enjoying the film!  From the direction, to the action, the camera work and especially the surfing shots, it was just amazing.  Seeing the waves crashing fifteen feet tall, it is definitely worth seeing in theaters to get the full effect.  Another shock came in the form of teh script, and the acting.  While they had their holes, it was amazing how real the movie felt.  They weren't actors, they were real people.  From the very beginning, it starts.  Other reviews have claimed that these characters were all standard hollywood barbies, but this is far from the truth.  While it Anne Marie is quite attractive she is far from movie star beautiful, there is this natural and real quality to her that, if anything, makes her all the more endearing.  i could drivel on, but the point is, this movie just makes you feel good.  it takes you along on this enjoyable ride, and leaves you with a positive attitude and an insatiable desire to move to hawaii, rent a shack and spend your days surfing.  It was cute, but there's also a lot of substance there.  definitely worth seeing."
"SnoopyStyle","7","6","6","16 March 2014"," More than what's on the surface
","Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) is a local surfer girl with best friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) aiming to surf the Pipe in competition. Her little sister Penny (Mika Boorem) is getting more rebellious especially when their mother leaves town. She struggles against testosterone driven surf culture, and her disgusting job as a hotel maid. However the arrival of pro football quarterback Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis) may distract her away from her goal.<br/><br/>On the surface, this movie has beautiful babes in beautiful exotic locales. Beneath the surface, there is a compelling underdog story. It has emotions. She has to overcome her fears. Kate Bosworth is good as a girl unsure of herself. Rodriguez is the girl with attitude to spare. It's more than a simple exploitation film."
"kmskeels","8","5","5","21 July 2019"," Its a surfing movie... Not Shakespear.
","I don't understandn the reviews people are giving that sound like they expected so much more from this movie. Pretention, I'm guessing. The cast was great. Plenty of laughs. Stunning shots in and out of the water and a happy ending. It certainly isn't the most profound movie, but I'm pretty sure they werent going for that anyways. I like it for a feel good movie. I've watched at least ten times and I still enjoy it for what it is. If i want a riveting storyline I'll watch something other than a surfing movie, duh."
"TypedbyTara","8","4","4","17 February 2012"," These ain't the Girls Next Door
","Every once in a while a movie fanatic such as myself will come across what can only be described as a ""solid production."" <br/><br/>Blue Crush follows the lives of three best friends, AnneMarie, Lena and Eden. The trio form a tight-nit support system as they struggle to make ends meat (rice crispy treats often constitute their breakfast). The one thing these ladies do have going for them is that they are all talented surfers. It's clear that surfing provides them with an escape from the harsh reality of life, and they try to hit the waves every second they can. <br/><br/>AnneMarie is acknowledged as the most talented of the three and has the best shot at winning the ""Pipe Surfing Competition."" However, a near-fatal surfing accident has left her with a bad case of PTSD. Yet their luck changes for the better when a group of football players roll into town, providing both romantic and financial opportunities. While their money provides an ease on the financial burden, the dashingly good-looking Quarterback could prove to be more of a distraction for the hard-core AnneMarie. <br/><br/>This movie has a simple plot line that is executed perfectly. Blue Crush is a straight forward, no BS kind of movie that is short, sweet and to the point and it has just enough surfing action to gage your interest.. The actresses/actors do a great job of conveying the sincerity of their characters, and their situation is very believable."
"flickershows","5","19","29","18 July 2004"," It's Not Tubular
","From the thoroughly mediocre school of filmmaking, here comes director John Stockwell's 'Blue Crush'. Its graduates...uh, actors include Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and a bunch of other pretty people you've never heard of. Bosworth is Anne Marie, the super-talented surfer with a confidence problem. Before the movie is half over, she's in love with a pro quarterback and struggling to gumption up for the big all-girls surf championship. It's your standard 1980's Tom Cruise picture.<br/><br/>If a movie with such modest ambitions is supposed to make you want to go out and take up surfing, I say, hand me my 'Point Break' DVD instead. Sure, 'Blue Crush' is professionally made and the camerawork is fine, but how hard is it to pretty up shots of the Hawaiian ocean when it's in the form of gorgeous, humungoid waves? That's a natural beauty that speaks for itself and doesn't need Hollywood to flaunt it. As for the screenplay by Lizzy Weiss & Stockwell, well, they're proficient with the surfing lingo. They're also absentminded enough to bury their various hanging plot threads in an undertow. The flick is not trying to be a deep meditation on the entire wave-lovin' experience, but that's no excuse for staggering along with such a sub-par story.<br/><br/>As unremarkable as they may be, the female leads are about the best thing in the film. They all look smart in bathing suits---the words ""woo hoo"" come to mind---and they're fairly natural. Plus, these likable babes don't grate with too many, ""you go, girl"" comments. Rodriguez even smiled once or twice, which confirms that she DOES have more facial expressions than just snarling and pouting. But despite the physical beauty of the waves and the girls, the film they're in is generic goop. Parents will be happy that all the sex is kiss-kiss-fadeout, there's nary a drug, and only a handful of cuss words. All the same, I'm certainly not happy with the content of 'Blue Crush'. It's just not tubular, dude."

","I should start off saying, This film is amazing on So many levels!!! the story is believable and well plotted, and the way this film was shot is Amazing!!!<br/><br/>I originally went to see this film for two reasons. 1.I love Michelle Rodriguez. 2.Im a sucker for surf movies.<br/><br/>I originally didn't figure on expecting too much from this film, other than a fluffy story with people wiping out alot on weeny waves, but In turn the characters are brought out quite well, and the waves are HUGE! I do however think this is a somewhat sequel to ""North Shore"", ""ie..Girl makes it big on small circuit, has problems and eventually breaks through and comes out on top, and it takes place in Hawaii, on the North shore.. :)""..It's Kind of a ""fluff"" story, but it Draws you INTO the character's lives...and when your finished watching this film, you'll feel like youve Really been hitting the waves!!<br/><br/>However , If you Don't like feel good movies, or surf movies in general bore you...then this film Isn't for you...otherwise this movie is tops when it comed to surfer flicks!!!"
"LBytes","8","18","28","12 July 2004"," Hi marks for the audio presentation
","I won't dispute the weakness in the story and some so-so acting. In this particular case I rate this movie highly for its video and especially audio quality. For any home theater fanatic looking for top notch sound this is one of the best. When they're out in the water laying pipe, etc... its about as good a sound track as I've heard. You can almost feel the water getting in your ears. The video isn't far behind but that was easier for the filmmakers since the Hawaiian coast is so beautiful. I found the story to be passable, but there are a couple of segments that are dumb and I skip over on repeat viewings. Some of the extra features on the DVD are also good. If you have a good HT audio setup this needs to be in your collection!"

","This is a great movie! The surfing scene's are brilliant! Everything is perfect! Even the house and car made me feel all warm inside! We're actually thinking about moving to Hawaii thanks to this movie. There are some stupid mistakes in this movie. I'm a big fan of Michelle Rodriquez, but don't let her play in a surf movie if she can't surf... When she's surfing you can't see her face or you only see her back... so that's kind of pathetic... But this movie is funny, romantic, exciting, active and so much more! In one word: Great! I really don't understand why there are so many people who don't like this movie... It's really great! If it's a hot summer night and you're with you boyfriends/girlfriend you should definitely watch this movie!"
"tedg","Null","11","17","16 August 2002"," Cinematic Water
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I was blown away by this little gem, because of how purely cinematic it is.<br/><br/>All the good parts are framed by a weak story that started out at least competently formulaic but has been so sliced and diced by the producers that none of it makes sense. No matter. Really, no matter because the water scenes make the time more than worth the effort. But it must be noted that while the story (and acting and dialog) is all disposable, it respects the sexuality of the girls. They are in bathing suits, and look nice but not even once is there a prurient shot. Not once is there an attempt to slip into a coy, seductive wiggle. And that's remarkable indeed.<br/><br/>But it is not the thing that makes this trip worthwhile.<br/><br/>
Not all of life does well in translating to cinema. Some things are inherently more cinematic than others, and the stuff that is (and is easy to do) comes pouring over the hapless moviewatcher: explosions, car chases, macho strutting and the related violence. And of course a specific type of sexual, cool open (usually submissive) femininity. In fact, because that sexual presence is so cinematically effective, it has defined societal types and expectations. That's another story, one we will avoid here except to already have noted that this film made a deliberate effort to steer away from sex in order to only have one cinematic center.<br/><br/>And that's the architectural water. Structured, moving water is the most cinematic thing in existence. It is also an incredible challenge to film, but the few times it has been explored, the results have sometimes been striking. Even in the otherwise horrible `Hard Rain,' even in the deeply flawed `In Dreams,' even in the melodramatic `Titanic,' the movement of camera with water comes close to a visually spiritual experience.<br/><br/>I live in a surfing town, and in 1967 saw `Endless Summer.' But in that and all subsequent surf movies, what you get are moving portraits, not cinema. Here, we move to a whole nother level. The camera is above us, it is under us, it is _us_, it chases us, it anticipates us. I have made a minor study of how different projects move the camera within dancing (and in Ang Lee's case, within fights). The same techniques are used here as we participate in the dance between this athletic girl and these immense hydraulic beings.<br/><br/>I do not know for sure who did what, but I confidently surmise that this achievement is the result of a true story of girl power in Hollywood. The editor in this case is Emma Hickox. Aside from what we see on the screen, we know she is a remarkable cinematic mind if only because of her parents. Her mother is the still working (at 85!) editor who changed the world of visual imagination with `Laurence of Arabia.' Her father is the fellow that made one of the most intelligent films about films ever (`Theater of Blood'), but sadly unrecognized as such.<br/><br/>Watch what Ms Hickox does with the compositions of the eye as we envelop the enveloping water. Watch how cleverly she establishes our place with our ear at the beginning of these sequences and keeps us aurally, mentally stabilized while the eye dances. Amazing, simply amazing.<br/><br/>My only criticism is probably something beyond her control. We only needed to see the flashback sequence of the younger Anne getting her head bumped once. It must appear eight or ten times, every moment we have to be bludgeoned into recalling that she is frightened.<br/><br/>See this film. It advances your visual imagination far beyond what `Perfect Storm' ever could.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

","Blue Crush. I have this really stupid habit of putting the names of the movies that I loved on the wall of my room. I spend hours deciding whether or not to put up the names of the movies making notes of its pros and cons. It's a tough job!!<br/><br/>Today, so very strangely, with the opening scene of Blue Crush I wrote its name between The Matrix' and Underworld'. I knew I was going to love the movie even before I had seen it. And truly enough I loved the movie.<br/><br/>
What I loved so much about the movie was the story. It was a story of struggle against the odds to survive, to live for a dream. Isn't it the intensity of our struggle with our inner demons and external nightmares that determines the person that we grow up to be. The theme  I have a dream, never fails to win me over. If you don't live for your dream what will you live for. The art direction was awesome. If nothing else go to see this movie for the photography. The underwater shots - breathtakingly beautiful. The movie setting was perfect and the waves huge. The spirit of never-say-die that the movie leaves behind is undeniable. I also loved the fact that the leads both were set in different financial backgrounds. To see the trio of friends working as maids seeing to the luxury of the rich in a posh uptown hotel was an experience.  <br/><br/>Kate Bosworth does a really good job playing the role of a promising surfer who has a nightmare to live down. Michelle Rodriguez is Hollywood's toughest girl. Its about time she gets to prove her worth instead of being given the second lead. This tough girl can take all of Arnie, Stallone, Vin Diesel and give them hell in their own home turf. I may have watched the movie originally for Michelle Rodriguez, but who really stole my heart was Lena. She has this bright outlook at life that truly brings to life the essence of being alive. Kate B's sister, Penny, going wayward growing up was also great. <br/><br/>The music was really cool. I'll admit I'm mostly a punk rock/ sometimes heavy kinda boy, but the song that I'll be humming for a long time will be `Cool Summer' from the movie soundtrack.<br/><br/>In the end I always write about the glitches in the movie. Today this will remain blank. I found none. Brian Grazer in an interview talked rather proudly about this movie and the surfing stunts in it. And to God, he has a definite reason to be proud. And its called Blue Crush."

Better than anticipated surfer flick with the twist on the genre by focusing on a Hawaiian based determined young female athlete (Bosworth) attempting a requiem two years after a near fatal accident while competing is buoyed by her family of friends and a vacationing quarterback (Davis) factoring as an unexpected blossoming romance.  The connect-the-dots plotline of social graces hinder the otherwise excellently lensed moments of visceral, adrenalized thrills in shooting a curl with massive walls of water in all its colorful fury by cinematographer David Hennings while director John Stockwell (who co-wrote the screenplay with Lizzy Weiss' adaptation of Susan Orlean's magazine article) balances the melodrama affectively with the totally awesome hydrodynamiques on display.  One gripe: would it have killed the filmmakers to show some more of the paradise playland for a travelogue begging to be showcased?"

Anne is traumatized with her accident, and is quite afraid of the big waves, but she aims to achieve a sponsor to follow her career and have the necessary financial support. Some days before the competition, she has a crush on the football player Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis). 'Blue Crush' is a good popcorn film, having a shallow story but compensated by the wonderful places and the big waves in Hawaii, and the very beautiful young cast.

While too much of the injected skag of usual turns and characters are found in Blue Crush, not to mention the always important climactic contest (can a sports film not lead to a major contest in the end?) and (spoiler) picture of the winner on the cover of surfing magazine, while all that is there, there is an audience for Blue Crush, and they ride that wave out.

"dilloncw02","9","2","2","16 November 2012"," Way more than just ""Gnarly""
","When viewing a movie centered on the sport of surfing, some may feel like they're on the outside looking in. But Blue Crush, a ""summer box office guilty pleasure"" according to the New York Times, directed by John Stockwell, does in an incredible job of displaying the surf world while drawing in the average American by employing the typical Hollywood love story. Most Americans think of the sport of surfing as a thing for Californians or Hawaiians and synonymize it with the words ""hang ten,"" ""righteous,"" and ""gnarly."" But in Blue Crush, Stockwell is able to connect the inner workings of one of the most dangerous sports in the world to the story of just a typical local Hawaiian girl aiming for her shot in one of the most prestigious big wave surf completions in the world.<br/><br/>Produced by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, Blue Crush stars some well-known actors in Hollywood like Kate Bosworth, Matthew Davis and Michelle Rodriguez but also adds an actress who can truly relate to the world of surfing in Sanoe Lake, an ex pro surfer and face of billabong. Kate Bosworth who stars as Anne Marie Chadwick, lives with friends and fellow surfers Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) and is trying to prove to her other local friends and herself why and how she earned her wild card admission into the Billabong Pipe Masters Competition. While attempting to balance a job as a hotel maid, her dreams and raising her younger sister, Anne Marie struggles to find who she is and how she is going to be able to continue the current lifestyle she is living. While on the job, she falls for pro football player Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis) and begins to lose sight of the competition she has worked so hard for but soon realizes she is out of her element and doesn't know what to do. She eventually figures out a way to balance all of the things in her life and how to be herself while maintaining a relationship with her friends, sister and boyfriend and manages to achieve success while competing in the Pipe Masters. <br/><br/>The key to making this movie such a success was the outstanding cinematography. Stockwell and Universal Pictures display masterful camera work anytime someone was on a surfboard, which was a lot. Shooting all different angles of the waves that the stunt doubles surfed on, from the views inside the pipe of the waves to even getting beautiful shots of the undertow and coral reefs, Stockwell displayed his brilliance by understanding the key components of what drive the very sport of surfing. On top of magnificent camera work, the story line is something so original and specific in the sense that it is a movie based around surfing and the surf lifestyle, yet so relatable to the average person who doesn't know much about surfing at all. <br/><br/>Granted this movie was shot in Hawaii and is about the sport of surfing, Blue Crush is a great all around movie that is not just a typical summer flick. It's certainly a movie for people who enjoy surfing or are surfing enthusiasts, but it is also a movie for the general population as it lures them with an exotic landscape and puts a twist in the typical Hollywood love story of romance, heartbreak and fairytale ending. I, being someone who has been to every site where this movie was shot, recommend this movie to all based upon the legitimacy it contains about the lifestyle of surfing and the entertainment and drama it provides to keep the movie goer hooked throughout the entire motion picture. It may not have won an Oscar, but it is definitely an excellent and intriguing motion picture that shows the ""behind the scenes"" view into the world of surfing while still being entertaining."

","Nothing special to say the least. <br/><br/>*MILD SPOILERS WITHIN*<br/><br/>Blue Crush tries to take on a lot of themes but seems to drop them without any effort to carry them. For instance, we never find out what happens about Anne Marie and Penny's mother, Eden and Lena quit their jobs then are seen working them a few days later, Penny seems to have a growing interest in drugs and sex and we're just supposed to believe it's typical 'teenage experimentation,' Anne Marie and Matt's relationship happens at a ridiculously fast pace, the rival surf gang or whatever suddenly warms up because...why? Etc.<br/><br/>Plus the dialouge sounded way forced and awkward, and, at times, very unnatural. The surf footage was pretty impressive, if you ignore the fact that in most instances it was clear that stunt doubles were doing the surfing. But the rest of the footage looked like a home video.<br/><br/>A big disappointment. 3/10"

The chicks in the movie seem real as do the locations. It's great how they have done this. My favourite movie character in Blue Crush would have to be Anne Marie.

","A feel good chick surfer movie. The bad kind. Need I say more. Maybe. Sexy lead actresses, some incredibly nice underwater shots and shots of waves, not much of a story, a lame surf-stylewannabe soundtrack, but still, there's an idea as to what a surfer's life should look like, except here it (with little surprise) all about being number one and getting rich and famous. In between there's some unnecessary comic relief and a love story if you believe that's what it is.<br/><br/>Recommend - if you liked ""Coyote Ugly"" then this movie has your name on it. Otherwise just skip it and rent ""Point Break"" instead. And if you're really into surfing find a movie called ""Sprout"". You'll thank me"

","Do not let the poor reviews put you off, Blue Crush is a very enjoyable and touching tale with spectacular waves that will have you screaming at the screen for everyone to get the hell out of the water. They are clearly all crazy.<br/><br/>Anne Marie (Bosworth) is a talented surfer that hopes to compete in the male dominated Pipe Masters competition. She shares a ramshackle beach house with her two friends Eden (Rodriquez) and Lena (Lake) as well as her rebellious little sister Penny (Boorem). Her life is split between a gruelling Rocky style-training regime, surfing, and working with her house mates as maids in a high-class hotel in an attempt to pay the bills. That is until the hotel is taken over by American Footballers whose quarterback Matt (Davis) catches her eye. <br/><br/>It starts off badly, with a rather psychedelic flash back sequence that shows us the traumatic surfing experience that haunts Anne Marie and is the reason she has been out of the professional circuit for the last few years. But very soon the characters begin to win us over, primarily because it is impossible not to respect someone who regularly paddles out into over 20ft waves. Especially when they are just wearing bikinis. Boswoth gives a great performance and perfectly portrays the mixture of adrenaline, exhaustion, vulnerability and absolute terror that anyone facing mother natures at her most magnificent would feel. The waves are the most spectacular you will see on screen, with stunning camera work and sound that manages to pull you out into the water to feel the panic and fear, not just for the characters, but for yourself. The surf sequences are absolutely gripping and will have you clinging to your seat, breathlessly. <br/><br/>On land the film holds up just as well. Even though many ideas and sequences are lifted directly from a variety of other films (Pretty Woman, Maid in Manhattan and Point Break to name a few) they are handled in a fresh way, and have plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep you entertained. The support cast is uneven, from the two brilliant big and black American Footballers to the dubious use of real life surfers and locals. However this seems to add a realism that actually works well as these few scenes can feel like the link shots used between the action in real surfing videos.<br/><br/>It is hard to explain why this film is so good. The plot is not great, and is has been accused of being a mindless sports/action film that uses scantily clad girls for titillation. That's crap. The girls are in bikinis because they live on a beach, the camera is never lecherous and there is no nudity. This film is far less predictable than you would expect it to be and it is sincere and sentimental. It also deals with many themes that we can relate to, such as facing up to past demons, finding a sense of direction and identity, family responsibility, and how priorities change when we fall in love. <br/><br/>Go see this film on the big screen, it's a great Romeo and Juliet story that's fun for both girls and boys of all ages. It will have you leaving the cinema smiling, perhaps with a new determination to face your own fears, or at least to try and get fit and go to the beach. A great film to get you in the mood for summer."

","What a horribly lame movie this is.  First, the bad acting almost makes it a comedy...almost!  Second, the plot...what plot?

And third, I can't imagine what some of these reviewers are referring to when they describe cinematography and sound.  It's mediocre at best.  I was laughing through most of this movie watching the actors struggling at their attempt at creating drama.  It's one of those films that is so bad that you can't help watching it.

","I remember seeing this movie several years ago and thinking nothing of it, I felt it was gonna be another cheesy teen movie with inane dialog and cliché moments of romance and humor. But low and behold, I was proved wrong. It may not have an award winning screenplay, but the dialog and plot along with some acting performances are decent enough to make the film entertaining than it actually is. What won me over was the cinematography and many will point out that the sound is one of the film's best assets. It was a treat to see this film back in the cinemas so I have no doubt in my mind that that same feeling can be had in the comfort of your own home. While watching this film, you almost feel as if you're in it itself and that's a feat that ""Blue Crush"" accomplishes because of it's superb atmosphere.

","Blue Crush is a movie that's gotta be seen to be believed and that's for one reason-the water shots. This movie is stunning in it's photography and contains some of the best underwater and wave/surfing visuals I have ever seen. In a way, I wish I had seen this on the big screen because man what a powerful bonanza that would have been. The visuals are almost unfathomable.<br/><br/>I must be honest and say I didn't really get into the movie much when the characters weren't surfing. There was a lot of music interspersed with dialog which didn't, to me, go with this type of movie and I was so wowed by the ocean scenes that when the characters weren't surfing I was bored. There were a few times I felt like I was watching Animal House meets a movie about surfing. The movie contained some of that type of humor which, to me, again, didn't go with what the movie was supposed to be about. If the movie didn't have all that other stuff I'd have liked it a lot better. It almost seemed like two different movies. I was a bit perplexed by that.<br/><br/>This movie needs to be seen by anyone who surfs or who loves the sea in general. I was swept away by the fierceness and power to the water scenes but wish I'd enjoyed the movie more as a whole. I'd give the visuals a 20 out of 10 though even though not the movie as a whole.

","Note: I streamed Blue Crush from Netflix in the USA on a laptop. Recommend you watch on a bigger stream.<br/><br/>Nearly fifteen years after its release, Blue Crush is a time capsule of the end of the nineties before the aughts had an identity. The film follows a group of young women who live together without parents surfing the waves between shifts at a hotel where they work. The film teases us with the revelation that Chadwick's mother left her to live with a man she met. Chadwick's little sister shows these same traits and Chadwick herself meets a hunky football player who just can't help himself with her. Many plot threads such as this remain underdeveloped like the adolescents living in the film's world. ""Blue Crush"" is ultimately a film about young people having a good time and living their lives. ""You were always so good,"" and ""go find your own dream,"" aren't just cheapshots between Chadwick and her friends. The young actors are real people in this world. We have been dropped into this narrative, and the unexplored plot lines are the segments we can't see.<br/><br/>That isn't to excuse all of the film's narrative choices. This is still a sports movie and Chadwick has to win the surfing competition, or at least place. She does of course. We see her and many other people surfing and we never get a sense as to how she was good enough to be invited to the competition. Maybe because she's hot and white, I guess? There's some cheap drama with the football player boyfriend who buys a dress for Chadwick to wear that's a bit too sexy. Chadwick is a rich boy's plaything. This revelation builds up to the surfing competition and the film's didacticism: women should follow their own dreams and not rely upon a man as a shortcut to comfort. Your friends will help you. During the surfing competition, Chadwick's competitor even helps her overcome anxiety to catch a wave.<br/><br/>In between the plot we see many surfing segments and Hawaiian beach fun. The director exhausts the natural beauty of these shots by repeating the same technique of presenting the waves each time. The camera pans behind the character, then underwater, then in front of them. Some effort is made to vary the underwater shot but the pattern is evident.<br/><br/>""Blue Crush"" is better than a film of its plot summary should be. It also has many elements that tie it to the late 90's. Recommended ON A BIG SCREEN!"

","John Stockwell's Blue Crush treads so close to the line of falling into the category of impossibly unrealistic romance fare but rebounds significantly by having its main character never lose sight of what's important to her. Just as you think the romantic element of the film will hijack the idea of the conflicts of self-motivation and self-doubt the narrator is having with herself, writers Stockwell and Lizzie Weiss rebound and help the romantic interest of the film's lead character motivate her rather than distract her. In addition, the film also respectfully portrays the surfing culture as more than a gaggle of stoned losers that ride waves and do nothing but slum when the tide comes in.<br/><br/>The film stars Kate Bosworth, an actress who, I assume, in 2002 was looking to be the next Kirsten Dunst or Reese Witherspoon until the glory faded, as Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), a teenager working as a maid at a tourist hotel in Hawaii and surfing with her best friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) on the side. Anne Marie is also taking care of her fourteen-year-old sister Penny (Mika Boorem) after their mother left for Las Vegas with another guy she met, in addition to training for her surfing comeback in a huge, publicized competition in North Shore. Winners, or highly-skilled participants, of the race are known to get surfing magazine deals left and right, and being a famous female surfer, breaking the stereotype, and gaining the glory for women everywhere is part of Anne Marie's dream.<br/><br/>In the mix, she winds up meeting Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis), an NFL quarterback in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Both individuals catch the eye of each other, but don't immediately strike up any flirtatious behavior because both have other things on their mind. Overtime, however, the two drift towards each other and wind up becoming closer, with Anne Marie's resistance always remaining in tact, as she doesn't want to be another hilarious story for Matt to tell his teammates when he gets back to the mainlands. However, Anne Marie finds out she may need Matt for the motivation and encouragement that she finds difficult to provide herself with, despite being highly-qualified and filled with talent.<br/><br/>Blue Crush features some superbly photographed surfing scenes, shot with crisp, directorial command by Stockwell and made clear and evocative thanks to the cinematographical work of David Hennings. The final twenty minutes of the film are some of the most electric scenes of surfing I have yet to see, and work wonderfully in terms of shifting the focus away from what could be sentimental romance fluff into something truly breathtaking and original.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, however, Blue Crush, while harmless, is also pretty simplistic; it's bears a very surface depiction of its characters despite not having the predictable pitfalls of its genre. Bosworth accentuates a nice charm, and the way that Stockwell and Weiss avoid the easier route is a commendable feat, on top of all the lush photography, but there's not enough drama that is gripping enough to invest in that doesn't seem oversimplified or voided by a lack of conversation in the film. Blue Crush serves as more intriguing basic entertainment than a great deal of other films made during or after its time, mainly due to the way it nicely avoids convention, yet there's still not a great deal of substance here outside of the fact that the predictably absorbing love interest doesn't monopolize the entire film on arrival.<br/><br/>Starring: Kate Bosworth, Matthew Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Sanoe Lake, Mika Boorem, and Faizon Love. Directed by: John Stockwell."

","Released in 2002, ""Blue Crush"" tells the story of three young female surfers in Hawaii who support their lifestyle as maids at a high-class hotel. Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) has dreams of going professional, but she has to get over her past failures and her family's breakup to succeed. In the meantime a vacationing NFL quarterback (Matthew Davis) romances her and she has to determine if their relationship is real or just a fling (for him, that is). Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake co-star as Anne Marie's surfing friends.<br/><br/>As you can see, ""Blue Crush"" is a 'sports film' in the manner of ""Karate Kid"" and a host of others. Although some of these movies go the comedy route -- e.g. ""Cloud 9"" and ""Bad News Bears"" -- ""Crush"" is a serious drama with fun flashes.<br/><br/>Filmed on the beaches/resorts of O'ahu, Hawaii, this is a beautiful and exhilarating film to watch, the perfect remedy if the weather in your area has been dreary.<br/><br/>There's no profanity, raunch or t&a exploitation but, to be expected, the film features some good-looking women in swimwear throughout its 104-minute runtime (dudes too, if you're a woman). By ""good-looking"" I mean realistically so, not like ""Baywatch"" which normally featured masses of ultra-hot babes swarming the beaches.<br/><br/>For the first hour the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, nothing great but moderately entertaining for this type of flick, and then something happened at the the 58-minute mark that struck a chord with me. Anne Marie hits the waves with her friend (Rodriquez) to prepare for the Pipeline Masters as we hear the song ""Youth of the Nation"" by P.O.D. This sequence touched me for some reason. The music & lyrics are emotionally potent and effectively set the tone for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>""Youth of the Nation"" exemplifies the zeitgeist of the new millennium just as ""My Generation"" perfectly represents the mid-60s and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" typifies the 90s (I was gonna say ""and just as 'Muskrat Love' typifies the 70s"" as a joke but decided not to, lol). Anyway, everyone's heard the song by now but if you're not sure go to youtube and listen to it with lyrics; it's an incredible piece, to say the least, and dig those heartrending lyrics! It's reality, my friend.<br/><br/>For me, the film's just compelling enough to give a marginal thumbs up. Fans of surfing and Bosworth (or any of the other actors) will appreciate ""Blue Crush"" more than me. But I was moved by the above musical interlude and one other thing...<br/><br/>What affected me most with the story is the picture of the three maids, impoverished and disdained by the snobs but full of youthful zeal and hope. It strangely reminded me of something I experienced on my last trip to Southern California. I was leaving the last showing of a theater late at night and spied the janitorial crew coming in to clean with their mops & buckets. They were Mexicans, mostly young, and possibly illegal aliens. Everyone walked by them as if they were invisible, like they were the scum of society or something. But I made a point to acknowledge them and smile. I don't feel I deserve a medal for this or anything; it's just that I made a decision long ago that, no matter how far I go in life, I'm not going to look down on or ignore those in a more modest position. Why? I don't know, maybe because I'M scum.<br/><br/>The film runs 104 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B-"

The surfing action, which might have redeemed such cheesy fare, suffers from a surfeit of over-familiar MTV-style editing. Also it's hard to feel any emotional engagement with the drama, while dismal dialogue, dangling plot threats and a wasted supporting cast (a sultry Sanoe Lake, a genuine surfer; Michelle Girlfight Rodriguez, from whom one jealous sneer speaks more volumes than a thousand pages of Barbie-gush) further let down a potentially subversive proposition.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there's some lovely shots of Hawaiian sunrises, if you're still undecided about cashing in those Air Miles."

","The rather cute story of some surfer chick/bums, perpetually broke, living the dream in Hawaii. One of them is a former competitor and champion. But she hit bottom, literally, and can't get on the bike again. So that's the plot. Get her back in competitive women's surfing.<br/><br/>She and her two friends work as maids in one of the hotels. She has a younger sister who goes to a local school, and generally acts up. But she's a cutie, too. They all are, basically. So it's around February, and the NFL Pro Bowlers come to town. There's the QB and his lineman, presumably from his own team. The QB sort of looks the part, because QBs generally are not that built. They're not all Terry Bradshaw. And the offensive lineman sometimes can have a belly and still be all-Pro - think Larry Allen. So I found the casting just barely believable in that. And she and the QB sort of hit it off. And eventually she offers, with the help of her friends, to teach them how to surf.<br/><br/>It's a comic scene after scene as they learn to surf. But the point is to make the payoff. She goes to his hotel room, and he practically propositions her with a wad of bills. But she takes it home, pays the rent, etc, and we're on to the competition. Of course, she starts having sex with the QB, too. But it's for love, not the money. Certainly not any suggestion of actual marriage.<br/><br/>The heart of the story is the competition. She has to get over her fear. She has to brave a number of waves. And of course - she wins in the end, gets the sponsorship deals, etc. That is success.<br/><br/>The film really, that is, didn't have much of a story to tell. The story really was surfing itself, a sort of lifestyle, and that people would devote time to this, and to the competitions. The Pro Bowl backstory, while providing the 'love interest' only served to show their interest in this thing called - surfing.<br/><br/>Despite surfers complaining that it wasn't just one big wave ride after another in this film, the film, nonetheless, is all about surfing - because it really is not about anything else. It's light-hearted. The actresses are almost always smiling, which is attractive. It's just a film with a lot of cute scenes, and at least one 'gross-out' scene. And when they do hit the water, there are some clever following shots right into the water showing the 'washing machine' that grabs the surfers who fall.<br/><br/>I suppose the actresses have other commitments. I suppose Rodriquez will be about done with, Lost (which looks on the verge of getting cancelled). And I'm sure many would wonder, even though 'Penny' is now much older and very different, if the three other actresses are looking to reprise a Blue Crush II?"

","This movie is a cross between ""Sport movie"" and ""Teen flick"". Based on that sentence alone you can predict pretty much all elements in there: good looking people (well, mostly girls, to be fair), gross humour that isn't funny (used condoms, floaters in toilets, puke), a romance, a crisis in the romance, a sports contest, some ""go out there and kick some butt"" speeches, and, unfortunately, blaringly loud music in every second scene in order to push a soundtrack CD.<br/><br/>But all of that is excusable in this case for a single reason: The surf scenes, and the camerawork in these. As shallow as the movie may be, when it gets down to the surfing, they've been as serious, as meticulous and as visually brilliant as film makers can get. Well, and the waves did their best too, I'm sure. I'd love for this movie to be rereleased in DMR IMAX format.<br/><br/>Some people mention CGI, and sadly, the face replacement wasn't convincing in some scenes. But, and that is perhaps more important, there were no full CGI humans, no surfing James Bond, anywhere in sight. So you get a dodgy face replacement or two and near the end an embarrassing blue screen, but apart from that everything appeared to be authentic.<br/><br/>So in the end it boils down to this: If you want to watch some of the most amazing visuals ever shot, without wire-fu and big explosions, then this movie is worth your money. If you happen to like corny, predictable teen flicks crossed with sports movies, but without any laughs, then you will like it too.

Anne-Marie,surprisingly does,It portrays her as intelligent,bubbly and haunted with past insecurities.They fail completely. She has a job as a part-time cleaner,struggling to pay the bills while cleaning up filth from vile customers(I wont go into detail of what)in which she apparently finds funny.Yes,very....(note sarcasm) It continues.The younger sister,a trapped and typical angstful teenager.The plot goes off the rails,but instead of crashing,intends to bore you to death.The sister has to be dragged out of a party with older boys(A guy meant to be twenty with grey hair),noteably their rival who looks like a drugged OAP with a tough character.He grunts,he shoves and shouts.Perfect,the directors cry,what a good rival. Joy of Joys when we get a macho football player enter and the terrificly stupid romance plot enters the rubbish story. What follows is him trying to use his non-existentent charm and acting abilities to woo her into some kind of partnership,and the story now practically throws a fat genre of bordem down your throat.Its depressingly bad. And now for the final insult of patronising,it adds some surfing,with Anne Marie doing a couple of surfs,falling off her board,remembering some extremely poorly shot bang on the head(as aforementioned)which only helps to add to your mounting hatrid and confusion at the appalinging film.Then she gets back up and surfs again....the dry,horribly annoying and tedious repetetiveness is the final straw.Even a red-blooded shallow male coming to watch surfing girls will be put off,even as she flops around durmbly.Even a surfing fanatic will be disgusted,even insulted,at this terrible movie.I wanted,I needed,to walk out of the movie. Maybe it's my male nature to intensely dislike this kind of horror,or maybe its my dislike for horribly repetetive sports films,especially like here where they get bemusingly technical.I found out,to my relief that I was not alone.My Partner was embarrased at her blunder,which I was against from before I heard it was a romance film. There is very little that I can say was good about this film.Maybe the wonderful Hawaiin backdrop,the calm water and white beaches.But its spoiled when you seem Anne-Marie and her football friend squatting by the palms.The film was doomed,to me,before I saw it and by the end I found myself realising it was the worst film I had ever seen.Giving this more than 0.1 is severe breach of sanity,and my only adivce to you is avoid it like the plague.Its shoddy,shallow,boring,repetetive,patronising,annoying and an all round crap of a film.I have to lay it on harsh for this one-it is one of the worst films in existence.Shallow People,Surfers,people who like to see girl-lead movies(which this blatantly patronises and degrades),and everyone else,I advise to leave this alone."

","This movie is definately not the worst movie, and in fact can be quite enjoyable at times throughout the movie.  However, the acting in the movie is rather average.  Kate Bosworth does a satisfactory job of portraying Ann Marie.  Michelle Rodriguez though...she always seems like a terrible actress to me.  The Fast and the Furious and this, she just isn't a great actress. However, she doesn't talk very much, so this does not detract from the movie in the end.  The dialogue in the movie can also be painful at times.  Also the plot is not the most original or interesting, but it manages to pull through all right with what it has.

","I first caught the tail end of Blue Crush after a long night of work, with the surf crashing down, the competition heating up and...no real chance to judge anything other than what I immediately saw, which I liked.<br/><br/>Well it made me want to see more and so later when I had the opportunity, I checked it out.  *** possible spoilers ***<br/><br/>This could have been a much better movie.  The lush women and scenery, and for the gals, a few good men, as well as the comedic relief of Faizon Love and company...did make the movie enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>I just could not deal realistically with the plot point that Kate Bosworth and this Pro Football player could hook up in the period of a short week, hey let's give them two, and for their relationship to find such levels. The depth of this relationship was too much too fast when they hardly knew each other.  In the real world we might call it immaturity, infatuation, whatever.  It just seemed unrealistic.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, Kate Bosworth might make any man fall in love, definitely lust, and if you're battin' for the other side, well, her body is rockin' and......but c'mon now.  <br/><br/>The point is this was not meant to be fantasy.  We were meant to buy this and maybe in Hollywood or under the age of 15 this is how people act, but I just buy it in the real world short of stalkers and pure psychos.<br/><br/>All in all, I did like this movie.  Even with the absence of some of the sub-plots being expanded upon, it could have worked.  It's just that once you start playing with what is real and it is not meant to be the newest fantastic story, it invariably screws things up and hurts credibility for many viewers.<br/><br/>One last note.  I'm not sure how much is CG and I heard that Bosworth's head was placed on some real surfer girls in some spots, but regardless, the Surfing is very cool.  For anyone who is a fan, check out ""In God's Hands"" for some really decent, real surfing.  No great plot there either if I remember, but not as much of a stretch."

","I channel surfed (sorry) into the beginning of this movie and thought I'd turn it off after a few minutes, but I couldn't.  It wasn't an amazing plot (standard with few surprises) nor outstanding acting (everyone was fine, but that's all) -- it was primarily the amazing, mind-blowing, knock-your-socks-off photography of water and surfing that kept me coming back after I'd stepped into the kitchen to heat up some dinner and that prevented me from moving from my chair once I was seated again with my plate and fork.  (Minor note: the view of life in Hawaii from the non-tourist side was also fascinating.) I am old enough to be the mother of most of the characters in the movie, and I don't even know the name of the genre for the music which provides the soundtrack.  (Is that hiphop?)  I am not at all athletic, and I wasn't into beach/surfing movies even when I was the same age as the main characters in ""Blue Crush"".  That having been said, I really liked this movie.

It's like we get to see what it is like when a surfer gets crushed by the wave.  And there are some funny moments with the fat NFL players.  What I didn't like is the main character is turned into a slut. Anne Marie sleeps with the quarterback like the second day she knows him. And like he would have any respect for her, much less go down and cheer her on at the surfing competition.  Then, she gets mad when she hears some of the other girls talking about the quarterback and  the Denny's waitress.

","No one was more surprised than me that I enjoyed Blue Crush. It is a by-the-numbers teen drama about three Hawaiian wahinis who have crappy day jobs to the pay the rent and support their surfing addiction. One of them, Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) was a child champion of the sport, but stopped competing when she was almost killed when she lost control of her board and bashed her head on a rock. Now after a break of three years she's signed up to ride the big waves in the island's largest surfing competition. She's in training until she meets a young, rich football player who sweeps her off her feet. Story wise Blue Crush falls flat when it is on land, but the surfing scenes are spectacular. There are a few little twists that set this apart from the usual teen fare - the girls have decidedly unglamorous jobs as hotel maids, and live in a grotty little shack - but don't expect to be wowed by the plot. Think of it as The Wide World of Sports with dialogue."

A surfing competition that Anne Marie hopes will make her famous is almost upon them, which makes it hard for her to juggle her friendship with Lena and Eden, her work as a chambermaid at an upscale Honolulu hotel, and being a sister to Penny, a loner with a bad attitude. Later on, she meets Matt (Matthew Davis), a visiting football player and his obese teammate Leslie (Faizon Love), both of whom the four girls train to surf. Sparks fly between Matt and Anne Marie after she is fired from her job for scolding Leslie following an incident with a used condom (watch the movie!), and Matt begins to pay her for teaching him how to surf.

","i rarely watch sports- movies, because it is not my favorite genre. however i found them interesting and expressive of other messages than just pure action. BLUE CRUSH is a good example.<br/><br/> As a movie about sport, of course it features action-packed shots and they are really impressive. i wonder how could the cameraman survive such huge waves , trying to film them or he got other techniques. ANN MARIE looks so professional and she acted as well as she surfed. she's just like an angel flying over waves smoothly and freely. but, the way i see it , there's nothing more to flatter the waves and that's it: the routine goes on when Marie get set , jump into the water, paddle hard, wait for a huge wave and get on it when it comes and finally try to swerve to the left or right escaping the chasing wave. the cinematography is good , but repeated ,which is the most obvious setback of this movie<br/><br/> However, this movie doesn't grip you most of the time, it could also be considered a romance one. Marie not only surfs , but also love. it 's sort of classical love story of a prince and a  hotel maid in Hawaii. their love is not so special but it spiced up the film.<br/><br/> ""face your fears and live your dreams', a traditional slogan of a sport-flick, here again it is implied.

","Ok, going into this movie, I did not have the highest of expectations. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Don't listen to the people on the message board. Blue Crush isn't the best movie of 2002 but it definitely isn't the worst. Kate ""Why in the world did I do Rules of Attraction?"" Bosworth plays Anne Marie, a young girl who is forced into the role of mother to her younger sister (played quite well by Mika Boorem) when her mom runs off to Vegas with a man. Michelle Rodriguez plays Eden, Anne Marie's coach who lives vicariously through her when it comes to surfing. Surf star Sanoe Lake makes a convincing debut as a surfer girl and this is the inner circle of friends for the movie. Most of the surfing footage is edited quite well and the only thing I found to be really cheesy is the end shot (if you've seen Blue Crush you know what I mean). Rodriguez once again plays a tough girl (can she play anything else?) who is more driven by Anne Marie's goals than Anne Marie. I could've done without the love interest side story between Anne Marie and Matt, the NFL quarterback in Hawaii for what I presume is the Pro Bowl. I get that they were drawing parallels between Anne Marie and her mother (both have men wanting to whisk them away). Extras are cast quite well and you really get to appreciate the gorgeous scenery that is Hawaii throughout the movie. On the level of a surfing movie this works. The huge waves, competition, and girls in bikinis were all quite enjoyable. The side stories weren't as good although I did enjoy the football players and their antics. In the end you really felt for Anne Marie and Bosworth does a great job carrying off the character. There was great chemistry between the 3 surfer girls and that really showed in the movie. Props for most of the cast doing as much of their own stunts as possible as well. If you like good looking kids in paradise, this is the movie for you. Some of the unneeded cheeseyness takes points away but for a mindless summertime flick, I have to endorse Blue Crush.<br/><br/>*DVD includes loads of extras including commentary by Bosworth, Rodriguez, and Lake who arrives late (must have been surfing) and commentary by Stockwell. Music videos, surfing terms, a behind the scenes look at the making of the film makes the extras strong.* ***7/10 stars***"

","Saying that Blue Crush is exactly what you would expect is saying that it is neither particularly good nor bad. I guess its better than you would expect, then, since it could so easily be a stupid, cliched film. In many ways it is, but it is not so cliched that you don't enjoy watching it. The plot about the girl who has this big match at the end and meets a guy and starts dating is all a cliche. It doesnt matter. The surfing scenes, including when they just go out surfing to have fun, as opposed to only when they are competing, are fun. The romance might be cliched, but it is still okay. It bothered me that the two friends weren't given real characters of their own, but nobody will accuse this movie of being a smart film. It's brainless fun. If you want something smart, dealing with teenagers, and attractive ladies, check out Risky Business. Blue Crush is more of something that you watch to not have to think about. If youre in that kind of a mood, then this is perfect."

","One little spoiler but relevant.<br/><br/>How could I forget Blue Crush? This was such a good movie. I was entertained. While watching it, I just got this new found respect for women in sports period. Hell this movie, as mediocre as it appeared to others, showed that women are just as good as men at surfing. It also showed that we can ultimately find our true selves through our greatest fear(s). The lead character would have been forever tormenting herself if she never tried. It rings so true to life with all of us in anything. A gift, a dream, whatever.<br/><br/> Bosworth did a good job and is such a cutie. Her character was so grounded. They didn't gloss these girls up (not idealistic but realistic) and I appreciate that. It takes alot of balls and discipline to do this sport. Check out that underwater scene with Bosworth running under water carrying the rock with her friends on her shoulders. Hell I couldn't do that."

","This is a film that will undoubtedly find an enormous audience with the ""Dumb and Dumber"" set, the ""Baywatch"" fans, and perhaps a few neurotic females impassioned by delusions of the ""surfer dude"" mystique.  But there are a few moments which are at least partially inspiring in this otherwise obvious fantasy.  That is, because it is hard to imagine that anyone could be that superficial or banal.  The girls might just as well have been competing with the boys on who could write the best comic books, for all that their maturity was involved, except that, one might suppose, surfing is arguably more ""dangerous,"" and hence more ""serious.""  The dubious message of the film seems to be that whatever the less intelligent males like to do, so can it be done by the girls, whether they prove anything worthwhile about themselves in the bargain or not.<br/><br/>And they don't.  They turn out to be as vapid and superficial as their male counterparts.  The lead female character is every inch the two-dimensional Barbie doll, finding greater aptitude between her legs than her ears.  And her male cohort is equally the Ken doll, strikingly handsome and athletic, who likes his dolls best when he can dress them all up in sleazy outfits. It's an embarrassing film, like something done by Hugh Hefner.  Pretending to be a film about women, it's actual appeal is to the less subtle sort of male.  It wants its females to be sexual playthings, so that's how they're cast.  Oh, they rebel a bit, and put up a good show to be sure, but there is something about a hot young football player that no red-blooded American female can resist, or so it would seem for this movie."

Unfortunately, that is really all it is about.  It's basically a played out story line about a girl who once could.  It revolves around a cute girl that once suffered a serious head injury while crashing her surf board, who now doubts herself as one of the biggest competitions in her life is upon her, one that could put her face on the map of women's surfing.  I'm sure you can see where it is going.  <br/><br/>In a weak attempt to add depth to the plot, there is a cheesy relationship which develops between an NFL player and the main surfer girl, one that begins taking up all of her time that should be spent practicing for the competition.  It takes the will of a good friend of hers to try to get her to regain her focus just in the nick of time for the surfing event.  Other than some added testosterone from local guys, one being an ex boyfriend of hers, this movie really doesn't have much more as far as the plot line goes. There was potential for depth as the main surfer is taking care of her little sister due to her mother not living up to responsibilities, but for some reason, the movie basically ignores this topic throughout most of the movie.  <br/><br/>If you're a heterosexual guy, you won't mind this movie for the women in bikinis alone, but for the rest of you out there, I'd say this is a 2 star movie.  I however, being a guy who likes women, gave it 3 stars.  I didn't have any expectations for it, thus I really wasn't disappointed.  However, my fiance who expected more for some reason, said afterwards that she thought it was highly cheesy and not a good movie.  So there you go."

I was correct.  I tried to like it at least enough to finish it, but it was just so bad I stopped watching.  To let you know how bad it was, I am a person who usually finishes films even when they suck.  Especially if I'm bored on a plane.<br/><br/>I do admit I am not a surfer-person, and this movie was geared toward a younger age group than I am in now, so younger kids (13-14?) that like surfing may like this movie and not notice how bad the script is.  It just had no flow to it and the dialog was really boring.  The football player boyfriend was particularly awful(my favorite bad line was when some 'surfer-dude' said generically, ""Hey, aren't you that Quarterback?"" Couldn't they at least make up a team name if they couldn't use a real one?). I honestly did not give a crap about any of the characters.

I did think that the acting was quite good. Michelle Rodriguez (spelling?) was excellent and I loved her no crap attitude. And Sanoe Lake was good in her small role as the sidekick. But, unfortunately, the movie was soured a little by the romance between Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) and Matt (Matthew Davis).

Set on the Hawaiin coast Blue Crush, directed by John Stockwell, tells the story of Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) a dedicated surfer who falls for Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis) a professional American football player in the days leading up to a huge surfing competition. But her flatmates Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) have different ideas as they play surrogate mother to Anne Marie's younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem). There's plenty of action, with huge crashing waves, as Anne Marie abandons her training to teach Matt to surf. But is it just a holiday romance? Will she be too distracted to make the competition? Ultimately the film is about overcoming your fears. Anne Marie fears a major surfing accident and is cautious beyond measure when it comes to riding the waves. Later, she develops a fear that Mat might just be using her for a holiday romance. Blue Crush is the ultimate surfie movie and bound to be a huge hit in New Zealand this summer."

","(**Note -- contains spoilers***) `Blue Crush' was an enjoyable movie about surfing and about following your dream.  It had great surfing scenes, a good cast, good photography, and a good story line.<br/><br/>The film follows Anne-Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) on her quest to win a surfing championship in her home state of Hawaii.  From the beginning you see that Anne-Marie has the right stuff to be a champion.  She rises at dawn to run and practice surfing and stays focused on the contest as best as she can.  Unfortunately, life has thrown some obstacles into Anne-Marie's life.  Abandoned by her parents, she must work as a low-paid hotel maid in the highest cost of living state.  And at the same time she is trying to raise her younger sister.  The bogeyman haunting Anne-Marie is the surfing accident which nearly killed her three years earlier, of which we see several flashbacks.  <br/><br/>Suddenly, in the last week before the competition, she meets and falls in love with Matt Tolman, the handsome, charming Detroit Lions Quarterback. Confused on the eve of her great quest, Matt, Lena, and Eden convince Anne-Marie to go for it.<br/><br/>I really think the cast was great, just hampered by a poor script.  Kate Bosworth will go on to many more roles.  I also enjoyed the performances of Sanoe Lake as Lena, Michelle Rodriguez and Eden, and Matthew Davis as Matt Tolman, and of course Faizon Love as Leslie, who zings the few comic lines in the film.  <br/><br/>It was not a box office smash, but could `Blue Crush 2' be far behind? What could they do to improve it?  Here's a modest proposal...  Anne-Marie and Matt pursue their athletic careers and their romance, and decide to get married during the off-season.  When Matt takes Anne-Marie back to Minnesota, she gets more than she bargained for.  With only one sister, she is suddenly brought into the world of the extended Tolman family.  Matt's father, Linus Tolman (played by Garrison Keillor) a successful Norwegian immigrant and president of Nordic Sports, finds a saying in Norwegian for every occasion, and dispenses Windex for any ailment.  Matt's Mother, his five sisters, their husbands and children, plus 25 first cousins provide quite a culture shock  Anne-Marie adopts her new family, and introduces surfing to Lake Superior.   It could be called `My Big Blue Norwegian Wedding.'  Hey, just a suggestion!"

","Yes, the women are gorgeous. Yes, the waves and water looks magnificent. And yes, the plot struggles to surface for air while being constantly pounded by the waves of predictability and cheesiness. Essentially, a B-grade attempt at an A-class concept, Blue Crush suffers from letting it's paralleling stories get in each others way. However, it does succeed in unearthing some of the core workings of the surfing lifestyle and it is this fact, combined with the charm of its leads, which saves Blue Crush from being all out to sea.<br/><br/>Kate Bosworth (Remember the Titans, The Horse Whisperer) plays Anne Marie, a amateur surfer and local Hawaiian hoping to make her big break in the upcoming Pipeline Masters surfing competition. Left by her mother, Anne finds juggling work at a local resort as a maid, her sisters erratic teenage lifestyle and the need to train for the upcoming competition all too much. Haunted by the horrors of a near drowning and dogged by unpaid bills, Anne and housemates Eden (Rodriguez) and Lena (newcomer Lake) decide to give surfing lessons to a holidaying NFL team for extra money. When Anne falls for the charismatic quarterback Matt (Davis), it is time to take stock, face her fears and re-arrange her life, her priorities and achieve her destiny.<br/><br/>Blue Crush succeeds admirably in its attempts to capture the essence of the surfing lifestyle. Getting up at dawn to check the surf, a non-challenging job, tardiness on account of the waves, local bullies and of course the guts it requires to throw your ability at mother nature and at death itself. This last point is captured brilliantly, with the sheer size of the waves and the flashbacks of Anne's life threatening wipeout rapidly driving that fear home.<br/><br/>The surfing footage is without a doubt the most authentic Hollywood has captured. The leads look and lead the part, clearly getting physically into their parts. However, they are let down by shoddy editing (crowds in the background of isolated breaks) and a shocking level of repeat footage. Although acceptable on your run of the mill surfing video, a lot better is and should be demanded of Hollywood's finest.]<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the sub-plot storylines of Anne's parental duties to her sister, her friendship with her flatmates and her love affair with Matt are never fleshed out enough to make a difference. Neither are they relevant, as the film begins and climaxes with Anne's need to combat and overcome the fear in herself while facing some of the largest and deadliest waves of Hawaii's famous (and camera friendly) north shore. What we have here is a great 50min flick that is stretched into a feature length through the addition of predictably cheesy soap plots.<br/><br/>Performance wise, all 3 female leads bond and bounce of each other with the same ease and self assurance that the culture is famous for. Rodriguez especially is well cast in the meatier of the roles, however, it is a fine debut by Lake that is most likely to turn heads. Around them, competent bit parts are played throughout, although this standard drops as you continue down the line of locals pulled in for smaller parts.<br/><br/>Blue Crush is far from rubbish. There are some genuinely funny moments and the cast garner affection, without going far enough to insult the censors. A great start and climax hold up a weak middle and predictable ending that do little more than flesh out the running time. The big question is, how do you make a consistently good  90min+ film about a surfing competition? Who knows, but when Blue Crush is in the water it excels and is well worth a visit."

","The ocean is deeper than the plotting in this MTV-style paean to surfing (and going for your dream, bucking the odds, yadda yadda), but as empty summer movies go, it has a pleasing working-class grit and credibility. Our plucky heroine comes from a believably broken home and has a credibly taxing bratty little sister, not to mention a sullen best friend/trainer who feels betrayed when our surfer girl forsakes hanging ten for hanging with a hunky NFL quarterback (OK, it's not THAT believable). The story is an agreeable time-passer that doesn't take up too much space between the spectacular surfing sequences, and the happy ending isn't so happy that credibility wipes out, a la ""Rocky."" There's some annoying comic ""relief,"" and the movie isn't exactly psychologically complex, but if all you want is to extend your summer for a couple of hours while looking at pretty people and pretty Hawaiian beaches, you could do a lot worse."

""Blue Crush"" has attractive strong young women stars, killer surfing sequences, and a story by Lizzy Weiss and Stockwell which actually holds our interest for the duration. Also having the stars surfing in bikinis is literary genius on Stockwell's part-- respecting the surf movie tradition. <br/><br/>Kate Bosworth plays Anne Marie, a former junior surfing champion, who has been out of competition since a nearly fatal surfing accident in a tournament. She and her surfing buds, Eden (a very intense Michelle Rodriguez), and Lena (a breezy Sanoe Lake) currently work as hotel maids at a Maui resort. This allows them to be surfer girls. <br/><br/>Anne Marie has taken on the responsibility to raise her younger sister Penny (well played by Mika Boorem). She is also training to make her come back in the International ""Pipeline"" Tournament. No nonsense Eden questions Anne Marie's commitment, when she pursues a possible relationship with a visiting Pro Quaterback, Matthew (played with goofy charm by Matt Tollan). ""Blue Crush"" has the teen soap opera thing going, and the build up to the day of reckoning surfing tournament which is kind of ordinary. However, what distinguishes ""Blue"" is the smart dialog, and that the movie is really about character and not giving up. Kate Bosworth is a star. Besides being gorgeous and athletic, she is both charismatic and vulnerable. She always comes across the screen as real. Her Anne Marie is doing the best she can, and she is up greatness, even though she is falling and failing. That is inspiring. I love strong, tough characters up to something in life in movies-- much like people in real life.

Nothing against Kate Bosworth, I thought she was great, but Rodriguez has a physical presence that would have been a lot more substantial against the local boys.Sanoe Lake was great, she played the part so naturally it was almost offsetting to see how easy it came to her. It would be  shame if this was all she did. In a summer stocked with blockbusters that played more like CG timekillers, this movie, with all detractions  noted, still had enough going for it to make it a great film. You have three lead actresses that  are on hopefully on the rise, excellent footage of one of the last great sports and , for the most part, a compelling premise. The throw-in love story could have stayed at home, I thought the prompting from her friends should have been enough to drive the main character. And in the end, less talk, more surf."

","The script of Blue Crush has left some reviewers in a state of utter confusion.  Whether 'tis nobler to show the travails of hotel maids cleaning up vomit, feces, and used condoms without remark or complaint, or to let the ladies give voice to their consternation and speak up...albeit at peril to their monthly incomes, now, THAT is the question.  I did not find this bit of consciousness-raising to be the least bit hokey, for it would be stranger yet that a gaggle of gung-ho athletic women would accept men's crap (literally) without a single effort at self-assertion.<br/><br/>Of course, we are not dragged into that hell of daily drudgery until we first witness the awesome spectacle of ""surfing the pipe"", a deliberate visit to the inside of a tornado of water, the conquest of which leads our heroines to do whatever it takes, for the sake of their sport.  Unlike other pro athletes, whose sport attracts bets from gamblers, and who can haul in six-figure incomes on their names alone, these pro surfriders' sole income derives from sportswear sponsors who pay to have their products demonstrated in public.  Tiger Woods may get a chunk of change for wearing the Nike Swoosh at his performances...but these gals have to be sponsored...or else...pay their own way.<br/><br/>Thanks, writers and producers, for some quality time with real athletes who engage in a sport for, well, the sport of it.  Equestrienne Kate Bosworth makes a great transition from a real-life jockette who has fallen off a few saddles and hit the ground with a thud, to portray a character who imitates a drowned rat just as well as any surfer, or any trainee from the Naval Special Warfare School, for that matter.  (Wendy, why didn't you write Gov. Jesse Ventura into your script?  He'd probably have gotten a kick out of showing the Minnesota voters what SEAL training really teaches a person about water, high surf, and seamanship!).<br/><br/>Now I'll go back to the latest news about the baseball contract negotiations, and get my barf bag ready for the next millionaire's complaint about his stingy billionaire team owner...and no, I don't plan to leave the contents laying around  for someone else to clean up!"

","Blue Crush is an enjoyable and fun movie.  I think when we see Kate Bosworth become a mega-star, we can say Blue Crush launch her career.  Her character, Ann-Marie isn't Gidget in any sense.  Her life is pretty much a wretch.  She and her friends(Lena and Eden) have the worst jobs on the isle cleaning after rich tourists as hotel maids.  Her once promising surfing career is stuck and going no-where after she almost drown 3 yrs ago.  Her mother abandoned the family and now she is raising her lil sister, living day by day on their meager wages.  And worst of all, her sister is becoming like her and she doesn't know or can't do anything to change it.  Kate Bosworth provides a fresh face that is as engaging as I have seen on the movie screen.  Two years from now when Kate Bosworth is a household name like Reese Witherspoon or Kate Beckensale, remember where it all started.<br/><br/>Since the movie doesn't really have an original plot and it won't break any new grounds in terms of writing and acting, I don't think you go to see this movie to judge whether is it oscar worthy.  I think from the poster alone, you know this is going to be a fun ride for the summer.  Nonetheless, the cinematography was awesome.  You can really feel the waves as it is crushing the actors in the water.  My only complaint is the wierd special effects they employed on some shots to superimpose Kate Bosworth's face on the stunt surfer's body.  I know you can't teach surfing in 2 months but it would had been nice if Kate Bosworth took more time to train the surfing scenes.  The one awesome scene I thought was when Sanoe Lake went airborne over the waves.  When you see that it was actually her rather than a stunt double or a cgi shot, it takes you out of your seat.

"MarshallStax","7","0","0","20 August 2002"," Off-handed realism and hyper-reality mix
","""Blue Crush"" has an unfortunate tendency to veer into extreme-sports style montages (freeze frames, sped up action, extensive use of slow-mo).  While undeniably fun to watch, this style exists mainly when the film is in the wet.  On dry land, the movie shifts gears completely, generally going for off-the-cuff realism underscored by carefully careless hand-held camera work, the look of natural-lighting and the casting of less-than physically perfect actors and actresses.  The director and cinematographer seem to have done a lot of shots from a distance and used telephoto during scenes of interaction between the female leads.  This more or less works to give us a feeling that we are watching real lives unfold. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the two styles of imagery clash and as a result might reduce enjoyment of the film.  Perhaps a more raw style of surf photography might have made the difference.  In general, though, the characters are well-drawn (especially the supporting cast), their dialogue is fairly believable and their motivations seem to come from an honest place.<br/><br/>So... there's nothing wrong with ""Blue Crush"" (except for a couple of detectable special effects shots and a continuity error or two) and there are numerous small but substantial pluses.  Go see it; you won't hate yourself afterwards.  And see if your throat doesn't close up in dread the first time we and our heroine Anne-Marie get a good look at the towering juggernaut of water at Pipeline on competition day.  Yikes!"

Strong acting and although this film looks as though it is just another teeny bopper flick it never diminishes to that level of cheesiness seen in Freddy Prinz Jr. flicks until near the end. One other thing I noticed--there is a mistake in editing near the film when Kate Bosworth is knocked under water and she has to undo the strap on her ankle to release the board. She does this but a few seconds later we see another shot of her struggling in the water and the strap is still there. Hmm....i think it is safe to say that this film  was rushed and when the makers realized the mistake it was too late to change it.

","When I first saw the ads for Blue Crush, I thought it'd basically be Bring it On in Hawaii, on surfboards. Instead it's an entertaining movie about a girl overcoming her anxiety of defeat.<br/><br/>Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) was a former hopeful in the world of amateur surfing, she backed out after a near drowning incident, and is trying to get back into competition. She is the sole caretaker of her 14 year old rebellious sister, Penny (Mika Boorem). Anne and her two friends Eden and Lena (played by Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake) work as hotel maids to scrape up enough rent for their beach home. The film pays respect to hotel maids by showing the disgusting things they must clean up after, from backed up toilets to the party-trashed rooms of NFL players, who are currently residing there. Anne eventually has a fling with the quarterback (Matthew Davis). All of these problems in Anne's life are not there to take over the story, just show some of the causes of Anne's anxiety.<br/><br/>Kate Bosworth does well as Anne Marie, the budding relationship between her and Matthew Davis is charming and believable, but thankfully does not take over the plot of the story. Michelle Rodriguez for the most part, gives up her usual tough girl role to play more of a coach to Kate's character. Sanoe Lake, the pro surfer turned actress, is surprisingly good in this film, considering this is her first gig. And Mika Boorem is charming as the rebellious younger sister.<br/><br/>The main highlight of the movie is the amazing footage of the surfing. I have never been to Hawaii, and I probably won't get there very soon, so seeing people tackle 20 foot tall waves is breathtaking. The camera work show how it must feel to surf one of these monsterous waves, and what it feels like to be crushed by one. There are a lot of 3rd person shots inside the waves that make me scratch my head and wonder how they did that. This is definately one of the reasons to see this movie.<br/><br/>The best surprise of the movie is that it may be along the lines of a typical sports story plot, it does not have the ending I predicted it would. And although there is a group of sexist male island boys who are very annoying (although their time in the film is short) the movie is not about the girl surfer beating them and proving that women are equal. In other words, this is not a giant, blatant, advertisement for female empowerment.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this film, the plot my not be the most original, but it has a surprise or two and works well. Plus, 20 foot tall waves, c'mon, how often do you see those everyday?"

I thought it would be horrible when I saw the movie posters and previews, but it far exceeded my expectations.  I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is because the characters and environments actually seem believable.  It's not just a movie about surfing - it's about how these 3 friends live in virtual poverty trying to support their other lives as part of this surfing subculture.  At the same time, the main character is trying to keep her little sister in school (since their mother abandoned them), and battle her own fears which center around a near-death experience she had while surfing in a major competition that keep her from moving on with her life.

It would be interesting to see a documentary on how they managed to film the surf scenes.  Of course, the Hawaii locale provides for beautiful scenery.  But it's one thing for a cinematographer to make you feel like your actually on the back of a motorcycle, and another to make you feel like your riding a surfboard on some large, nasty waves.<br/><br/>The audio FX and soundtrack, while both fitting and well-done, lack anything innovative.

The good news is this movie is much more than a 2-hour episode of Baywatch.<br/><br/>Yeah, there's plenty of hot chicks, but they aren't on a Sport Illustrated Swimsuit photoshoot here, they're serious surfers. The lead character, Anne-Marie, has some serious issues to deal with. In addition to overcoming the trama of nearly drowning in a surfing competition, she working for minimum-wage as a maid for a fancy Oahu hotel, and struggling to take care of her rebelious little sister and pay the bills. (It's kind of funny how this movie paralells Lilo and Stitch).<br/><br/>But who cares about the back story? This movie's about surfing, and surfing you will get. The camera work is great, you can almost feel the 20 foot waves crashing down on you. Don't listen to the people who say wait for the video, because your tv isn't going to portray the intensity and mass of the waves. If you're even somewhat interested in seeing it, you have to see it in the theater.<br/><br/>So while the non-surfing portions are pretty cliche and forgettable, the surfing is awesome, so at least see a matinee."

","Like a lot of people, I thought Blue Crush would be pretty putrid. It looked very similar to a Disney Channel Original Movie called Motocrossed, in which a girl tries to infiltrate the male-dominated sport of bike racing. I'm not saying Blue Crush ripped-off Disney. I just think it's funny that I've seen an entire DC Original Movie. Pray for me, my children. Anyway, it turns out that while light in story and character development, the stunning oceanic cinematography really saved the day here. I could watch those foaming, crushing waves all day, and some of the camera tricks were really creative. Whouda thunk? But we obviously can't spend ALL of our time out on the water, so there is a simple story here about a girl who used to be the greatest gal surfer on the beach, but after a near-drowning accident she's lost her spirit. Sound familiar, sports movie fans? She lives with two friends and her younger sister in the perfect beach bum shack, living from paycheck to paycheck by working as a maid in the nearby fancy hotel. There's a rich love interest, a sub-plot about the kid sister smoking, but none of it really goes anywhere. Everything really depends on the Big Surfing Contest at the end of the film, where if our heroine wins she will get all kinds of sponsorship and realize her dream of putting female surfing on the cover of every magazine. This inevitable showdown is really handled well, and I genuinely rooted for the girl as she tried to catch the perfect wave. My only problems revolve around the expend- able boyfriend and sister characters, who don't really do anything except spout out lines like, ""Belive in yourself. You can do it!"" I say spend more time on the three lead chicks or just take the surfing footage by itself and make an IMAX film. Now that would be cool. ***/**** P.S. I loved the fat football player. He was hilarious!"

If your a male in your teens, you'll find it fun with an optical sweetner (and the girls arent bad to look at either) and you guys from your 20's and up can appreciate the visuals and action. <br/><br/>It's a well paced film thats fun and visual. Actors are believable and the lead (forgot her name) is natural and comfortable in her portrayal and yes, has a certain something about her face and smile that are wholesome yet naturally beautiful. Will be interesting to see how she develops.<br/><br/>It's not a mind twister by any means yet it's not meant to be. A refreshing story with some colorful photography bathed in a grain of sand in life and friendship. Loved the water shots and though are plentyful, I just couldnt seem to get enough. Sappy or corny it surely isnt....fun and visually entertaining it is. Good job to all, my time was well spent.<br/><br/>

","Surfing is another planet and I loved the visit during Blue Crush. The Blonde in a Bikini wants to win the big surfing competition. She's competitive but inhibited by physical fear after a terrifying accident. She's distracted by family obligations and a Cinderella romance with a football Prince Charming. Will she take the easy out and let her mentor down or will she overcome? It's a heroine instead of a hero so the physical fear and the temptation to be validated by romance instead of accomplishment are culturally acceptable. The mentor is another young woman - probably the most original thing about the film - well played by Rodriguez. The setup is realistic in many ways. The bodacious surfer girls live in a dump and work as maids in a hotel. It is demeaning, tacky labor but so what? Their real life is ""laying pipe"" in that magnificent surf. The wave scenes are so beautiful and exciting they eclipse all the rest, including the loose ends and schlock humor in the script. <br/><br/>A final tribute: I never imagined living for something so trivial as catching a wave, now I get it."

","Could teen flick `Blue Crush' actually crush `Divine Secrets of the YA YA Sisterhood' by saying more about the need of young women to strike out on their own? Yes, a surfing movie with some weight easily glides over the lame `Ya Ya.'<br/><br/>John Stockwell, who directed the estimable `crazy/beautiful' last summer with Kirsten Dunst, once again shows a teenage girl as a developing adult when she could have been just an attractive blonde with only guys on her mind. Of course, both of his films have hunks, in this case an NFL quarterback, and, yes, the leads fall for them, but Stockwell never forgets the girls' basic goodness and their ability to work out their problems and dreams as many of our worthy daughters have had to do in their real lives.<br/><br/>The surfing sequences are impressive photographic gymnastics-you do feel you are piping with her as she glides inside the tube of a giant wave, although much of the time it is obviously not lead actress Kate Bosworth (the athletic equestrian from `The Horse Whisperer') negotiating that breaker. The reality of young girls working as housemaids to support their sport, including cleaning up vomit and condoms in rooms occupied by indelicate and wealthy men, is an authentic part of not just another Gidget doing beach-blanket bingo.<br/><br/>While this film has not much of the gritty adolescent angst of Stockwell's `crazy/beautiful,' it relies less than I anticipated on the physical attributes of the young women and much more on the challenges of becoming good at something other than `looking good.'"

It was also refreshing to see Sanoe Lake and the Chris Taloa (not typical Hollywood-looking actors) on te big screen-- even though I couldn't understand a word Taloa's character said.<br/><br/>Two complaints though-- 1) I could see the computer graphics effects in the surf scenes very plainly.  I mean, I don't know whether people care about that or not but I can tell you I wasn't even looking for it and noticed. 2) The surf scenes toward the end pale in comparison to the first one.

","** out of ****<br/><br/>Maybe it was just the fact I was in the mood for something lightweight and melodramatic, but I found myself oddly entertained by Blue Crush.  That's not to say I give it a strong or even cautious recommendation.  Hell, I'm not quite sure what to say, except that I found the cliched story mildly enjoyable and lead actress Kate Bosworth both quite pretty and talented.<br/><br/>Bosworth stars as Anne Marie, a hotel maid in Hawaii who lives with her two friends (Michelle Rodriguez and someone I don't recognize) and her younger sister, Penny (Mika Boorem).  In their spare time, she and her friends surf, particularly as practice for the upcoming ""big"" competition that you know is going to pad out the lengthy conclusion.  Anyway, complications arise when Anne Marie finds herself falling for a handsome pro football player (Matthew Davis) who's arrived for the pro bowl.  Which will she place above all else, her newfound boyfriend or the big surfing competition?<br/><br/>As far as lightweight entertainment goes, Blue Crush delivers just enough that you won't feel you've completely wasted almost two hours of your life. This is thanks mostly in part to Bosworth's performance, she's sympathetic and likeable, showing hints of a promising career.  Then there's Matthew Davis, who's shown he can deliver a good performance (Below, for instance) and is okay as the pro quarterback, but more importantly, he and Bosworth actually have some decent chemistry together.  <br/><br/>Most people consider the movie's anchor to be the surfing sequences.  Aside from a scene of horrible CGI, these setpieces are lovely to look at and shot quite well, but they are repetitive, and by the final competition, it just drags uncomfortably.  Amidst the story are the typical cliches, including a scene in a bathroom stall that you just know right from the get-go how it's going to pan out.  <br/><br/>Aside From Bosworth and Davis, the rest of the cast is serviceable at best. Michelle Rodriguez continues her ""angry chick"" acting and she's not very good at it, either.  Mika Boorem is a talented young actress, but there's nothing here to stretch her acting chops.  It's easy to see how Blue Crush became a minor box office hit.  The ""girl power"" story draws in the scores of teenage girls and the tantalizing promise of girls in bikinis will have the guys salivating.<br/><br/>All this comes at the expense of the portrayal of the men in the story, who are almost exclusively seen as hot-headed, rash, and uncleanly.  Only Davis shows some honorable qualities but even he is revealed to be a bit of a wild guy.  Still, complain as I might, Blue Crush did entertain me for most of its running time, and I guess that counts for something.  As Saturday night rental fare, this is a movie that should go down fairly easily."
"Pavel-8","5","1","2","5 April 2003"," Watchable.
","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>""Blue Crush"" takes the sports movie formula, throws in a cup of romance and a dash of family strife, and cooks up a movie that is watchable, but not really that good.  <br/><br/>The basic problem is that virtually nothing in the story is original.  While some sports movies can get away with that due to compelling characters or powerful performances (like ""Rocky"", of which this movie is reminiscent), ""Blue Crush"" is not one of those.  The characters and plot lines are cliche, and the actors, who don't have much to work with, are simply servicable. <br/><br/>
When the movie is on dry land, it plods.  None of the ashore scenes are very interesting; they merely fill time between surf sequences, for which I found myself impatiently waiting, without enhancing the driving storyline.<br/><br/>The visually arresting surfing scenes are indisputably the highlights of ""Blue Crush.""  Director John Stockwell put cameras just about everywhere in, around, and under the water.  Those innovative shots provide the best visuals of the movie, expertly and vividly portraying a you-are-there sensation of surfing.  The surf culture was explained well too, from the local thoughts of tourists to the comaraderie of the competitors.  The only problem with the surf scenes was that they sometimes felt pieced together (and they probably were), particularly during the announcer's voice-overs at the final contest.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: ""Blue Crush"" is the essence of a guilty pleasure movie.  Great photography, enjoyable surfing scenes, and girls in bikinis.  But the story makes half the movie drag.  5 of 10."

","When I saw the Planet of the Apes remake about a year ago I thought that it would be a log time until I saw a movie as pointless and as poorly written as that one.  Today I saw a movie that seemed as if it was written by apes. Instead of an actual movie it seems that the producers of Blue Crush have decided to give us a garble of scenes that have a vague relationship to one another.  The script is actually one scene of work with the lines cut and pasted in different order to give the illusion of an actual script.  For example, the line ""Dude you wasted a wave"" was repeated at least four times by the same character over the course of the movie.  The script wasn't the only thing that seemed cut and pasted.  The scenes themselves looked like the same images rehashed over and over ad infinitum and ad nauseam.<br/><br/>Blue Crush is a failure of a movie, the only two positive points that the movie gets is the nice visuals of the surfers (which get tired after you see the same ones 50 times) and the fact that it was under two hours.

","`Blue Crush' is about something new in the world of commercial sports: female surfers. Everything is popping up 'extreme' these days, and while female surfers are not new to the world at large, they are new to the pop landscape. `Blue Crush' takes this interesting idea and strands it in a pedestrian storyline with nice performances, passable special effects, and beautiful cinematography and stunt work.<br/><br/>Three friends living on Hawaii's North Shore are determined to make it big and be the first women on the cover of Surfing magazine. The best of the three, Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), recently wiped out and got sucked under, getting slammed into the razor-sharp coral reef. Since then, she has not been the same surfer. Right off the bat, we've moved into the valley of the banal.<br/><br/>She and her friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) work as maids at an upscale hotel. There Anne Marie meets and falls for Matt (Matthew Davis), an football player visiting the island with his team, which seems to be made up of a handful of African-American guys who try to give the movie 'flava' by yelling a lot and cramming a fat guy into a Speedo. Anne Marie gets fired after yelling at the Speedo boys for leaving used condoms lying around, and she begins to practice hard for a big upcoming surfing competition.<br/><br/>Bosworth, as Anne Marie, gives a nice little performance. All that is really required of the girls is to look good in bikinis (Rodriguez especially suffers playing an underwritten tough girl), but Bosworth comes up with a little more. We root for her because we genuinely like her, and it's Bosworth that makes this happen, not the script.<br/><br/>That script is a little paint-by-numbers deal, throwing in a little of everything but never focusing on one issue long enough to explore it. Anne Marie is looked down on by male surfers, Matt distracts her from her goal, money is tight among the girls, the island boys beat up Matt for being a mainlander and surfing in a private spot with Anne Marie...each little crisis is introduced and completed in about five minutes. No one has a person to play, just a collection of lines.<br/><br/>Which is unfortunate, because the cinematography (by David Hennings) and editing (by Emma Hickox) are nothing short of spectacular. You have never seen a surfing movie that looks like this (assuming you've ever seen a surfing movie). The camera goes above the water, under the water, inside the curls, and on the boards as it prowls the beach. The water is beautiful, and Hennings pulls off camera tricks no one has ever seen before. Digitally pasting the actress' faces over the women who did the actual surfing is sometimes fake and distracting, but the actresses seemed to do a lot of the surfing, and the women who filled in for the tough stuff did a great job. Hickox weaves it all together dazzlingly; this film is a joy to look at. It's too bad that listening to it is so painful.<br/><br/>This movie will no doubt entrance girls of all ages. While I can't recommend the movie based on the story, I can and will recommend the amazing visuals. It's just too bad that the real world of female surfers didn't get a movie that did them justice."

","I have always hated surfing and the whole shallow attitude that is usually attributed to surfers. For the most part this film proves what I have always said. Story takes place in Hawaii where we see three young women who get up early and surf. Then they head to their chambermaid jobs during the day and then head back to the beach. Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) was a championship quality surfer but suffered a bad spill and was injured. She has been trying to overcome the trauma of that and challenge in the big surfing contest next week. Her roommates Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) try to encourage her and help her get back in shape. Anne Marie also takes care of her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem) but she is becoming rebellious and hanging out with the wrong sort. One day Anne Marie meets a pro football player named Matt (Matthew Davis) and gives him surfing lessons but they quickly become a couple. Anne Marie doesn't know how deep his feelings are and she doesn't want to end up being just another quick fling for a jock. <br/><br/>This film was directed by John Stockwell who has slowly developed into a pretty good filmmaker and this is a good looking film. Its technically well made and the performances by Bosworth and Rodriguez are earnest but they're just is not a shred of character development. Yes, we know Anne Marie's mother has bailed out and she also suffered from a wipe-out but all the other characters just seem to be there to  serve her. Bosworth's character talks of never wanting to go to college but later she moans of having a hard time paying her bills. What does she expect? Of course this is a fable meant for a younger (And less tasteful) audience and teenagers seem to be the target. The plot and characters are so very predictable that when the film ended there was absolutely no surprises. Pretty much what you think is going to happen does! Most of these characters are so dumb and obnoxious that it becomes impossible to be interested in them. Why were those local boys always barking orders at Anne Marie? Who are they to tell anyone what to do? It was ridiculous toward the end of the film when those same Neanderthals were rooting her on during the competition. Are we suppose to forget they're violent behavior during the film and think that they're really decent people? I didn't and you can't help but think that they're the biggest losers on the planet. In fact, I couldn't help but feel sorry for all the characters that live to surf. What a waste of time and life and too bad that none of these people are able to have any type of a life. This film is only for people(!) that love surfing. Anyone that has read one book in their life and has more than two working brain cells should be warned!"

","Blue Crush is one of the worst movies ever made. The story was terrible and unoriginal. I also find it ironic that this was a movie  about how girls can beat guys at their own game, but yet in real life, while filming this movie, they had to get guys to surf the bigger waves because the girls couldn't handle it. This is an MTV, teeniebopper, Britanny Spears type of film, so if you are an airhead in between the ages of 12-24, you will like the film. I give this movie an overall rating of -3 out of 10."

I was astonished at the sheer brazen quality of the screenplay writer and her ability to blatantly place so many overused and predictable cliches in only one script.

","""Blue Crush"" was not based upon a novel, a short story or a play but upon a non-fiction journalistic article (""Life's Swell"" by Susan Orlean). This is not an unprecedented phenomenon- ""Saturday Night Fever"", for example, was also based upon such an article- but it is nevertheless an unusual one. Non-fiction is a highly important part of the publishing and broadcasting industries, but the same is not true of the cinema. There have been occasional exceptions (""March of the Penguins"" being a recent one), but in general film-makers have taken the position that documentaries are something best left to television. So, despite its provenance, the story told in this film is a fictitious one. (As, of course, is the story told in ""Saturday Night Fever"").<br/><br/>The film's surfing sequences have been much praised, and rightly so. Like most Britons I have never tried surfing- weather conditions here are hardly conducive to it- but the exhilarating sequences in this film capture something of the sport's excitement and beauty and go some way towards explaining just why its devotees can get so fanatical about it. You cannot, however, make an entire feature film out of surfing sequences alone. (Well, you probably could, but you would have difficulty getting it shown anywhere except for a few art-house cinemas). So the film-makers had to come up with some sort of storyline to fit around them.<br/><br/>What they came up with is a sort of double love story, ""girl loves boy"" plus ""girl loves surfing"". The main character, Anne Marie, is a young woman living in Hawaii where she works as a hotel chambermaid. Her great ambition is to be a champion surfer and the film explores the story of how she fares when she enters a prestigious surfing competition, with a subplot about the progress of the relationship between Anne Marie and her boyfriend Matt, a professional footballer whom she meets while he is staying in her hotel.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this plot is banal and uninteresting. It doesn't help that Kate Bosworth, who plays Anne Marie, gives such a poor performance; she mumbles so much that I had difficulty understanding a lot of what she is saying. The rest of the cast are not much better, except perhaps Matthew Davis as Matt; he may not be a great actor, but at least he speaks clearly and distinctly. Yet beneath the bland, feelgood plot there are hints of something deeper and more interesting struggling to get out. We hear of two traumatic events in Anne Marie's past, of how she nearly drowned during a previous competition and as a result abandoned the sport temporarily, and of how she was abandoned by her mother who ran off with a boyfriend. As a result Anne Marie has been forced to care for her younger sister Penny herself, with some help from her friends Eden and Lena. (Don't they have children's services in Hawaii?)<br/><br/>The trouble is that we merely hear about these events in retrospect. It might have been if they had actually been shown to us, possibly in flashback, which would have given us a more rounded picture of Anne Marie's personality and the forces which produced it. This would have made for a more interesting film, a story of a woman's triumph over adversity rather than a standard love story against a sporting background. Such a film would probably have needed a more accomplished actress than Bosworth in the main role, but it might have been more rewarding. 5/10. (3/10 for the film itself, with two bonus points for the surf scenes)."

","This was a very formulaic athletic/sports movie which hews closely to all of the genre's conventions. That said, however, it is all done pretty well. There were no real false notes on the acting, which means that the script had to be pretty decent, as even great actors can rarely overcome bad dialog. Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sanoe Lake also all looked very nice in swimwear. The cinematography had to be very challenging and looked great, even though surfing footage can be a bit monotonous, going all the way back to ""Endless Summer"". Interesting portrayal of the surf spots where a hundred or more surfers are competing for waves. There were some annoying rap ""songs"" on the soundtrack which detracted from the movie a bit."

","""Blue Crush"" is a movie which has to do with a girl who tries to get on with her live and prepare herself for the Pipe Masters surf competition, the biggest competition of surf. She tries to get over some other things that happened in her life and she wants to fulfill her dream of becoming number one in surf and win the Pipe Masters surf competition.<br/><br/>I think that ""Blue Crush"" is a movie with which you can spend your time and nothing more than that. Although I liked the plot of this movie and it reminded me another movie about surfing the ""Soul Surfer"" (based on the true story of Bethany Hamilton) which I liked more than this.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that with this movie you can understand how a surfer feels and you can also understand how difficult is surfing."

","Some sports movies are about sports (Remember the Titans) some are about the people who play them (Girl Fight). Blue Crush makes a huge mistake of choosing the latter approach, and it asks the viewer to invest in a handful of characters who are largely under fleshed, and never amount to much more than bodies in bikini's or shorts. The story is choppy and lacks fluidity, resulting in rushed characterization, a lack of explanation, and worst of all, The movie is not very exiting.<br/><br/>Blue Crush's sole effectiveness, is that director John Stockwell has designed some phenomenal shots. He is able to work the camera behind the waves, below them or up atop them, sometimes onto the surfboard itself. Blue Crush may have some effectiveness as a sea spectacle but it is a superficial one. It's a flimsy story about flimsy people, frequently predictable. Offering a few laughs and few smiles, in an otherwise bland motion picture."

","I think it is obvious why most boys will watch this film, but there is a good theme to be seen too, so I decided to try it and see which I'd be paying more attention to, and the conclusion, both. Basically, set in luxury Hawaii, Anne Marie Chadwick (Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth) is a surfing enthusiast, along with her friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake). The days are counting down to the Pipe Masters surf competition, and Anne Marie is determined to conquer the waves that she had an incident on last time she tried two years ago. Her practising and determination for this competition are being distracted by both her young Penny (Mika Boorem) she has to look after, and her falling for professional quarterback Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis). But when it does come to the day of the competition, determination hasn't changed one bit, and she is willing to do it both for her Penny, her friends and Matt together. She may not have got through the full competition and won, but she still got high praise and her photo on the cover of a surfing magazine. Also starring Chris Taloa as Drew, Kala Alexander as Kala and Ruben Tejada as J.J. The surfing and ocean sequences are brilliantly shot, and of course the boys (me included) will enjoy the sight of three great looking girls in bikinis, so an enjoyable romantic (water) sports drama. Worth watching!"

","There are two movies here, and only one of them is really worth seeing.<br/><br/>The first one is a predictable ""overcoming your fears"" story, which, as usual, focuses on the least interesting but most WASP-y character. Nothing to offensive there except how dull she was. Why didn't they focus on Sanoe Lake's character, who was WAY less insipid? The second movie was a about water. And waves. And figuring out how to convince them to let you ride them without dying. Whoever filmed the water sequences should go to heaven on this film alone- it's beautiful and terrifying. I was on the edge of my seat with every wave. Perfect.<br/><br/>I'm a super n00b surfer and learned at a women-friendly break. I didn't realize how unusual that was. My favorite part of the ""above water"" part of this movie is when Kennelly coaches and cheer leads her competitor onto a perfect wave. When I've surfed with women it's really like that. When I finally caught a wave, every women there cheered.<br/><br/>It was great to see this camaraderie in a film.<br/><br/>And to anyone worrying about this film being nothing but titillation, it isn't. Yes, they're in bikinis. If you've been to Hawaii you know that's what people wear on the beach, even people you might wish didn't. There was nothing salacious, even when they could have gotten away with it in the plot. (Think of all the wet bikini shots they missed by having Bosworth wear a rash guard!) It was a very modest film. The T&A emphasis the previous reviewers remarked upon came from their brains, and not from the film."

","When I was at Wal Mart a few weeks ago, I saw a DVD that had three movies in it for 10 bucks, Blue Crush happened to be one of them, so I figured to go ahead and see the film, I mean, decent price, the movie might be worth a look. So I watched Blue Crush last night and I have to say that when I remembered seeing the trailer for Blue Crush when it first came out and it looked like the most lame thing ever, I was 17 years old at the time, so watching this now, it was better than what I expected. But still, it was nothing special, it was like one of those movies that you see once, and you're happy with seeing it that one time. It has fun sports, hot actors(that really can't act), and a decent story that's worth a look, even if it is a little too much of a chick flick at times.<br/><br/>Anne Marie is a young girl in Hawaii who lives with two other friends and her little sister. Her mother ran away and left her with all the responsibilities of being an adult. Anne Marie is also a competitive surfer and kicks butt on the waves, so much so, that her room mate, Eden, wants her to compete in the pipe line contest, which is extremely dangerous and Anne Marie has a fear off since she almost died from a wipe out when she was a little girl. A hot tourist, Matt, distracts her and has a steamy affair with him, she forgets who she is and has to get back on track in order for her dreams to come true.<br/><br/>Blue Crush is a cute movie and has an uplifting and positive message to go the distance and make your dreams come true. Sounds cheesy, but I think young girls need more movies like Blue Crush, it's cool for the tween crowd. As an adult, like I said, it's average, but it was a decent film. There's nothing terribly wrong with the film, there are a few unbelievable things and it's a little predictable, the acting is alright, but it's all good, it's just a cute film. Blue Crush is worth a look if you're looking for a sport type of film, but for me, that's all that I'm going to have of the film.<br/><br/>5/10"

","While it has some good acting, the storyline to BLUE CRUSH is the worst ever to be put to the big screens. The ""why in the world did Universal studios take this one up"" leaves you with more questions than answers. Teen championship surfer-chick Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), who is gang leader to a threesome of other surfer-chicks, was a 'pro-circuit' surfer until three years ago when she had a near death accident with some coral while surfing. She finds a kindred spirit in footballer Matt (Matthew Davis), loses some good friends over basically nothing and finally decides to take up the pro-circuit again. Everyone makes up and the story ends with some crappy music. When the producers were putting this one together, they were either so drunk that they were just short of passing out, or they hoped that with some good acting and a few sex scenes they could take emphasis from the abysmal plot and character development. Although I think this one would be better off on the cutting room floor, it has some good values. With strong friendships, peer pressure, living-out dreams and how to dispose of condoms it should get people through the 104 minute production that left all in tears of boredom. Director John Stockwell tires to make it a movie that would bring teens in from all over the world. But as the old saying goes, ""Second rate articles in second rate magazines turn into second rate movies""."

Dominated by trash talking burnouts, baby mamas and tattooed hoochies. People with something to prove, even if the viewer couldn't care less.

On that note after seeing ""Blue Crush"" I really enjoyed it. I especially liked that the used real surfer's (Lena & Drew) to help create the movie, in the end I think that helped it out quite a lot. I came to have some major respect for surfers after watching it, as well. That is far from being an easy sport, and you have to be in tip top shape to do it, I'm sure. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a shot. The worst that can happen is that you don't like it."

","My favorite line of the movie was ""hey, you're that quarterback.""  That sums up the movie.  Generic plot and acting.  The surf scenes are nice though and there are some funny scenes of a big fat guy who thinks he's an offensive lineman.  Worth the price of a $2 ticket at the discount cinema if you just want to get out of the house and if you've seen all the other movies at the discount cinema."

","The best and truest thing about `Blue Crush' is that the Hawaii surf girls in it are working class girls.  They're not just pretty girls off on a spree, much less middle class boys with endless amounts of time to pursue the perfect wave in the endless summer.  They have to clean up gross, trashed suites inhabited by pro football players in a luxury hotel on Oahu and take care of their wayward little sisters because their mom has run off, and they have to grab extra minutes to train in the small hours.<br/><br/>All the scenes that illustrate this working class aspect of Anne Marie and Eden and Lena and Kala's and Anne Marie's little sister Penny's life are fresh.<br/><br/>The movie also delineates the difference between haoles and locals:  it shows Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis II), Anne Marie's pro footballer temporary boyfriend, getting a beating when she takes him surfing on locals' wave turf, which is something that happens in real life.  A haole can get killed for that.  Sanoe Lake (with a Hawaiian surf champion mother) and Mika Boorem and Kala Alexander are pretty close to what they're supposed to be and they play really well and naturally together.  The scenes between them are fun, whether working at the hotel, or on the beach or at their hutch.  Michelle Rodriguez (of `Girlfight') is girl no. 2, Anne Marie's goad and coach, some would say a stronger, more charismatic person than Kate Bosworth. Rodriguez's relentless feistiness can be grating, but still it's easy to believe that she ought to be in the Pipeline competition along with Anne Marie and she has an impressive dignity, not to mention beauty, about the way she holds herself.<br/><br/>The subject of class is further developed by showing a little bit more about the pro footballers the girls run into at the hotel.  Matt Davis as the quarterback boyfriend has hunk charisma and a sweet face, a mean combination.  Good casting isn't quite enough to make this a great movie, though.  It has social awareness and authentic atmosphere, but all the nice surfer bods and the hairiest Pipeline waves can't make `Blue Crush' different from an average surfer movie climaxing in a competition.<br/><br/>The best surfing action adventure fiction movie is the 1991 `Point Break,' which was made by a woman, Kathryn Bigalow (whose `Near Dark' is another classic in another underdog genre, the vampire movie).  `Point Break' gets away from the clichÃ© of competition and gets deeper into surfing's mystique than any of the documentaries.  Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and his pals are surfing gurus and romantic outlaws so charismatic that the cop (a strong, wide awake Keanu Reeves) lets Bodhi surf to his doom rather than have to face jail.  Every one of Bodhi's crew is sharply individualized - always a good sign.  Surfers don't just chase the perfect wave and get inside a tube; they seek Nirvana and they vanquish their inner demons or die trying, and death is no idle threat in this sport.  `Point Break' gets at all that and takes us on a wild ride full of surprises.  It's arguably the most original and best action movie of the Nineties.  And naturally the surf photography in `Point Break' is as grand and as beautiful as any on film: it focuses on the huge openness of the sea and doesn't get too hung up on waves. This movie is about boldness.  The scenes of the girl teaching a cocky, athletic guy to surf are the same thing `Blue Crush' tries to do - much less memorably.<br/><br/>The girls in `Blue Crush' talk a lot about big balls, and they don't mean beach balls.  But there's precious little about the mystique of surfing in the movie, and no moments that strongly capture what it's like to go out there and meet the challenge. Why does Anne Marie, who's the movie's heroine after all, wimp out so much?  Well, because she nearly drowned in an earlier competition.  But we don't really so much see her conquer her fear and live 24/7 the life of an adrenalin junky (a given of all the surfing life in `Point Break') as get pushed to a good performance and a pro contract by the encouragement of a more seasoned fellow competitor from Australia, real life woman surf champion Kate Skarrett.  There are other great women surfers who appear in the movie and they've got the balls they're talking about, no question about it.  But they wind up being the usual window dressing.<br/><br/>The affair with the quarterback is left dangling. `Blue Crush' is good fun, and it's an appealing introduction to the too much overshadowed world of women's surfing, but it hasn't much of a payoff or a truly interesting plot, and the surfing sequences have been accused of too much digitalizing. Another example of a sports movie with women that goes deeper (way deeper) into interesting plot territory while handling its athletic world (track) with exceptional integrity is `Personal Best' (which some think Mariel Hemingway's one essential performance) - but then that was written and directed by Robert Towne (of ""Chinatown""), who's about as good a writer as Hollywood's got.  John Stockwell, who directed this one, has had a somewhat checkered career as actor and writer (he wrote the screenplay for `Rock Star,' which starred Mark Wahlberg, and he's just directed `Crazy/Beautiful' with Kirsten Dunst), isn't on the level of Towne and Bigelow."

","This movie wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be.  Actually, I think it would have been pretty good had they actually hired professional actors. Michelle Rodriguez did okay, but everyone else was horrible.  The story was pretty predictable too.  The cinematography was excellent.  I especially liked the shot where they were running underwater and the shots inside the wave.  It's a decent movie to watch at home on one of the movie channels."
"der_mann","2","0","2","25 August 2002"," Edge of your seat boredom
","I like almost every movie I see, and I'm normally not that picky at all, but this movie takes the cake.  The previews lead one to believe that it's full of action - i.e. surfing, fighting, perhaps a little sex thrown in - but what is actually in the movie?  There is surfing, and a boring fight scene (I admit that that might just be realism instead of the typical Hollywood depiction of fighting), and yes, lots of bikinis, but there is also an incredibly slow development of a love story between Anne Marie and the quarterback.  Who really cares?  I mean, it's not even interesting, and it doesn't resolve any of the problems brought up anyways.  When it comes down to it, this movie was an hour too long.  When it tried to do what the previews promised, it did it well.  The surf scenes have some excellent camera work, and there are plenty of bikinis for all of the men out there. The problems occurred when the movie strayed away from this great formula and into the realm of smarmy romance, and unbelievable relationships between a maid and a football star."

","Very few movies come along with the sensitivity and insight of ""Blue Crush,"" a film that succeeds on many levels.  It's a rare and realistic look at a life style that is not at all well understood by the general public, played against the backdrop of a difficult surfing competition.<br/><br/>There's no more beautiful place on Earth than Hawaii with its fine climate, awesome geography and wonderful people.<br/><br/>Director John Stockwell captures the spirit of Aloha while at the same time brilliantly reflecting the complexities of human relationships.<br/><br/>It's a movie that transcends gender differences, although it is a reflection of today's woman: gutsy, empowered and dynamic.<br/><br/>It's beautifully photographed and executed.<br/><br/>Thank you for this wonderful gift of a film.  Enjoy it, everyone as you marvel at what the search for beauty can bring, and how it can be paved with bumps and dilemmas along the way.<br/><br/>I'm proud of the cast's performances, especially Sanoe Lake, who seems to have it all just right.<br/><br/>It's great to be stoked about life.  Get out there and start living: it's all so temporary!"

","Dude this movie was amazing!  I'm glad that it was a movie showing the way female surfers really are, and not the usual blonde airhead type! If you love surfing, I recommend you see this movie!  You will not be dissapointed!"
"Watcher-37","5","0","1","18 August 2002"," Could've been better, but no offense to filmdom
","The Cinematography was fantastic! The storyline was way pedestrian. The romance with the quarterback was laughable. The actor in no way resembled a professional athlete. I loved the surfing scenes, and wish there had been more of them. Certainly better than 1998's In God's Hands, but this isn't one you have to run out to the theater to see. The four females in the cast were exceptionally appealing but really could have used a better script."

","Should be blew, because that's pretty much my interpretation of this movie. The visuals are indeed stunning, the landscape and the ocean beautiful. But that was the only thing that kept me going through this movie.<br/><br/>There's really nothing here in the way of the essentials of film (plot, characters, dialogue) Certain shots ( I won't say which, because that would destroy the movie, and unless you're looking for it, you probably won't even notice) should have been redone, as they look horribly processed on a blue-screen.<br/><br/>plot = ***/***** could have been more tightly compacted, or a new angle in the surfing competition (like a female arch-rival)<br/><br/>characters = **/***** gah! the characters don't really go anywhere. there's no character arc.<br/><br/>dialogue = **/***** the lines are unremarkable, unimpressionable. There's nothing in this film by way of dialogue that will become a new teen catchprase.<br/><br/>But Hawaii is stunning, it's spectacular glory is captured perfectly in scenes that allow a wider camera angle to see the shore, the water, the landscape of the island. Some surfing scenes are great. But it's overdone, even in a film that has to be surfing. There should have been more comedic antics, (although a tie-in with a football game in Hawaii in February provides this in one respect)<br/><br/>cinematography = ****/*****<br/><br/>I could be the wrong person to comment on this film, and I'm sure there are many people who will enjoy it. I found that it dragged on for an unrelenting hour and forty-five minutes, about 20-30 minutes too much.<br/><br/>
Go see it if: You're female, you're into surfing, You enjoy water.<br/><br/>enjoyablilty = **/*****"
