"Bertaut","6","350","440","7 September 2018"," Aesthetically perfect, narratively frustrating
","Reading around some of the reviews of Zimna wojna, I recognise that this should have been a film I liked, loved even, as so much of what these critics are praising are exactly the kinds of things I myself often look for in a film. It's one of the best reviewed films of the year, and I freely acknowledge there's a huge amount to praise here, with elements of the visual design borderline genius. However, all the aesthetic brilliance in the world doesn't hide what, for me, is its single greatest flaw - it just left me utterly cold; I didn't care about the two main characters, and I didn't buy their relationship. Yes, I'm aware that emotional detachment is exactly what it was going for, and it's probably unfair to criticise a film for successfully doing what it intended to do, but when it ended, all I could think was ""meh."" Although, to be fair, that may say more about myself than the film.<br/><br/>Written by <a href=""/name/nm0667734/"">Pawel Pawlikowski</a>, <a href=""/name/nm0323196/"">Janusz Glowacki</a>, and <a href=""/name/nm2819873/"">Piotr Borkowski</a>, and directed by Pawlikowski, who loosely based the story on events in his parents' lives, the plot of Zimna wojna is simplicity itself. The film begins in 1949, two years since a communist government came to power and the country was provisionally renamed Rzeczpospolita ludowa (Polish People's Republic). It opens with composer and pianist Wiktor (<a href=""/name/nm1682799/"">Tomasz Kot</a>), his ethnomusicologist producer Irena (<a href=""/name/nm0474492/"">Agata Kulesza</a>), and rigid state-sponsored overseer Kaczmarek (<a href=""/name/nm0844371/"">Borys Szyc</a>) travelling through the isolated rural communities of the Polish countryside, recording folk songs and attempting to find recruits for a folk music school, with the aim of putting together an ensemble to perform nationally, and hopefully, internationally. Wiktor is bored out of his mind with the repetitive nature of the work, until a young woman named Zula (an extraordinary <a href=""/name/nm2251846/"">Joanna Kulig</a>) comes to the school to audition. Although she doesn't fit the profile of what they are looking for - she's from the city rather than the countryside, is rumoured to have spent time in prison for killing her father, and performs not a folk song at her audition, but a piece from a Soviet film - and although Irena points out there are better singers, Wiktor argues that she has ""something different."" Irena, who may or may not be in love with Wiktor, immediately recognises that he's enamoured with Zula, but he assures her he's acting out of pure professionalism. Of course, he isn't, and soon enough, he and Zula are in the midst of a passionate relationship. The rest of the film takes place over 20 years and four countries (Poland, France, Yugoslavia, and East Germany), but it never branches out from the central relationship. There are no subplots or significant supporting characters; the narrative is pared down to within an inch of its life, with every scene, every line of dialogue, every action, existing only in relation to this focal driving force.<br/><br/>So, to look first at some aspects of the film which I liked. The aesthetic is absolutely unparalleled, as Pawlikowski and director of photography <a href=""/name/nm2617994/"">Lukasz Zal</a> allow the visual design to both originate from and convey thematic points, a truly extraordinary example of form and content blending into one another. As an example, the film is exquisitely shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), which has the effect of confining the characters within the frame. The nature of the film lends itself to sweeping vistas and cityscapes captured in anamorphic (2.39:1), but, instead, Pawlikowski and Zal use the box-like nature of the Academy frame to trap the characters, meaning they don't seem free even when standing in the vast open countryside or in Paris at night. The epic nature of the narrative and the confined frame work in a kind of ironic symbiosis to visually convey the important theme of the tensions within and between the characters; freedom and confinement constantly working against one another.<br/><br/>Another example of the synergy between form and content is the use of focus. For example, in the opening scene, the shallow focus creates a depth of field so small that the village just behind the in-focus singers is completely flattened. This renders it visually inaccessible, and thus compels the audience to concentrate fully on nothing except the foreground singers. Compare this with the scene where Kaczmarek is giving a speech extolling the glory of the state and the prestige of the school to a collection of bored students, all the while a cow is wandering around in the mud behind him. The use of a deeper focus here than in the opening means that the cow falls within the larger depth of field, and can be clearly seen, once again directing the audience's attention, only this time that attention is directed away from the foreground character as opposed towards him. The cow, obviously enough, serves as a commentary, telling us exactly what Pawlikowski thinks of Kaczmarek's speech, and the ideologies underpinning it.<br/><br/>Another scene of this ilk is when a worker is attempting to hang a ""We welcome tomorrow"" banner on the front of the music school, under directions from Kaczmarek. However, falling from his ladder (and by the sounds of it, falling to his death), the banner is never hung, hanging limply across one side of the building. Again, as with the cow, this is Pawlikowski criticising the state-sanctioned machinery introduced by the Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza (Polish United Workers' Party) since 1948. Of course, the communists are not ""welcoming tomorrow"" - they are far more interested in the past, which is why they are collecting folk songs; in an effort to create a Politburo-approved musical tradition designed to instil both national pride and political conformity, by rejecting the ""western"" rock & roll music of tomorrow in favour of a musical past.<br/><br/>Speaking of music, in relation to the way the opening scene is shot, it instantly becomes clear how vital a part of the story music and singing are. As the narrative develops, music becomes Wiktor and Zula's everything - they derive hope from it, they imbue it with their feelings, it brings them together, it drives them apart, it even comes to symbolise the strange bond between them, never moreso than when Wiktor refers to an album on which they have been collaborating as ""our child.""<br/><br/>Another structural aspect that is exceptionally well handled is how Pawlikowski designs the time jumps, as the film skips forward to the next instalment in the story. When a sequence is finished, the film cuts to black, and then, using a variation of a J cut, the sound from the next scene can be heard a few seconds prior to the image being seen. Furthermore, that sound is usually music, reemphasising just how important music is to these characters. Interestingly however, the last few time jumps don't use music to introduce the incoming scene, perhaps referring to the changes in the characters' circumstances at this stage of the film, the darker ideological underpinnings of their psyches. In relation to this, it's also worth pointing out that once we get to the second half of the film, the two leads almost never smile (not that they smiled that much in the first half). Ironically enough, the character who smiles the most is probably Kaczmarek.<br/><br/>So, having spent all this time waxing lyrical about aspects of the film which impressed me, why did I not enjoy it? As I said above, there's a huge amount to admire here, the craft is exceptional, but, at the end of the day, this is a romance. And it doesn't work as a romance. Yes, it's not what you would call a standard romance by any means, the character motivations and justifications that you'd see in other narratives of this ilk (not just filmic texts) are absent here, and maybe because of that, although there was undeniable chemistry between the leads, I just didn't buy their seemingly insatiable compulsion to seek one another out, sleep together, hurt one another, and then split up. The problem is, this exact template happens about five times - they meet, have a great time for a while, argue over something, and one runs off. Wash, rinse, repeat. And even at only 85 minutes, this kind of structural repetition becomes, well, repetitive, as I increasingly found myself asking ""why are these two even together?""<br/><br/>To give you an example of what I'm talking about, during one particular argument, after Zula finds out Wiktor has been lying to people about her background, he explains, ""I wanted to give you more colour"". Seriously? These are two people who have precious little respect for one another; beneath all the eroticism and physical attraction, they are simply two irreparably damaged people trying to save one another, living with a co-dependency, but instead hastening each other towards destruction. And as I couldn't buy into the believability of the romance, the entire enterprise floundered; it never achieves the status it seems to be aiming for, that of cathartic high-tragedy. And although the end is very well done, and the last line is spectacular, it left me unmoved, because, by that stage, I just didn't care. True, the structure of the film and the insanely tight editing means that events in their lives are glanced at rather than lingered over, so the kind of nuances and character beats you'd often expect are absent, with the audience being allocated no time to become enveloped by the emotions on screen. As the narrative is built on ellipses and omissions, many (in fact, almost all) of the standard romantic tropes simply aren't present. By design, the film is barren and emotionally impenetrable, and in that sense, Pawlikowski seems to have been attempting to construct as detached a narrative as he possibly could. If anything, he succeeds too well."
"asifahsankhan","9","144","185","25 June 2018"," A beautifully composed poem of doomed love in Cold War Europe
","Less is most definitely more in Cold War. Using the same academy ratio and frosty black and white from the Oscar-winning Ida, the Polish auteur's new film tells the tale of a tragic romance between a musician and a singer, spanning fifteen years and the fractured continent of post-war Europe. We first see Wictor (Tomasz Kot) in the depths of a Polish winter in 1949, as he and fellow musicologist Irena (Agata Kulesza) putter around the frozen landscape in a truck, recording folk music wherever they find it.<br/><br/>Along with administrative bureaucrat Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc), a school is set up to harvest young talent and create an ensemble to celebrate Polish musical culture and tradition. Competition is fierce but one candidate catches Wictor's eye, a young blonde student called Zula (Joanna Kulig). She's ambitious and sly and it's rumoured she killed her father: 'He mistook me for my mother and I used a knife to show him the difference'. Wictor falls hard and, despite the dangers inherent in the situation and the fact that Zula might even be informing on him, a love affair begins.<br/><br/>As concerts are given and the school proves its value, so the state intervenes and folk music gives way to propaganda, with songs about the joys of agricultural reform and the wonder of Stalin. The group also tours abroad to export a vision of peasant authenticity and associated Soviet values. At this point, Wictor decides he's had enough and plans to use a trip to Berlin to cross with Zula to freedom and the West. Zula, however, uncertain and afraid, misses her chance and Wictor crosses alone.<br/><br/>So their love affair becomes as fractured as Europe, but crucially their serial separations are caused as much by their own decisions as by any external political forces. Zula's lack of courage is one such moment, but she also tells Wictor: 'I would never have crossed without you'. Pawlikowski has structured his film in a series of economic scenes, separated by fade-to-black lacunas where years pass, unseen and mute, and opportunities are irredeemably lost. Lukasz Zal's simply sublime cinematography now replaces the snowy tones of Poland for the cigarette-smoke greys, nightclub dark and sharp neon whites of Paris. The music also evolves from folk to propaganda and then to jazz and a quick burst of drunken rock n' roll. Later, it will find an atrocious denouement in the kind of 'Boom-Boody-Boom' Eurotrash, giving the sense that the world has moved an insuperable distance from Wictor and Zula's beginnings.<br/><br/>Wictor and Zula are both played with aplomb by Kot and Kulig, neither falling into the stereotypes that others would have them be. Despite his garret flat, he's not the tortured artist and, for all the damage done, she's no simple femme fatale. They are flawed and wilful - liable to jealousy and a free hand with the booze - but their mistakes are punished disproportionately and therefore unjustly. The borders might separate them, but they also imbue their love with a stoic tragic heroism. Pawlikowski's Cold War is dedicated to his parents, on whose love affair it is loosely based. It is an appropriately beautiful and sympathetic tribute. This is the refined work of an artist at the peak of his powers. A true masterpiece."
"cguldal","6","85","118","9 January 2019"," Another romanticized dysfunctional relationship
","Stunningly filmed with two actors who're very nice to look at and some great (and some purposefully, humorously cringe-worthy) music. Yet, it is hard to feel for the characters, one an almost-alcoholic, self-destructive woman who doesn't think much of herself, and the other, a stupidly loyal man. It's not clear, especially when they meet in France, what they have together that keeps them in love. There seem to be real problems, but we only glimpse at them without much development. It's baffling that he'd leave his freedom and risk being captured and tortured to go back to Poland just for her. The love they so value is not well developed, we do not see it really form and bond them. We see some lust, some physicality, and a lot of betrayal (on her part). The ending will frustrate many people. Comes a bit out of the blue. Why not continue to ruin each other's lives? Sadly, this is a film where form dazzles, but content leaves much to be desired."
"mageh","6","68","95","22 December 2018"," Beautiful to watch but lacks in story telling or connection
","I agree with many reviewers here. It is beautiful cinematography, but the story is loose and doesn't make sense or engage you enough. It left me cold and more than that, the female was really irritating.
I understand what the director was trying to say: i came from that region too, but some story lines don't make sense. As patriotic as you can feel, you don't choose communistic Poland or any communist country over amazing Paris (especially when you are an artist) AND leave your soulmate behind. That is why many people were trying to escape. May be she was nostalgic or couldn't connect emotionally to French culture, as an artist? It is not very clear from the script.
In overall, she was pictured as spoiled selfish ""femme fatale"" that ruined their chance for happiness while he has weak personality, that sacrifices his life and freedom for ungrateful partner. May be this is unconditional love? I didn't find her attractive either for some reason, while he fits the part better. For me, unlike Ida that was amazing, this is only 6/10."
"markgorman","10","119","175","4 September 2018"," Completely engrossing and stunningly beautiful. An arthouse masterpiece.
","The first thing to state about this beautiful movie is that it's monochrome. So stunningly so that at times you feel you are in a photographic gallery rather than a cinema. The quality of the cinematography is quite extraordinary thanks to Lucas Zal.<br/><br/>It's also in 4:3 format. Not the square format of Instagram, but close.<br/><br/>We don't see 4:3 very often these days but Wes Anderson used it to immense effect in Grand Budapest Hotel and so did Lazslo Melis in Son of Saul.<br/><br/>It's an engaging format that draws you in. It suggests a time before cinemascope (16:9 etc) and only really works in period cinema of a time. <br/><br/>This time. <br/><br/>But it also lends itself to incredible framing, such as when our female protagonist floats down a river gradually disappearing out of shot, and later in the movie when the chief protagonists leave a bus and walk out of frame in a composition that Henri Cartier Breson would be proud of.<br/><br/>It's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in many years.<br/><br/>In truth that's probably its biggest strength.<br/><br/>It is, but it isn't really, narrative driven. More episodic than story driven but it does tell a tale about director Pawel Pawlikowski's parents' love affair set against the Cold War backdrop in his native Poland.<br/><br/>It's fairly sordid in a way (his mother was abused by her father as a child) but without anything shocking to see.<br/><br/>Imagine, yes.<br/><br/>The two leads ( Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot) are magnificent. Brooding, beautiful (although unconventionally so) and real.<br/><br/>Lucas Zal has a great time dwelling on three particular things. Crowd shots. Amazing, Dance sequences. Amazing. Joanna Kulig (the lead). Amazing.<br/><br/>In particular, Joanna Kulig has a stand out performance. She's not one to show her enjoyment in life. Sullen most would say. But it is an immense performance.<br/><br/>It's a love story, set against the challenges that Cold War Poland put in front of people of artistic belief where communist doctrine made creativity very difficult.<br/><br/>What Pawel Pawlikowski achieves is a mood piece of exemplary, peerless really, detail.<br/><br/>And it's a musical. <br/><br/>I was constantly drawn to comparing it to La La Land, yet it is so NOT La La Land. Partly it's down to Kulig who shares the unorthodox looks (beauty) of Emma Stone. Partly it's the framing of Zal.<br/><br/>And the music fuses from Polish country folk to French basement jazz (which La La Land would have been so comfortable with).<br/><br/>This is an Oscar nomination shoe in. It's absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>And, at 88 minutes, certainly does not outstay its welcome.<br/><br/>Bravo!<br/><br/>A Straight 10 from me."
"vonWeisstadt","Null","53","75","11 October 2018"," Triumph of form (over content)
","The cold war between the western and the communist worlds has undoubtedly marked the life of anybody born in the second half of the twentieth century. And, of course, it has been a subject of many great films, too numerous to list here. Naming the film ""Cold War"" can therefore either be taken as being ironic, or very ambitious. I am not sure, but I think the director Pawel Pawlikowski meant it mostly in the latter sense, although the former is not completely excluded. Except mostly visually, the film however fails distinctly to deliver on the promise of its grandiose title.<br/><br/>The film depicts two passionate lovers, who are both Polish, although from different worlds, divided by culture and status. This division, however, does not matter much in the new Poland of 1949, and they, both being strikingly better looking than the people around them, fall in love. They are united by their love of and talent for music, but temperamentally, and we can guess intellectually, differ quite a bit. Their persistent desire for each other drives the plot, and we follow them through their many tribulations, first with too serious art directors, then Polish communist apparatchiks, well-meaning bur arrogant French intellectuals, each other, jazz musicians in Paris clubs, Yugoslav secret service, and even prison guards. All of this takes place over many years, and their inability to truly be together, because of themselves primarily but the external circumstances as well, is, naturally, exhausting. This leads them to an unexpected final solution for their predicament that ends the film.<br/><br/>The film is very well shot and put together, and contains plenty of interesting Polish folk dances and songs, which are enjoyable and worth seeing. It makes some good points about an easy corruption of true art by politics and fashions of the day. It is also hard to resist the main actress (Kulig) with her voice and spontaneity, but one is hard pressed to see why she is so enchanted with her very serene lover, except that he is a musical authority, and also happens to be exceptionally tall. The real problem starts once the viewer realizes that the film runs smoothly only by constantly remaining on the surface of things, be it their love affair, communism, or the Parisian art scene. We learn almost nothing about the basic psychology of the main protagonists, or about the communist Poland, and especially little about the wider context from the film's title, which exerts some influence over their relationship only to a rather limited degree. Everything is treated at the level of a postcard, which looks good, but was taken in an instant and was not too seriously thought through. (For example: not every artistic male in Paris had a five-day beard in the 50s; that actually became fashionable more recently and was quite atypical at that time!) Five minutes of Wajda's ""Man of Marble"", to name another Polish film, say more about Stalinism than the entire ""Cold War"". Nothing wrong with that, of course, but without this political context of the film this modern take on Romeo and Juliet would certainly not have been so enthusiastically greeted by the western audiences and the critics. In other words, if the film did not pretend to deal with certain period of world history it would have been taken for what it actually is: a not well motivated and rather naive love story.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to learn how the ""Cold War"" was greeted in Poland. A qualifier is probably warranted here: the film is in fact a Polish/British/French co-production, made by a basically British director (Pawlikowski), who is Polish by birth. To this reviewer it has a flavor of those Eastern European films made to appeal to Western festival circuit, by playing skillfully on some existing prejudices about the East. (In fact, one of more interesting scenes in the film, a brief confrontation between the main heroine and the French female poet, makes a comment on precisely this point.)<br/><br/>In sum, black and white photography and unusual formatting alone do not make a great film; the script matters! This may be lost on the Cannes' jury this year (""Best director"" to Pawlikowski !?), and I fear may even suffice for an Oscar (it has all the necessary ingredients for the foreign film category, which is: sympathetic characters, unbridled passion, totalitarianism (preferably Russian), nice visuals), but will not fool anybody remotely familiar with the works of Wajda, Kieslowsky, or Zanussi. If it lures somebody to search for more substantial Polish cinema of the distant or more recent past, however, it has served some good purpose."
"CinemaClown","Null","40","56","3 December 2018"," A Stale & Soulless Story Of Cursed Love In Cursed Times
","From the Academy Award-winning director of Ida comes another cold, stark & emotionally distant feature, this time centred around a couple that can neither stay together nor live apart. Taking inspiration from his own parents' turbulent history, Pawel Pawlikowski's latest is a tale of cursed love in cursed times.<br/><br/>Set in the ruins of post-war Europe, the story concerns a musical director who discovers a young singer and helps her refine her talent. The plot follows their romance over the years as their different backgrounds, varying temperaments & politics of the era keep separating them apart & bringing them back together.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Pawel Pawlikowski, the film definitely benefits from its splendid camerawork & wonderful music but the romance aspect is both stale & soulless. Watching the same episode repeated time n again in different places & years gets old & boring real soon, plus we never even grow to care about them.<br/><br/>The two lovebirds have no individual lives of their own. The story never digs into that aspect, for it only shows us the segments that brings them together before driving them apart again. And the repetitive nature of it makes sure that we are never invested in them or their relationship or the troubles they find themselves in over the years.<br/><br/>Difficulties of living in exile or under totalitarian regime are only glimpsed at but never explored. Joanna Kulig & Tomasz Kot do well with what they are given and while their work looks impressive, it doesn't truly resonate on an emotional level. It's a good thing that the film is only 85 minutes long and ends before it becomes an ordeal to sit through.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Cold War is beautiful to look at but its story doesn't stimulate the senses the way its arresting imagery does. The frame composition, greyscale photography, crisp camerawork and excellent musical choices actually turned out to be its saving grace, for without them, this Polish drama would be no less than an absolute chore. In a word, underwhelming."
"erikstuborn","5","50","72","12 December 2018"," Good music, beautiful photography, loose script.
","After watching the film 'Ida', the impression produced by this second film known outside Poland by Pawel Pawlikowski is that it is a commission in the shadow of his success and not a quiet and meditated work of which the author can feel proud father. Probably in Ida's creation the author easily spent five years of his life, in this one it is obvious that the script are some brushstrokes sketched on the basis of fused in black and label of 'A few years later' that slow down the rhythm and burden a story that in this case is conventional in itself but typical and not very credible.
The first twenty minutes it seems that he was going to be satisfied with making a Carlos Saura type film about Flamenco, only that applied to Polish folklore, and to the specific time in which they were under the yoke of the Warsaw Pact, it would have been a worthy effort because both the music and the interpretations in that first part are really outstanding, but the melodrama enters the scene and spoils everything. A lost opportunity and a downturn in the trajectory of this author that we hope will give us much more 'Idas' than 'Cold Wars' in the future."
"hughrcarson","9","46","71","11 September 2018"," Exquisite and Artistically Sumptuous
","Reading a bit of the blurb surrounding Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War, it would seem that this is a film based loosely not on his own experiences, but on those of his mother and father.<br/><br/>Not only were they hopelessly in love, but they were, to all intents and purposes, a bit rubbish at it. Pawlikowski refers to the fact that they seemed all too able to create chaos out of order by way of their poor decision making and general impetuosity; thereby frequently courting romantic disaster.<br/><br/>Set to the backdrop of post-war Poland, Pawlikowski's film traces the ups and downs of a highly passionate and volatile relationship between two somewhat mismatched lovers: musical impresario, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), and the singer / dancer and all-round apple of his eye, Zula (Joanna Kulig).<br/><br/>Zula is one of the star turns of the Mazurek Ensemble, a musical collective created by Wiktor and his musical business partner, Irena (Agata Kulesza), which seeks, above everything, to preserve the purity of the traditional music of Poland.<br/><br/>This purity is however soon to be compromised by political forces and it's not long before the ensemble is obliged to espouse all manner of Stalin-esque Soviet propaganda to the wider world, much to the chagrin of Wiktor whose own personal Western ideals and values are in direct opposition to this.<br/><br/>While on tour in East Germany, Wiktor sees an opportunity to escape this autocratic nightmare and conjures up a plan for he and Zula to flee across the border from East to West Berlin. This he believes will allow the couple the best possible opportunity to live a creative life free from the shackles of repressive Communism.<br/><br/>But while Zula is apparently receptive to Wiktor's idea, to what extent exactly? And what place and role - she secretly ponders - could a young Polish country girl possibly have in such a brave new world?<br/><br/>Pawel Pawlikowski effortlessly combines elements of romance, politics and art here to form an absolutely mesmerising piece, helped in no small way by two wonderful lead performances of quite some stature from Kot and Kulig.<br/><br/>Artistically creative and texturally sumptuous, Lukasz Zal's cinematography is quite simply breathtaking, and enhanced no end by the decision to shoot in monochrome. This is a choice which accentuates not only the dank unrelenting greyness of a Communist-era Poland, but the brooding smokey cool of the hip 1950's Parisian jazz scene which Wiktor embraces following his ultimately lone defection from East to West.<br/><br/>Perhaps most impressive of all though is the film's exquisite soundtrack. From a selection of luscious traditional and jazz arrangements of Polish folk tunes, to an expertly curated selection of classical pieces and rock and roll hits of the time, this is as overwhelming a cinematic sonic experience as I have had in many a year.<br/><br/>Pawlikowski's film somehow creates the feel of a sprawling three hour epic yet at just 88 minutes in length, this is a lesson to all film makers in achieving maximum impact from what is almost bordering on short-form film making - in the context of Oscar-nominated major motion pictures, that is.<br/><br/>Above all, Cold War is a wonderfully memorable and immersive tale of promised yet untenable, ill-fated love in unforgiving times, and undoubtedly an award-winner in the making.<br/><br/>This and hundreds of other reviews are available on my WaywardWolfBlog"

At 88 minutes it is a short film, it is in a subtle black and white, there are no fancy effects, one scene follows another with a brief blank screen between, and yet the film grips from beginning to end. The ensemble performances are strong, the two leads are magnificent and the sense of place and period are perfect. What is extraordinary is the way in which the film creates a potent reminder of the ways in which the human spirit and love can survive the worst that a totalitarian state can inflict on its people. In our time, while far right politics rears its ugly head, there is also a timely warning in this extraordinary achievement in European cinema."
"lucy-41188","3","56","90","17 December 2018"," The narrative leaves a lot to be desired
","Visually, this film is stunning and beautiful example of film noir.<br/><br/>The narrative leaves a lot to be desired. This film is portrayed as a love story, star crossed lovers in post way Poland. However in my humble opinion I wasn't convinced that they were in love, not convinced that there was romance. To be honest it came across as self indulgent tripe.<br/><br/>From Zula not showing up to their destined meeting in Berlin to escape to the west, to Zula leaving Wiktor in Paris while she returned to Poland. I want you, but I don't. And now I do again. Wiktor in his soppy ""I will follow her no matter where"" does just that and despite very high risk of incarceration, goes to find her and does find himself in jail. Thats paraphrasing much of the story but it is less painful than actually watching it.<br/><br/>Zula comes to the rescue when she claims she will get Wiktor out. Fast forward and there is an implication that she got together with Kaczmarek and had a child.<br/><br/>When Wiktor is freed he goes to the show and sees them all. Zula gets off stage, walks straight past her child without a glance to greet Wiktor. WHY????????? Why even bring a child into the narrative? It did absolutely nothing to improve this story and just made the ending even more unpalatable.<br/><br/>The ending.... well Wiktor and Zula symbolically marry in a ruined church. Once their vows are made, they swallow a whole bunch of pills. While not specifically shown you can guess that suicide is the end.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this. I really did. Unfortunately I found myself wondering if I had watched a different edit to the critics because I found it to be utterly forgettable, selfish and self indulgent. The cinematography was not enough to save it for me."

I enjoyed Ida less than most people, but I respect that film. At least you could call it a coherent story.<br/><br/>When it comes to Cold War, however, things get tricky. It looks and sounds fantastic. It's a technical marvel, at least by polish standards. Having said that, you'd be better off watching it without sound.<br/><br/>The story is a mess. The characters are walking tropes. The actors (except for Agata Kulesza and Tomasz Kot, who don't disappoint) don't seem to know what they are doing. The dialogue is simply laughable and the pacing is so terrible, I can't even describe it without swearing.<br/><br/>How am I supposed to believe in love between two people, if we aren't shown any? And yes, it is supposedly a story about a mismatched couple that can't live without each other - what a shame there is absolutely no chemistry, nothing but point-blank declarations from the characters. I believe that you need much more than sex on screen and a person saying ""I love you"" to portray a touching romantic experience. Because if this film isn't a romance, what do we have left?<br/><br/>It leaves out important parts of the story, like relationship development. The ending is a joke (historic accuracy much?). Joanna Kulig is infuriating. Borys Szyc left me screaming in frustration.<br/><br/>It's a shallow film that tries really hard to be much more than it ends up being. It won't bring anything into a viewer's life, maybe except for passionate discourses about said flick on parties. But those discourses annoy everyone, so the only two people really benefitting are Pawlikowski and your inner critic. A very disappointing movie."

","This is another case of style over content. The look of this film is stunning , deliberately reminiscent of the European films of the 50'sand 60's however there is no substance to the story. The script jumps years and places so many times that we never care enough about the main characters and their love story which is the main focus of the film (some would say only focus) as the major political changes that took place during this period are kept so far in the background that they seem insignificant and ultimately irrelevant.The jazz sequences in a Paris cafe only seem to be included to show some great smoky black and white photography rather than to move the plot forward. I appreciate that this is a very personal story for the director but in the transition to the screen he has lost the tragedy and emotion that he wanted to convey to audiences... and what could have been a great film is only 'quite good'."

"poland-estates","7","37","62","13 September 2018"," Culture clash
","There is consensus forming that this film is a technical masterpiece with imperfect plot. I won't go into the already lauded shots and design, casting and performances; although I will say that this is the first time in my life that a film has made me actually gasp at the power of a cut. It's a masterclass in editing.<br/><br/>Personally, I wish this great film did not end with a suicide pact. I've read in interviews that Pawlikowski took a while to come round to this ending, so there must have been others. He's also said that there is 30% more footage which has gone unused. I would love to see an alternate ending, and a longer version of the film.<br/><br/>Many British and American viewers will see the lovers in Cold War as mentally ill and thoroughly tedious, while many Poles will see them as magically and transcendentally in love.
It's about culture clash. I should know because I have Polish blood and I know Poland as well as I know England, America and the 'West'.<br/><br/>So I want to get into what I believe is the reason why many Anglophone audiences have a problem with the characters and plot.<br/><br/>This is empiricism versus voodoo.<br/><br/>First an illustration. Why is it that you can walk down London's Oxford Street in rush hour, and nobody walks into you? And then you arrive in Warsaw and you are walked into by three separate people who are not looking where they are going, on your first day there? The reason is that Londoners are looking a few meters ahead, they're aware of the consequences of their actions, that they have an effect on the world around them, that control of destiny is in their hands and think that awareness is important. Poles often have little confidence in their own effect on the world around them, there is no point looking where they're going because taking initiative has no effect - and besides, they are not responsible, and it doesn't matter anyway because there are more powerful forces such as god and love. Just look at the way the drive, too: the highest number of road deaths in Europe, because life is not in the driver's hands but god's.<br/><br/>In England the stereotype of emotional repression is still valid; it has perhaps been moderated by decades of influence from American self-help books, talk shows and rising awareness of psychology and psychotherapy. Many Brits still can't really express what they really feel, or need to get drunk to sort of get around to doing so. There is a sense of independence and responsibility for one's emotions, and that this is something to aspire towards. A Brit can remain polite while hating you. And emotional responsibility can get pretty boring; if you want passion, you have to go on holiday. In this environment, suicide seems to be an utterly idiotic and self-indulgent response to being in love.<br/><br/>By contrast in Poland, still to this day, there seems to be a far greater culture of psychological dependence between people, there are fewer personal boundaries, there is less of a sense of personal responsibility. Reckless acts of romantic love, 'co-dependence', outbursts of devotion and rage are all accepted as entirely normal parts of life. Emotional blackmail is a standard, everyday form of persuasion. Many Poles do things with little assumption that they are responsible for their own behavior - ""it's not my fault"" is a pervasive phrase used in Poland; the powerful force driving the individual is presumed to be the boss, the priest, the state, the parent or the spouse. Many Poles wait to be told what to do rather than take initiative - somebody else is thought to be in control, somebody else is going to look after them. The idea that you can teach your children independence by empowering them to feed themselves instead of their parents feeding them, or encourage them leave home, is often abhorrent and framed as neglect. It's not unusual for young entrepreneurs to be told they are being arrogant, they can be laughed at or put down by their (threatened) elders rather than encouraged and praised. While ""independence"" has become a buzzword amoung women and young people in England and America, it's a relatively strange concept to be preoccupied about in Poland. By extension, a suicide pact can be viewed as intensely romantic and even admirable, it's the ultimate proof of a love than can transcend life and all its banality."
"bastille-852-731547","8","28","46","9 October 2018"," Beautifully Made Drama from Poland
","This superbly shot and acted black-and-white drama from Poland is a worthy film from Pawel Pawlikowski. It doesn't quite live up to his outstanding previous film ""Ida,"" but it comes close. Like ""Ida,"" this film runs a fleeting 90 minutes and is shot in black and white using simple (but gorgeous) cinematography. For a film of such short runtime, ""Cold War"" is deeply ambitious, and for the most part, the ambition pays off. It is set over a considerable period of time both inside and outside of the Iron Curtain, and centers on a love story between a man and his student who meet at a state-run music academy in communist Poland.<br/><br/>The film's use of a variety of filmmaking techniques to depict the history and culture of postwar Europe through using historical context is outstanding. The simple and very powerful music is beautiful, as is every key shot in black-and-white. The two leads both give excellent performances, mixing desire for purpose in life with an intense feeling of passion that is prevalent among ambitious individuals in the era. Some of these strengths in the movie are even combined together to excellent results, such as a chilling scene when young women from the state music academy sing songs pledging absolute loyalty to Stalin on stage in performance. The juxtaposition of the different scenes in the movie is also done very well, as each scene simply cuts to black before the next major scene (set in a different region or area of Europe) begins. The only real complaint I have about this film is that while I really appreciated the ending for the most part, the tone of the film's finale felt slightly anti-climactic. Otherwise, this is a gem. Gladly recommended. 8/10"
"liakosasv","6","63","114","26 October 2018"," A critic for a good movie, but ""Nothing special""
","I must admit that the movie is not bad. The black and white color style creates a romantic and nostalgic atmoshere, during the era of the beginning of the cold war. There are some impressive and well-played scenes (and that is something the director must be praised for, his visual aesthetic), especially in the beginning of the movie, showing the life in Poland after the war and the folkore culture. The perfume and sense of old times and the illustration of another era are so clear. This is the good side of the movie, that reminds us something of the old romantic movies. On the other hand, a movie that could simply be a masterpiece, it just ends to be ""nothing special"". The main reason is that, although it considers to be a love-film, love is not clearly illustrated. The spectator cannot really understand why their love is so strong, why these people are so stuck to its other. They continue to move all the time and make love and argue, while there is not enough ""heaviness"" to their relationship. It becomes boring at some point, just to watch people go around and argue and love each other without a reason.
In cocnlusion, while I liked the way that the director presents the capitalist world, giving emphasis to the differences between the east and the west ethics and culture, I didn't like the way of presentation of the communist side, because he concentrates only to authority, power, jails and no freedom at all.
The movie just left me with a sense, that I was expecting something more."

The cinematography is pretty and the context, worthy. But that is it. I learned nothing, felt nothing for the characters and wasn't taken anywhere by this film. It's a case of the wrapping paper being better than the present.<br/><br/>I don't want to be mean about the filmmaker or wickedly speculate on the reasons this film has gained critical acclaim. What I can say is the mark of a good film, at least for me, is that you can and feel you must see it again as there is a recognition that there are so many things to appreciate that a single viewing cannot satisfy.

Maybe they had some expecations that were unmet.<br/><br/>For me though, I was pulled along, telling myself 'it is too late, I'll watch it tomorrow' before being dragged into another beautiful and perfectly timed (in length) scene.<br/><br/>Originally I was just enchanted by the music, composition and the hint of a story unfolding, but as it unfolded I was surprised to recognise and be involved in the distantly viewed and stilted portrayal of emotional damage and love.<br/><br/>I haven't seen this good a film for years, and it will stick with me"
"grayner-2","6","11","17","5 February 2019"," A bit of a disappointment to me
","I should start off by saying I am a fan of Polish cinema, have even studied it in the past. This movie was a typical Polish intellectual movie: focus on emotion, scene development and the characters' emotional journey over huge plot developments. I can't fault this film for any of that. I also loved Pawlikowski's last work, Ida, with the two principal women in this film, but found it much superior,<br/><br/>There is a lot to like in the film. Excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography, a careful attention to sounds and scope. Pawlikowski is an expert at evoking strong emotions when you view a scene, he can make all people and items on the set work in concord to convey the overall feeling he wants. So far, so good!<br/><br/>For me, where the film falls short is in giving these characters a real direction or, in the case of Zula, making her likable. Also, frankly, despite the very good acting, I could not feel a strong chemistry between the two leads.<br/><br/>Beyond this: We get it - life in Post-war Poland was very hard, being freshly annexed and essentially made a Societ puppet state. Pawlikowski conveys so much meaning in the choice to add Russian folk songs to the Polish repertoire, resulting in the resignation of the conductor after a short while. Yes, the protagonist is imprisoned and Zula does basically marry someone she doesn't love to get him out of jail.But that is pretty much the end of the analysis of the massive scope of becoming part of the Soviet block, Beyond this, it is first a visit to favorite eastern block countries, then a long stay in Paris, followed by the return to Poland.<br/><br/>But where the movie loses me is in the character of Zula and their relationship. It is established she had a hard life. She becomes part of the choir because it is prestigious, she does what she has to do. But later, she basically devolves into this pouty hussy. Instead of looking at the real difficulties of immigration, we are brought to a huge apartment and glitzy nightclubs. She pouts over the repetoire she is to sing, is rude to her partner's previous partner. She marries an Italian just to immigrate and never even gives him a second thought. We understand things are dog eat dog in an Eastern block country but she is immediately painted in such a bad light, it's hard to root for her. She gets drunk, cheats on her boyfriend, evoking a slap, and then returns to Poland, apparently leaving the love of her life behind. Could their not be 10 mintues when she is generally happy they got out? This is due to 2 things: 1) She is supposed to be this incredible free spirit and Bohemian. But why then not establish this resistance, at least to a degree, within Poland? Their she was the great little soldier, even spying on her boyfriend to the higher-up's. 2) She is to have this incredible yearning to return to Poland - despite all of her ""faults"", her love for the fatherland is strong in her. But instead of exploring this in a deeper way, Zula's return to Poland is presented as a rash, impulse thing.<br/><br/>Yes, the couple redeem themselves a bit. he gives up his life in Paris to return to Poland, gets the anticipated prison punishment and she marries a jerk so that they can be together - ultimately leading to their own suicide pact, as living in their native country has become impossible. But, sadly, all of this is presented as a couple unable to decide what is what and what the reality is until it is too late. Instead of an intelligent discussion of why being in Poland means so much to them, it ultimately boils down to, ""Oopsie, we really screwed up.""<br/><br/>Finally, and this is just speculation - When Ida won the Oscar a few years ago, the Polish rightwing was outraged - How can this film smear the image of Poland? I'll leave it to others to discuss the veracity of some of the claims presented in the film. The point is, legislation was discussed to demand only positive portrayals of Poland in film, TV and other media. This film seems like something that would please the right-wing government: Most of what was bad is the fault of the Soviets. And we have this flighty, flawed couple who, despite their faults, make it back home to Poland out of love for country and/or each other. Perfectly pleasing for the rightwing audience. Not saying that most of this was not true but this film greatly lacks the moral ambiguities and personal contradictions found in Ida."

The whole time I was watching it, I felt like there was something I was missing. But I have to judge a movie based on my personal reaction to it, and this one left me cold. The two leads have little chemistry, and the movie doesn't make a compelling case that these two damaged souls can't live without each other. We're just told they can't, but we're never shown.

"rabbitmoon","5","48","100","7 September 2018"," Its just OK. Don't fall into the trap of ""4:3 ratio + BW = amazing"" like the director wants you to
","Pawel Pawlikowski was so flimsy and uncertain during the making of his ""The Woman in the Fifth"" (Ethan Hawke, 5.4 on IMDB) that the film ended up a huge commercial fail. It seems he's then continued his run of 85ish minute films by sticking to very simple stories told in frosty black and white and the 4:3 ratio. Why, they must be incredible arthouse films! Well, no. <br/><br/>This is not Kieslowski or Tarkovsky. There is no greater meaning or depth to be unpicked from a frame. The more you look, the more annoyingly shallow and superficial the film feels, like its been carefully constructed to hit enough notes to look like a worthy film. You can almost feel the director thinking ""how can I shoehorn in a smoky jazz scene?"" then ""how can I shoehorn in some rock'n'roll dancing?"" but there's precious little relevance to such scenes. <br/><br/>Its not a bad film. Its often nice to look at, and its fairly engaging (although it abruptly throws you out of a scene with the episodic 'jump ahead a few years' structure, when you don't feel like the scene you just saw was particularly relevant or substantial). <br/><br/>But what's the point? Love can't be stopped? Obsession transcends time and circumstance? Please. It gets to a point where it stops being relatable and never approaches the level of emotional maturity or intelligence that it pretends. I just don't trust or think that the director really has a clue what he's doing, and is simply throwing a lot of stuff at the wall in the hope that it 'looks' like a film. But its not more than the sum of its parts - the closer you look, the emptier it becomes."
"truemythmedia","8","4","5","11 September 2019"," Unparalleled Cinematography
","Well, first off, the cinematography was not underrated. It is incredibly beautiful in a way that American Filmmakers have almost seemed to forget. We live in an era of cinema where color and computer graphics are our main tools for communicating at the theater. We want bigger (IMAX), louder/immersive (Atmos), and flashy/bright/color epileptic seizure inducing displays of digital fireworks.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I love a movie that blends those things effectively, but there is a simple beauty to a black and white, 4x3 frame. The main thing I see in this sort of film is light. With no color to distract you, the emphasis of the film revolves around areas of light and dark.<br/><br/>The diffuse soft light of the cold air in winter and a stand of trees gains a mystical quality sometimes as the snow which clings to the dark trunks of trees seems to disappear into the distant fog. The hard light of a night club is seen for what it is, small sliver of light in a darkness that people long to disappear into and can't seem but help to be consumed by.<br/><br/>""Cold War"" uses this light effectively as neither the star of the show nor a simple utilitarian instrument. It communicates an emotion that can't be portrayed through acting or production design alone.<br/><br/>The story is a classic one. A couple, torn apart by the love that binds them together and the forces of the world which conspire to keep them apart. Honestly, it's the main weakness of the film. I don't begrudge it that hard though. It was made by a Polish director and this is his own country's history and I'm sure there is a reason that that the war torn romance is a classic of literature and cinema. People identify with it.<br/><br/>In ""Cold War,"" Zula is a young woman trying out for a Polish Heritage singing and dancing troupe. Wiktor is the director and, upon her first audition, he is intrigued by her. As they work together the troupe gains popularity till the state expresses interest in sponsoring the show. Wiktor doesn't like the control that the state is exerting over his art so he plots with Zula to escape Communist rule through Berlin.<br/><br/>They agree, but Zula gets cold feet and doesn't meet him at the rendezvous, opting instead to stay in Poland. The rest of the film revolves around a romance that only finds expression in passing as her career eventually takes her out of Poland and the the two of them reconnect and struggle with life abroad.<br/><br/>""Cold War"" isn't a film for everyone. It's a little slow and reserved. The passion of their love is very muted, seeming more like passing interest at times than a fiery love affair and that makes it hard to connect with the characters at times.<br/><br/>Slow Cinema is seeing a bit of a resurgence right now, though, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to check out a highly acclaimed movie which exemplifies this style without falling into the trap of a 3 hour runtime as many slow cinema films do.<br/><br/>At a tight hour and a half, there are few people who can't afford to see something a little outside of their comfort zone. I certainly enjoyed it and more so even as I think about the film and the themes it presents once I left the theater."
"Equalizer16","10","15","29","7 October 2018"," A Cold War Romance
","Pawel Pawlikowski's Cannes hit is a tragic romance in background of the Cold War. After winning the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film for Ida (2013), the Polish director pays tribute to his parents with a love story threatened by historic conflict. Its rather poignant for me to be seeing and hearing outrageously positive things about Pawlowski's latest film, as my own university; Oxford Brookes has been once been home of teaching for the director. Although I haven't myself had the pleasure to be lectured by the man himself, his education in film is reaching me through his craft and non-more superbly shown then through Cold War.<br/><br/>While recruiting a group of Polish citizens to perform communist propaganda songs in a traveling concert, composer Wiktor Warski (Tomasz Kot) becomes infatuated with a peasant girl Zulu (Joanna Kulig) rumored to have killed her father. As their secret love is kept hidden during the tour, Warski and Zulu struggle to find true happiness in their bond while the events of the Cold War unfold over 15 years.<br/><br/>Loosely based on the lives of his parents, Pawilowski takes us on an powerful journey into war and love simultaneously. As Zulu and Warski cross paths over different sides of the Iron curtain their attraction to each over is invaded by their political contexts that prevent them from being together. You could easily mistake this couple for Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman from Casablanca (1943).<br/><br/>Its not just the central romance that rings the bell of Rick's CafÃ©, but indeed in the look and feel of the film the golden age of cinema is seeping out. Pawel Pawlowski's takes us back to a more traditional form of cinema with a 1:33 ratio, black and white, and more classical cinematography from Lukasz Zal. We are transported back in time, with Zal's camerawork with movements and stills that could very well have come from films from the same era.<br/><br/>The central performers of Kulig and Kot bring authentic and immersive energy to their roles, building a beautiful relationship that we are engrossed by for the entire film. But its Joanne Kulig's electrifying performance that's the stand out. From her journey to small peasant girl to a concert star is a natural as the flourishing of a flower. One sequence with Kulig's Zulu dancing in a bar is poetry itself.<br/><br/>Cold War's jazz soundtrack is narration of the story itself with an early melody about a forbidden love already foreshadowing the star crossed lover's tale. With some unforgettable music sequences in the dark smoke room clubs with glimpses of tormented eyes of Zulu as she sings. You can almost see a lot of Damien Chazelle's La La Land (2016) in the nightclub scenes.<br/><br/>Pawlikowski's portrayal of love in war is a masterful construction of beauty and melancholy, led by the wonderful central performances. A tale that says much more with its visual than dialogue another pure testimonial to cinema itself as well as the director's parents. Marvellous."

","The first time I saw Cold War, I fell asleep halfway through it at AFI Fest 2018. That was my fourth film of the day, and I was extremely tired. I felt very bad, so I was very eager for when the film would be released to the public so that I could give it another try. Today is that day.<br/><br/>Well, after seeing it for a second time (and unfortunately being two to three minutes late), I actually think there was more than tiredness that caused me to fall asleep in the first screening. I truly think that Cold War is the epitome of what style over substance is. This film has such a bad plot, uninteresting characters, and a story that flashed through more than a decade in eighty-five minutes. Cold War tries to disguise its faults with spectacular black and white cinematography, a stunning vocal score, and a pretentious choice of a historical time period, but I was not fooled for one bit.<br/><br/>The plot was so thin that I could not even begin to describe how ridiculously simple, yet annoying it was:<br/><br/>""Man who is a musical director finds a female singer with incredible talent. He leads her to fame. One day they eye-flirt at a party. They bang pretty intensely. Then, one year goes by without talking to each other. They meet one day on the sidewalk. They both declare they have significant others. But, because of their erratic attraction for each other, they have intercourse again. And then they bang again and again. Then they go on tour. She gets more famous. Then, five years go by. After not speaking to each other, they meet each other yet again. They both declare they are married to other people. But because of their lustful nature, they BANG yet again. And again. Then they decide to drop their husband/wife and become a couple. They start to fight. Then they bang to make up. Then she gets mad at him. Then she slaps him. Then seven years go by. They bang. Then, they get married. The end.""<br/><br/>In other words, the plot of this film revolves around two people whose love affair can be simplified as ""hey baby, let's get it on."" There is hardly any dialogue between them that is romantically sincere. It is all just sexual or boring exposition. I felt nothing for these two people. And I really didn't care.<br/><br/>For all you love it to death, good for you. But I prefer films with better developed characters at the expense of extremely pretentious cinematography. How about the Before Trilogy that isn't beautifully shot by any means, but the characters are excellently portrayed.<br/><br/>All in all, I wish this film was better than the camera thinks it is."

Probably in Ida's creation the author easily spent five years of his life, in this one it is obvious that the script are some brushstrokes sketched on the basis of faded in black and the label 'A few years later' that always slow down the rhythm and burden a story that in this case is conventional but typical and not very credible.
The first twenty minutes it seems that he was going to be satisfied with making a Carlos Saura film about Flamenco, only that applied to Polish folklore, and to the specific time in which they were under the yoke of the Warsaw Pact, and it would have been a worthy effort because both the music and the interpretations in that first part are really outstanding, but the melodrama enters the scene and spoils everything.

The most obvious one is the one between East and West during the period in which the film is set, (it covers the years 1949 to 1964), a time when, simply moving from one country to another 'illegally' is enough to get you called a spy and sent to a prison camp for 15 years but the other cold war is the one between its protagonists, Wiktor, (an excellent Tomasz Kot), and Zula, (a stunning Joanna Kulig), who are almost crazy with love for each other but who can't live together or, it would appear, apart.<br/><br/>We first meet them in Poland in 1949 when Wiktor is one of a group of musicians touring rural Poland in search of authentic folk artists that they would mould into a musical company. Zula is the exceedingly pretty and talented young girl who catches Wiktor's eye; in time they have sex and start a love affair. Years pass; they meet and part and move from East to West and back again. The Cold War going on around them does little for their self-esteem. As Wiktor tries to hold it together, earning a living playing piano in a Parisian jazz club, Zula hits the bottle. Hollywood has done this kind of thing in the past but seldom with this degree of fierceness.<br/><br/>Pawlikowski shoots his relatively short film, (it clocks in at under 90 minutes), in a series of compact scenes that simply fade to black, mostly to denote the passage of time, in stunning black and white, (his DoP is Lukasz Zal). He also uses music to great effect, both Eastern European folk and in the second half, American jazz. If the term 'musical-comedy' is an over-used one then let's call this extraordinary film a 'musical-tragedy'."

"coolcleangreen","5","5","10","4 February 2019"," A deep well, but confusing
","Set in post WWII Poland, two musical artists are ill-fated in love, and struggle with maintaining their love while separated by politics and circumstance.
This film had its moments of brilliance, especially the musical score, but the plot was sometimes indiscernible. I felt like this story was freewheeling through space and time with no compass. Maybe this was emblematic of the jazz period that filtered through the background, but this felt more like a gothic romance set out of place.
I could not always sympathize with the characters' decisions or issues, especially since many of their issues were self-inflicted. The chemistry between the two leads was there but it did not help with the stilted, manufactured anger (which some mistake for passion) that would bubble up periodically throughout their decades long semi-relationship.
I did not like this film as a whole, although some things were good. I felt the music, the jazz era coolness and messy vibe. I felt the coldness and the settings. On the other hand, the passages of time gave me whiplash. I could barely understand the motivation for anyone's actions. The emotional arc was severely curved. I could relate to the feeling of being drawn to the same person throughout life because they were your first love, but the way that these protagonists treated each other made no sense. I'm surprised it is getting so many rave reviews. Perhaps because the soundtrack is amazing, which is why it gets a 5/10 from me."

","Cold War is cinematically very beautiful and clearly someone put some thought into it, but that didn't extend through character development. Frankly, I thought the relationship between the two main characters was weird. It's rife with stereotypes about the era; wiktor is much older than zula and zula is the ""crazy, unpredictable lover."" Many things remain unexplained as the viewer jumps year to year, also they age zula throughout the movie more than wiktor (he is the classic silver fox and looks more or less the same throughout). As other reviews have mentioned, their relationship is not so believable- they have very little chemistry and very few full conversations throughout the movie. I'd skip this one, wish I saw a different movie at the theater."

","The Polish movie Zimna wojna (2018) was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Cold War. It was co-written and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski.<br/><br/>The movie stars Joanna Kulig as Zula, a young woman whom we first see as a trainee at a folk dance school. It's there she falls in love with Wiktor, portrayed by Tomasz Kot.<br/><br/>Zula is a rural girl, whereas Wiktor is a sophisticated professional. Despite this, they fall desperately in love. The plot of the movie is that of star-crossed lovers who want to be free in a time when no one was free in Poland.<br/><br/>This was a very good movie, but not a great movie. Although the lovers endlessly say that they love each other, in my opinion the chemistry wasn't there. Also, they make very bad decisions for reasons they don't explain. So, partly, the star-crossed lovers are to blame for their bad fortune.<br/><br/>Still, although it's grim, the film does keep your interest throughout, and the music that they create is worth hearing.<br/><br/>The two protagonists are good actors, as is Borys Szyc, who portrays Kaczmarek. Kaczmarek probably would have chosen another role in life, but he accepts the situation as it is. He's the link between the dance group and the Polish/Russian Communist apparatus. He's always watching, and always seeing.<br/><br/>We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre as part of the outstanding Rochester Film Festival. It will work well on the small screen."

The music is nice but the staged numbers should have been in wide-screen colour. The main female character, Zula, is very unsympathetic. All she wanted was to be mistreated by everyone, including the world in general.<br/><br/>A shame, as I wanted to like it. It's not a love story. I honestly don't know what it is. A tragedy, maybe.

When they do, they are rewarded with an appearance in East Berlin, whence they plan to escape to the West. She doesn't show up, so he goes on. It takes ten years before she shows up in Paris, where he scores movies and plays in a jazz bar.<br/><br/>Pawel Pawlikowski's feature has been chosen as Poland's submission for this year's Best Foreign Language Movie Award, and it has a lot going for it. It has beautiful, crisp black-and-white photography - intended, no doubt to mark it as a period piece - two good looking leads and uses its musical score to cover the flowering and eventual senescence of post-war Jazz as a metaphor for the couple's relationship. However, those are the bare necessities of a good movie, which it is. As a serious contender for an Oscar, it needs to offer more than a good story, told well; at least, I would hope it should.

","There are some movies that I can bang the review out the moment I leave the theater (for example, ANY movie starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). There are other films that I need to sit with for a few days and sort out my feelings and thoughts about them. Such is the case with the Polish film COLD WAR.<br/><br/>I am an ""Oscar completist"" and, thus, needed to see this film, not because I am a big fan of foreign films or because I am culturally literate, but because the Director of this film, Pawel Pawlikowski, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Director.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I saw this film, for COLD WAR is a rich, thoughtful, meditation on love and sacrifice that is full of mood and emotion. This film was conceived, written and directed by Pawlikowski and it shows on the screen. There is much heart on display here. It is said that Pawlikowski patterned the two lead characters after the tumultuous relationship of his parents (he even gave them his parents name), so I gotta think there is some knowledge and depth to these characters and their situations that resonate.<br/><br/>I walked into this film not knowing much about the plot or characters and this actually worked in the favor of the film, so I won't say much about it now except to say that this film follows the characters Zula (Joanna Kulig) and Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) as they experience life and love in Poland in the years just following WWII, the ""Cold War"" years.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, both Kulig and Kot are strong and they share a rich chemistry with each other. The film crackled when these two personalities were on the screen together and didn't crackle when they weren't together, so that must say something for their performances. Anyone else on the screen is ""fine"" (read: forgettable) in service of the plot and the two leads.<br/><br/>But, make no mistake, this film is a Director's film and Pawlikowski deserves the Academy Award nomination he received. The scenes are lush, and very ""European"" (lots of shots of still objects with a single viola playing in the background). The film was shot in black and white and this really helps the ""behind the Iron Curtain"" feel of things.<br/><br/>This film was also nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, and I think it has a good shot for that award (Pawlikowski is, I feel, a long shot for his award). Which makes this film worth seeing, just know you are getting a Polish language film, centered on two characters, with lots of long, lingering ""beauty"" shots setting up environment and feel. Don't expect fast pacing and action.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B+<br/><br/>7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

Problem is they're not available in very many theaters, and ""Cold War"" is another casualty. In New York City it is being shown in two theaters, which a loss for moviegoers looking for something special in movies.<br/><br/>Zula is an ambitious peasant girl with a restless spirit but is trapped behind the Iron Curtain. It 's 1949 in Poland and she comes to tryout for a Polish national musical troupe. She falls in love with its director who is looking for an excuse to defect to the west. He tries to take her with him but she is unable to follow. Years pass and they meet now and then on Tour stops. It is the saddest love story I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Director Pawlikowski has captured the texture and feel of the post-war era behind and in front of the Iron Curtain - at least to my satisfaction, not having been there. Joanna Kulig is excellent as the beleagured Zula, a girl and then a woman tossed along in the rapids that is her life. The overriding feel is of separation and emptiness which is accentuated by the black and white cinematography. It is definitely worth your time if, like myself, you feel unfulfilled by current Hollywood fare.<br/><br/>7/10 - Website no longer prints my star rating."

I was waiting for more emotional development to happen but it never surpassed a passionate lust affair. This type of relationships simply didn't fit the overall tone of the movie and more development is the one thing it is missing. There were also a couple of moments that were unrealistic and without explanation (such as one character disappearing and randomly appearing again at a strange time).<br/><br/>Overall, Cold War is obviously a well-made film, but unfortunately the story is so forgettable that it keeps it from reaching its potential."

","European films used to be made in B&W with limited dialog not necessarily out of choice but because of lack of better resources. COLD WAR is made that way to ...., well, look like those old films. Not in itself a fault but COLD WAR does not come close to the artistic level of European endeavors in and around the '60's. There's no background to the main characters that might make me sympathetic or intrigued with the plot changes; some brief moments in the beginning might have achieved such. I can accept a film's huge shifts in time and setting but in COLD WAR the pace is too erratic. Again, why not throw in just moments to cover the in-between years. The ending of COLD WAR is simply too dramatic and abrupt but, worse, wholly inconsistent with the characters portrayed. I know I'm a curmudgeon. COLD WAR is/was a worthwhile endeavor and earns it's ticket price. Not a contender, however."

There were several good movies that could have come out of this - one about gathering folk songs in rural Communist Poland, one about Polish expatriates in Paris, one about working in the Soviet music industry - none of these are the movie that was made, however, and any of those would have required more detail given to character to make it work.

From the gorgeous black and white cinematography, to the stunning music that has such a variety but still seems to fit in every scene, and to the two main actors Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot. They did a fantastic job, I believed their chemistry, their desire to be together, but also their frustrations. There is a scene where Zula and Wiktor are on a boat and it reminds me of a scene in Charade with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, just enjoying this quiet moment that they have together and looking out at people as they pass by. They know that this moment is fleeting, but they still take it in. It almost feels like a silent movie, and I wouldn't have minded if it was, but the music is so great in this that I'm glad it's not.

As much a romance between people of different strata while serving as a commentary on the failings of a repressive government trying to stymie the creativity of artistes, this film, shot in gorgeous black & white (much like director Pawel Pawlikowski's previous feature Ida), is episodic yet an emotionally involving treatise on love which tugs at the heartstrings but empowers one's sense of time & place when a love affair begins w/the best of intentions only to be hampered by the marching drums of history."

I'm constantly listening two ""Two Hearts"" in every version and language and you just cannot miss this one.<br/><br/>The one and only problem that I had with this move was the framing.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","5","12","12 December 2018"," Better than Ida, but doesn't mean that much
","""Zimna wojna"" or ""Cold War"" is a new Polish movie by writer and director Pawel Pawlikowski and if you are a film buff or just into European movies, then maybe you will think immediately of the Oscar-winning ida from not too long ago and yes this was another work by Pawlikowski. And there are parallels between that one and his new release. First of all, both are not very long films and this one clocks in around the 90-minute mark. Also both play way back in time most of the time at least and both are black-and-white from start to finish. And both have received really good appreciation by critics and awards bodies now as well already. But for me, there is a key difference, namely that I did not like Ida that much, but I enjoyed this one here quite a bit. Well, not sure if ""enjoyed"" is the right term really given the subject, but I guess you can say it. The script is good, but it is really the two standout lead actors who carry the film, Kot and Kulig. I would say Kot was slightly superior, but it's a close call and if I say something like that it means quite some appreciation because Kulig is very stunning and that is another unexpected perspective because blondes usually don't do too much for me. Agata Kulesza, the star from Ida, is in this one again as well, but really just as a minor supporting character early on. Afterward, we get a love story that spans over decades, maybe a lifetime. It seems as if the two cannot be with each other, but also not without, but probably rather the latter because he seems absolutely crazy about her, calls her the love of his life and travels back to Poland for her knowing that he will end up in jail for a long time as a consequence. However, she finally realizes it too and shares his feelings apparently. There are one or two sex scenes, but nothing too graphic really that would chase very prude audiences away from seeing this film. And it would be their loss anyway in my opinion because they are clearly missing out on a quality film that way. I could write a whole novel on all kinds of other scenes easily, but I will do without that and it is up to you to interpret these yourself as you will probably see something entirely different in these compared to what I did, so yeah go for it yourself. I will say a few words on the ending though when they are finally united and she took the price of being with another man for years, giving him a child, just to get his real love free a bit more quickly. They are getting married, well not officially as they run the ceremony themselves as they basically have nobody else they love and trust as much as each other. Which is pretty sad, but also slightly intimate to be honest and ths positive again you could say. As for the very ending are they dying? I am not sure. It is open for interpretation again if they give in to the hopelessness of their love or not. Again, decide for yourself. If you want to see the fiilm, you should, however, not expect a film that is really a whole lot about politics or the Cold War mentioned in the title. It is much more of a well.. not romance movie, but love and loss relationship movie you could say. Maybe one that women will enjoy more than men frequently, but not exclusively. In the end, it is just a good film and I recommend checking it out. Thumbs up and I am curious if it can get Poland another nomination. I think another win would be unlikely and right now I don't see Pawlikowski joining Farhadi territory."

","A love story set across 15 years and many countries. The film opens in 1949 with Wiktor (Tomas Kol) and Irena (Agata Kulesza) collecting folk songs and music in the mountains of Southern Poland. Along with administrator Lech (Borys Szyc) they set up an Institute to form a Folk Song and Dance Troupe. During the auditions for students Wiktor notices a student, Zula (Joanna Kulig), who though not technically a perfect singer has something special. Two years later They become lovers and admits that she has spied on him for Lech (she is still on probation from prison), a party hack. Lech has already persuaded the Troupe to include songs praising Stalin into their folk song repertoire. When the Troupe visits East Berlin Zula agrees to defect to the West with Viktor, but changes her mind.<br/><br/>Over the following 12 years they meet at intervals, pursuing a love which never seems to properly work out. Two artists, occasionally working together even living together in Paris, striving to find that perfect synthesis of love and music. Wiktor makes great sacrifices to try and be with Zula but he doesn't fully appreciate the losses she also suffers from pursuing their seemingly doomed relationship. Zula would always be scarred by her early life experiences and her doubts that their relationship could ever work. Great performances from Kulesza and Kol as the star-crossed lovers and Szyc as the scheming bureaucrat who carries a torch for Zula. Filmed in sparkling monochrome, director Pawel Pawlikowski delivers a veritable saga in Cold War's 85 minute running time. 8/10."
"TimWil014-1","8","7","19","8 October 2018"," Wonderful performances but...
","Saw this at a screening last night in NYC.<br/><br/>The film is visually striking and the two central performances are quite wonderful but it just didn't quite add up for me. I suppose seeing Alfonso Cuaron's incredible film Roma (also stunningly shot in black and white) the night before may have unfairly influenced my view of this one. Still, I wanted more from this film and ultimately didn't get it-I'm referring to the sort of character/plot/setting details which fly fast and furious throughout Roma but which rarely seem to appear in Cold War.<br/><br/>The director Pawel Pawlikowski and leading lady Joanna Kulig (who really is superb playing a very difficult character) were at the screening for a Q&A. Both were extremely charming and articulate. I enjoyed Pawlikowski revealing that he advised Kulig to bone up on the 1940s siren Lauren Bacall to capture her character's ""sarcasm."" My main issue with the film came to the fore when Kulig said one of the reasons her character felt out of place during the film's midsection was because Zula missed her ""family"" of folk singer/dancers. The problem is we never actually SAW her interact with them like a ""family."" In fact we only saw her interact with one of them once during the audition sequence very early in the film and even then it was for an opportunistic reason. <br/><br/>I do recommend this film, though. Many of the set pieces involving music are striking and there are many images (especially Miss Kulig floating in a lake) which will stay with you for a long time. I'll definitely see it again when it lands on Amazon Prime."
"Turfseer","5","4","9","4 February 2019"," Downbeat post-WW II tale of obsessed sad sack composer/musician, unable to let go of old flame
","Maybe there's a pattern here. This year's foreign language Oscar darlings, Roma and Cold War, appear to have so much in common. Helmed by noted directors (in the case of Cold War, Pawel Pawlikowski), both films feature brilliant, haunting cinematography and memorable soundtracks (in Roma it's all ambient sound; in Cold War a mixture of great Polish folk music, orchestral pieces and jazz). But both directors have taken on the task of writing the screenplay themselves. Result: protagonists who simply don't engage.<br/><br/>
In Roma, director Alfonso Cuarón puts Cleo, his maid heroine, up on a pedestal. Pawlikowski, in contrast, turns Wiktor Warski (Tomasz Kot), his hero music ethnographer turned music conservatory head in 1949 Poland, into a lovesick sad sack. When he meets Zula (Joanna Kulig), a much younger aspiring vocalist trying out for the conservatory and its touring company, sparks begin to fly between the two principals.<br/><br/>
Pawlikowski then reveals what happens to the couple over time-years continue to pass indicated by convenient title cards with the lovebirds indubitably showing up together in different locations including Warsaw, East Berlin, Paris and somewhere in Yugoslavia.<br/><br/>
Pawlikowski manages to keep our interest for a while with a shady antagonist: the duplicitous apparatchik Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc), the administrator at the Conservatory. Under his watchful eyes (with his orders couched as mere suggestions), Wiktor is forced to include homages to Stalin in his musical program, which are presented at various cities in Europe and behind the Iron Curtain as his talented group shows off impressive musical and choreographed showpieces.<br/><br/>
The break into the Second Act occurs when Wiktor, feeling artistically constricted by his Communist overseers, decides to defect to Paris. Similar to a scene in Casablanca, Zula fails to show up at the appointed hour as he expects her to leave Poland, and is completely crushed. Wiktor takes up playing jazz piano in Paris in smoky night clubs and later finds decent work scoring movie soundtracks.<br/><br/>
But still the once passionate couple continue to meet over the years, making love and then leaving one another again and again. Despite his crush on Zula, there's also a wellspring of anger toward her, undoubtedly as a result of Zula's decision not to join him outside their native country.<br/><br/>
The lovers eventually take up with other partners and in Zula's case, ends up having an affair with a friend of Wiktor in Paris. This appears to unhinge the former Conservatory head even more. At one point he's almost seen stalking his ex-lover by showing up in Yugoslavia where she's now a successful singer. The first time he's put on a train back to Paris by apparent Soviet agents but the next time he decides to go and see her, he's arrested in Poland and imprisoned. Zula, now married to Kaczmarek, uses her influence to get her old flame released.<br/><br/>
Should we really care about Wiktor's creepy obsession? The answer is clearly no. His motives always seem to be of the one-note variety, expressing his ""passion"" and then undermining his desires reflexively. Sad sacks never make for good drama but Pawlikowski hits the final nail into the coffin by also turning Zula into the spitting image of her once exalted Wiktor, joining him in downbeat heaven. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Should we be impressed by the joint suicide that takes place at film's end? Again the answer is a resounding ""no.""<br/><br/>
There is no doubt Pawlikowski is a very talented director whose grasp of the visual medium is quite assured. In addition, he does well in presenting the oppressive atmosphere in post-war Poland. At best, Wiktor's obsession is a cautionary tale for the viewer. But Pawlikowski holds up all of this as some kind of epic tragedy. Since there is no complexity to his protagonist's motives, in the end, we film-goers (so impressed by the director's visual talents) ultimately feel let down as the air seeps out of the film's proverbial bag."

Cold War is a powerful film of dark and light, a love story set in Soviet dominated Poland, post WWII, that evokes the disjointed and desperate Poles trying to preserve their folk culture. Ironically, the Soviets watch over the songs that adjust to Soviet tastes and are obedient to its direction. In other words, the central love affair between very young Zula (Joanna Kulig) and older Wiktor Tomasz Kot) is punctuated by dislocation to Paris, return to Poland, and eventual tragedy.<br/><br/>Despite the disorienting nature of one country taken by another, the music, authentic or not, captures the Polish rural roots while it looks to tomorrow with rock 'n roll. The lovers are torn between the motherland and modernity, doomed to physically and figuratively wander to find a home and an enduring love.<br/><br/>The beauty of writer/director Pawel Pawlikowski's romantic drama is the couple's attempt to keep connected, for they are passionately in love. Along the way their music (she sings, he plays and conducts) and Poland's make a flawed attempt at preserving traditions and their loves. The crisp black and white is a perfect vehicle to exemplify the ambiguity of the political situation and the stark reality of the lovers' struggle to vanquish the forces aligned against their fulfillment."

","I don't know about everyone else, but I'm a little tired of these two romantic formulas:<br/><br/>1) Woman plays hard-to-get and then suddenly falls in deep love with the man without enough believable development (describes a lot of old-school Hollywood romantic films)<br/><br/>2) a romance that goes awry and one starts sleeping with everyone in town to try to prove some kind of point and the other drinks himself away.<br/><br/>The latter applies more so to this film. Perhaps it would've been a little more palatable if I connected to the characters at all, but in reality, I didn't. I couldn't feel the intensity of their relationship. Maybe it was because of the length of this film and the quick time period transitions or perhaps it was just because the characters lacked that semblance of a real human being but, instead, were just cinematic caricatures.<br/><br/>The historical backdrop was what kept me engaged throughout the film, not the characters and their arc. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with such a critically-revered film from a genre that's usually up my alley. With Cold War, I just walked away with indifference."
"AhmedSpielberg99","7","3","7","29 January 2019"," Cold War left me COLD!
","I feel as if I was watching La La Land (my favorite Romance film, and one of my all-time favorite movies), except that I wasn't invested in the ""love story"" even for a single moment! Simply because the romantic relationship between the two main characters is not clearly illustrated and surprisingly very shallow. I even couldn't understand why their love is so strong; why these people are so stuck to each other. I would have been more convinced that they fell in love with each other if their love was at-first-sight kind of love. But their love is even more corny and superficial than I could have ever imagined. They continue to move all the time and make love and argue, while there is not enough emotional heft to their relationship. The movie never even delves into the romantic aspect; it only displays the parts that unit the ""lovers"" before driving them apart again. And I honestly wasn't invested neither in the characters, nor their relationship and the obstacles they face over the years. It comes as no surprise that the movie becomes boring at some point. Yes, that means that I wasn't bored per se all the way through the movie, and that's for some reasons.<br/><br/>For starters, the cinematography is simply awe-inspiring! Every scene is one of breathtaking beauty. The black-and-white color style creates a romantic and nostalgic atmosphere that tricked me that I would enjoy a love story that fits its setup. Cold War hands down deserves an Oscar for best cinematography, despite the fact that there are many 2018 films I've seen that look astonishing. Cold War has a truly striking visual aesthetic.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, Pawel Pawlikowski skillfully showed us the life in Poland after the war and the folklore culture. The nostalgic sense and the illustration of another culture in another era are so pure and genuine. Let alone the mesmerizing singing scenes that serve as small feasts for the senses.<br/><br/>As for the ""political"" territory that the movie tackles, it's equally superficial and flat as the romantic aspect. Nevertheless, I was surprised that I cared about this ""capitalist world"" more than I cared about the romance between Zula and Wiktor, considering the fact I'm not into politics at all.<br/><br/>Both the two leads, Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot, elevated their colorless characters by delivering powerhouse performances that were enough to make me not hate Zula and Wiktor.<br/><br/>I was prepared to see a masterpiece, and now I really feel that I've been cheated. I'm thoroughly underwhelmed by it.<br/><br/>(7/10)"

","I have to admit that this film was extremely well marketed for what it really is. Honestly, Cold War is not the masterpiece one would expect. Acting and directing are exceptional. Also, the black and white cinematography gives great style to the film. However, the screenplay falls short and film editing, in my opinion, is flawed.<br/><br/>I think Cold War was very close to be an amazing film. The main issue is that the characters have no depth, therefore, the story feels empty and unrealistic. Even when many assumptions can be made throughout the film, the love story between the main characters seems hard to believe.<br/><br/>For an 88 minute film, Cold War feels very slow paced and boring. I felt there was no substance or emotion that could really captivate the audience. Finally, reusing the same song over and over got really annoying. I can't say I recommend this film, but acknowledge the effort of its creators. I haven't seen all the films in the race for the foreign film Oscar. However, I doubt Cold War deserves a nomination.<br/><br/>Score: 6.5/10<br/><br/>FJ Medina"
"andrewroy-04316","7","2","4","25 May 2019"," Cold War juxtaposes slow, patient individual scenes with very quick chronological transitions to jarring effect, but the acting and story are too heartfelt not to love
","While on a scene-by-scene basis Cold War seems like a slow burn, really there's so much packed into each scene and implied beneath the surface that if you're not careful, you'll miss most of the movie. Pawlikowski has created an emotionally driven romance that also uses the political climate to heighten the tension of the film. Kulig's performance is exceptional as Zula, giving her character a distinct impulsive and bold personality. Her on-screen chemistry with Kot was strong and looked like a real, obsessive mutual attraction. It wasn't until late into the movie that I realized just how quickly their lives were changing - several times they meet in a country for just one scene and move on. While I'm impressed with Pawlikowski's ability to create a coherent and moving narrative in such a short runtime, I do think the emotional investment would have been heightened by having more time spent with the characters and seeing more of their events - the combination of slow takes and short time spent in any one location means we never really settle into a rhythm. To some degree that's an intentional directorial choice and representative of their relationship, but there were times they were clearly in love and met up in a city but there's no explanation for why one leaves or why they don't make any sort of long term plan. The script gave Zula tons of room to shine and really showcased her character, but Wiktor's character wasn't as distinct. The ending is beautiful but devastating. It's a strong film that I'm glad received so much support, and I only wish I had been more ready to be intellectually aware and interpret its subtext from the start."

","While certainly beautiful to look, Cold War - based on the director's parents - does indeed feel cold. Though two artists, getting drunk on Paris life an utterly absorbed with each other (for the most part) the film is strangely devoid of passion. Unlike Betty Blue - a tragic look at a couple obsessed with each other and in love - the lack of character depth in either the father or mother lends itself a more melodramatic feel. Artistically put together and lyrically beautiful, it doesn't hit the spot in the same way as The Last Resort. There is something very sad about it (there is no child in the film - no Pawel Pavlovsky himself) which must surely stem from Pavlosvsky's relationship with his parents. Yes they were glamorous, artistic and popular, but also self-absorbed. A somewhat distant couple through the eyes of a child."

","Some may be turned off in the beginning by the pretentious aesthetic of the visuals but, in my opinion, this is where to positive reviews actually rang true. The photography is great. The square aspect ratio seems a bit self-indulgent but I found myself forgiving that quickly.<br/><br/>As many have noted in other reviews, the biggest short-coming of this movie is the so-called love between its insufferable main characters. It is difficult to invest any emotional stock in their plight because circumstances or antagonizing forces are not really standing in the way of their love, they just choose to not be together. Sometimes it's a matter of not feeling like putting forth the effort or, in the case that they do find themselves together, one of them decides that they would rather be with someone else or be somewhere else. As a result, I stopped caring about their relationship halfway through the movie, and why not? If their relationship is not a priority for them why should I care? This flat cycle of ""love"" and disinterest continues along a dramatic plateau, leading to a climax which strains the definition of the term. It was devoid of any significant emotional weight or catharsis for me.<br/><br/>There are morsels of other interesting issues for us to consider related to the backdrop of the story (questions of cultural identity, political uses/implications of arts and entertainment, loyalty and commitment to the pursuit of one's own interests). Others seem to suggest that this movie's genius must be read between the lines so, if you decide to watch this, keep in mind that you'll need to come up with compelling central story elements yourself."

","I don't know if it was the language barrier but I had a difficult time following this movie. I couldn't tell where any of the character's motivations were coming from other than that they were lustfully attracted to each other. I understand that the political climate of the time dictated the lives of the people in the film but I couldn't always tell why it was making people do what they were doing. I'm usually one to appreciate subtlety in a film, especially when concerning changes in the background of it. But, with Cold War I feel that some nuanced explanation of events could have been useful. I was particularly frustrated at the very end of the movie when I had been thinking the whole time that the film was just too subtle for me to follow properly only for it to hit me with one of the most ham-fisted metaphors I can remember to close the movie. Maybe that was a play on how secretive the film had been and, if so, its charm was lost on me. I did enjoy the music and thought the two leads did a good job."

","Cold War is about an incredulous love story between a Polish peasant girl and a talented musician in 1950's communist Europe. The uninspiring and dull story spreads over 15 years with Poland in the background stage. This is a theme which has been told countless times in the movie history. While J. Kulig displays some decent acting, T. Kot looks bored, aloof and nowhere near the passionate lover he's cast for. The black and white cinematography only makes the movie too artsy putting the style over substance. The story telling is choppy, jumpy and documentary style which fails to engage the audience. A lot of interesting details are glossed over and happen off the screen. Although the story involves stages in Paris, Berlin and Yugoslavia, the pace is slow and sleepy. The nomination for the best foreign movie Oscar is a big exaggeration for this snoozefest."

","Obviously taking its inspiration from Fellini, the story of two lovers in cold war Poland and ""western"" France is one that totally did not grip me. Sure, the photography is great & the acting is OK (though not great) but that's about it. Otherwise this is a story with no surprising twists, no real plot, no secondary themes. It's empty.<br/><br/>The scenario is boring and revolves around one single thing: the love of the two protagonists. That's it. Nothing else. There's very little about the political aspects of those times (just some details regarding censorship and the Polish communist government trying to create propaganda) and furthermore some twists are completely unbelievable (after many years of separation she suddenly finds him in an obscure bar in Paris?). Also, the eternal love, that the movie is supposedly about, is not built up at all, but rather a given at a certain point in time. Also, folk music and dance roughly amount to 1/4th of this anyway short movie (80 or so minutes). The dialogues are cringeworthy at best. In short, there's not much to like here, in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's hard to get into the skin of the two protagonists and their love. As said, it's not built up, there's hardly any character development. The two stay the same for 20 odd years and that is basically all the movie offers. No secondary characters, no other twists, no other deeper meaning.<br/><br/>I am boggled by how this movie (and also Pawlikowski's other tragically bad but somehow critically acclaimed movie 'Ida') received so much positive press. For me there's nothing in this movie except eye candy. Perhaps all the critics have suddenly fallen in love with Pawlikowski and the type of movies that have no message, no meaning and just superficial splendor. Maybe it's the black and white thing? I don't get it.<br/><br/>Seriously flawed scenario with very little surprising elements. In short, simply a boring movie with unbelievable and uninteresting characters and theme. It might be even worse than 'Ida'. How this could have been nominated for an Oscar is completely beyond me."

","It's amazing how so many people miss the real meaning of this film, even though the title literally hits you over the head with it - COLD WAR.
Yes, superficially it is a love story between two people, but it's so much more than that.
Put yourself in Poland in 1949 when the movie begins - What was going on? Russia was grinding out the souls of the Polish people and replacing it with Communist doctrine, turning human beings into bricks in the wall.
The essence of this film is the fight to remain a Pole while a mass dehumanization is going on all around you.
Both leads struggle with it, within the system and without.
They're pulled away and then drawn back, both to each other and to Poland.
Compromises are made along the way, humiliations are swept under the rug but they still tear at the heart.
When you're under someone's thumb, you fight back in little ways - The girl gets married to an official, not for love but for advantage, then as she tells her true love later - it doesn't count because it was not in church.
Poland is one of the most Catholic countries in the world, we're brought back to that for the ending where the two lovers finally 'get married' in a real church, or what the Soviet Union failed to destroy. It was a symbol of love but even more than that a symbol of defiance during the... COLD WAR."

I liked it. Since I gave it a 4.5/5 on Letterboxd, I'll just give it a 9/10 officially.<br/><br/>(significantly easier to read on my blog)<br/><br/>There be slight spoilers below.<br/><br/>
Cold War was an interesting story of two totally appropriately aged lovers who couldn't make it work long enough to avoid drama and sabotage. It was essentially an adult version of Romeo and Juliet, but with more realism, adult matters, and wartime politics. I feel more sorry for him than her, but that may be due to the film focusing almost entirely on his perspective and me sharing his demographic.<br/><br/>All of that being said, I really enjoyed the first half's performances prior to the forced politicization into propaganda. Up until that point, they had so much soul in their performances and love for what they were doing. I felt like I was being allowed to bear witness to people's cultures and appreciated it every time. Once the propaganda bulged in, it all became hollow and they themselves became smiling husks. Props to the film crew for accomplishing this. I'm now wondering how accurate that part of the film is to what was going on at the time.<br/><br/>If you think Cold War is about the performances, fear not. They're just a major part of the first half in that the plot is centered around them in a non-overwhelming way. The second half is... let's say a story about a male making his way through life and being occasionally visited by the ghosts of his past in rather life-altering ways. No, it's not magical. Just realistic in the way people and decisions affect your life. Smaller-form performances persists throughout the second half, mind you. That reminds me, the performances are consistently used to portray the mood and feelings of the characters. I'm especially thinking of the last performance in this regard... ~and I'll leave it there.<br/><br/>
Things I Like:<br/><br/>1) Dat cinematography<br/><br/>1a) Lemme rave real quick about how much that reflection scene got me in the first half. To pull that simple trick so subtly and at the same time not only foreshadow but allow the audience to presume so much. ðŸ‘Œ<br/><br/>2) Da performances<br/><br/>
Side Notes:<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching the behind the scenes videos such as Amazon Studios' ""Featurette"" after the film because of how much more I'm starting to appreciate it. I say ""after"" because realizing that I was seeing it in color after all these months hit me in an strange way and I suspect doing so beforehand would have affected my experience.<br/><br/>I don't recall what song was playing during the end credits, but I remember staying seated the entire time.<br/><br/>
Favorite Line:<br/><br/>""He mistook me for my mother so I used a knife to show him the difference."" -Zula<br/><br/>
Favorite Character:<br/><br/>Zula (when she's not being drama). For her spunkiness.<br/><br/>
About the Trailers (1 & 2):<br/><br/>Y'all, I love it when a trailer manages to show so much and reveal so little. All I'll say is that it effectively covered, say, 50% of major moments but having done so without context revealed next to nothing to the viewer. That being said, if you want to skip the slightest of spoilers, skip 1:28-1:30 and 1:40-1:44 of the first trailer and 1:26-1:32 of the second. Enjoy.<br/><br/>
Similarities:<br/><br/>The Fire (2015). For how I feel worse for him than her.<br/><br/>

","In this post-war love story we follow the relationship of Wiktor, a musician involved in a project focused on folk music, and Zula, a woman who's trying to avoid problems with the law after almost killing her father. Wiktor during the auditions for the project, feels almost immediately for the young girl; later on she's also drawn to him. The movie doesn't really give any other reason for their affair besides pure attraction, probably to enhance the nature of romantic love; their love is real and that's all, no explanations or reasoning required. The folk music ensemble is very well accepted; however, since Poland was under the soviet regime they're pressured into including. pro-stalinist, communist propaganda in their performances - something that frustrates Wiktor and ends up convincing him to leave the country. He asks Zula to cross the border with him and she agrees to do so - and they affirm their love for each other; however, she does not show up and he ends up crossing the border alone. After a timeskip, we see him working in a jazz club in Paris. Wiktor and Zula reunite for a short time and once again both affirm their love for each other; she confesses that she didn't cross the border with him because she didn't believe it would work out. After their encounter, Wiktor goes to Yugoslavia to watch her in concert; she gets visibly shaken to see him there. After another timeskip she marries a man to get a visa and be able to be in Paris with Wiktor. Their relationship however faces some problems; Wiktor is way too caught in the artistic life, while Zula seems to get more and more frustrated. He eventually manages to build her a good career, but her personal needs are overlooked by him. Unhappy with all the situation she decides to go back to Poland. Wiktor tries to follow her, but since he fled Poland he can't claim nationality. Later on we see Zula visiting him in a work camp; he's been sentenced to fifteen years of labor and due to the deformed state of his hands he has no hopes of ever working in music again. Zula manages to get him out of there with some political help. When they finally reunite again they decide to run away once again, this time for good. They go to the ruins of a church to perform some sort of makeshift religious marriage; they take unspecified pills - probably something that would kill both of them. The film ends with both of them sitting together in the middle of nowhere, they go to the other side of the road and the camera shows them no more.<br/><br/>
This movie portraits in a beautiful manner a relationship that was tragically interrupted by the tensions of a post-war world finds it almost impossible to be functional. The troubled nature of their love is shown whenever they're together; it is as if their love never really found a way to grow peacefully. However, the love never really ended no matter how many unfavorable situations they got into. In the end both were terribly wasted; both lost anything that could really support their love in a pratical manner - so the only way was to affirm it one last time. Double suicide was the solution they've found. This premise paired with the beautiful visuals of the movie, the amazing camera work, and the equally beautiful soundtrack really makes up for a emotional experience. Cold War is a beautiful portrait of a tragic love in post-war times; the perfect background to enhance the chaotic and sad nature of love. The experience is satisfactory, even though possible hopes for a happy ending were taken away; Ultimately, the meaning I find in all this experience is: If love is real then it will find a way, even if the way is tragedy."

","In the tradition of ""Dr. Zhivago,"" ""Zimna wojna"" is a highly-charged political film framed in the context of an epic love story. The two films also share a resemblance in the stunning cinematography. Instead of the spectacular color photography of David Lean, ""Zimna wojna"" is filmed in a lush black-and-white style by Pawel Pawlikowski.<br/><br/>The incomparable uses of music and dance help to drive the action of the film. A group of Polish peasants is assembled in Warsaw as the Cold War is heating up in 1949. But a pretender enters the company, who is not a peasant at all. This is the dynamic and talented Zuzanna ""Zula"" Lichon, who had apparently made an attempt on the life of her abusive father, then ran away to audition for the folk singers. She fatefully meets the conductor, Wiktor Warski, and the stormy relationship that cover the entire sweep of Eastern and Western Europe unfolds.<br/><br/>The film is not entirely successful in depicting the political ramifications of its title. We do not really see the human rights abuses and the political repression of the Eastern Bloc nations. And, the Western European nations are portrayed superficially as sleazy and decadent. The lines of dialogue are occasionally overwrought with loaded political implications, when Zula tells Wiktor in Paris, ""In Poland, you were a man; you are different here"" or when Zula is lectured by Wiktor's love on the meaning of a ""metaphor.""<br/><br/>The moves from Poland to East Germany to Paris to Zagreb and back to Warsaw, spanning the years 1949-64. Some of the locations were stunning, especially a hollowed out Eastern Orthodox church that figures prominently in the action.<br/><br/>The film is worth seeing for the mesmerizing performance of Joanna Kulig as Zula. Like Julie Christie as Lara in ""Doctor Zhivago,"" Kulig delivers a knock-out performance, especially in her singing. The turbulent love relationship of Zula and Wiktor mirrors the Cold War battles that nearly destroyed the world. In the case of ""Zimna wojna,"" two souls were drawn together and were nearly destroyed, not so much by the world around them, as by their human frailty."

"jgcorrea","7","0","0","9 February 2019"," Interesting, and a suggestive reminder of Camus-styled existentialism
","Here between us, however patriotic a Polish of the 1945 Generation might be, who would prefer the Iron Curtain to Paris? especially Wiktor, an outstanding musician, who had sufferingly left the love of his life, the pretty Zula, behind in suffering Poland. This movie is another flagrant case of style & form to the detriment of content. ¨Cold War¨ may even win an Oscar - it has two basic ingredients - rampant passions and Soviet totalitarianism, - but it hardly reaches a comparison with the best film essays by Wajda and Kieslowski, to name only two Polish masters contemporary of the Cold War era in real life.
The cinematography, the items of the musical soundtrack and the excerpts from ballet folk choreographies are admirable attractions here. An impressive visual treatment evokes the New Waves of the 1950s and 1960s, but the plot is elliptical: loose and barely sketched, neither sufficiently enveloping the spectator nor spelling clearly its philosophical sense or the author's ultimate message, whose protagonist has a weak personality. Wiktor sacrifices his art to Stalinist Jdanovism and his life and his freedom to such an ungrateful, unfaithful partner, Zula, a selfish, spoiled and annoying young girl - herein, supposedly, a femme fatale.
One can try a Camusian approach to this film. Wiktor and Zula had already lived throughout the WWII. The Cold War, which was not properly a war, began simultaneously with the end of the horrors of WWII. The film takes place between 1949 and 1964 and places on the table, even though metonymically and indirectly, the great questions of existentialism, a doctrine that had its apogee and greater popular influence precisely in the 1950s and early 1960s - especially on account of Albert Camus.
Wiktor, an intellectual and an eclectic (folk, classical, be-bop) musician, flees from the Iron Curtain to Paris in 1951 - the year in which Camus published ""The Man in Revolt"" - L'Homme Révolté or The Rebel. Because he was not a supporter of the Cold War between US/NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Camus was considered an eccentric, and therefore criticized by the right, the left, and the center. His fidelity was towards truth, not ideology. He was opposed to state assassinations, terrorism and wars in every quarter. An artistic anarchist, with a passionate spiritual hunger, an austere and moral Don Juan, a sensual man of conscience and honor who earned a reputation for a lifelong literary meditation on death in all its forms: illness (he suffered from tuberculosis ), murder, suicide, death penalty, war, etc. One of his first novels is ""The Happy Death""; death as ""happy"" as absurd, at one time as sudden as slow. Likewise in the movie ""Cold War"". Camus's enemies were social injustice, political perversion, the powerful who thought they had the right to make others suffer and die for their perverted purposes, liberal imperialism, Soviet Marxism, and abstract ideologies in general.
Popularly known for his writings on absurdity (which for Camus was only a necessary first step to revolt, and eventual suicide), when he died on January 4, 1960 in a car accident in France having in his pocket an unused train ticket, the press explored the absurdist nature of his death! The media still do so. But did it really happen like that? There is a conspiracy theory that, instead of an automobile accident, Camus might have been murdered by the KGB because of his criticism of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, the massacre of Hungarian freedom fighters and his defense of Boris Pasternak and the novel, Doctor Jivago, among other things.
According to such theory, the accident that cost Camus' life would have been organized by Soviet spies who damaged the tire of the car using sophisticated equipment that cut it, or caused it to be slashed at high speed.
Camus's exegetes soon rejected the idea. But a book called ¨Camus must die¨ recalled another mysterious death, in 2013, of journalist Michael Hastings in the United States, when his car accelerated to more than 100 miles per hour and exploded against a tree on a highway in Los Angeles.
Whatever the cause of Camus's death was, of course we can echo his voice today. He served beauty and suffering, he defended the innocent in this basically murderous world, he was haunted by images that still haunt us, as of 2019 preys of megalomaniacs and paranoids suffering from the Syndrome of Hubris and feeding dreams of conquest. We remain in an absurd prison, threatened by madmen brandishing small and large arms.
The world as a prison is of course a metaphor with a long and popular tradition. Over the last hundred years or more, with the secularization of Western culture and the perception of God's ""alienation,"" the gates of that prison took popular imagination with a growing number of people feeling trapped in an kind of alien universe , unable to unite the abyss between themselves and a supposedly absent God. Death has become for many the symbol of the absurdity of existence and the futility of flight. It used to be, though, for the faithful like Wiktor or Zula, an open road to free eternity."

","There is a lot to commend in this depiction of the post world war rebuilding of lives and traditions. Not least are the singing and dancing performances that form the backdrop to the fated romance between the pianist and his beau of do-we-believe-it dubious background. This is, perhaps, a symbol of general everyday misogyny -the woman's talent is minimized? Hard to tell because the story arc is not easy to follow with too-long-held black blank screen breaks performing that necessary trope of story-telling aka 'Meanwhile, back at the ranch'. We don't really get to see why the two lovers are so dedicated to each other, or why they have little or no compunction in having serious relationships with other people. A mystery the viewer has to fill with their own day-dreaming, as with adding colour. It is a shame that, throughout, we are restricted to black and white visuals. A fault that is repeated in the rather two dimensional story telling. Entertaining enough but far from perfect."

","The Jehovah's Witnesses were very much the Scientologists of my childhood, in so much as they came across as both mysterious and a little ominous. <br/><br/>From door to door they would traipse with calm but dogged determination, eager to share their literature, and impart their 'answers' to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Of course there was no real mystery at all, just a devout set of believers with a rigidly defined set of life rules that anyone with a modicum of interest - or more pertinently 'patience' - could very easily have discovered more about should they, just for once, have chosen not to slam the door in their faces.<br/><br/>The odd couple of stalwarts outside shopping centres or train stations-aside, they seem to have slipped somewhat from public consciousness these days, displaced by a tidal wave of far more topical unsavoury pressing religious issues of our day, but that's another story...<br/><br/>Refreshing it is then to be offered a glimpse into the curious world of Jehovah's Witnesses by way of Daniel Kokotajlo's excellent but rather austere tale, Apostasy.<br/><br/>Set in Oldham, Greater Manchester, it focuses upon a mother, Ivanna (Siobhan Finneran), and her two teenage daughters, Alex (Molly Wright), and Luisa (Sacha Parkinson), for whom a zealous belief in the doctrines forms the rigid backbone of their day-to-day existence.<br/><br/>Although Ivanna and Alex are unwavering in their belief (at least outwardly), Luisa has, with age, developed doubts, and on becoming pregnant, her own faith as well as that of her immediate family is to be sorely tested.<br/><br/>But on whom can she rely to guide her on her path into motherhood? And can her predicament ever be endorsed within the strict parameters of her family's staunch religious beliefs, and indeed those of the religion's 'elders'?<br/><br/>Director Kokotajlo was apparently keen that northern English acting talent should be afforded the limelight here, and in Siobhan Finneran, we are treated to a fine portrayal of a mother mentally conflicted between the iron grip of her religious devotion and her natural role as a caring mother. <br/><br/>Molly Wright puts in a tender performance of both innocence and vulnerability as youngest daughter, Alex, whilst Sacha Parkinson is cast well as Molly's wayward sister, Luisa.<br/><br/>Played out under a grey overcast Lancashire sky, Apostasy is never less than bleak in its outlook. Even the film's fleeting romantic interest seems somewhat tainted given the rather stony ground on which it is being asked to take root and flourish.<br/><br/>Kokotajlo's film seems as genuinely intrigued as it is disapproving of its subject matter, yet never is it damning or dismissive, instead it walks its viewer methodically through a succession of tough scenes that will doubtless dumbfound and frustrate through their pure indoctrinated illogic.<br/><br/>Blood may indeed be thicker than water, but it seems that it's no match here for the sheer viscosity of the doctrines of Jehovah, and those who so single-mindedly adhere to them, as ultimately will become patently and tragically clear."

","This love story is set in the years shortly after the end of the Second World War when Poland, having struggled to free itself from Nazi tyranny, then finds itself subjected to Stalinist occupation. This cruel, repressive situation provides the setting in which the lovers struggle to build their futures - the key to understanding the drama. <br/><br/>A middle-aged musician, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), under the direction of Stalinist quislings, is on a mission to find the talent for the creation of a Polish folk ensemble, destined for use as a propaganda tool by the Soviets.In the course of his search, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful young singer, Zula (Joanna Kulig). Aware of the growing constraints being placed upon him and his artistic integrity by the sickly officialdom of the State, he plans to escape to Berlin, and asks her to go with him. She agrees. But Wiktor soon discovers that such a move is more than she feels can cope with, and she remains in Poland.<br/><br/>Wiktor moves on to Paris where he becomes involved in the jazz scene and with another woman. A few years later, during a tour by the folk ensemble to European cities, Wiktor and Zula meet again. She is now married to one of the odious Polish State officials, an act of convenience/necessity rather than love, just as Wiktor's new relationship is. They try to go their separate ways, but their initial passionate attraction returns and they rekindle their affair . . . with tragic consequences. <br/><br/>The yearning for the Homeland is strong and the lovers return to Poland. Their fraught relationship, with its dream of personal and artistic fulfilment and freedom, flickers and flares, warms and burns until at last, the lovers confront the impossibility of their dream ever being realised under the stifling presence of the Stalinist regime.Wearied by existing in such a world, they decide to take their own lives. <br/><br/>This superb movie, wonderfully shot in monochrome in a boxy frame, combines utterly convincing acting by the leads with evocative and brilliantly performed music, creating a chillingly bleak mood. Sentimentality is absent, the lovers being portrayed as hardened and flawed as well as tender and torn. There is no hint of melodrama, more of weary inevitability. The final scene is handled with such tragic delicacy that I, for one, was left speechless with grief as I left the movie theatre. <br/><br/>A brilliant tour de force with an emotional punch that stays with you long after the movie is over.<br/><br/>(Viewed at HOME Arts Centre, Cinema 1, Manchester, UK 9 September 2018)"

","I have never seen a film capture the desolate despair of Eastern Europe after the Second World War as in this case. This film offers a beguiling tale of a middle-aged Polish musician who travels to a feudal area and becomes infatuated with an aspiring female singer who is among the peasant folk who audition to perform for his company. The two fall for each other and their love blossoms into a perpetual romance that survives many upheavals including the company being taken over by Stalinist ideologues and the man's decision to leave Poland for western Europe.<br/><br/>Performances here are extraordinary by the two leads. They present a compelling and sympathetic couple who can't stay way from one another despite marked differences in their character. She as it turns out comes from a troubled family.

It's one of those romances whose imperfections make it the perfect love story.<br/><br/>Alas, we have this film's conclusion. I cannot abide a film's resolution that does not conform to the character arc. If there is insufficient character development or plotting for the climax that takes place, then the ending will only take away from the film's logic.

"cultfilmfan","10","2","5","10 March 2019"," Cold War
","In a lot of arguments against modern films, or I guess the case could be made for older films as well, it seems as if audiences in general want all the easy answers and don't necessarily want to have to think for themselves or ponder a film and it's meaning after they have watched it. Cold War is a film that I think many would argue has not enough character development and a lot of viewers would be left scratching their heads as to why the characters in this film do what they do and why the relationship depicted in the film often feels strained and more like a love/hate relationship than one that is based out of love. I think here as with any number of art house, or films that would leave more up to the audience's interpretation as an emotional means, but also to have a lingering if not haunting effect upon the viewers after the film is over. There is I would argue a fair bit of character study on display here and what is not shown, or maybe instead is implied to the viewers, I would still say speaks volumes about the character's tendencies, personalities and overall motives as to how they live their lives and what is the logic or reasoning behind a lot of their decisions. The two main characters are often seen fighting either verbally, or a few times physically and there seems to be a general sense of tension and hostility between them. At other times we seen them in the throws of passion and as if they would never leave each other and like they mean the absolute world to one another. And yet these characters go years and sometimes close to decades without seeing each other and forming other relationships and commitments with their lives, but there still seems to be a yearning and a tiny if yet large fire blazing inside them whenever they do reunite whether it be for a brief, or lengthy period of time. One could argue that these two lovers are often very cold both emotionally and on a romantic level with one another, but I think for both of them that it is only a part of the attraction to one another and while they have tried (how hard is up to interpretation) to live apart, we somehow know and feel that in a sense despite the peculiarities within the relationship and the lack of emotion or depth still lingers a love that will ultimately conquer the contradictory forces both in their home lives as well as the country's backdrop as to where they are living as well. This is a film that is certainly a fine example of stage and spectacle and some of the song and dance numbers whether it be a more folksy traditional number on stage, or to the smoky and yet ambiance filled scenes set in Paris clubs that feels both cool and classy at the same time. This is a film that is heavy on mood and atmosphere and some of these scenes are amongst the finest I have seen in any film of last year, or in recent memory. The cinematography here is also amazing with any number of single shots, or frames that could easily be put on display in an art gallery with how much it says in each shot as well as the beauty captured in and around the events in and out of focus. The black and white photography is probably the best looking I have seen recently and the film's cinematography nomination at the Oscars was more than well deserved. Joanna Kulig who plays the lead character, plays her with a lot of intense emotion and feeling and yet can be quiet and vulnerable at times when the role requires it as well. It is one of the most impassioned and yet heartfelt and longing performances in recent memory and she could have easily won any number of acting awards for this spot on and powerful portrayal. The film looks great and sounds great and is certainly a sight to behold and I am pleased to say that it gives it's viewers a lot to think about and does not gives us a cheap way out, but instead allows us to linger on it's beauty and it's ugliness and the film is all the more resonant and powerful for having done so. One of 2018's best films and one of the most stirring and accomplished films in recent memory."

They first meet in communist Poland and gradually come to decide, that for them to have a future together, they should defect to the west.<br/><br/>The film, shot in black and white, depicts a very interesting period of European history, although that history frequently has to make way for the romance. My biggest issue with the film was, that the love story, which is so central to the narrative, didn't feel that special. I did not really root for them to end up together, nor for them to split up. I was most interested about the societal depiction of the communist block and later, that of France.<br/><br/>The crowning merit of this film, however, is not the cinematography, although that too is great. It is the soundtrack. This film documents the evolution of popular music in communist countries and in western Europe, and does it in an interesting way.

","Polish Director Pawel Pawlikowski's newest film ""Cold War"" recently a Best Foreign-Film nominee at the Academy Awards a few months back is a fascinating, historically-resonant and in many ways poignant and even quite-beautiful movie starring the fantastically charismatic (and multi-talented actress and singer) Joanna Kulig.<br/><br/>I remember considering director Pawlikowski's 2014 Academy Award winner 'Ida' to be a genuine cinematic masterpiece (ruminating on 'Ida' who had escaped the Holocaust hidden in a Catholic Convent, who later attempts to reconcile a deep and tragic 'persistence of memory').<br/><br/>Joanna Kulig I also remember from another historically-resonant and outstanding performance as a Polish resistance-fighter in the 2011 film ""Remembrance"" directed by Anna Justice.<br/><br/>In any case the film ""Cold War"" is a tremendous film working on many levels, primarily as Love Story between the musically-gifted singer 'Zula' (Joanna Kulig) and her artistic 'mentor' 'Wiktor' (Tomasz Kot) who is a talented pianist/arranger. Of course, since this film begins in the very late 1940's/early 1950's the Musical-theater scene in Poland is mostly sponsored/ and overseen by the Socialist-State and adherents therefore, 'Wiktor' and 'Zula' although vibrantly adventurous individuals (both artistically and otherwise) find their artistic 'voices' more than a bit squelched in the still Stalinist-leaning Poland (circa1952) and Wiktor launches an 'escape plan' for both Zula and himself to cross-over to France and pursue more liberated musical endeavors...... best laid plans.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about ""Cold War"" is that it most certainly does not follow a predictable narrative (and actually makes jumps in time and space: late 1940's Poland - 1952 East Berlin - 1954 Paris - 1955 Yugoslavia - 1957 Paris again - early 1960's Poland again),,,,,, each vignette from a specific time & place reflecting a Life-changing 'epoch' for one or both of the artist/ Lovers....... finding and losing Love (searching for deeper-connections) both for each other and for their cherished unfettered artistic-expression (and musical-creativity) which acts as a sort of 'Lifeline' throughout this film.<br/><br/>As with Pawel Pawlikowski's last film 'Ida' there is a pronounced and indelible feeling of tragic-authenticity with regards to the overpowering-shadow of ""Cold War"" timeframe in which especially creative & imaginative individuals had to constantly re-calibrate their appropriate level of 'expressiveness' to coincide with the whims of those totalitarian artistic-cultural overseers & bureaucrats. You most definitely receive the distinct feeling (especially from Joanna Kulig's vitally-empathic performance) that ""Zula' and 'Wiktor' are both sensitive souls who just yearn to fully express their natural musical gifts... and their genuine love for each other without the State (or overbearing-bureaucrats) intervening in either the course of their 'Life or Art'<br/><br/>Note: the many 'musical' scenes interlaced thru this film (usually featuring ultra-charismatic Joanna Kulig, but also some Jazz artists in the mix for good measure) are quite vibrant and spectacular (even in humble B&W). Cinematography is also outstandingly atmospheric!"
"iquine","9","1","2","23 May 2019"," That Was a Heavy Love Story; Uff-Dah
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>True love trumps everything else in life in this somber tale. During the Cold War through the 50s, a rural Polish folk composer, Wiktor, starts a cultural signing group of peasants. Headed by his female music partner and a talented younger female singer, Zula. When the government catches wind they 'persuade' them to focus more on communist political themes rather than heritage. His upset partner then leaves and Zula climbs the status ladder and forms a lustful bond. Shortly thereafter, Wiktor is tired of the government meddling and decides to flee Poland for France and asks Zula to join him. At the last minute she doesn't go. The two get separated and there are many country border issues and deportations to come and they move on with their lives and still try hard to be together. Will the things they need to do to get back to each other actually tear them apart? Do those who strive to leave Poland for a better life regret what they left? Shot in rich black and white and in a square format with coffee table book quality cinematography this was a joy to look at. Strong even pacing and a meaty story made this very memorable."

","The cinematography is beautiful, like a painting in black and white. But the story is really superficially told, no way for the viewer to relate or to even care for what's going on with the characters. I doubt that the western audience can even relate to the communist background of the story as this too is superficially depicted. Just a simple love story in beautiful B&W shots."
"nancyldraper","7","1","2","4 May 2019"," There is just something about this movie...
","There is just something about this movie. On one hand, it is slow, plodding and dark. On the other, there are moments of beauty, heart and an unfathomable passion. Basically, it is the intense love story of two people (reputedly the author's parents) that spans 15 years and transects Europe. From the very beginning the character Zusa emerges as the axis upon which Wiktor's world revolves. No matter where he goes to escape oppression he cannot escape Zula's hold over him. It is impossible to take your eyes off Joanna Kulig as she inhabits this character or to escape the spell she weaves. This is fine acting. The choice of a black and white palette suits the mood of the piece while the life of the music shattters those bounds. Not a movie for everyone but there was something about it that captured me. Nominated for multiple awards, including 3 Oscars in 2019, it has been well received by film critics and festivals. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Dramatic Love Story}"

","In the late 1940s, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) and Irena (Agata Kulesza) are musical experts assigned to audition and assemble young peasants from rural Poland to form a choral group. One singer is Zula (Joanna Kulig) who later becomes involved with Wiktor. Their story covers many tours in Communist Europe and later includes the jazz scene in Paris in the 1960s.<br/><br/>""Cold War"" is beautifully directed by Pawel Pawlikowski who was also directed ""Ida"" (2013). Like ""Ida"", ""Cold War is blessed with beautiful black and white cinematography. It also has stunning music in a variety of forms including peasant folk, jazz, and classical.<br/><br/>It is inevitable to compare ""Cold War"" with ""Ida"" in other ways. Kulesza had a supporting role in both of them though her role in ""Ida"" was more prominent. In her few scenes in ""Cold War"", she plays an artistic director who is at odds with the shallow Communist authorities who work to manipulate the choir as a propaganda tool. The film would have benefited if Kulesza's role had been expanded.<br/><br/>Also, like ""Ida"", there were some rash decisions made by main characters that were incomprehensible. In ""Ida"", this occurred only in the second major role (the one played by Kulesza). In ""Cold War"", it is both Irena and Wiktor who act oddly in ways that are not understandable - at least to those who have not lived through the harrowing experience of eastern Europeans who survived WW2 and then subsequently lived through Communism. Nevertheless, Kulig and Kot are passionate as lovers in a very difficult time and there is little doubt that ""Cold War"" is a film that pleases the senses on many levels. - dbamateurcritic"

","Cinematically, this film has just about everything going for it: cinematography, production design, music.
Where it falls short is story and character development. The film depicts two people who keep trying to escape and are stuck in their relationship; whether they're together or apart, they are stuck. There are obstacles, but the obstacles are never overcome; therefore very little evolution. I felt very little investment and empathy as I watched Cold War. Mostly, I felt impatient and eager to get this very limited story over with. Thanks for a relatively short run time, though it still felt unbearably long."
"jboothmillard","7","1","2","28 February 2019"," Cold War
","I think I saw film critic Mark Kermode talking about this Polish film on one of his programmes, it looked interesting, it was getting positive reviews, and then it received nominations during Awards Season, I hoped it would be good, from Oscar and BAFTA nominated Pawel Pawlikowski (Ida). Basically the story is set in the ruins of post-war Poland, and also in Berlin, Yugoslavia and Paris, during the 1950s. It is about a pianist/composer/music director, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), who presides over an audition to set up a traditional folk-dance troupe to tour. During this process he meets and falls in love with beautiful free-spirited, changeable singer, Zula (Joanna Kulig). They are two people with different backgrounds and natural predispositions, who are fatefully mismatched but condemned to be with each other. As performing musicians, they are forced to play into the communist propaganda movement, they long to escape and find creative freedom in the West. They one day get the opportunity to make a break for freedom to France but fall out with each other and make a decision that will change their lives. It is ultimately an impossible love during impossible times, as Wiktor and Zula are separated by politics, character flaws and unfortunate twists of fate. Also starring Borys Szyc as Kaczmarek, Agata Kulesza as Irena, CÃ©dric Kahn as Michel, Jeanne Balibar as Juliette, Adam Woronowicz as Consul and Adam Ferency as Minister. Kot does well as the lead male musician, but it is Kulig who stands out, channelling a likeness to young Bridgette Bardot, looking vivacious and with a beautiful singing voice, the two leads make a believable, flawed couple who are living during austerity in the Soviet-controlled times, it is made much more entrancing by the use of black-and-white colour, it is slow at times, but the love story and the music throughout is most watchable, overall it is a worthwhile historical period romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film Not in the English Language, Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography. Very good!"
"Irena_Spa","7","1","2","21 February 2019"," Maybe good, but not perfect 100% :)
","Yes, it is good, first because of that excellent black/white photography and second, because of Joanna Kulig. She isn't attractive, not femme fatale as someone says in the movie for her character, but she gave her heart to build that character of Zula in every way, as she is singing in one song in that movie. This story shows us a very passionate love which looks like in many moments as in the song ""Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,......To keep me from getting to you babe"", but on the other hand gives us, if I may say, a very black depressed happy ending."

I did not care enough for them how I was probabyl supposed to. The acting was good however, especially Joanna Kulig who gave an impressive Performance and was generally very mesmerizing. I also liked Tomasz Kot and most of the rest of the cast did a solid Job.
The direction was good and I liked that they used a small length of film and told the Story effectivly within that time. The score was nice, the cinematography of Course amazing.

It's not like I didn't care either, it's just that I felt really detached from the characters and that's something I don't really like in movies. I wanna feel emotions and with this movie I felt very little.<br/><br/>The visuals however are reason enough to see this movie. I love that it was in black and white and while I didn't like watching for the story I was happy enough to just look at the beauty og the visuals.<br/><br/>And last I wanna say how much I love the music in this.

","Cold War is an amazing movie in all aspects. Starting with the 4:3 screen format, almost square, in contrast to the modern trend of widescreen productions. The beautiful photograph of the young Polish cinematographer Lukasz Zal features a black and white figured out in a striking and intimate chiaroscuro.<br/><br/>Following the track of an unlikely couple, a conductor who researches folk songs and a singer and dancer, the film recounts the relationship of 15 years, mainly occurred in the 50s, which, in any other production, would be an epic but here it is reduced to fast scenes of a passion that transits between unexplained intensity and challenged impossibility. Although time is linear, it occurs in uneven spaces and with no clue as to when the scene occurs.<br/><br/>It is as if the script wants to prove at every moment that reality always finds a way to demolish all the plans and dreams. This is how the group of Polish traditions that intends to represent the true rural art ends up being co-opted by the communist party, unfurling a gigantic poster of Lenin. The musician Wiktor invites his beloved Zula to cross the border to the West in Berlin (there was no wall yet), but the girl has other priorities.<br/><br/>From this first mismatch, others occur. Paris does not match the ideal dreamed by Wiktor, who becomes a pianist in a club and composes soundtracks for horror movies. Eventually, they get together, but the relationship does not work out. The musician tries to return to Poland, goes to Yugoslavia to attend a performance of the Mazurek troupe just to see Zula, but none of this works either.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is breathtakingly beautiful. After going through all the misfortunes and managing to overcome geographical, political and psychological barriers, the couple, named after Pawlikowski's parents, finally solve the problem of remaining together. Forevermore."

""Cold War"" tells a love story between two post-World War II Poles, their encounters in opposing situations, their forbidden passion, misfits, romances and separations that revolve in a period of almost 20 years aligned with Pawel's great technique are the ingredients perfect for making a great movie.<br/><br/>A photographic dedication that uses black in white with full cinematic notion, is like watching a movie from the 1940s, the use of film filming contributes even more to its rustic and playful beauty at the same time. A firm plot that is based on a great editing and editing that make the film not be heavy, although the same is repetitive, you do not feel its weight, but may lose some interest in the course of the work. And that was the great sin for me, the non-use of external script resources to branch out the plot, which develops in a medium way its characters.<br/><br/>The duo of actors are very well in the film, just like their director of photography, director and composer who do an excellent job that together make up a different, daring, delicate and cruel film.

"jadepietro","8","1","3","19 February 2019"," Love Hurts
","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A beautifully made dysfunctional love story.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Director Pawel Pawlikowski used his own parents' love story as his inspiration for his tragic tale, Cold War. Set in 1946 Warsaw, a music teacher becomes enamored of his young talented student. (Call me a prude, but this serious lapse of judgment never becomes an issue and this Humbert and Lolita relationship shrouds this unhealthy affair throughout the film for me.)<br/><br/>The film follows the lives of Wictor and Zula for the next 20+ years and the changing landscape of a world at war. Caught up in the politics and upheaval of Cold War Poland and the rise of Communism, these two self-centered Bohemian souls fall in love while they battle their own personal demons.<br/><br/>The film is superbly acted by Tomasz Kot and Joanna Kulig as the two leads. Their mercurial relationship is shown episodically and the actors fill in any gaps in their characters' many mood swings and ill-advised decisions which result in many severe consequences along the bumpy road to love. All is gloriously filmed in b& w by Lukasz Zal. The stunning imagery gives the film a somber look and captures the bleakness of the period most effectively.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Janusz Glowacki, Pioti Borkowski, and the director has some lovely dialog in its dramatic storytelling, although some clarity is lost in translation with the film's episodic structure. At times, the jumps in time frames are jarring and in need of fine tuning. Also, the characters, as written, are basically callous and too self-absorbed to really care about. Even the beginnings of their relationship may come into question by some moviegoers due to their noticeable age difference (adult vs. teenager) and ongoing destructive nature which kept them at an emotional distance from this reviewer. (I just could not justify this dance by two sexual predators, even if its powerful ending is filled with pathos and sadness. Much should be credited to the palpable chemistry by the talented Ms. Kulig and Mr. Kot and Mr. Pawlikowski's masterful direction.)<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Cold War is a beautifully realized and well crafted love story that makes a solid case for its two doomed and very dysfunctional lovers."

","This movie threw me, left me speechless, i couldnt even cry.
Its interesting what happens in cold war. It shows how two people fall in love and even though they undeniably want to be together, they fight for something else as well. For keeping their own sense of self. He cant stay in poland, he has to go to paris in order to develop himself as an artist. She at the same time, cant just follow him in this, ""who will i be?"". Fear of losing own sense of self, identity, value, meaning. She eventually goes to paris and cant handle the feeling of loss, she was a big fish in a small pond back home, now she struggles finding value for herself. Finally they both end up sacrificing their integrity, their own identity in order to be together, which is what finally kills them. The struggle of 'Cant live with or without you'.
But why didnt they just move on, fall in love with someone else and have nice memories of a great love?
When its about the love of your life i guess love is stronger than anything else, even at times of war."
"sweidman-28016","8","1","3","19 February 2019"," Another Amazing Foreign Film!
","Cold War Review:<br/><br/>Cold War is a Polish film that follows Wiktor, a music director, who falls in love with Zulu, a singer. He tried to persuade her to flee communist Poland and go to France with him during the 1950s Cold War. This film is nominated for three Oscars this year including Best Foreign Film, Best Cinematography, and a big surprise for Best Director. Naturally I wanted to see this based on all the buzz it's been getting. People have either said they love this film or don't like this film on first viewing. I loved it! It had an interesting story throughout. Pawel Pawlikowski co-wrote and directed. He did a phenomenal job. I can definitely see why he got the directing nomination, though if I had to swap out a director for someone who is nominated, I would choose him. It's a music based story so it caught my attention right away. I knew very little about it going in. I saw the trailer once and read about it a few times and knew that it was about the Cold War and a singer. With it being a foreign film I didn't think I'd have the opportunity to see it in theaters, but I'm glad to have had the chance. Joanna Kulig was amazing and the best part. She was very good at playing singer Zula and I don't understand why she wasn't talked about more in the Oscar race. Yalitza Aparicio was talked about way more for Roma, another big foreign film this year, since it was her first movie ever. Though I thought Yalitza was better Joanna was still very good but this film wasn't praised for its acting. I can compare this film to Roma since they're competing for Best Foreign Film (I'll explain more later). Tomasz Kot as Wiktor was also another great part of the film. I liked his character and thought he was a great casting choice. The two actors were great with acting but I didn't feel their love connection entirely at first. It was just kind of there. I did like the two together and it added to the film, but it was just kind of thrown there. The cinematography was beautiful and I can see why it's nominated. Just like Roma it's all in black and white. I love black and white movies and it added effect with the time period. My vote is for Roma to win Best Cinematography because that was a beautifully shot film. There was no score to this film, just like Roma, but I loved the singing and song choices. The song performances, whether it was solo or for a concert, were another one of my favorite parts. Overall this was a very good film. My only issues were the love story being thrown in right away at the beginning and there were a few slow scenes. It was what some may consider to be a ""slow movie"" which I like but there were a couple lengthy scenes. I don't know when anyone would really have the chance to see this film but I would highly recommend this beautiful foreign film.<br/><br/>My Grade: A<br/><br/>Now to explain the beta between Cold War and Roma. As I explained earlier, they're both foreign films nominated for three of the same awards (Foreign Film, Cinematography, and Directing). This has been the year for foreign films. Now Roma is also up for Best Picture which some people feel is wrong. I'm personally fine with a foreign film being nominated and potentially winning the award. What I don't feel is right is a foreign film winning Best Foreign Film (it's basically their Best Picture) and Best Picture. Right now for foreign Film it's between those two movies and it's hard to tell. Roma is currently predicated as number one to win both Foreign Film and Picture. My thought and many others think that if during the awards ceremony that night, if Roma wins Best Foreign Film, it won't win Best Picture rather, in my opinion, Green Book. If Cold War wins Foreign Film that means Roma will win Best Picture which would be amazing since that's never happened and it's also a Netflix film. It opens a door for both foreign films and streaming services. This will be a very interesting year for the Oscars. Hope you liked this review and comment your thoughts."

","The trailer for Cold War suggests a languid, intimate romance set to a series of shuffling cool-jazz ballads.

The passionate romance suggested by the trailer is certainly at the core, but layered around it are themes of obsession, disordered personality, art vs. politics, nationalism, classism, exploitation, and tyranny. The film accomplishes so much in such a short period of time that it's hard not to marvel at it, even if the break-neck pacing can be a bit emotionally distancing. Strip away the sociopolitical commentary and what you're left with is a powerful exploration of the pleasures and dangers of all-consuming love.

","The message of the film is so lovely that it makes me weep.<br/><br/>Since long I've been thinking of TRUE artists, as well as TRUE scientists, TRUE businesspeople, TRUE educators... wondering about their ways of choosing ""a side"" when it comes to the happening of war or such political matters. I always believe that those ones have their own side, not the two political sides. Their side is the heart and how free it can be to beat the rhythm of love. That's an important messgage many people may have learnt but we do need to make sure every next generation, young artists and young people with expertises, should acknowlege, understand and consider it as the meaning of their working life.<br/><br/>Talented artists can make a good living anywhere because all and every human society -- no matter which side or what political background -- needs art. How beautiful it is in this movie, the film makers choose music as an incarnation of art and the context of the Cold War in Europe to tell the story of artists and how they evolve from 'talented' to 'true' artists.<br/><br/>After all, Cold War is just a war like any other wars. After watching this movie, as a Vietnamese I imagine what if this love story should happen in the Vietnam War, two sides are the South and North Vietnam, then the couple's hearts would still be theirs and the flow would be the same, as lovely and warm as true artists' hearts.<br/><br/>Another thing to say, artists are supposed to be born to feel lonely.

","I know it is a strange comparison to make - one movie is set in a Cold War Poland and another in Hollywood but I felt that the underlying stories of the movies were weirdly similar. I must admit that walking out of La La Land I felt disappointed, perhaps the most disappointed I had been with a movie that year, the idea was great, the execution not so much. On the other hand Zimna wojna delivers on all levels. The characters, the visuals, the story and emotion. Coming from a European country I would suspect that non-europeans will have a hard time appreciating this movie as it talks about life in a very non-american/western way and presents it from a point of view of a Polish person. There is certainly a possibility of a culture clash.<br/><br/>Overall I think that if there is a tiny flaw in this movie it is its story. It is very good but at the same time it does not have that extra transcendent element to it. It is more of a poem than a novel. The story is the reason I gave this movie a 9 rather than a 10. I will certainly watch it again and depending on how I enjoy it the second time around I might change the rating to either an 8 or a 10. I am very happy with this movie which is, I think, a bright spot in a year full of dull remakes and superhero movies that are destined to make billions."
"dromasca","8","1","3","22 January 2019"," love in times of cold war
","Pawel Pawlikowski continues a tradition of remarkable film directors that left their mark in the history of cinema in the second half of the 20th century and made of the Polish film school one of the best in Eastern Europe, competing in value and number of remarkable movies only with the Soviet school of cinema. Andrzej Wajda, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and young Roman Polanski made wonderful films despite Communist censorship, fighting and tricking the censors and using cinema as a mean of social and political protest using the tools of art. 30 years passed since the fall of the Communist regimes in Poland and the rest of Europe, but film makers from that part of the world continue to get back obsessively to those times. They do it now with a different perspective, and free of political constraints. Did time heal the wounds? Maybe, at least in part, but there are lessons to be learned, traumas carried over generations and realities that perpetuate in mentality that invite to thought and debate.<br/><br/>'Cold War' (the original title is 'Zimna wojna') tells a non-conventional love story that takes place in troubled times. Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) is a musician and co-founder of a musical institution for talented young people trying to promote authentic Polish folklore - music and dance - in the conditions of increased ideological pressures. Zula (Joanna Kulig) is one of his pupils, a young and beautiful girl, just out of a troubled childhood. Their relationship goes against all the conventions because of age gap, social status, cultural level, puritan rules of morality. Poland is hardly a place were their relationship can blossom .Aspiring for freedom they will cross the Iron Curtain on both directions, but hardly find happiness or accomplishment in the Paris of the 1950s either. The impossibility of their love - is it caused by the hardship of time, or by personal incompatibility? I did not get a clear answer even after the last frame of the film.<br/><br/>What I liked. The whole cinematographic concept - black and wide, narrow screen format - fits well the story and makes a reverence also to the cinema of the period when the action takes place. The music is fabulous. It starts with real folklore songs, continues with the processed folklore mixed with the hymns to Stalin which was promoted in the Communist countries at that time, switches to jazz and French chansons for the time spent by the heroes in Paris, and returns to the 'light music' of the early 60s in Poland. Music tells as much about the period as the story itself. The settings and the atmosphere are carefully designed, from the muddy desolated landscape of Poland in 1949, passing through the Berlin of 1952 still bearing the scars of war, the Paris of the 1950s undergoing the Americanized healing, and back to the Poland of the late 50s and 60s, with its own version of the Gulag but also with the false shining of life 'normalized' under Communist control. All these are realistic and credible.<br/><br/>What I liked less. Although both Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot are fine actors and their individual performance are good, their relationship does not look at any moment too credible on screen. Hard to tell if their lack of chemistry is intentional or not, but they never seem to fit one with the other, and their love story looks as cold as the war which gives the title to the movie. This surprising lack of vibration lessens the final impression about a movie with many qualities and certainly worth watching."
"cabassotti","9","1","3","20 January 2019"," Elegant strangeness
","I love how unusual and strange this film is. And yet, at the same time, it keeps its argument so classical and simple. The ellipses do not let us inside the couple, we keep seeing them both from the outside, with single plans and killer glances that are worth a whole dialogue. But its formal violence it's softened by the music that flows and evolves from the original folk music at the beginning to the yé-yé at the end. It's almost a musical.<br/><br/>Crazy love is always relatable (or should be). It's a film that speaks of a suffering that reminds us of a thousand sufferings, and still manages to make it exist in a political world. It's the Casablanca of our time."

The beauty of human love and art, and the ugliness of Communism are interspersed.<br/><br/>The doomed love-affair has some of the aspects of La La Land, but instead of the nonsense of tinsel-town keeping the lovers apart, it is the damnation of Communism that dooms them. Damnation is an applicable term to use because a destroyed church plays an important counter-point to the Communist world.<br/><br/>Zula, the female lead, is a femme fatale who leads Wiktor, the male lead, to destruction in several ways. Near the end of the movie Wiktor's hands are crushed by the Communists (remember, he's a pianist) and at the very end, Zula leads Wiktor into a double suicide (or is it?).<br/><br/>The question in my mind is why is Zula such a destructive and self-destructive person? I think the answer is that she is the true product of the Communist system, a fatally disturbed system produces fatally disturbed people."
"gortx","Null","1","3","16 January 2019"," Pawel's companion piece to IDA seemlessly evokes the era
","Director Pawel Pawlikowski's follow up to his sublime IDA is another tale of Post WWII Poland. It's also rendered in B&W (by IDA cinematographer Lukasz Zal) and the (co) Lead character is another enigmatic woman.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a Soviet/Polish apparatchik project to put on a propaganda show highlighting the peasant songs of old Poland. Once the troupe's artistic director Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) lays eyes on vivacious contestant Zula (Joanna Kulig) he is hooked. A heated love affair ignites almost immediately. Over the course of over a decade, we follow Wiktor and Zula's tempestuous relationship which continues despite extended separations. Using their connections and wiles, the pair also drift back and forth over the Iron Curtain border. But, as the line goes - no matter where you go, there you are. Their current location matters less than their volatile chemistry. Amour fou knows know boundaries.<br/><br/>Normally, a short summary doesn't cover close to the full breadth of the story, but, COLD WAR is almost that schematic. Like IDA (82 minutes), Pawlikowski's latest is compactly efficient (89 minutes). There are, of course, many details a synopsis can't convey, but, this isn't a movie so much about plotting as about conveying a feeling. The symbolism about how their fiery history shadows the Soviet era of Poland goes unspoken, but, looms over their coupling. There are moments here that are breathlessly cinematic. Depending on one's own personal catalog of cinema, there are scenes here that evoke memories of Bergman, Antonioni, Resnais and Pawlikowski's fellow countryman, Andrzej Wajda (who passed only two years ago). COLD WAR doesn't just embrace 50s & 60s European cinema - it's in its DNA. Pawlikowski isn't simply making a pastiche, it's in his soul. And, that soul permeates the entire experience. (the movie is inspired by the filmmaker's parents)<br/><br/>Kulig and Kot are superb, even with the fairly sparse plotting. Again, it's more the feeling they convey more than mere dialogue. Zal's digital camerawork blends seamlessly with his Director's vision, and similarly evokes the work of his euro predecessors behind the camera such as Nykvist, Vierny, DiVenanzo etc.. The one drawback here is the movie's brevity. While it worked fully with IDA, here the abbreviated runtime seems incomplete (with IDA there was only one main character and the time span is much shorter). While one applauds Pawlikowski's instinct to not underline and highlight each and every beat, there are some sequences (particularly the musical scenes) where it would have been richer to let them play out. It's a small, but, significant flaw in an otherwise excellent production and certainly doesn't lessen the artistry on ample and loving display here."

"ferguson-6","9","1","5","3 January 2019"," star-crossed lovers
","Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't enjoy a good love story? The wonderfully talented filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski proves to us the massive difference between a story of 'good love' and a 'good story' of love. With two lead characters based (somewhat) on his own parents (and named after them), we witness how two people can be simultaneously meant for each other AND not meant to be together. It's the story of a man and woman forever connected, yet painfully mismatched.<br/><br/>Director Pawlikowski's extraordinary last film, IDA (2013) won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film, and this time he starts us off with a curious montage of Polish folk musicians (including bagpipes and violins) performing their songs ... each in stark and static close-ups. This strange opening only makes sense to us much later, as we realize what a key element music plays in the numerous shifts in tone - the chapters - of the story.<br/><br/>Former lovers Wiktor (Polish star Tomasz Kot) and Irena (Agata Kulesza, IDA) are co-directors of a Polish song and dance performance team, and as they are conducting auditions, Wiktor is immediately drawn to Zula (Joanna Kulig), one who has a pure singing voice but a questionable past to go with no previous dancing experience. Irena recognizes lust when she sees it, but Wiktor stands firm that he perceives Zula's stage presence as something special. The film covers the period of 1949 through 1964, and in that time we watch as Wiktor and Irena are both proven right. Mr. Kot and especially Ms. Kulig deliver extraordinary performances ... truly captivating.<br/><br/>Director Pawlikowski offers up a love story unlike anything we've ever seen on the big screen. Wiktor and Zula experience the most tumultuous and romantic ride through Poland (the company first performs in Warsaw), East Berlin, Paris, Yugoslavia, back to Paris, and back to Poland. There were likely some other stops along the way, but those are the ones I made note of. Sometimes they are together, other times they are separated. It's 1952 East Berlin where they formulate a plan to defect ... only Zula is a no show, and they don't meet up again for a couple of years. In one Paris rendezvous a few years later, Zula explains to Wiktor that she married another man ""for us"". Somehow this makes sense.<br/><br/>It's best to know no other specifics of this relationship. Star-crossed lovers is not a phrase used much these days, and perhaps even that description falls short. What causes someone to sell their soul for another - or sacrifice so much? How can so much pain and humiliation be accompanied by so much longing and yearning? What's fascinating is that the film's music styles shift in tone right along with their relationship. Sometimes the music is political (with a Stalin poster) - as that is the wall between them, and then later Zula is dancing totally free to ""Rock Around the Clock"".<br/><br/>There are no wasted words here. The black and white images of cinematographer Lukasz Zal complements each segment with the appropriate softness or harshness depending on the characters' emotions of the moment. Certainly at the heart of this story is the role of memories ... how snapshots in time can impact our feelings, at times causing us to be oblivious to rational thought. As viewers, we experience a constant feeling of impending doom - even during the good times for Wiktor and Zula. The unusual editing style of extended cuts to black signal shifts in time ... the blackness held for an extra beat or two, allowing us to brace for the next chapter. Polish jazz pianist Marcin Masecki scored the film - a crucial element not just because our two main characters are musicians, but because the music guides us through the lives we see. The film recalls the crown jewel of mismatched lovers in CASABLANCA as two lovers apparently meant to be together, but real life circumstances prove too much. Yet another excellent film from Pawel Pawlikowski."

The plot is standard and contains no surprises (except maybe one) - just your average 100 % artificial extruded will-they-or-won't-they product.

The supporting roles (of which there are few) are adequate, but nothing more than that. However, the main flaw of this film is simple - there is absolutely zero chemistry between the leads!

","The cold war period is used as a backdrop for a story about 2 passionate lovers, who get separated at some point. Is their love strong enough to survive the separation?<br/><br/>Unfortunately this love story is A BIT lacking in drama. Just a bit. It only lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes. That's extremely SHORT for a dramatic story and I really missed the buildup in drama, storywise speaking. Lots of plot turns happened too quickly. And especially the dramatic relationship between the 2 lovers didnt get enough screen time in my opinion. The director admitted in an interview that he cut out 30% of the scenes and although it didnt hurt the movie, the dramatic devellopment felt a bit rushed at times. You have to really pay attention to get the dramatic cues, because many dramatic plot turns happen in merely seconds.<br/><br/>The actors, who portray these 2 lovers deliver good performances, but they dont ooze charisma. A dramatic love story is at the core of this movie, but I am not experiencing any truly dramatic romantic scenes, which should have brouhgt me to tears or should have swept me off my feet. I missed the usual intense emotions that go along with such a story. The director made a deliberate choice to portray it this way and it has it's peculiar charm, but I was baffled by the absence of emotions as well.<br/><br/>What is truly impressive about this movie though are the visuals and the music. Only a few genius directors are capable of creating such heavenly, beautiful images, which are almost physical in nature. I could almost touch, smell and feel the images, they are THAT powerful and breathtakingly beautiful. I still get goosebumps thinking about them. The music score is truly magnificent as well.

Remember the great days of Foreign movie stars like Sophia Loren and Marcello MastrioannI and directors like Visconti and Fellini ?<br/><br/>Well all these ingredients are evident in the Polish film Cold War with the pairing of Joanna Kulig as the luminous Zula a beautiful talented , calculating charismatic but damaged Polish refugee and Tomasz Kot as Wiktor the musician and her handsome rescuer and totally obsessed lover.
When we first meet Zula in 1949 desperate to join a Polish Folk Academy while on probation for stabbing her father , when Zula is asked why ? her chilling reply is
"" He mistook me for my mother and the knife showed him the difference""
The story filmed magnificently in Monochrome and on a smaller screen ratio 1:37:1 in keeping with the era which covers 15 years is a love story Romeo and Juliet style , which may explain my only criticism a very odd and puzzling ending.<br/><br/>The director Pawel Pawlikowski has created a beautiful atmosphere and ambience to suit the era
and chosen a superb cast to portray the characters.<br/><br/>I loved the 2 music styles in this movie the Polish folk songs and dancing in the beginning and the sultry jazz in The Paris night clubs that follow on as the couples story unfolds over the years.
This film is nominated for 3 Academy awards Best Foreign Movie , Best Director and Cinematography .
Ihope it wins Best Foreign Movie , it probably won't because Roma a film , which left me totally cold and bored is the favourite of The Academy I suspect purely because of its Mexicaness and as a protest to Donald Trump."

","""Cold War"" 2018 release from Poland; original title ""Zimna wojna""; 90 min.) brings the story of Wiktor and Zula. As the movie opens, it is ""Poland, 1946"", and Wictor and several others are driving around in rural Poland, taping various local (mostly folksy) songs. Then they go recruit rural singers to form an ensemble of singing and dancing. Among those auditioning is Zula, and she catches Wiktor's attention right away/ Meanwhile, the Communist Party sees a great opportunity to use the ensemble for political purposes... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: the last time we heard from writer-director Pawel Pawlikowski was when the stunning film ""Ida"" was released some 3-4 years ago,, to universal acclaim (and winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie). It was one of my favorite films of that year. Now he returns with another post-WW II story, but that is where the parallel ends. Let me state upfront that ""Cold War"" is plot-heavy, and hence I will not say another word what happens or doesn't happen. Instead let me heap praise on its two lead performers: Joanna Kullig (as Zula) and Tomacsa Kot (as Wiktor) are both outstanding. The movie, like ""Ida"" is shot in striking B&W, and moreover shows in an almost (but not quite) 1:1 ratio. One caution: there is a LOT of singing and dancing in the movie (although the movie is NOT a musical), so if you don't care for music, you may want to consider something else. At the end of the movie, we see that Pawlikowski dedicates the film ""to my parents"", and in fact the movie is loosely based on them.<br/><br/>""Cold War"" premiered at last year's Cannes festival, to (once again) immediate and universal acclaim (Pawlikowski won ""Best Director""). No big surprise then that when the Oscar nominations were announced recently, ""Cold War"" picked up 3 nominations: Best Foreign Language Movie, Best Director, and Best Cinematography. I don't know that it will win, though, as it is up against ""Roma"", an even better film (with 10 Oscar nominations). Regardless, ""Cold War"" is another gem from writer-director Pawel Pawiilowski. :Cold War: opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended ok but not great (about 15 people). If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film shot in beautiful B&W, do yourself a favor and check out ""Cold War"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Cold War"" is a WINNER."

No, this is not a typical romance film, the story raises questions from the viewer about love, war, and distance. Cold war is not only visually beautiful, (credits to cinematographer lukasz zal) but the story sequence with the timeline is perfect. Tomasz Kot role is outstanding as a sensitive romantic who would do anything for love. on the other hand, Joanna Kulig role impressed me as a disturbed young woman between two fires, love and her future.<br/><br/>one of the best things about cold war storyline is the way it presents the story without details, you feel the change in the small hints and details thrown around like puzzle.<br/><br/>Generally, a perfectly crafted film with an excellent and not ordinary storyline and incredible performances, definitely worth your time."
