"MR_Heraclius","6","42","49","21 February 2020"," Not a good movie, honestly.
","This is a bad film, I know that right off the bat. Some pretty bad acting, camera work and scene slow-mo, ridiculous action parts, like Alice jumping 30 feet in the air over a fence. But, these Resident Evil films are pure guilty pleasure films. I loved the Nemesis creature (Matt). That all this movie is, pure guilty pleasure."
"Darth_Nebuchadnezzar","6","120","170","30 September 2004"," 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong, but it certainly doesn't do everything right.
","Following the success of the 2002 adaptation from video game to film that was 'Resident Evil', comes its tantalizingly-trailered sequel, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. I have to say, I was entranced by the trailer of this film. I seriously thought that this film had the potential to rise above 'Mortal Kombat' (1995) and 'Resident Evil' as the best cinematic event to spawn from a video game. 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong, but it certainly doesn't do everything right. <br/><br/>Let's start with a brief synopsis. Firstly, this film picks up literally days after the first drops us off. 'Apocalypse' opens with a rehashed explanation of what we learned about the two main characters in the original, Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt Addison (Eric Mabius). Again, we are told that this Umbrella Corporation is an international super-power and that Alice is (or more accurately was) the head of security in an underground research facility dubbed ""The Hive"", which harbored research and specimens pertaining to biological weaponry. After that, we are treated to the scientists who wheeled Addison away at the closure of 'Evil', opening the zombie-infested annals of ""The Hive"". Immediately before the audience 'knows' what happens (its pretty obvious and is given away in the final shots of the first 'RE') we transition into a militaristic evacuation of important personnel associated with Umbrella Corp. After a few assorted events that do (and simultaneously do not) move the plot line (a 'do not' being the lead-scientist asking how bad the situation is). After this, we are introduced to nearly a half-dozen other characters, including a renegade police officer (Sienna Guillory), the remaining members of an elite task force (Oded Fehr, Zack Ward), a VERY stereotypical Black man (Mike Epps) and a hulking creature (which, if you paid attention to the first 'RE', you would be aware of its appearance) that totes both a rocket-launcher and a hand-held chain gun named the ""Nemesis"". <br/><br/>As far as performances go, the aforementioned actors and actresses do well with the material that they are given. Guillory has Helen of Troy (not from the film 'Troy') on her resume, as Jovovich has Joan of Arc, Fehr has the mummy hunter, Ardeth Bay from the 'Mummy' series and Epps is credible in several comedies. There is no real emotion in the script, so the viewers really can't ask for any emotion from the actors (sadly true). <br/><br/>That is where 'Apocalypse' stumbles, and in many places, falls on it's face.<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the audience until the last ten minutes (which is a near-complete turn around from the original, which actually evoked SOME thought from the audience). It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot 'em up. The small sub-plots really vary from little to no relevance in the story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of 'oh no, my friend was bitten and eventually, I'll have to kill him just before he bites me' situation, and the big action/set pieces are blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot, with their arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an ass-kicking femme fatal, and finishes the film being...oh, you guessed it, an ass-kicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine (Guillory) is another one of these masculinely tough females, although sans Alice's super powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the epitome of black stereotypes, played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic, however that my favorite bit of 'Apocalypse' involved a reference to another video game franchise. <br/><br/>Again, 'RE: Apocalypse' is not completely bad. Although few, it has its moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience, which was something needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time (although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and his head piece actually shifts visibly on the actor's shoulders) and makes a formidable villain for a good margin of the film (although his closure is a bit weak). Many of the action sequences had great potential...but the majority of those action scenes were fast-cut, much like 'AvP', so much so that it was very hard at moments to see exactly what was happening in the shot. <br/><br/>'Apocalypse' suffices much more as an action movie than it does as a horror film, and it struggles to keep interest, even for someone who has faithfully played the video games. I will be glad to admit, though...'Apocalypse' has the BIGGEST, most unexpected scare of 2004. I won't say when or where...but I am glad to have experienced it. 'Apocalypse' isn't exactly worth all eight dollars of your admission fee, but it doesn't make a bad Saturday afternoon matinee...6/10."

","The sequel to Resident Evil - in which a group of scientists and special forces get trapped in a giant underground facility overrun with zombies and mutants - is pretty much what you'd expect. After being captured by the Umbrella Corporation at the end of the first film, almost-sole-survivor Milla Jovovich (the only supermodel in the world who you can take seriously as an action heroine) wakes up in an abandoned laboratory in Raccoon City to find that the zombie-animating ""t-virus"" has spread to the surface. Half the city are already zombified and killing the other half, and Umbrella Corporation has sealed off the city limits and is planning to ""sanitise"" the area. Hooking up with a rag-tag group of survivors, Jovovich makes a deal with a rogue Umbrella scientist who promises to get them out of town as long as they rescue his missing daughter who's hiding somewhere in the ruins. Meanwhile Umbrella has its own plans for the lovely Miss Milla, involving a seven-foot armour-clad mutant called the Nemesis who's using the infested city as a training ground. Much shooting/fighting/exploding ensues, and - just like in the first film - the mysterious cliffhanger ending leaves things wide open for another sequel.<br/><br/>Probably because it's based on a Japanese video game, this movie isn't afraid to embrace the clich√©s that Hollywood's spent the last decade or so trying to avoid. Lurching zombies, machine gun-toting monsters, smarmy suit-wearing villains, hard-as-nails soldiers and a wisecracking streetwise black dude are all essential ingredients, as well as not one but TWO sexy ass-kicking heroines. While Jovovich rides in to save the day on a motorcycle and carries so many guns it's a wonder she doesn't fall over, Sienna Guillory (as tough bitch cop Jill Valentine) has the dubious honour of performing various athletic action sequences in a miniskirt and boob tube. Am I complaining? Hell no.<br/><br/>To be honest, it's really quite refreshing to see a movie like this in this day and age. Like the timelessly cheesy horror/action flicks of John Carpenter, the Resident Evil franchise throws realism and political correctness to the wind and just has fun pitting Pretty Girls With Big Guns against Ugly Monsters With Big Teeth. Be honest - unless you're a metrosexual poseur or a card-carrying member of the PC Police, you probably love this stuff as much as I do."
"tay-sedai","7","13","16","26 May 2013"," Not bad
","I wouldn't call this a brilliant movie, but it certainly kept me watching from start to finish. Michelle Rodriguez's character is replaced by another kick-arse heroine to work alongside Jovovich's Alice. There's also a new super-evil dude to contend with. Naturally the biggest baddies of all are the people who work for the Umbrella corporation! And, man, those zombie dogs are just freaky!<br/><br/>In this movie we get to know a bit more about how the T-Virus came to be, and get a new perspective on how it can be used for good and not just bad. Naturally, though, it's mostly all bad!<br/><br/>As usual, there's a lot of action and a lot of death. And the Umbrella Corporation sure is good at twisting the facts of the truth. I'm intrigued to know what happens next.<br/><br/>So I'm ready to watch movie #3."
"Jrdn853","8","57","85","22 February 2005"," Resident Evil: Apocalypse (of plot)
","Hollywood is known for its summertime action ""flicks"", and recent action films such as The Matrix began to show a hopeful turn towards a trend of thoughtful plots and interesting stories. Unfortunately, the large success of Resident Evil: Apocalypse may very well be the deathblow to this promising new trend. In a sense, the title speaks for itself; Resident Evil: Apocalypse may very well be the apocalypse of intelligent action movies.<br/><br/>After a new virus breaks out in a large industrialized city, citizens begin mutating into cannibalistic, flesh-eating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation, consisting of the people most directly responsible for the outbreak, takes measures to quarantine the city, turning it into a horrific sanitarium. The story follows several characters as they attempt to survive and escape the city with the help of an unseen ally who keeps contact with them from outside the city. Things further complicate when ""Nemesis"", the movie's biggest, toughest monster, arrives for the sole purpose of killing just about everything he perceives as a threat.<br/><br/>The plot of Resident Evil: Apocalypse is, perhaps, the single worst piece of writing recently played out before the eyes of unfortunate movie fans. From the very beginning, the story begs questions that are never answered: who gave the Umbrella Corporation a building permit for a gigantic wall that would circle the city and with which they could, at a moment's notice, lock everyone inside? Why does Alice come crashing into a church through a stained-glass window, on a motorcycle, ""armed to the teeth"" with weaponry, to rescue the protagonists with perfect timing, despite the fact that she has never met them before and was, in the previous scene, walking around in the street with only a shotgun and no motorcycle at all? These and many more mind-boggling questions are completely ignored; the person who was in charge of this film's continuity should never work in Hollywood again. In fact, Resident Evil: Apocalypse has more plot holes than moldy Swiss cheese. However, even when ignoring the numerous plot holes -- which is almost an impossibility -- the story itself is still laughable, revolving partly around an insipid ""fight for survival"" that seems to rely on the main group splitting up and one of the subgroups being brutally slaughtered for no good reason, with the other part being about Alice (a character invented by the script-writer, as she was never in the game it is very loosely-taken from) and her relationship with the monster ""Nemesis"". Surprisingly, the director managed to craft a story that is significantly less interesting the one presented in the video game version. To cap off all the ""excitement"", the movie reaches its climax a full fifteen minutes before the end of the film! After a handful of survivors have escaped, Alice is caught and put in a lab, where she not only manages to escape, but also to manifest psychic powers while quipping off several lines that were used to advertise the movie in commercials. What was the purpose of this 15-minute epilogue? To set up the next movie in the series - a completely unnecessary task, as the film has already made it clear that there is absolutely no help for the next sequel in terms of quality. In a way, it could be said that the one thing the plot truly accomplished was setting the stage for even more cinematic fodder in the future.<br/><br/>The acting was not bad, and, in general, was as good as it could have been, given the material the actors had to work with. Although Alice is mildly interesting (do largely to her reflections) and well played by Milla Jovovich, the rest of the characters were mostly stale archetypes. The most blatant example is the character of L.J., played by actor Mike Epps, who embodies every ""black"" stereotype that is popular today. This character's only true purpose is comic relief, and to that respect, he does it dryly.<br/><br/>The cinematography offers a wide variety of different camera shots, as well as providing a constant supply of ""eye candy"". In what is easily the highlight of the film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse shows some impressive-looking stunts, such as a scene of Alice running down the side of a sky scraper with either the intent to kill, or the intent to break her legs. Either way, the scene was a joy ride for the vision. Truthfully, the only badly shot scenes that come to mind are the blurry scene (unnecessary, ugly, and pointless), and the climatic fight scene at the end (badly cut and confusing). Overall, though, the cinematography was decently good, which is likely the cause for this film making so much money in the box office.<br/><br/>The setting was exactly what you would expect for an apocalyptic zombie movie - a big city with lots of undead people. The sets maintained a Gothic look throughout, and few scenes took place in daylight. Thankfully, the lighting was very well done, so the film maintained a dark, night-time look while simultaneously allowing the viewers to perfectly see all that was happening. Sets based on real buildings, such as schools and police stations, all looked exactly as they should. Resident Evil: Apocalypse had a big budget, and that fact is made apparent by the great sets and props.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, nothing saves the movie from its horrible plot. A plot should provide any movie with its base, and with a plot so holey and incoherent, everything that could have made Resident Evil: Apocalypse good simply falls apart. Despite the big budget, some reasonably well-known actors, and a license and subject-matter with a cult following, nothing can gloss over the essential flaws that keep this movie from any kind of greatness. People who prefer to see mindless exaggerated action sequences, devoid of any decent plot, will likely enjoy Resident Evil: Apocalypse. However, those interested in intelligent, well-written stories will do well to look elsewhere."
"politehere","9","20","27","2 April 2014"," Resident Evil Apocalypse Has a Lot to Offer
","I've watched Resident Evil 1 to 5 many times, and I have RE 4 and 5 in 3D. Having seen all these movies numerous times, I now have come to the realization that Resident Evil Apocalypse is my most favorite in the franchise. Granted, the first movie in a franchise is usually also the most enjoyable because it introduces us to the movie's universe. As such, the first half of Resident Evil 1 surpasses all others and can be watched many times without regret; however, while Resident Evil 1 is one of my favorite movies of all time, it fails to deliver enough thrills in its second half; and this is exactly what RE Apocalypse compensates for. Apart from that, RE Apocalypse has a great first half, because it is one thing for the T-virus to spread inside the Hive and a completely different thing for it to spread to the entire city. That being said, RE Apocalypse is thrilling and engaging from start to finish, because the universe in which the story unfolds is entirely different from the one in the original RE.<br/><br/>Also, while we had some bland characters in RE 1, such as the medic or the first guy that is pulled in and killed by a horde of zombies, almost all of the characters in RE 2 are colorful and each of them contributes to some aspect of the movie. It also feels good to distance oneself from the claustrophobic feeling one gets in RE 1. RE Apocalypse is an action-packed horror movie that has a lot to offer. We are presented with a stronger and more agile version of Alice who can perform fascinating Kung Fu kicks and acrobatic moves, the most interesting of which, in my opinion, is where Alice is running down a vertical building. The Nemesis is a real life replica of the most feared monster from Resident Evil games. Jill Valentine is simply perfect and makes a video game character come to life. Moreover, the sense of humor helps the movie to not get boring. I remember the first time that I watched this movie, it left me wanting for more. It has a cliff-hanger ending, and you can't help but wish to know what happens to Alice next. This is very important, given the fact that many great movies let the audience down by a disappointing or predictable ending. The movie has been shot beautifully and the background music is exciting. This movie is strongly recommended to all action-horror fans right after RE 1."
"thefifthtoon","1","14","18","18 January 2007"," The Resident Evil movies are a blow to all fans of the video games.
","I first saw this movie about two years ago, but I didn't bother to write a review about it or anything. To tell the truth, I was so mad at the movie (and those who made it) that I couldn't watch it without yelling at the television screen.<br/><br/>Being an ardent fan of the Resident Evil video games - I've played and beaten all but one - I was not only disappointed by this movie and it's predecessor (which I haven't seen enough times to review, fortunately), but I was angered by the complete disregard that the people who created the film had for the story of the games.<br/><br/>Alice doesn't exist in the Resident Evil video games. She has never existed in the video games. At first, I had held out a hope of tying her into the video game plot, perhaps via the T-Veronica Virus of Resident Evil: Code Veronica (for the Dreamcast and Playstation 2), but they let me down. All they created her for was to have a sexy, uber-powerful female lead - a Mary Sue for the big screen.<br/><br/>They introduce Jill in this movie... for what reason? Oh, right, so they can get the hopes up of fans of the video games, because maybe, just maybe, this will start to sound more like the real thing, and less like a thirteen-year-old's fanfiction story. But they disappoint yet again, proving that they only brought Jill in to make Alice look better - by being stronger than Jill and ""showing her up."" <br/><br/>Carlos Oliviera, who accompanied Jill in the Resident Evil 3 game, also appears in this movie... only to be stripped of his accent and identity, reduced to little more than a stand-by to shoot at things that get too close. Oh, wait, for one line, they did attempt an accent - an Egyptian one. What part of the name Carlos Oliviera suggested to them that he might be best played by an Egyptian actor? Because really, I was thinking that Spanish would be much more appropriate.<br/><br/>Two minor characters from the game also make appearances - in name only - in this game: Nikolai and Mikael. Of course, in keeping with this sad excuse for a movie, they don't resemble their video game selves in any way, shape, or form. Oh, wait. Nikolai's still blonde. My bad.<br/><br/>Not even Umbrella resembles itself in this movie. The ""Hive"" isn't present in any of the games - there is a main Umbrella headquarters, but it's in Europe, and it certainly isn't any kind of huge, underground hive structure. I'm pretty sure someone would have noticed it long before this movie - the government, for example. There are reasons why, in the game, Umbrella's bio-weapon branch works in absolute secrecy in hidden, underground labs.<br/><br/>Then there's Nemesis, who is Jill's rival/boss monster in the Resident Evil 3 game. Apparently he used to be Alice's boyfriend - I'm not entirely sure about that, and I think it was a stupid sub-plot - and... I'm sorry, when did they ever give an indication that Nemesis had a heart? The plot to this movie was also flimsy, and the dialog terrible. I wouldn't have been able to watch the whole thing, if it weren't for the laughs I got out of how terribly they did this.<br/><br/>I don't understand why they felt the need to attach the Resident Evil name to these awful movies, if all that they were going to do was take it so wildly away from the games that it's hardly recognizable anymore.<br/><br/>I don't know about the rest of you, but the only way I think these movies can be redeemed would be if Alice dies a horrible, painful, and above all, permanent death in the next one."

The zombies take advantage of the human's blunder and pour out into Racoon City. Alice and another hot chick decide to bring the war to the zombies. The rest of the movie is one long fight scene with zombie dogs, slobbering creatures and a big monster with a rocket launcher all wanting to waste the killer babe squad.<br/><br/>While ""Resident Evil 2"" is light on plot, it is heavy on kills, explosions and various other forms of mayhem. I definitely felt I got my money's worth. There are really only two differences between this movie and the original ""Resident Evil"". One, this movie introduces a new monster, the Nemesis. It's a big monster with bad teeth wearing an overcoat and wielding a rocket launcher. The other difference is that they added another hot woman to the zombie killing mix. Alice needed some babe backup. Overall, I was pleased with this one. It's worth a look."

","Action packed zombie goodness, but the plot leaves something to be desired. The characters are developed and well acted, but the storyline feels disjointed.

But Alice kicks ass as usual and it's a worthy resident evil successor."
"todd-ramirez","1","65","110","26 January 2005"," IMDb should allow a vote of 0
","This movie is so bad I couldn't finish it. Normally I am patient with bad movies, hoping that the ending would salvage them. But RE2 is one exception. The script is atrocious, clich√©d, or just plain juvenile. Character development is non-existent, so the scene where the two main female characters meet for the first time was quite appropriate: Jill asks Alice, ""Who the **** are you?"" I kept asking the same question throughout. This new character of Jill was probably the biggest mistake here. There just is not enough room for the two female characters to co-exist.<br/><br/>Bad acting (which to me translates to bad directing) is commonplace in RE2. Case in point is when Alice, after blasting away some zombies, spins her two guns, a la John Wayne, before putting them back in the holsters. I laughed out loud at that ridiculous scene. From that point on, I just couldn't take the movie seriously.<br/><br/>What a waste of money (I actually bought the DVD, shame, shame, because I liked the first RE). Don't make the same mistake, unless you wanna to be annoyed."
"PrimitiveScrewhead","1","27","42","26 May 2005"," Another great franchise ruined......
","Please excuse my short outburst but this movie is utterly awful and bares practically no resemblance to the videogames, especially in terms of style and action.<br/><br/>I'll try and re-elaborate on this. Resident Evil Apocalypse is nothing but TRASH. Pure, post-Matrix trash. The first movie was vomit inducing, resulting in pulsing headaches and dissolved moral. I had a small pinch of hope for the sequel, namely because the hack known as Paul W.S. Anderson wasn't directing (he was too busy murdering FOX's prized franchises) so the directing duties was given to first-timer Alexander Witt. I have come to the conclusion that Witt was just simply Anderson's alias.<br/><br/>The director just copied and pasted what Anderson achieved in the first film, namely rapid editing, a hard rock soundtrack and YAWN, kung-fu melee. The end result was simply a hacked attempt at copying a previous hacked attempt. Was Witt pressured by the studio to copy another Hack's style? The acting. Well, Milla Jovovvovovovocichs hams up the screen time a plenty. Serena Guillory looks quite hot in her Jill outfit but resembles a hooker for the undead. The rest of the cast are just equally as bland. And Nemesis, oh Jesus Crumbcakes. How could you feck up such a powerful, iconic character from the videogames? Easy, get Anderson involved. They MADE Nemesis a complete pussy. And why did he go after Milla? The whole point of the Nemesis in the storyline was to hunt down S.T.A.R.S. Members so why was Milla a hunted target? She has bugger all to do with them. She's just screen fodder.<br/><br/>And the final showdown. LAME. A fist-fight between Milla and the Nemesis, and she fricking BEATS HIM????? And then Nemesis dies by having a helicopter crash land on him? Anyone who played the RE3 game will know what a complete cop-out that was.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the game, AVOID THIS FILM. But, if you've never played the videogames, enjoy post-matrix filth and into new culture crap and don't give a damn about the quality of films, just want a cheap thrill and all.........AVOID THIS FILM AS WELL!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","97","175","1 October 2004"," About as good as the first, overall
","After having seen Resident Evil god knows how many times, and being pretty psyched for the sequel, I finally got to see it, and on the premiere night, too. Of course, I knew that the director of the first RE, Paul W. S. Anderson, wasn't doing this, since he was busy making his dream project, Aliens Vs Predator. Luckily, I can cope with changes like that... as long as the change isn't devastating. For this movie, however, it's hard to tell... maybe the mediocre attempts at scaring the audience and providing shocks was Anderson's fault, as he wrote the script, but it may be the new director, first-timer Alexander Witt, who's responsible. Let me say this upfront; I, as many others who enjoyed the first, really liked the ending, the whole foreshadowing thing, and, thankfully, the film picks up exactly where the first one left off. Actually, it goes a little further back, to show us exactly what happened before Alice woke up. The plot is decent, about as good as it gets when it's Paul W. S. Anderson writing it. It doesn't drag... heh, it doesn't drag... heck, it doesn't even leave the slightest chance for it to drag, as it's constantly moving. The movie never allows the audience to catch their breath; apparently, someone(I'm guessing Anderson or Witt) has never heard of the danger of overdoing action sequences. For anything (at all) to be good, entertaining, thrilling, whatever... there needs to be what is commonly referred to as 'buffers'. Without those nice little talky-talky scenes in-between, heck, maybe even a dash of good old-fashioned character development, the action just ends up being trite. And that's pretty much what happens here. They try to squeeze as much action into every single frame as possible, and it ends up annoying the audience rather than exciting. The director also has a horrible habit of blurring the image whenever there are more than five zombies on-screen, apparently to (I guess) cover up a bad job on makeup... or something to that effect. If the first had too much make up and such, this has too little. The acting is decent enough. Milla Jovovich gives the same good performance that she usually does. The rest of the cast are acceptable. The characters are mostly clich√©s and stereotypes. Of course, by mostly I mean almost 90% of the cases. You got the stupid reporter who just wants to make a story out of all of this, despite her being in obvious danger; The bad-ass cop who's suspended but still takes her duty deadly serious; the half-witted pathetic guy who's obviously only there for comic relief... actually, scratch that last one, as he was actually pretty darn funny. For once the person who's supposed to be there for comic relief works, instead of just being the *most*(or even worse; least) laughable character. The special effects were well done, but not spectacular. Definitely not the best I've seen. The action was good, but really over-the-top. The scenes with the Nemesis range between being some of the best action in the movie to being some of the most pathetic and smirk-inspiring scenes. The cinematography is nothing special. The film introduced an unnecessary amount of characters, most of whom are just fodder for the zombies or Nemesis anyway. The showdown between Alice and Nemesis was somewhat pathetically staged, and probably would have seemed out of place, hadn't the rest of the film been of the same quality(honestly, it seemed like a video-game... and while I am quite a big fan of them, I'm considerably more interested in playing them than watching them). That big ol' hunk o' biologically engineered walking death was simultaneously underdeveloped(for what they had him/it do) and overexposed. The film is noisy and loud, but not as loud as the first film, and while the sound is often horribly overdone, it doesn't distract as much as several other big action hits. The film is also less loud when it comes to the soundtrack; it was nice to have some change from the one-note *loud* heavy metal from the first film. All in all, a pretty entertaining flick, but out of your mind much faster than it got in(and that's saying a lot, believe me). If you liked the first, are a big fan of one or more of the actors, or you just have nothing better to do for 90 minutes, give it a shot. It kept me watching through the end, and, despite a few disappointments, kept my interest as well. It just didn't stay fresh in my head for more than about fifteen minutes after the credits started, which is very little for a film with so much going on in it all the time. I recommend it only to big fans of the first or of Milla Jovovich. I suppose big fans of Paul W. S. Anderson(they must exist, somewhere) will probably enjoy it too. I will say that most who liked the first will probably like this as well, but possibly a little less due to the lesser directing. 7/10"

The game rocked! Within the first 5 minutes of me watching RE: Apocalypse, I knew it would suck. How crappy was the first scene with those astronauts entering the vault and getting the parasite lose. The movie sucked. Oh my god, i cant stress the fact enough. How is it that you cant shoot one of those licker things in the church with bullets because they dodge them, but the hero of the story can jump off of her motorcycle and crash it into the monster sending both the motorcycle and the monster 100 feet into the air... Then blowing the motorcycle up, a perfectly good vehicle to use during this chaos. This movie was so bad, i thought i was infected with the T-Virus when i had a strange urge to eat the brains of the people next to me in the movie theater... but they wouldn't mind, they were watching the most brainless movie ever."

","The first RE had a lot going for it.Nice cast.Good fx.Some suspense and general scares.A nice visual style.And a surprise ending that set the stage for a lot of promise to build on toward making one hell of a Horror flick.But a lot of people griped that Re was not like the game enough.Well the bad movie gods heeded their collective whine and have given them what they wanted.While the rest of us are still reeling from this disaster.<br/><br/>Its really a big screen version of the now-classic Playstation game RE 3.It takes place right after the first.Things start out okay.We're introduced to Alice,Jill,Carlos,Nemisis,etc.But after the opening 10 minutes it is all downhill from there.<br/><br/>For starters why give Alice Super powers?It takes away from the first movies realism,makes her shallow,and a grade z matrix wannabe.The stakes go from high to low.Whereas the first you never knew who was gonna live or die.Where is the tension?<br/><br/>The Nemisis is kinda fun to watch.They got him right.But even he is sabotaged by the random shots that reveal him to be an over-sized Stuntman in a rubber suit.A competent director would know to shoot around this.Even the Roger Corman cheapies know how to do that on a tenth of this flicks budget.<br/><br/>Where are the zombies?For the most part they are again sabotaged by the director,who keeps them out of focus most of the time.Its like they are ashamed to say this is a horror flick?<br/><br/>Where is the freaking logic here?The characters do the stupidest things?There is some howling dialog here.Its hard to sustain interest upon hearing what comes out of the cast mouth.Why the hell would they bring a kid along on a rescue attempt?The action sequences resemble MTV videos from 1986.<br/><br/>Milla is okay as Alice.I would watch her in a soup commercial.But she comes off as really pompous here.Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr are about the only ones that come off well in RE 2.Mike Epps,Thomas Kretschmann,and Jared Harris are wasted here.The cast all come off as kind of smug in my book,and its hard to like them.<br/><br/>The directing,scripting,and visuals all look terrible here.I don't wanna be hard on Witt.But I would have went with Anyone else but him. I suspect its not all his fault though.I was never part of the I-hate-Anderson-crowd.But I think the fault here lies with him and the producers.He ruined AVP.Now this!I think he owes me 20 bucks now for paying to see the combined dreck that is AVP and RE2.In the same year no doubt!!!<br/><br/>RE2 held a lot of promise that has sadly been flushed down the proverbial toilet.Ever more cringing is the fact that a RE3 is on the way."

","Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I think that's what makes IMDb such a great site for reviews. When a movie trailer peaks my interest, one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from ""excellent"" to ""pure crap"" for any movie, no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however, to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP, in which complaints of bad lighting, bad angles on combat scenes and a general absent-mindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said, everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie, but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.<br/><br/>I hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. First off, I liked this movie, a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright, I mean really, there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared, angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough, nothing too innovative or complex, but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games, for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay, entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers, explosions, etc were par for the course really, but it was nice to see the slow-mo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic, which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere, labyrinthine city, danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally, the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design, very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally, what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the Uber-Alice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers, I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?<br/><br/>The review is getting long here, so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action, explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars, and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flat-out good flick worth a matin√©e price."
"springsunnywinter","9","10","14","8 May 2007"," Quite good but not better than the first
","**PLEASE NOTE THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS TO THE FIRST RESIDENT EVIL** After watching the first Resident Evil I knew that the there would be a sequel but I thought Nemesis will jump out of nowhere and Alice will start shooting him with her shotgun because Matt was infected & he was put into the Nemesis program. At the start they showed what happened in Racoon city before Alice woke up in the Hospital, which was sensible and the first appearance of Nemesis was so cool when he wiped out the S.T.A.R.S team. My most favourite scene in the film is when Alice was running down the building. In the second part they went a lot deeper into the T-Virus & it was a bit confusing but in the first it was very straightforward. The whole film is very similar to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, the scene where Alice was running across the building while the helicopter was trying to shoot her and when she was cornered she dropped her gun & caught it before it hit the floor was taken from the game Resident Evil: Code Veronica X. Overall it's quite good but not better than the first and I'm looking forward to the third installment Resident Evil: Extinction I hope that also turns out to be good."

","I enjoyed this installment of the franchise a lot. It is my favorite of the series. I like the Nemesis character and the interplay between Alice and the other characters. I don't think this story was as much survival horror as the first movie. This is a lot more zombie outbreak. Still, it is a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I love the Nemesis scenes, if you hadn't guessed."
"ChadKuhns","Null","3","3","18 September 2004"," Take What It For What You Will
","First and foremost, I enjoyed Resident Evil: Apocalypse. In no way did I find it to be a masterpiece of cinema, nor does it leave an everlasting stamp on any of the genres it tries to adhere itself to. However, that being said, the film is what it was intended to be..a sequel on a somewhat grander scale, intended to be nothing more than a popcorn flick, admitted mindless fun. It can be said that this movie, and it's predecessor were made with the sole intent of capitalizing on the huge pool of the fans of the game who would flock to see it on screen and droves, and that is a fairly correct assumption. However, it does not take away from the fact that the film is entertaining nevertheless. <br/><br/>I've read a lot of complaints about this film on the site, and I want to see if I can address some of the main problems, and just give my thoughts, a bit of a counter to the negativity. Possible Spoilers for those who have not yet seen it.<br/><br/>1. There's no character development-I don't think there is really any intended development for much of the characters, outside of Alice, Jill, and perhaps the Nemesis, if you constitute back story as character development. This type of film is meant to throw disposable characters out into the mix, because half of them will be dead before the film reaches the half way point. It would be near impossible and somewhat futile to establish too much character for someone who will be picked off before that character can even become sympathetic to the audience.<br/><br/>2. The zombies seem less 'zombie like' than the original RE- I feel that the zombies, for the most part, appear exactly as they did in the original RE. These are supposed to be the citizens of Racoon City, who have just died, so in all reality, all you are going to get in terms of appearance is some wounds from what killed them, a pale, dead look, and the trademark gray bloodshot contacts. I've also read a lot of people's comments, saying that they seem to appear to move like the zombies in 28 Days Later. I didn't really see that myself, the only time I saw rapid movement was the result of quick cut, rough shot editing. If anything, there was more emphasis on this film to actually shoot them in slow mo, to emphasis there zombie like walk.<br/><br/>3. Nemeis Sucks/No Logic When He is On Screen- I'll agree that Nemesis did not come off as menacingly or as grand as was probably intended, especially near the end of the film, but in his final scenes with Alice, he is portrayed as something of a sympathetic villain, simply a failed or futile experiment. I think that is why in the final portion of the film his makeup and appearance seem less menacing, and evil, as an attempt to make him more human like, and perhaps more tragic. Also, the idea of shooting him in the head may in fact be a mute point, as Nemesis was not a zombie.<br/><br/>4. Where did the Lickers/Graveyard Zombies Come From-Lickers escaped when the hive was opened, and the T-Virus, being portent, was released in a gas form, permeating the soil.<br/><br/>All in All, I'd say take this film for what it is, a disposable, but fun addition to the Resident Evil universe. Don't scrutinize it too much, it wasn't made with an Oscar in mind, so don't think of it as such."
"firegoddess827","9","91","178","29 December 2004"," Great Movie
","I personally loved this movie. I saw Resident Evil 1, and it wasn't as good as the 2nd one. Maybe its just me, but I love the action, and the constant suspense when you never know what will happen next. The music,<br/><br/>I admit, wasn't as good as it should be. Milla is a great actress and she does a lot of her own fighting, and that is admirable.<br/><br/>I did, however, find a lot of bloopers, which made the movie less enjoyable, but most weren't painfully obvious.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an action packed show.<br/><br/>This movie would definitely give anyone an adrenaline rush for the fight scenes."

","This movie is what might happen if you take a typical zombie flick and give it a plot, lot's of action, and a large city with PLENTY of extras to show mobs of zombies. It has humor. It has suspense. And it has a plot that unfolds; even if you've played the games, it's got plenty of changes to keep you guessing. With, I might add, several of the game characters (Jill, Carlos, and the little girl). I enjoyed this movie better than any since Lord of the Rings, Return of the King. Not that you could compare the two. It's just that there haven't been too many good movies since then.<br/><br/>Milla Jojovich is really cool and she's a talented actress. Her character really rocks when her hidden secrets come out. Mike Epps kept me rolling with laughter. He's always funny, and it was quite nice and different to see Oded Fehr in this role as Carlos. Cool. As for Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine... she was a PERFECT match. This movie was very fun and I'd love to see it again and again and again....<br/><br/>I voted 9/10.

"Terryfan","10","9","13","11 September 2012"," My favorite of the Resident Evil Live Action Movies
","This is my favorite of the Resident Evil Live action movies, I seen the movie twice in the theaters, I own it on DVD,Blu-Ray and UMD PSP.<br/><br/>I just felt this one in my opinion really show respect to the games because they did tones of things in the movie that came from games like Resident Evil 3 Nemesis and Code Veronica.<br/><br/>Also we get to see the debuts of Jill Valentine (A Resident Evil Legend) and Carlos from Resident Evil 3.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich returns as Alice the main hero of the series with Jill Valentine being played by Sienna Guillory and I will say Sienna did well playing Jill she even look at her from Resident Evil 3 so I'll give her points for looking like the character Oded Fehr plays Carlos and he did well for the most part as Carlos they made Carlos different from his video game counterpart.<br/><br/>The story takes places right after the first movie, The T-Virus has now escape into Raccoon City and has infected many and slowly turn them into Zombies.<br/><br/>Major Tom Cain played by Thomas Kretschmann is order to lead a team to get all of Umbrella's top researchers out of the hot spot but one Dr.Ashford played by Jared Harris refuse to leave without his Daughter Angie Ashford played by Sophie Vavasseur. Angie was to be taken to him but her car crashed forcing her to take cover in her school.<br/><br/>So Dr.Ashford contracts the Survivors, Alice, Jill, SJ (Mike Epps) and Carlos and makes them a deal, in return for a way out of the city they will rescues his daughter.<br/><br/>Things get worst as Cain sends Nemesis after them from Resident Evil 3 played by Matthew G Taylor. Nemesis really was a force to be deal with. Nemesis was very dangerous in the video game because he could run dodge attacks and chase the player into different areas of the game. Nemesis in this movie is very much like his video game counterpart.<br/><br/>So yeah I felt like they really did a lot of tributes to the games with this movie and in my opinion the story was very well done because of the way they mix action and horror in the movie.<br/><br/>Being this is my favorite of the series I think it is the best out of the ones that were made and I'm glad to have it and have seen it in the theaters.<br/><br/>I give Resident Evil:Apocalypse a 10 out of 10"

","I recently saw the theatrical trailer for the movie Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me that I never saw either Resident Evil movies, even though I've been wanting to see them. So I rented the movies yesterday and watched them last night and I have to say that I was a little surprised about the rating on IMDb, I really loved Apocalypse, I think I liked it better than the first Resident Evil. Milla Jovovich is still so awesome and I think she's improved since the first movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse we have more action and in my opinion a very awesome story, one that is even up there I would say with George Romero's zombie stories.<br/><br/>We start where we have left off where Alice has been left in the lab with her friend, Matt. But she escapes and finds a world that is not the same, where the virus has broken out into the world and zombies are now walking above ground. People are doing their best to survive and there are now new people called STARS where they are being eliminated by a huge new monster who might be familiar to Alice. But she is with survivors: Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera, Captain Nicholai and they find a little girl, Angie Ashford who's dad Dr. Ashford is the man who created the virus and is being hunted down.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse was very awesome to watch and it's a buy for me at least. I'm really looking forward to Extinction now, I can't wait to see how they continue the story. See, the only bummer about me watching this now is because now I have to wait for the sequels as well. But at least I get the experience of the theater. But anyways, I would recommend this movie for anyone, it's an awesome movie to watch and has terrific action.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I liked the first movie, it was good average entertainment. I think this one is slightly better than the first, mainly because this one is scarier. I admit i preferred the zombies in the Dawn of the dead remake but thats because they were fast. The script is no great shakes, the cast are OK. Though the bad guy seemed like he was doing a poor man's Schindler. The FX was fairly decent and the movie never becomes boring, it's too fast paced for that. Some of the sets were obviously based on the games. At least it made me jump out of my seat a few times. Needless to say a third one seems very likely but i like where there going with one scene reminding me of Brian De Palma's The Fury. 6 out of 10"
"Psycojester","1","8","12","28 February 2007"," An actually Zombie movie, instead of a movie about Zombies
","Zombie movies have always been a guilty pleasure of mine. For sheer cheesy pleasure nothing beats watching a gathering of mind-numbing dumb individuals being torn limb from limb by the ambulatory deceased. I want to make this point clear before I start this review as Resident Evil: Apocalypse is amongst the most painful mindless films I have ever endured.<br/><br/>Paul W.S Anderson (director of such masterpieces as Mortal Combat, Soldier, Event Horizon and Alien VS predator) has achieved something truly monumental with this film. He has managed to make a film with a more childish and illogical plot than the game it was based on.<br/><br/>Resident Evil 2 upon which the film was based follows a Police officer and a college student as they attempt to escape a city which has been overrun by the undead. Paul Anderson felt this story to be far to boring and mundane to turn into a film so instead we are given Milla Jovovich as Alice a woman with superhuman strength and agility leading a motley band of irritating clich√©'s (featuring such family favorites as slightly racist comedy relief black guy and nosy reporter woman) across a city filled with zombies and bad CG effects in order to rescue the daughter of a mysterious scientist and escape the city before an inexplicable evil European man detonates a nuclear bomb and wipes Raccoon City from the face of the earth.<br/><br/>If that didn't make to much sense don't worry you won't be alone. The film seems to actively avoid developing the character or plot; it seems to feel that being coherent was something shameful that must be avoided at all possible costs. To this end the film bounces from one action scene to the next. These range in quality from the silly; riding a motor bike through a stained class window, jumping off and then shooting the fuel tank. To the downright pointless; running down the side of a glass skyscraper in order to ambush five men standing around looking disinterested at the bottom.<br/><br/>Considering the tripe they had to work with it's not really fair to criticise the acting in this movie. You can't build a mansion out of cardboard and by the same token it's difficult to give a convincing performance when you're given lines like ""You motherf@@kers is crazy! Look. That big motherf@@ker got a rocket launcher!"" That said credit must be given to Mike Epps (LJ the mildly offensive stereotypical black guy) he knows he's in a truly absurd movie and seem to be having a really really good time. He seems to find the next plateau beyond over-acting, uber-acting perhaps. Everybody else just seems to be waiting for their pay cheques to be clear and they can get back to making worthwhile films.<br/><br/>In summation it's a mindless zombie movie that shuffles around the plot, the dialog is mindless groaning, it looks bad and it'll probably eat your brains. The consummate zombie movie really.<br/><br/>By Nicholas Hamonet"
"noxturne","Null","13","22","17 September 2004"," Reasons that Resident Evil: Apocalypse sucked.
","May contain spoilers, but you can't spoil the rotten. <br/><br/>1. After all the dead people came back, the Umbrella Corporation managed to cover it all up. Even though news stations reported it, newspapers were printed up, and people escaped who saw it all happen, it was all covered up. There were NEWSPAPERS PRINTED! No one had the internet? No one BLOGGED ABOUT IT? Information wants to be free! <br/><br/>2. This stuff reanimates dead flesh. Somehow, it managed to seep through the ground and into the coffins of people who had been dead for 20 years. Even though there shouldn't have been any flesh to reanimate, not to mention they moved like muscles hadn't atrophied, tendons hadn't turned to so much body goo and chunks o'flesh.<br/><br/>3. The stated reason for closing off the only exit from this city was to keep the infection in. Though there were OTHER EXITS that could have been destroyed by ramming a truck into them, no one went to them. Horror movie stupidity. Who would say, ah, they're right, I could never scale that wall using mountaineering equipment. I'd rather stay in this place with dead people trying to eat my flesh!<br/><br/>4. The stuff managed to reanimate dead dogs somehow, and created some other undead creatures, though no explanation was given for them. If it could do dogs, though, that means all animals are fair game, meaning that rats, for an example, could be brought back from the dead. Rats will always escape. There are sewers, they can climb walls, they can jump pretty damn high. There is no such thing as containing a plague that infects animals. There are dead birds all over the place, none of them flew out and infected people with deceased bird poo? Even gerbils and hamsters can get away, so says Richard Gere.<br/><br/>5. Other minor nits are zombies that were sometimes smart, sometimes dumb, using doors vs. scratching at them, zombies that were either superfast ala 28 days later, or superslow and so comical, who would be afraid? You could outrun them by speedwalking! The Grandmas of Doom (the speedwalking gang that used to harass me in the mall) could have taken them down.<br/><br/>In closing, see this movie only if you don't mind turning off your brain and watching action. Don't think. It will fall apart in front of your eyes. I hate this movie so much, and it's definitely an insult to horror movies in general, and the first movie in specific."
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","9","4","5","27 March 2015"," Very entertaining sequel for an unwanted film
","Trapped in Raccoon City, Alice joins a group of survivors to fight their way out of the zombie-infested city to find a young girl at the heart of stopping the plague before the entire city is destroyed.<br/><br/>This is an immensely fun and exciting effort. One of the better parts to this is the incredibly frenetic action that utterly overwhelms here based on all sorts of different measures. Paced more like an Action than film than a Horror film, this one has a nearly continuous series of attacks, shootouts, firefights, brawls and chases that all combined together that makes this an unrelenting and non-stop Action film, getting going right from the start and never letting up. From the madness of the barricade to leave the city, the troops' firefight with the creatures along the burning city streets and the church hideout, it really contains a lot of action and shootouts quite early and runs through them into the ecstatic final half. These contain even more impressive action scenes as the first encounter with the hulking humanoid monstrosity wielding rocket launchers, mini-guns and more in a frantic, exciting shootout, a daring battle with mutant dogs in the school and the impressive shootout to allow them to take out the heli-pad which turns into a blazing action scene full of brawling, hand-to-hand combat and a further shoot-out among the security center with a second helicopter gets a lot of exciting moments packed into this. With all this action it really does put a lot more positives in here as this makes for continuous special effects showcasing the ravenous zombies and deformed mutants throughout here, and that also puts in a healthy amount of blood and gore to be had. About the only part here that's not really all that interesting is the finale which tries to go far too overt for its own good rather than just letting the good it's established stay in the forefront. Instead, this one seems as if all the different conspiracies and actions against the main city here are simply to keep the storyline going for future films rather than serving any special point for this one. That's still not enough from making this one a wholly enjoyable and entertaining watch.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Brief Nudity and children-in-jeopardy."
"Carlos_Olivera","8","4","5","19 September 2004"," Surgeon Generals warning: Adverse side effects may result. (minor spoilers)
","Well, I waited on baited breath for this movie. I saw the previews, among the slickest I've seen. The entire Regenerate commercial was brilliant. By the end of the movie, you have an idea where they are going with that idea. But let's not get ahead of our selves.<br/><br/>The movies, as a pair, show an amazing flow of continuity. They even include flash backs and remain consistent with the end of the first movie, placing it with in the first 10 or 15 minutes of Apocalypse.<br/><br/>Such continuity is rare, look at the Evil Dead series, it looks like the Writers were high when they did those two movies, I mean they look almost identical to each other. The second one regurgitated the premise of the first one, alight a little more strange. The last time I saw a movie series flow together like these two was Back to the future, but we didn't have to wait so long.<br/><br/>Now, I know that a lot of people didn't like the direction the movies went, leaving the games to the side, and pushing them away when they were included in apocalypse, as the woefully overly criticize secondary role Jill had in the movie. The movies tie more or less into RE 3: Nemesis, depicting the nemesis' origin in the first one. The games never even mention where or what the nemesis is. or even why he's killing and hunting STARS. Here in apocalypse they even fleshed him out into a more human creature, a more beauty and the beast parallel to Alice. As to Carlos and Nicholai, that's just creative license. The writers decided to change it because they wanted too. I still think they were both excellent in the movie though they were backgrounds to the others. The additions of Angie and L J were great. L J added comedy relief, though in no way did he steal the show. I'm sorry, but I never looked forward to his next moment and entirely expected him to die. The girl was kinda creepy in her 6th sense way of the zombies and cool exterior, though she had enough tempering of her childish frame to make her slightly believable. I honestly thought the zombie girl was her and was all sad :( Then I was happy to see her again and alive to the end :). I admit some of it was predictable, but I admit I had some popcorn choking incidents where I was genuinely surprised by something. Just like the first one as I recall. <br/><br/>An example to raise was the church seen with the priest and his sister(?). At first you know something is wrong, you hope she's just scared, then you hope she's just dead, then you know she's a zombie. It's milder, less extreme case than the guy with the wife and baby in Dawn of the Dead. That was just too much for me, I still have nightmares of the zombie baby. Here you see her, but you also don't and that makes it creepier, wondering. Most people complained you didn't get to see her enough. Well, why not complain about Alfred Hitchcock? Or Psycho? They weren't gory...I mean just seeing the blood going down the drain in Vertigo makes it creepier than seeing the actual trauma inflicted to spill that same blood. People are hungry for things like Cabin Fever these days. Gore, gore and more gore. As others also pointed out, the movie lacked good gory zombie views. Well, this movie isn't about any one zombie, save the nemesis. Besides, unless a zombie is about to kill you, are you gonna really be caring about what average Joe zombie looks like? No you'll be running. One zombie is just like another zombie: dead, decaying and moaning for your flesh. Oh, let's not forget that there are so many of them, hence the idea of Apocalypse. All of it ending with you being the last one. Have some sense and forget about ogling the zombie, even if she has nice boobs! Run! <br/><br/>Speaking of boobs, a lot of people had trouble with the nudity. Well, most horror movies have at least 1 or 2 sexual scenes. These are usually actual sex or a shower scene. Most of these scenes are just thrown in there for the hell of it with no plot reasons. In Resident Evil, it never sexual. In this case, nudity is used for conveying vulnerability, rebirth, and in the case of the zombie hookers, comedy. <br/><br/>Now, what's the point of the movie? Like it or not, every director, every writer wants to make a point. They're arrogant and want to give the world a piece of their mind. If you don't know that, well, I guess you weren't awake in English or lit classes in high school. Shame on you! Here in the world of Resident evil, it's about conformity, image, and power. Umbel represents conformity in the pursuit of power hidden behind an image. The t virus starts out as a means to the power to help the powerless, the doctor and the daughter confined to crutches and wheel chairs. Umbrella seeks to snatch the virus to sell for monetary power to those wanting military power. But then, they see in Alice Regenerate: the power of the wealthy to pay for Strength, beauty, youth. If cultivated, it could be the ultimate power, or the ultimate death. Even as the ultimate in health care, it has it's prices in development and the soul should it go awry. The Nemesis and Alice are the avatars of the T virus; they personify its 2 potentials. Alice is the Regenerate cover girl, where as Nemesis is the warning sign of the zombies. Beats a Surgeon General's warning . Just remember, our world has corporations like umbrella. Think Dupont, Microsoft, Time-Warner, Wal-Mart. Not too far from the truth huh? - A. C., a.k.a.

RE:Apocalypse is a complete mess for several reasons. 1:Thier's no story to back any of this mindless zombie blasting up. 2:Thier's no character development at all you don't care if any one in this movie dies because you don't know what makes them important. And 3: Overall this movie is no where near as good as any of the games. RE:Apocalypse tries to trick you that it'll be a good movie with characters from the game. But any resident evil game fan well quickly realize that it was a pathetic excuse for there money. Overall if your a zombie movie fan avoid this and see the Dawn Of The Dead remake or 28 days later, If your a resident evil fan it might be worth a rental I guess if you liked the first one. Anyone else watch something else because anything beats watching this crap for the next 90 minutes."

","I love the ResiEvil films, the entire franchise is just pure entertainment, granted, starting with Apocalypse they moved away from the horror and further into action sci-fi but it's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>RE Apocalypse starts off directly after the events of the first movie, there's a little flashback narrative by Milla Jovovich to fill in the questions for anyone skipping the first film, apocalypse upped the action by 70% and added more characters from the games like Jill Valentine to the movie franchise, lots of martial arts and gunplay throughout the film, it's good fun.<br/><br/>If you like zombies, action, hot women, guns, sci-fi etc then you'll enjoy the ResiEvil series."
"hickieboy2001","Null","15","28","19 September 2004"," Wow.... so much thievery... used so poorly. *Possible Spoilers*
","***Possible Spoilers I Guess***<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that I generally enjoy going to the theatre just to be amused by a big budget exploso-fest and save the movies I would actually criticize for a more intimate small-screen viewing. That said, i had few or no problems with the sparseness of the dialogue, the emphasis on action, the plot gaps, or the nonexistence of character development found throughout. <br/><br/>However, the one thing that i found truly frustrating was the way that Resident Evil: Apocalypse felt the need to shamelessly rob other movies blind, and then not even have the decency to make a tasteful theft of it. From the first scenes of Alice, when she is walking around a deserted city, even without knowing she'll be meeting Zombies soon enough, a definite 28 Days Later feel creeps in. The appearance of and even the final fight with Nemesis seems to remind me of a particular episode and monster of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And yet these thefts are not even limited to movies with at least a 1-year grace period, as the Entire LJ character, from his mannerisms, to his lines, right down to his hat appears to be lifted wholesale from the Homeless guy in Day After Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Yet the worst theft is unquestionably the scene in which the director chooses to rob Jurrasic Park in an almost Frame-by-frame manner, taking the nerve-wracking scene in which the children in JP fight and flee from Raptors in the kitchen and turning it into a watered down clone in which Valentine and Angie flee and fight zombie dogs in a kitchen. Once a dog is beaten over the head with a frying pan, the parallel is completed, and no questions can remain about who the director decided that fearsomely intelligent killing machines can be easily replaced by dogs reminiscent of Santa's Little Helper at the close of a Simpson's Treehouse of Terror where everyone is turned inside out by a mysterious fog. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was in my opinion, mockably bad, particularly for its brazen thefts, and can be best summed up in what is quite possibly the most hilarious bad line of dialogue I've ever seen: (Regarding one of the Zombie dogs)... Nikolai: Save the girl! I've got this B***h!"
"hughie522","3","9","15","18 March 2005"," Somewhat disappointing
","I thought that the original Resident Evil was quite good, and have seen what the games have to offer. If the producers, directors etc. had put more of what's in the games into the film then Apocalypse would have been halfway decent. Instead, we get much of what we had in the first - but no where as good. The zombies play a minor part in the film, the Lickers appear for a very, very short time and we have the dogs: again. The film may have been okay if it had included some of the suspense, isolation and gore that the original had but the sequel lacks a lot of this. I would have rather watched a film that had yet another group of hapless victims entering the Hive and getting slaughtered..."

","I thought that RE:A was an absolute success and a d*mn good movie. I thought that it was more of an action film than a horror/zombie film and I did like the ""tenseness"" that was so evident in the first movie. However, I thought that the plot and storyline followed the game pretty close (I being an absolute zombie and RE fanatic both of the games and the movies) I would have like to have seen more ""zombie action"" though I did think that this crew did a very good job with the Nemesis creature. Overall I give RE:A **** and I would tell anyone interested in this type of horror to go and give it a shot....wait...I do have one complaint....NO HEAD SHOTS!! none close enough that is...lol...no zombies tearing flesh off of their victims...y'know what I mean.

It reminded me of the game much more than the first movie, also letting us to see The Nemesis for the first time, even tho they made him a lot Terminator like, which I did not like.

"badfeelinganger","8","2","2","11 October 2014"," Borrowing elements from the video games Resident Evil 2, 3: Nemesis, and Code: Veronica
","Resident Evil was a fast-paced, enjoyable, horror/adventure romp. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is Borrowing elements from the video games Resident Evil 2, 3: Nemesis, and Code: Veronica.The film opened to theatres on September 10, 2004. On a budget of $40 million, the film grossed $51 million domestically and $129 million worldwide, surpassing the box office gross of the previous instalment. Resident Evil: Apocalypse received mostly negative reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences but criticised the plot. Resident Evil: Apocalypse has lots of action,Milla Jovovich still deserves much of the credit for the film's short-term success , for what people refer to as ""star quality,"" perhaps nothing more is needed than the alluring oddity of her face, the widely-spaced cat's eyes and innocent animal look, fearless yet poignantly unprotected. The filmmakers can count themselves lucky to have an actress who can conjure audience empathy out of nothing;this sequel has a pleasing B-movie insouciance, not to say incoherence: it's a film with little on its mind beyond giving the audience their money's worth of horror, action, moody industrial settings and hip Gothic attitude. The no-frills script amalgamates various genre classics from the 1980s: the all-night race through a derelict city derives most obviously from Escape From New York, while the evil corporation pulling the strings recalls Aliens, as do the monstrous mutants of their creation. The easily-dispatched zombies themselves seem like something of an afterthought ‚Äì an element for the characters to wade through, rather than a threat in their own right.<br/><br/>As for the warrior women who dominate proceedings, they're swift-moving physical presences rather than characters, all sharp cheekbones, taut limbs and video-game poses. Specific acting skill is not required, nor is martial arts training beyond the basics ‚Äì shadows and flashy editing make the action sufficiently hard to follow in detail, and stunt doubles do the rest.So, if you're into horror-action films, this is a good bet. If you're into cerebral movies about the human condition, you'll want to find another way to spend a couple hours.Lovers of Zombie films and action flicks should like this fast paced sequel.Followed by Resident Evil: Extinction."
"RyanEberhart","9","2","2","29 August 2013"," Superb!
","Milla Yovovich is back as Alice in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. YES!!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie is a continuation of the previous movie, almost as if no time has passed. Alice wakes up in the hospital with needles in her arms and head. Whatever they, The Unbrella Corporation, were pumping into her enhanced her abilities.<br/><br/>Apocalypse revolves around the virus escaping The Hive because The Umbrella Corporation just wouldn't leave it alone. Umbrella opened up the Hive because they wanted to know what went wrong. The team that went into The Hive was attacked and left the doors open allowing the zombies out.<br/><br/>The zombies escaping prompts a protocol for Umbrella where some of the top scientists and executives are evacuated before the civilians can be allowed to leave, assuming that they aren't infected. One of the scientists is Dr. Ashford, played by Jared Harris, who is taken away, but anxious to get his daughter out as well. The vehicles that Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur, is in is hit by a semi truck. The two agents that were with Angie appear to be dead, while we see Angie move her fingers telling the audience that she is alive.<br/><br/>Using his computer, Dr. Ashford locates his daughter, but there is evidence of zombies in the area. Therefore, Dr. Ashford looks for recruits to help save Angie.<br/><br/>Before we get to this point though, we meet Terri Morrales, Jill Valentine, L.J., Carlos Olivera, and Sgt. Peyton Wells. It is a combination of these characters and Alice that eventually locate Angie and bring her to safety.<br/><br/>My three favorite scenes are pretty cool, two of them have Alice fighting the creature from the Nemesis Program.<br/><br/>The first scene is when Alice and Nemesis fight for the first time. The best part of the scene is when Alice escapes down a trash shoot in a police precinct. While falling down the shoot one of Alice's fingers gets caught on some fencing and either brakes or dislocates. Nemesis fire a rocket down the shoot, but Alice escapes anyway. The end of the scene is when Alice fixes her finger.<br/><br/>The second scene I liked was the scene when the rescuers get to the school that Angie has taken refuge in. As they search the school for Angie, Terri is attacked by several children who have been turned into zombies. L.J. is attacked by a zombie, but Carlos saves him. Jill locates Angie and tries to reconnect with the others from her group. Jill takes Angie through the Cafeteria not knowing that there are zombie dogs loose in the school. They get trapped in the kitchen and Jill eventually turns all the gas burners of every stove on intending to blow up the kitchen with the dogs inside. The book of matches Jill throws into the kitchen fails to set the gas off, but Alice arrives and throws a lit cigarette in... KABOOM!<br/><br/>The third scene I liked was the final fight scene between Alice and Nemesis. Umbrella wants to see who is better. Between the two the fight is pretty evenly matched. Alice, however, impales Nemesis on a piece of steel. Alice eventually realizes that Nemesis is Matt, the only other survivor of the battle in The Hive from the first movie.<br/><br/>I won't give away the ending of the movie. Suffice it to say that Alice ""survives"" yet again. If that is too much of a spoiler alert, I apologize, but you would have figured that out if you looked at the cast for the next movie in this series. Hint, Alice is the central character for the movies, she survives through the end of the fifth movie... and beyond.<br/><br/>I give this movie 9 Stars out of 10. The fight scenes are better and more elaborate. Milla Yovovich is sexy as hell, even as a zombie killing machine. Sienna Guillory is another sexy zombie killing machine and is perfect as Jill Valentine. Oded Fehr is another great casting choice for Carlos."

","*Spoiler Alert* (coincidentally can you spoil crap?) Where on earth to start...oh my, I'm trying to sit here with my friend and figure out how to best describe the utter stupidity presented in this movie...truly a waste of the breath in my lungs...<br/><br/>OK, lets start with one of the main characters, Alice whom my friend and I repeatedly referred to as ""Boomer"" because of her ability to constantly amaze us. This name is merely an understatement, as we are presented with multiple encounters of seemingly ""near death"" situations in which she quickly devises some witty plan, gains the strength of an ox, the agility of a rabid bunny, and the brain capacity of Stephen Hawking. One incident in particular is the scene in which ""boomer"" valiantly smashes through an assembly of stained glass windows on her motorcycle and carefully times her departure from the vehicle in the form of a triple back-flip, projecting the motorcycle at high speeds towards the apparently ""bullet-fast"" creature within the building's confines, only for the motorcycle to attain a vertical position along the creatures' abdomen, turning perfectly, exposing the ""ever-so-small"" gas tank, allowing ""boomer"" an effortless, but nonetheless accurate shot at the flammable contents of the tank, and thus ""efficiently"" dispatching this foul creature from existence... With her flawless perfection of shot, and ample bosom, how could anyone despise this movie...for laughs. Certainly not for actual enjoyment.<br/><br/>This movie was so bad, i purged in an empty popcorn container, forgot about it, picked up the container once again, and proceeded to name the individual ingredients i recognized as food, and formulated names for things that looked supernatural. That was a much more fulfilling use of my time than watching this crappy flick."

The sequel is not worse, anyway. The whole city of Raccoon is plagued, dead are all around, and only Milla again as Alice may save them all. She does. The movie never gets boring or slow, it holds you glued and gets you more and more excited. The very end makes you ask what the last part be?

Meanwhile, Alice (Milla Jovovich), Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) try to find Angela, the little daughter of Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris), who is trapped in Raccoon City, as the means to escape from the siege of the city.<br/><br/>Although having a kind of prejudice against movies with lots explosions and special effects, I loved ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". This movie is a great non-stop adventure and sequel of the first ""Resident Evil"". The choreography of the fights is excellent, the heroines are marvelous and everything works well in this great entertainment. I do not play video-games, but ""Resident Evil"" is among the favorite ones of my son and my daughter, and now I can understand why.

","This would probably have to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. All dialogue (except milla's monologues) was ridiculously stupid with some characters even dying after their action hero one liners. In terms of storyline progression and character introduction this seems to have completely missed the point. I cannot even begin to explain why i hate Jill Valentine.<br/><br/>The change in directors has played a big role in the demise of this movie. In fact i doubt that Paul Anderson has even bothered to watch the first movie. The camera jerks around wildly and I wouldn't be surprised if there was some secret competition among inadequate directors to see who could change angles most often.This is neither scary nor that great on Action.<br/><br/>This is my first Comment about a movie on IMDb but this had to be said.

"verity_farseer","8","6","10","23 December 2006"," Game fans will hate it but otherwise its good
","Don't be put off by the low rating on this page - its been dragged down by very pathetic fans of the games who despite the fact that it has been nearly five years since the release of the first movie still haven't come to terms with the films.<br/><br/>This film does exactly what is expected of it - it's got two hot actresses in little clothing, good actions sequences, humor and the acting is good (especially for Milla), people who tell you otherwise are usually Game-Loving/Film-Hating. Don't expect any vast life changing lesson from the film because its not trying to do that.<br/><br/>The script is passable and moves the story at a good pace - most of the fights are by the script bar two but those two are just so dam good that you don't really mind.<br/><br/>One special mention has to go out to Seinna Gulliory who plays Jill - not only does she look the part but she plays it perfectly. It would have been very easy for her to just fade in comparison to the killing machine Alice but instead has emerged as one of the film-lovers favorite characters. Her accent is perfect and came as a big shock to me when I found out she was English.<br/><br/>Bottom Line - Don't be fooled by the low rating - it succeeds at what it aims at - its just a dam good and enjoyable action/horror for the majority of the population who don't spend every minute of their lives glued to the Games."
"martine-12","7","6","10","18 September 2004"," Don't expect a brilliant plot and you'll be in for a treat
","When you see a movie like this you should never go into the theater expecting too much. Especially if it's a sequel. Fortunately enough, Resident Evil: Apocalypse does a great job of following up to the, in my opinion, very good first movie.<br/><br/>The basic premise is the same; a lot of zombies that have been infected by the T-virus are out to get our heroes. The difference is that this time they're out and about in Raccoon city, the city where The Hive from the first movie is located.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich again does a great job as Alice, with her this time is Jill Valentine, known from the video game, played by Sienna Guillory, whom also does a great job by the way. Not that there's a lot of acting taking place, the better part of the movie the protagonists kill zombies, blow things up or perform death, and gravity, defying stunts.<br/><br/>This is what makes this movie so good though; the over-the-top-with-tongue-in-cheek approach to the action. The first time Alice enters the movie for real she does it in such a brilliant way I almost clapped my hands.<br/><br/>Take this movie for what it is, a fun action romp through well known movie making territory, and you should have a great time."
"johnnysugar","6","9","17","13 September 2004"," Macho women with guns vs. mediocrity
","Film adaptations of video games have a decidedly mixed life. On the one hand, they are commercially viable with a built-in audience. On the other, they are often lifeless, barely more than live action versions of the games, less films than advertisements. Occasionally, as in ""Tomb Raider"", a fantastic lead can overcome the video game-to-file curse. Sometimes, the movie separates itself from the game enough to stand on its own, as in ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within."" The first ""Resident Evil"" had both of these: only a passing resemblance to the wildly popular game series and a dynamic lead in Milla Jovovich. The success of the movie spawned a sequel, and as in the video game world, so often, the sequel is an overly-hyped, rushed-to-production mess like ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse.""<br/><br/>The film begins roughly where the first one left off. Alice (Jovovich) is one of the only survivors of the first movie, having fought her way thought legions of undead when the nefarious Umbrella Corporation's experimental T-virus infected hundreds of people. When Umbrella tries to investigate the events of the first movie, they unwittingly release the T-virus into the streets of Raccoon City, turning the populace into slavering zombies hungry for human flesh. Umbrella shuts the city down to contain the virus, and Alice must fight her way out with the help of mini-skirted cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a small team of elite soldiers, and a trash-talking common citizen (Mike Epps). Along the way are obstacles like undead beasts with huge tongues and a giant mutant named Nemesis.<br/><br/>This film is a massive mess of teenage game-boy dreams. The plot is thin and the characters by and large thread bare. Most come and go so quickly that you never even get to know their names before they become a zombie snack. The actors try their best, though, and Jovovich is always a treat to watch in action. Guillory is also quite effective in her role as Butt-Kicking Babe #2, making a rather crowd-pleasing entrance. Epps provides the film's few intentionally funny moments, while there also fine performances by Oded Fehr and Zack Ward as two of the soldiers accompanying Alice. Of all the featured players, only Thomas Kretschmann, as Umbrella's laughably clich√©d Eurotrash representative, comes off as particularly mediocre.<br/><br/>But all the girls-on-zombie action in the world can't save this film from itself. The film has the quick-cut action scenes and loud, forced nu-metal soundtrack of a straight-to-video release but the effects budget of a minor studio release. Indeed, hardly a scene goes by that isn't punctuated with deafening explosions. Director Alexander Witt, taking over for video-game-to-film director Paul Anderson (who wrote the screenplay), has made a cold, hard film lacking any of the (relative) depth or humanity of the first film. Sure, this film may be based on a video game, but that's no reason to turn the characters into automatons. In addition, the film ends with a bizarre and seemingly arbitrary sequence that will leave most viewers to bang their heads in frustration...and, of course, opening the door WIDE open for a third film.<br/><br/>What could've been a more action-oriented follow-up to a fine video-game adaptation has become an incoherent and numb series of shoot-em-up action, a film so ridiculously conceived that it thinks nothing of sending its main characters through a graveyard during a zombie assault. Granted, it's immensely enjoyable to watch the female leads getting their action hero on, but both Jovovich and Guillory (and indeed the whole cast) deserve a better vehicle for their acrobatics. Skip the theatre and just wait for the DVD so you can go right to the good parts. 5 out of 10."

","Resident Evil Apocalypse the sequel to the 2002 movie and again loosely based on the video game series.
I really like this movie and it's my favourite in the live action Resident Evil movies a lot of fun action with some great characters and we even get some characters from the game's in Jill Valentine and Nemesis who look absolutely awesome.<br/><br/>The story now set in Raccoon City where an outbreak of the TVirus has happened we follow Alice has she has to deal with the zombies and the new villain Nemesis who is Matt from the previous movie who she survived with.
Nemesis looks awesome in this and the action scenes with him and Alice are awesome. We also learn alot more about Alice finding out she is infected but she bounded with the TVirus on a cellular level which is why she has all these wicked abilities.<br/><br/>The action scenes are so fun in this movie and finally seeing characters from the game series is awesome and Jill Valentine looks amazing and is such a bad ass.<br/><br/>There's also a great moment in the movie where the human side of Nemesis comes back through and he safes everyone such an interesting take on that character and really adds to the first movie which all good sequels should.<br/><br/>Same as last time some of the effects are a little dated and some of the acting in this one is a little off I also wasn't a fan of the ending like do Umbrella control Alice now I don't know it does set up a sequel like the first one but this seems a little rushed to me just my opinion.
However this is such a fun movie and from start to finish I just have a blast watching it and it's definitely my favourite from this Franchise. With Bad ass characters and a simple story this is just a thrill ride.<br/><br/>We also see more of how evil the Umbrella corporation can be buy causing all this and doing these experiments and leaving most of there men in Raccoon City to die this reminds of the game by showing how ruthless and selfless they can be don't care who gets infected or who dies they are in it for themselves<br/><br/>Verdict 8.4/10 best of the series and a great Resident Evil movie Alice is more bad ass and we get some great characters from the game's which is awesome."

","After watching the first DVD in my collection box, I excitedly hopped in for the sequel ""Resident Evil"" Apocalypse"". The outbreak worsens as the T-virus invades Raccoon City. New characters enter. New enemies come in. And a greater battle against Umbrella Corporation ensues.<br/><br/>The bioweapon ""Nemesis"" is probably the main attraction of the film. He doesn't look disgusting but threatening. Action sequence is grander than the first film. The church scene, the rooftop, and the final fight are well-choreographed. However, it fell short on horror, which is one of the three main genres of the video game franchise that serves as the source material.<br/><br/>The film shows how more evil Umbrella can get, and this is scary for the real world. The plot twist is unexpected, and confusing. It's obvious that there's a need for a second sequel. <br/><br/>I'm giving the film 8 of 10. Again, I'm looking for sci-fi, action, and horror, but it fell short on the horror genre. However, this is an action-packed film."

","After watching the first Resident Evil, I've thought it to be the best zombie virus film I've seen. Now, after watching Apocalypse, I know I was right. The definition of a good sequel is that it picks up where the first film has ended, smoothly continues, leaves no loose ends and unanswered questions, doesn't open itself to plot holes, and takes the rules made by the first film to a new and improved level. Resident Evil: Apocalypse does all of these, and in a nearly perfect way. In my opinion, it's easily in the top 5 of the best sequels ever made. Another thing I liked, is that it shows features that we've seen before (or will see later) in other famous films in their respective genres, like Terminator, The Matrix, The Descent and pretty much ever new zombie flick made in the 21st century. Resident Evil is probably the hottest name in the zombie film industry, and by right.<br/><br/>The screenplay and story are excellent, although the name is slightly misleading - the only place going through a ""zombie apocalypse"" is Raccoon City, not the entire world as the name (and the end scene in the first film) imply. Perhaps Resident Evil: Raccoon City would have been a better name, but never mind that. The plot involves everything we've learnt and today know to want and expect to see. An area infected by zombies, survivors trying to escape/live through the ordeal, and excellent action scenes of battles. As for the new and evolved rules - they're absolutely there and are very exciting, but I wouldn't want to risk spoilers.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Milla Jovovich is as talented, beautiful and deadly as in the first film, and is this time joined by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, the perfect femme fatal! I also liked Jarred Harris's roll as Dr. Ashford, but altogether a great work by the entire cast!<br/><br/>Direction and cinematography are also great, featuring some terminator style shots from the point of view of the beings controlled by the Umbrella Corporation. The soundtrack is also just the way it should be in a zombie flick.<br/><br/>It took me to this week to familiarize myself with the Resident Evil anthology, and not a moment too soon. I only wish I'd known it years ago. As a big fan of the Underworld anthology, I salute the better predecessor. I know I'm about to have a great time watching the rest of the Resident Evil films, including the animated ones. This film in particular is, as I've said, better than the first, and leaves plenty of room for more improvements (or a devastating fall from grace) in the third. The perfect sequel!"

","I used to hate zombie movies I took a lot of courage with the first resident Evil movie and it was good. When Resident Evil: Apocalypse came along in lots of reviews and pictures I felt a lot of excitement for the movie and when I watched it for the first time at the cinema (which I rushed to get in because not only was I excited there was a lot of people coming to see it) I was blown away by the movie. I liked it so much I went again.<br/><br/>When I got the DVD (including the first one) and paid close attention to the action and details. I found one or two bits in the movie that were wrong but there's an explanation to them, It's a movie! I thought Resident Evil: Apocalypse was good because when you watch a movie like Dawn of the Dead (2004) you only see the Massacre of the city and everyone dying without putting up a fight. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse you actually see highly trained soldiers and special forces fighting the infection, thats what I like to see! Men with guns making a stand and fighting.<br/><br/>Oded Fehr was excellent, he hates guns but he shoots them like a professional and does some good moves and stunts. Milla Jovovich is highly skilled in martial arts and none of her action moves are fake. Sienna Guillory proves to be a professional when it comes to the job.<br/><br/>To put it all together I think few of the critics were harsh about this movie when they don't even know the skill and effort in this movie, OK it is not the best movie in the world but I think its original and its another piece to the Resident Evil collection."

"bonnie91","2","11","23","4 May 2006"," What a disappointment!
","After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.<br/><br/>In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!"
"casperlei0324","7","8","16","23 October 2004"," Pretty cool but not as suspenseful as before
","When I played Resident Evil on PS console for the first time, I was scared most of the time. It was very suspenseful and scary, so was the first Resident Evil movie. In contrast, in the second Resident Evil movie, the main character, Alice, had total ownage. It kind of reduced the suspense in the movie, because she was too powerful so that nobody could actually hurt her.<br/><br/>Suspense is a very important element in any Resident Evil movies/games, but in the second Resident Evil, only the first part of the movie (When Alice hadn't appeared), was pretty frightening. After Alice arrived, it turned into a pure action movie instead of a suspense movie. The action was pretty cool, but I personally prefer more suspense.<br/><br/>The graphics were pretty good, and it was really nice to see some shots that were directly taken from Resident Evil III. Near the end there was even a shot that was taken from Resident Evil X, Code Veronica. I guess there will be another Resident Evil movie, and I hope it is as good as the first one.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I gave this movie 7/10."
"lost-in-limbo","4","5","9","3 May 2006"," Stimulating visuals and kick-ass female leads, but not much else.
","The film begins with a recap of what happened at the end of the last film with Alice waking up to discover Racoon city dead empty. After this we see the virus is released by some Umbrella workers who go into the hive to check what had happen and in doing so, they release the virus and these zombies into the city. To counter attack this problem Umbrella decides to seal off the city even with many uninfected citizens and law-enforcements getting left behind. Alice discovers that she has been injected with a virus, which has given her superhuman abilities. She also come across a small group of survivors led by officer Jill Valentine that she teams up with after being contacted by doctor who wants them to find his daughter and in exchange he'll get them out before Umbrella nukes their mishap.<br/><br/>Now this felt like a video game, but that doesn't mean its actually a good film. I found it to be an improvement over the unexceptional first flick, but not by too much. The original film was directed by Paul Anderson, but he decided to go with the ""Alien vs. Predator"" project instead of directing this piece. He might not have directed the film, but he did write the screenplay for sequel. Instead debut director Alexander Witt sits in the director's chair and brings to the series a far more expansive cookie cutter action flick that's very nice to look at. Well, that is the case when you can see what's happening! Just like the first film this one is just as slick and overly showy in detail. But what did become distracting was the constant use of stupid slow-motion and hasty editing that just got in the way of some of the action. Witt goes out of his way to up the action in leaps and bounds. While, these moments might be longer and be filled with many stylistic Matrix touches, but they just seemed quite pedestrian and unexciting at times. The fast and furious camera-work and pounding metal soundtrack is what gave these scenes its jumpy and highly-powered bursts. It just falls in the same hole as the first film with the arty techniques taking over the show, but at least on this occasion there was more brainless action to go around within it's flashy imprints. What I found a crime was that, where was the splatter? Yep, the violence is watered down and even far more than the previous flick, but the CGI effects were slightly better. The monster make-up is top-notch, though. The morbid claustrophobic atmosphere of ""The Hive"" in the first is replaced here with an subdued post-apocalyptic presence in the city.<br/><br/>Again the ragged plot and characters are secondary to the gloss and glitter of the production. The basic story sets up a typical small group of one-dimensional survivors trying to survive from a horde of zombies, rabid dogs and a mutant killing machine and at the end it gets us geared up for another sequel. It's the usual fluff with many incoherent and illogical lapses and cardboard, comic characters. The plot throws in everything but the kitchen sink from that of the power and influence of the corporation to flashbacks and heroic nonsense. But they don't bother to make too much sense of it with the inane script coming across with the standard clich√É¬© dialogue. They even try to demonstrate some humour with a comic relief character played by Mike Epps that draws more duds and only adds to the misfire. The humour just feels miscast, but Epps' performance is the most lively. The other performances are reasonably cold, but I thought that the always sexy Milla Jovovich was fine and kicked ass again, but really she wasn't given enough to do and she should've been made the centrepiece. Sienna Guillory looked great as the strong willed, mini-skirt wearing Jill Valentine. While, the support roles from Oded Fehr, Sandrine Holt, Zack Ward and Jared Harris are thin at best.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a boisterous and overblown piece of junk that just can't keep still for too long. Well, at least this popcorn flick does kinda entertain and gladly flies by quick enough. Amen!"

","Well, we all know that the video game industry is making huge amounts of money. $50 per game, as opposed to a $10 movie ticket. So the movie makers think ""Hmmm, ima gunna make a movie based on a popular video game and it'll be great! Everyone'll love it"" Well they were horribly wrong. Just like the people who made video games based on movies. (Catwoman)And we're going to see a lot more of them.<br/><br/>The Resident Evil series will always have a place in my heart. the stories of classic video games such as Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, the game this movie is based on are butchered in this film. I really don't like the character Alice, as she is just a Hollywood add-on to woo people who have never played the games. She was good in the first film, because that was an original story, set in the RE story.<br/><br/>This movie, being a remake of RE3, didn't meet my expectations. The problem was, after playing the game and loving it, I continued to expect a lot of things from the movie. In other words, I have a lot of high standards on sequels and movies, I want the same enjoyment i got from watching, or in this case, playing, the original. Which in most cases, was not satisfied.<br/><br/>This movie is OKAY for anyone who has never played the Resident Evil games, or know nothing about the story preceding the movies. If you have played the games, I'll bet that you will be thoroughly disappointed."

","Now, I was not an immediate fan of the first movie. I didn't hate it! But I was not happy with it at first. <br/><br/>But with an added budget (the studios actually LISTENED for once), and a better, more cohesive story, this second installment is quite entertaining! It combines top of the line CG-Eye Candy with natural dialog and some dark twists to bring you wonderfully dark story sequences and some bone-crunching action! It was practically non-stop action from start to finish and Milla Jovovich's tom-boy style really served her well this time around. <br/><br/>The direction was superb! The shots and layouts; the sequences and colors! I could easily compare the use of color and cutting sequences with the over-touted Suspira, but .. I just did. This was a GOOD Resident Evil MOVIE!! <br/><br/>Great action, great story, great portrayals. On the downside, the extras playing zombies must have all missed their mommies so much!! I'm telling' ya! Those in the background had that ""gotta wave cuz we're on camera"" thing going on, and it almost distracted Me from this otherwise GREAT flick! I mean, put on the eggs cuz the ham's already DONE!<br/><br/>The ""creepy kid sitting in a chair with his/her back turned who doesn't turn out to be a totally healthy lil kid anymore"" device has been used and abused. In fact, this tactic should have been retired to a shoe box the second Scary Movie 3 parodied it so well.<br/><br/>The fight between Nemesis and Alice was ... well, it looked GREAT on film, but... okay, there's NO WAY it would've gone like that. But okay. Just one small contrivance to help further the movie, and it can be forgiven because it really ~does~ look great on film.<br/><br/>This is not a ""thinking man's movie,"" nor is it classic horror fare. This attempt falls short in both of those departments because it is, above all, an action flick with horror ~elements~. It is not meant to be scary. It ~is~ meant to be suspenseful, which it certainly is. <br/><br/>This production utilizes brilliantly choreographed fighting sequences and some great style, without taking itself too seriously. It is played straight from the vest, with little humor; just as it should be. The drama was a tangible entity.<br/><br/>Some consider the cemetery scene in this movie to be a ""Plot Hole."" Their contention is that the T-Virus would not (or could not) affect those already dead and under ground. While I agree with this particular vein of thought, I must explain that this sequence was an attempt to romance the fanboys. Call it an ""homage,"" if you will, to the cemetery segment of the wildly popular video game, ""Resident Evil 2."" <br/><br/>The argument has also been made that Alice, being who and what she is, would never have led them through such a dangerous area ~as~ the cemetery. Again, I have to say that it was (however contrived) an attempt to win over the fanboys who all but killed box office receipts of the first installment of this line.<br/><br/>IF you're a zombie fan, a fan of the game, or just like freaky deaky dark lil horror flix to snuggle your best girl by, this is the one for YOU!!! <br/><br/>This is definitely an ""A"" scale production which has surpassed its first installment and earned nearly three times the initial estimated budget!<br/><br/>It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

"iamsam103","4","5","10","23 December 2005"," Is better and worst than the original, but still fails to transfer the ""Resident Evil"" franchise to the screen.
","If you find my review of ""Resident Evil"" you will very quickly discover I didn't like it. Simply because the director took the ideas and settings of Resi, and made his own thing. Eliminating gore, suspense and horror and instead making a lame action film. This film, has more to do with the Resi franchise, but still comes across as more of an action film than a survival horror. <br/><br/>The film, once again, starts off well, with the threat of the virus unleashed and Racoon City being evacuated. However, after that, it goes rapidly downhill. There is actually a lack of zombies in this film (which is odd considering the city is meant to be full of them)and even when they're on screen, they're presented in a dull, laggy collage of moments which is meant to intensify their horrid appearance, but just makes them boring. <br/><br/>The film centres around our main protagonist (super charged naked Milla Javovich - spelling?) as she is now a super hero and is helping a group of survivors escape from the city. It is good to see some of the characters such as Carlos and Jill Valentine appear from the game but they're characters are never explored and one gets the impression they're there to look cool and kick butt instead of having actual depth. But then again, this film has no depth.<br/><br/>At the end of the first film, audiences were treated with the possibility for a sequel involving Nemesis (a rock hard ugly dude in leather.) In the game, he is a force to be reckoned with and is truly terrifying and screamingly brutal. In the film, he comes off VERY cheesy, he is armed to the teeth with explosives and machine guns, and seems to appear, shoot at our main female, then disappear. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>There are some good moments though, such as making Lickers less powerful, making for a fairly entertaining shootout in a church (that is a until an overly dramatised bike scene is introduced), and a school full of zombie children. Although both these ideas are full of potential, they're both streamlined into lame action set pieces and never used to full advantage to creep the audience out.<br/><br/>The ending is the worst for the entire film, in which Nemesis joins up with our heroes to fight the evil Umbrella Corporation. It must be said that these ""teaming-ups by former enemies"" is a horrid idea, also idealised in Aliens Versus Predator (directed by the same guy who made the first Resi film and also produced this film.)<br/><br/>As I stated before, this film is a lame cheesy action flick - not the survival horror it deserves to be.<br/><br/>For the moment, I am hoping there is not a Resi 3 in the pipeline."

I should have respected the experience.<br/><br/>What the hell Alexander Witt?! Where are the zombies, man?! The whole movie was about the Thing-and-Robocop-hybrid Nemesis (Ah, and how scary I'd imagined it would be..) and the long-coming death match between him and Alice. There was no room for zombies! <br/><br/>Alice was turned into a superhero, acrobatic cycler, angry Lara Croft. Don't get me wrong, this does not give the movie a game-like feeling. (If you want to see the best example for that, watch Silent Hill) The director takes Resident Evil by the hand and dishonorably turns it into an average action flick. <br/><br/>How low can you get, adding pointless action scenes to a zombie movie just to keep the tension up? (""Omg! They're gonna get bored! Milla, break through this window with your motorbike! This'll give us a few more minutes."" ) <br/><br/>And Jill Valentine... Great choice of actress but bad, bad practice integrating her to the film. She was absolutely suppressed by Alice and didn't really serve any purpose to the film. Maybe two alpha females can't be a good idea.<br/><br/>The writing was bad (lots of ""But why?""s and ""But how?""s), the ending was bad (although it was supposed to leave us surprised and excited), the characters were mostly shallow and it was not, I repeat, NOT nearly scary enough.<br/><br/>Resident Evil is supposed to be scary. That's like the first and very simple rule of the RE trademark, unfortunately the director preferred to ignore it and showed us how unimaginative he can be about scary movies. If I were a studio, I would never, ever hand him over another horror project."

It has loads more elements of the game, like Jill and Carlos, Ashford (that should be called Birkin)... Talking about Ashford... He was the one who made me like the movie. I think he's one of the best characters there since he's the ""vehicle"". Let's face it... without Ashford they would all be dead. Keep this in mind when you go see the movie.

Umbrella immediately tried to rescue their scientists, only, their high priority extraction (Ashford, wheelchair high IQ scientist)) refuses to leave 'cause his daughter is still at school. They go get his daughter but she has a car crash. So she is trapped in the city. And then come all the other characters.

","Here's a warning to all movie snobs - STAY AWAY! Everybody else go have a good time. I really enjoyed the movie, but let me fill you in on where I'm coming from:<br/><br/>1) I like the Resident Evil video games. <br/><br/>2) I love watching Milla kick decayed zombie butt. <br/><br/>3) I love the addition of another hot babe who knows how to kick decayed zombie butt.<br/><br/>If you identify with the above, then this is the movie for you. Also, keep in mind that a person's level of enjoyment for a movie like this goes down as his age goes up. Let me put this in fundamental terms: this is all about Milla in tight outfits, shooting guns, back flipping off motorcycles, breaking zombie necks, and just looking mighty fine doing it all. Folks, that's all I really need sometimes. Oh, and Sienna Guillory doesn't exactly open the eyes of the Oscar voters, but she sure makes a sexy Jill Valentine!<br/><br/>Atmosphere plays a big part as well. Things are often loud, dark, and chaotic. So you can expect a booming soundtrack, a handful of jump scenes, and a whole lot of gory deaths. My main complaint is that sometimes things are a little too chaotic, especially in some fight scenes. The camera is too close to fully absorb everything that's happening. Come on cameramen, pull back a little.<br/><br/>One thing many zombie movies lack is a main antagonist. Characters usually have to deal with a bunch of generic zombies chasing after them, but that's not the case here. Nemesis is one scary monstrosity. I've played the video game, and he's something you don't want on your tail. The addition of the Lickers (creatures from the game) is also a nice touch. The CGI is well done.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for an all-out, non-stop thrill ride that is intent on preventing you from catching your breath, and you don't insist on the deepest story in the world, then there's really no reason not to see Resident Evil: Apocalypse. And ladies, I know I've gone on about the lovely Milla, but if you have the slightest interest in zombie movies or you just like fast-paced action with a serving of gore, then there's plenty for you to enjoy as well.<br/><br/>In terms of pure entertainment value this falls between 3.5 and 4 marks. I'm gonna shake up my rating system and give it a 3.75!!! It's Friday; you never know what kind of wild antics I might get up to.<br/><br/>THE GIST<br/><br/>Please don't go into this movie expecting anything resembling realism. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a movie based on a video game, and in my opinion, it's exactly what a video game inspired movie should be. It's gory, it's violent, it's got lots of heavy artillery, it's got a super cool villain, it's got well-toned heroines puttin' on a show ... in other words, this is the movie most adrenaline-fueled guys have been waiting for all year."

The stunts were mind blowing as Alice (Jovovich)crashes through a church window dodging every piece of glass in a slalom.<br/><br/>With funny, outgoing characters such as L.J (Mike epps) Bringing humour to this oustounding sequel. With quotes such as 'My sh!t is custom' and 'Ive got this bitch', Resident evil includes at least one aspect of every genre (accept romance)"

","This movie has everything a well done action movie should have: an intriguing story line, amazing special effects, and scantily clad beautiful women with large weapons!! Great fun for everyone, except the zombies.<br/><br/>The director does a wonderful job of making the movie look exactly like the video game it is based on. I particularly enjoyed use of a large corporation trying to control the world as the villain. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: this movie will never win an Oscar.

"dbborroughs","6","6","14","12 September 2004"," Frustrating- Well made movie with nothing in the center
","Picking up at the end of the first movie this film tops whats gone before, but at it heart is a decidedly empty center.<br/><br/>The plot begins with the evil corporation going back into the Hive complex that was the setting of the first film. They are unprepared for what they find and are almost instantly over run by the walking dead. The dead spill out into the city above and it becomes a fight for survival.<br/><br/>This film moves better than the first film. Certainly the handling of the dead and the mutants is infinitely better. The action scenes are first rate, the performances are very good, in fact this film has everything to be considered ""Dawn of the Dead 2"" except a real plot.<br/><br/>Thats the rub, for the first half hour there is no real plot only introductions of characters. The second half hour the plot finally kicks in, but by that time I was a bit too distanced from it to care. Essentially the plot has to do with this band of people trying to get out of the city by rescuing the daughter of one of the scientists responsible for the whole mess. The corporation behind it all has their own plans and it becomes a three way battle, good guys, corporation and monsters. If only there had been more to the script, then we'd be talking classic here.<br/><br/>I don't know. I gave the film a 6 out of 10, but its probably better than that, I'm just awash in serious disappointment because whats good is so good, that I wanted more behind it.<br/><br/>Try it and decide for yourself."

","So tonight I was in a mood for pain, and boy did Resident Evil2 meet my needs. The only cool highlights of seeing the movie were a reference to GTA3 (Thereby cementing the fact that the movie needs to steal from better things to survive), and a preview for a much scarier looking film : White Noise. This one looks wicked creepier than the film I actually went to see. I won't even talk about acting because it is like shooting fish in a barrel. On a related note, why was everyone so eager to see the character of Jill Valentine? She was hot and all and wore mini-skirts, but reeked of that horrible Tomb Raider movie and was about as bland and expressionless as a mannequin.<br/><br/>There were no scares because I could predict everything that was supposed to scare us about 2 minutes before it happened. They were all of the lowest ""BOO"" quality because no one knew how to properly build tension in the movie. The zombies were drunks with a biting problem. It's impossible to believe they can take over an entire city when they can't even walk straight. The sub baddies (lickers and zombie dogs) should've gotten more screen time as they WERE kinda cool. Nemesis at first was cool but then got lamer and lamer as the movie went on. The script was totally illogical. Would it be too much trouble for Paul S. Anderson to at least make us think there is a chance in hell of say, an ending? Not necessarily a good one, but an ending? Does he know how to do anything but make bad movies that demand sequels? I bet he took about half an hour to whip up the story for this. I'd bet even more that I could whip up a better movie story to this than he could. At least he didn't have the funny black guy die. I could go on, but you get the idea. This gets a D-."
"andrew-757","1","5","11","21 April 2005"," Absolutely horrible
","I didn't care much for the original Resident Evil movie, yet it did manage to work here and there as a trendy horror movie enough that it earned a spot on my DVD shelf. This one, as I feared, is all style, no substance, very much like AVP, Walking Tall, and all of these new generation actioners with slick-looking trailers but no teeth.<br/><br/>Basically, it's 90 some minutes of a few people strutting around striking cool poses, always trying to look cool in blurry action sequences that defy physics. That may sound good to action fans, but believe me, the whole movie is a hollow experience. There's no character development, nothing to make any of us care about any one of the cast of characters within it. As in the first movie, the universe apparently revolves around Paul W.S. Anderson's wife, Milla ""ALICE"" Jovovich, who now has mutant abilities.<br/><br/>The zombies in this movie, which is why a lot of people like me would come to see a movie like this for, are perhaps the greatest crime in this film. If they could have just gotten the zombies right, I could forgive a lot of the quick-cut garbage. The very few sequences zombies are seen, *you can't even see them!* I have no idea what they were doing, but it seems whenever a zombie(s) is on-screen, the camera begins shaking terribly and the screen gets blurry and in slow-mo, then begins showing you a hard-to-see montage of zombies (again blurry cam employed), so you can literally see nothing but vague outlines of the zombies marching around. And I may not be 100% up on my Resident Evil game lore (I've beaten Zero and 1 for Gamecube), but most zombies I'm aware of in film don't die when you break their neck. But egads, if you're making a zombie movie, just make a zombie movie. It's like the director or cinematographer Also, like Resident Evil before it (and this may be a budgetary issue), it seemed like the people making the movie forgot they were making an R-rated movie. Violence is MTV quick-cut to the point where you can't tell what's going on in any scene with anything other than two people talking to each other, and the gore is minimal. There's a couple of scenes with nudity... admittedly, quite good nudity, but they seem to serve the only reminder to the audience that they're watching an R movie.<br/><br/>Watching the movie and dabbling in the Resident Evil games, RE:A seems more video game-like than the damn video game series, which at least were imbued with a healthy dosage of effective Japanese horror ala Parasite Eve, Ringu, etc..<br/><br/>One thing... RE:A does make a zombie fan very appreciative that George Romero is finally able to do his 4th zombie movie, Land of the Dead, and that should be out in June."

"Captain_Couth","Null","5","11","14 October 2004"," I was impressed, sort of.
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) was a lot better than I expected. I was disappointed by the first film. It was kind of cool because it's been awhile since I seen a zombie movie on the big screen but the end results were mediocre at best. The sequel was far more entertaining and more like a video game movie. The only thing that would keep this movie from getting a higher rating is the fact that there is very little blood or gore. Besides a couple of scenes there really isn't much. The action<br/><br/>set pieces were pretty good whilst the pacing is just right for a movie of this type.<br/><br/>Taking place right after the events that have transpired in the first film, Racoon City has been overruned with zombies! The Umbrella corporation (doing what all big companies would do) remove all key important members of their company from the city and seal off the exits in hope of trying to contain their little accident. <br/><br/>The city is sealed off from the rest of the world. It's residents are cut off and are basically left to fend for themselves whilst<br/><br/>the virus runs it's course. But a few people inside don't want to become a zombie's midnight snack. So it's up to Claire and Alice plus a few other survivors to try and survive. But a wrench is thrown into their plans. Umbrella wants to try out their latest and most expensive project to date. Fans of the video game series know whom I'm talking about!<br/><br/>A fun film that'll entertain genre fans. Just don't expect a lot from a movie like this. You have to rate films like this differently than other genres (such as Dramas and Epics). This is the kind of movie you'll just have to leave your thinking caps at the door.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>B"
"greenhourfilms2","3","2","3","17 September 2012"," A bit of a step down from the original but still good
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse has excellent action and more characters from Capcom's beloved franchise. This action is bigger, the girls are hotter, and they are more zombies.

String music just doesn't go well with killing zombies I guess.<br/><br/>Besides the music(which I can get past), bad acting(which I can also get past), it's a damn good mindless action flick.

","I was a little skeptical about this sequel since I liked the original, but after 5 minutes, I knew that this would be a worthy sequel. I don't think it is as good as part 3 or the Original itself, but I do believe that this film is top notch, going for a different style.<br/><br/>The plot is basically the same where the same character, Alice teams up with some survivors and fights the same corrupt bimbos who let out the virus in the first place. Although the plot is still not fully developed, I think that the themes, kills and action have changed. I thought the one eyed looking creature was also awesome as well. These elements to me is what made this sequel still stand the test of time.<br/><br/>The action scenes and kills are much more better, the themes of setting the story into the open, public cities was an excellent choice because it gave the film a different feel where anyone (infected or not) could be killed or under threat at any time, and even the elements of the nasty corporation being fleshed out more gave us these gritty feelings of really hating those characters.<br/><br/>Overall, even if the plot of RE2 is not well-developed on any level, the film itself is still entertaining.<br/><br/>7/10"
"lastliberal-853-253708","8","2","3","11 March 2012"," My name is Alice and I remember everything.
","I am going out on a limb here and rating the sequel better than the original. I do that because it had way more zombie action and a lot less sci-fi. Sorry, gamers, but I want a movie, not a game.<br/><br/>Alexander Witt had scads of experience as a second unit director and cameraman, and did a decent job in his directorial debut. Unfortunately, he was up against some real zombie action, now (Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead), so the film fell short for some. Their loss! Milla Jovovich was back and juiced up with the virus and evolved into a kick-ass beauty that would give Jet Li a run for his money. She is accompanied by Sienna Guillory from Love Actually, Helen of Troy, and the Principle of Lust, and that gives us a duo of beautiful action babes.<br/><br/>Say what you will, but Nemesis was as bad as I've seen since Robocop, and damn ugly to boot. I haven't seen such rabid dogs since Rottweiller; they were awesome! Like I say, this film had a lot more zombie action and a fitting end to the jerk in charge."

","While the setting could remind many of the old Western movies, it does pack quite a bit of action in here. And therefor makes it more straightforward then the first movie. It also is picking up where the first one left us off. So it does make sense, to watch the first Resident Evil movie. You do not have to have played the games though. Though there are characters in here, that you might have seen or heard of, if you did, it also offers things, that have not been handled in the game series at all! <br/><br/>Milla is joined by some other people and we do have a ""funny man"" in here too. So there is some comic relief after all (if that was the one thing, you were missing in the first movie). On the other hand, it is far more lighter, because of the absence of any real story. You'll either think this is a good thing or not, but it is the way it is."
"tburke85","6","2","3","18 June 2009"," Resident Evil Apocalypse Action Packed But Flawed
","Resident Evil Apocalypse is action packed but flawed from director Alexander Witt whose admirable in making this sequel but the lack of character development, too many characters, real suspense, and a more central villain are what weighed it down. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretchman, Jared Harris, and Mike Epps. The rest of the cast are okay in their small roles of characters from the games who only make brief extended appearances before being written out out of the movie too soon for the audience to care about them. The action is pretty much non sop and impressive but after a while it gets to but a bit repetitive. The only one that really stands out is probably the one near the end which is well executed. The special effects and the make up artists have done a great job of creating the creatures including the zombies, dogs, Lickers, and the newest one introduced known as Nemesis who was actually Matt from the original. He mutated into Nemesis after being scratched by the Licker near the end of the first film. The Nemesis character is intimidating but he lacked screen time since there are other villains in this movie besides him. His showdown with Jovovich near the conclusion is a bit of a letdown like the third movie but it was fitting for that film. Despite some flaws with character development, suspense, and the movie juggling too many characters this sequel isn't that bad. Overall Resident Evil Apocalypse is a decent sci-fi thriller with plenty of action, amazing special effects, some suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast who make this second film in the series worth watching but it could've been better."

When u get bitten by a zombie it takes two hours for them to transform, Carlos got bitten for two hours and all he got was a slight cough! The Zombies looked to healthy to be dead, the special effects are none to bright either. it seemed Alexander Witt (dir) just shouted ""atcion"" and let the actors get on with it, Milla Jovovich and Oded Fehr have been in some really good films in the past, but judging by this film and their performances this is the end of the careers.

Like the first film i was not happy about it being nothing like the games, but aside that it was a very good film. The second has lots of action, some funny moments and a good cast. If u do watch and not like it it's because u need to loosen up and remember it is only based on the games. the film starts with a background of the first, carries straight on. Alice is cool, she is strong fast and her clothes are boss. the nemesis is a bit of a joke, but OK and is horrible and scary. the scene were the nemesis fights Alice is very good. the graveyard scene is good, but too fast. the licker bit was good because in the first there was one licker and it was the main evil, but there are a few and it increases the tension. the scenes which are from the games are exactly the same and are a good reminder and it shows there are some aspects of the game. Jill is great, she is just so cool and jealous of Alice, it's funny. I like the nemesis fight at the end and the very end basically tells us there's gonna be a 3rd. it answers most of the questions, and if it doesn't it's because it hints at and u need to think about it.

Speaking from the point of view of not having ever played the game that much, I probably miss out on many little errors and what nots. But I spoke with some friends who played the game and they told me that they would get flashbacks all throughout the movie. No surprise the plot line is just a continuation of the first movie. In classic sequel style there are more zombies and there are meaner and bigger zombies. And of course the movie ends nice and open ended leaving the door wide open for another follow up.

There is something about Milla Jovovich that makes her a great as the part of Alice and Jill is also amazing.

The plot was almost non existent, which kinda sucks being that the original was founded on a - dare i say it - engaging plot. We got likable characters with a certain depth to them, enough for us to hope for their survival. This film threw in a bunch of ""cool"" new characters without so much of a mention as to where they're coming from (yes I'm talking about you Jill Valentine). Being an avid fan of the games, I was hoping to find at least some reference to Jill's experience in the mansion. I let it slid, I figured I knew her background so no use in wasting time right? Well I will tell you this much, there was NEVER a dull moment in RE:A. This is probably the most action packed movie you will see all year, if not the last 5 years. Each scene finds the protagonists in a new environment with one of the myriad threats presented along the way. I had expected a more action centric movie as compared to the first, but jeez, this movie was so over the top I found it impossible not to enjoy.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of Resident Evil was Milla Jovovich, who once again owns the screen. While her character lacks the dialogue and sass she had in the first movie, she partakes in more action scenes than any other character. Her performance was mostly in facial expressions and an intimidation factor highly elevated from the original. Basically, Alice is one badass mother****er, an attitude Milla conveyed to a tee. Sienna Guilleroy was satisfying in her 2-dimensional role as Jill Valentine. She played it cool and her outfit was classic. No one else in the movie really stuck out acting wise, although the little girl was a nice form of continuity with the first.<br/><br/>Here was my BIGGEST problem with Resident Evil: Apocalypse: the directing. Alexander Witt must be a schizophrenic (sp?) because this movie felt like it had three different directors. First, there was the MTV style quick cuts which are becoming all too popular in big Hollywood action movies as of late. Also appearing were a couple of cool 90s action movie shots in which all the action is clear from a bitchin angle, like shot behind Alice in the church watching the explosion. Finally the b-horro film director had to get his say, adding (many) effective jump scenes and crooked angles. The guy just couldn't make up his mind; my eyes rolled each time the MTV style was featured, something which happened too much for my taste. I think Paul Anderson would've done a much better job.<br/><br/>I am still collecting my thoughts on this movie. It was such a big thing for me, I couldn't possibly decide a solid grade after a single viewing. I did like a lot of what I saw, exclaimed ""holy sh*t"" a lot, and even jumped out of my seat on much more occasions than I was expecting. I'm going to recommend this movie to fans of the original and to all action fans; you should not be disappointed."

","Resident Evil Apocalypse rocks! Anyone walking out of this film and not saying that had no business watching the movie to begin with. The dynamite sequel features Milla Jovovich in a kick ass performance as Alice. Picking up right where the last one left off. Racoon City has been destroyed by the T virus and it'sa effects as it was mistakenly let loose from the contaminated Hive. The now infamous Umbrella Corporation quarantines the city locking a few survivors and it's deadly inhabitants with them. Amongst the characters are game idols Jill valentine played brilliantly by Sienna Guilroy and The mummy's Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera. The film also features the Nemesis. if you have no idea of what I'm referring too you have no business seeing this film. It's definitely a high for RE fans to see their fav games done with such justice. Sure maybe the acting and dialogue are a bit cheesy but it's all part of a much bigger picture and I for one can't wait to see this brilliant franchises end result."
"swampthing-5","7","2","3","12 September 2004"," Sienna Guillory ruled in this movie as Jill Valentine...
","The first hour of the movie was really good. I'm a big FAN of the RESIDENT EVIL video games and I thought it was very similliar to to the games. When Alice & Nemesis started fighting each other and then he turned on Umbrella was very stupid and out of character. Anyhoo at least he said ""S.T.A.R.S."" once. Sienna Guillory was the BEST THING ABOUT THE MOVIE. The actress portraying JILL VALENTINE, nailed her character, she portrayed her really well. If there's a third part to the franchise I hope that Alice is killed in the begginning of the movie or she's not in it at all and hopefully they'll get rid of Paul W. Anderson. I hope they bring Chris Redfield and Barry Burton and Albert Albert Wesker as the main villain of the movie."
"AnFStudBoy84","10","2","3","12 September 2004"," One for the records in the horror/action category!
","Sometimes you just want to sit back and have fun at the theatre. Resident Evil: Apocalypse isn't going to win any awards at the Oscar's, but why do critics always make it seem like the only movies worth watching are ones with symbolism and deep, hidden meanings? This has got all the ingredients for an awesome horror/action flick (hot chicks kicking zombie ass, explosions, and of course plenty of gore). Milla Jovovich returns to her role as Alice, a former employee of the multi-billion dollar Umbrella corporation. She was altered by Umbrella to be a kind of super-human (she can now run down buildings, jump about 30 feet into the air, and has the strength of twenty men). Fans of the video game will be happy to see Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliviera, characters from the actual game, making their appearance here. The pacing of the movie is nearly perfect, and there's even some much-needed comic relief. But perhaps the greatest achievement of the film is Nemesis, a bioweapon created by Umbrella to hunt and kill S.T.A.R.S. members (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad). He is a monstrosity who can only be challenged by the super-human Alice. As anyone who has played Resident Evil 3 knows, you don't want Nemesis after you. Overall, this game is a huge treat for fans of the Resident Evil video game series, fans of the original Resident Evil movie, or fans of the horror/action genre. Now go see it!!"
"this_isyour_life","7","2","3","10 September 2004"," Good movie, lots of action, hot women
","I thought the movie was good. The action was a little frantic, but the overall plot was well thought out. Following the storyline of the game introducing new characters is a great idea that the director does well. Milla and Sienna do a great job as the heroines. Mike Epps does an excellent job providing some comedic relief. I really like the fact that the writers made the movie for fans, and that it is something fans of the movie and the games would enjoy watching as the story unfolds. Perhaps you will even remember a part from the game in the movie. All else I can really say without giving the movie away is that as long as Milla keeps looking hot I'll see whatever they decide to do in the future. I will look forward to a sequel if it is done as well as the first two."

","This movie consistently flowed better along its story lines than the first installment did. First of all, you've got to remember that it's an action movie - and a sci-fi action movie at that - so there's going to be some pieces that everyone would change. Especially the people who have played the video games. For one example - the Nemesis, should have been bigger, but again, it's a fantasy movie. As with all fantasy movies, you've got your small selection of cheesy lines, but overall, the movie was great - better than its predecessor. Milla did a fantastic job and they had a great supporting cast. I will definitely look forward to RE3, as long as Anderson directs that one as well."

I can honestly say it was at least a little better then the first because
there is more. This time there is more action less scares.<br/><br/>I seen this one on DVD with a buddy, after I responded well to the first
he had the second film and brought it over and we watched it, I loved it
even more because it had a lot of action and it left me wanting more,
because it ends on a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>This film pretty much picks up right were the first leaves off,
Umbrella employees re-open the hive and release the zombies,
within a few hours the city is over-run by the undead. 
Alice wakes up as in the first and enters the city and helps a group
of survivors as they battle against Umbrella Corporation.<br/><br/>There are plot twists that are confusing and some unexpected but it's fun.
And the best part a video game favorite, Nemesis is in it, and he is awesome.<br/><br/>I give it a 7/10. A fun follow up to the first, and like the first, ends on
a cliffhanger and leaves you wanting more. But I'll be honest the series
goes down hill from here. This is the second best in the series."
"onionbagel","9","1","1","29 January 2017"," Great adaptation of Resident Evil: ORC!
","Resident Evil Apocalypse is a loose adaptation of the video game Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City, and/or a cross between Resident Evil 2 & Resident Evil: Nemesis.<br/><br/>Alice wakes up in the Raccoon City lab (that was referenced at the end of the first movie) and finds herself in an abandoned, post-apocalyptic city called Raccoon City. She meets several people along the way (some survivors, some spec-ops like the first movie) and they try to find a way out of the city together (the government is going to nuke Raccoon City to contain/kill the infected/the T-Virus). Towards the end of the movie, Alice must face a ""boss"" (like in the video games) called ""The Nemesis"". He is virtually indestructible; she finds out it is one of the people from the first movie (Michael) and he ends up sacrificing himself to save the group from a helicopter crash. The final scene reveals that a man named Doctor Isaacs cloned Alice (this will come into play in the next movie).<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Unlike the first movie, this one was pretty accurate to the games (in my opinion); so...if you like action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls, or all of the above AND the Resident Evil games, you'll like this movie!"
"jtindahouse","6","1","1","10 January 2017"," Does just enough to stay afloat
","I said in my review of the original 'Resident Evil' that I hope the character of 'Alice' evolves and really stamps herself as the undisputed lead character of the series. That was probably the strongest thing 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' actually had going for it. The character really came alive. In the previous film I mentioned she often felt like just another member of the crew. In this one though there can be no doubt that she is in charge. <br/><br/>There's just enough going on in this film to keep it watchable. Near the start all the zombies came out again and I feared this was going to be a one trick pony with the character simply avoiding them for the entire run time. Luckily though in the second half of the movie a number of other things popped into the story to keep it fresh and interesting enough to be sustainable.<br/><br/>There are some very good action sequences in this film, but there are also some rather dull and unimaginative ones too. The consistency of quality just wasn't quite there. Also the characters, other than 'Alice' , really weren't that memorable this time around around. Most were either boring or simply annoying. For a sequel though 'Resident Evil: Apocalpyse' certainly holds its own and doesn't let the franchise down in any way."
"Uriah43","6","1","1","20 November 2012"," Almost As Good As the Original
","This sequel to ""Resident Evil"" begins where the first movie left off. ""Alice"" (Milla Jovovich) has been captured by the Umbrella Corporation and is having experiments done to her while she is mostly unconscious. During this time the Umbrella Corporation sends security personnel back into ""the Hive"" to try to figure out what happened. Upon entering, the security personnel are quickly overwhelmed by the zombies who rapidly enter into the general population of ""Raccoon City"". This causes mass panic as the infection spreads out-of-control. When Alice awakens she finds herself alone in the laboratory and upon exiting it sees the devastation brought upon Raccoon City. At any rate, rather than giving away any surprises I will just say that this film is almost as good as the original. Not only does Milla Jovovich give an awesome performance but so does Sienna Guillory (""Jill Valentine"") and Oded Fehr (""Carolos Olivera""). As a matter of fact, Sienna Guillory could have probably starred in her own right had Milla Jovovich not been available. Likewise, Sandrine Holt (as the television newscaster, ""Terri Morales"") and Mike Epps (""L.J."") did very well in a supporting role. I also liked the performance of Thomas Kretschmann as the bad guy, ""Major Tom Cain"". In short, there is a lot to like about this film. It has good acting, plentiful action and excellent special effects. As such, if a person liked the original then they will probably enjoy this one as well."

","I'm a huge fan of horror movies, sci-fi and Zombie flicks. I'm not a huge fan of action or gun movies and I hate movies based on games - but you know what - I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! This movie starts where the previous one left off, a plague has infected a city causing the dead to rise and seek to devour the living. Along with that is the understory is the ""end of the world"" aspect of how one could contain an outbreak like this how society would break down and it would seem that the end of the world is imminent. We have also the intrigue of a powerful company conducting dangerous experiments with almost complete impunity and dangering the rest of us. The viewer is left asking the question, could something almost this bad really happen, perpetrated by our government, a large corporation, a foreign power, terrorists? To what lengths will powerful people go in the quest for power or money? The movie is a great roller coaster ride of trills but also action characters that you care about, who are not just zombie fodder. The movie has some great action/fight sequences without being tedious like many of the karate or Tarrantino movies are these days. Well worth your time if you enjoy any of the types of movies I've described. A must see for zombie or apocalypse movie fans."
"de_cafe6914","7","1","1","5 November 2006"," Excellent Sequel
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an excellent sequel in my eyes. It didn't try to mimic the first film, and did things its own way to further the storyline. However, too much action just about eliminates the horror aspect of the series, and the end is just way too out there for my tastes.<br/><br/>Story: Well, that pesky Umbrella Corporation doesn't know how to leave well enough alone, and re-opens the Hive, unleashing the virus onto poor Racoon City. The city becomes a necropolis, and Alice bands together with a few other survivors in an attempt to escape the city and bring Umbrella down. This time, Umbrella steps up the game, unleashing Nemesis, a monster bent on taking them out.<br/><br/>Direction: Alexander Witt is no Paul Anderson, but he is a grand action movie director. He brings a different style and look to this film, which I liked. However, he never really builds up any suspense or horror into this film, which was my main problem. Still, he did a solid job and made a damn good sequel.<br/><br/>Acting: Milla Jovovich(Alice) kept her performance from the first film, but is much tougher. She can do just about anything. Sienna Guillory(Jill) portrayed the games heroin Jill excellently, and I was not disappointed with her at all. Mm, sexy! Oded Fehr(Carlos) is one of my favorites, and as usual, he rocked the part. However, their talent seemed wasted in this film, because none of the characters really have any depth.<br/><br/>Score: Jeff Danna scored an action film. Not the hardest thing in the world to do, but he did so with great skill. Though, it was pretty standard stuff.<br/><br/>Violence: As with most sequels, the violence is kicked up a notch or two. There may be a total of five minutes in between shoot outs if we're lucky. The blood level was also increased. We get head shots, bloody gunshot wounds, zombie bites and related gore, decomposed bodies, hideous creatures, an exploded head, and impalings. Yum!<br/><br/>Profanity/Sexual Themes: Mike Epps was in the film. Enough said about the language. As far as sexual themes is concerned, we get to topless zombie strippers, and a naked Milla Jovovich in a tank of liquid. Nothing to invoke any wood.<br/><br/>Substance Abuse: None.<br/><br/>Overall: Overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a good zombie sequel. The only thing that bothered me was that there was no real horror or suspense. Perhaps even a bit too much action, and the ending was way too far fetched. Still, I was entertained, and that is all I expected to be. 7/10"

That being said I am no fanboy and you will find that this is an unbiased review. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie. The movie does seem to convey a sense of suspense and the fight scenes are action packed. Computer animated special effects were below average. The makeup job they did for the zombies slightly makes up for it. I did not notice as many plot holes as I expected for a action movie based on a video game to have. The ""nemesis"", who is the toughest zombie, looks absolutely horrible. The makeup and costume just looks entirely fake. Fun, worth a rental at most.

","The title says it all really.<br/><br/>The acting was amongst the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few crappy movies in my time.<br/><br/>Not even a shimmer of acting by any of the actors. I simply have to assume the audition went something like this. For the male actors: ""Can you walk? Can you wear clothes? What? Never acted before? Doesn't matter, you're hired"". For the women: ""Can you walk? Do you mind wearing scant clothes? Never acted before? No problem, we'll give you some drivel to spit out since acting isn't a pre-req for this 'kind' of movie"".<br/><br/>I did like the eye candy, I admit, both the props and the sexy women. However, when they have less than zero (negative) acting capacity, one just wants to demand the money back, or for the theater / producer to pay me for wasting two hours on cinematic suffering.<br/><br/>The Plot then.. Well, it was thin as ice. It took me until the middle of the movie before I though I might possibly have perceived what the story was about: Getting out of a doomed city. Short version of the film: Blam Blam Blam, one liners ala: ""Me get wood"", ""Bit me"" and for some odd reason a lost Harry Potter side kick ""Oye, a thought upon me stuck, where be thee Elves""!?<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the awful camera and editing of the fight scenes. The zeleot who edited this clip EDITED AWAY with all the fights. The only thing one sees is someone having a huge problem holding a camera still!! This really bugs me, since if they at least had had an average camera guy, the fight scenes might have turned this movie from god awful to below average (the props and special effects were nice, so at least I could've gotten an OK fighting movie out of it).<br/><br/>As it unfortunately stands, I'd have to rate it a 3/10."
"meako1973","Null","4","9","12 October 2004"," Resident Evil: Atrocious
","The first film received a very mixed reception on release. People either loved it totally, or despised it, and the criticism levied towards the director (Paul WS Anderson) was, to be truthful, very harsh. I kinda liked it. As a fan of the games and also one of the few fans of Anderson himself, I enjoyed it from start to finish. The ending of the film hinted at the plot for the sequel, and I couldn't wait. Well, the wait is over¬Ö. The film begins with a quick recap of event so far, telling us that Umbrella were developing genetic and viral weapons in their underground labs beneath Racoon C0ity, but something went wrong. The T Virus was released and the dead began to rise from the dead. Into this walked Alice, and ex-employee of Umbrella, who at the end of the first film awoke to find the whole of Racoon City had been infected. There begins Apocalypse! Alice has been experimented on to give her enhanced abilities, and soon finds herself leading a rag-tag bunch of survivors (including Jill Valentine, one of the most popular characters in the game) to rescue the daughter of Charles Ashford, the creator of the virus. At the same time the Nemesis experiment is released to stop her. Cue action scene after action scene, and a film that just plods along without offering any tension or emotion at all.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the film, not through the story (the concept and script is well woven by Anderson), but through the acting and direction, oh and the effects. This is a film with more ambition than the budget can allow! It is nice to see that the studio is an equal opportunities employer, but having epileptics manning the camera is a tad too much! The term used by Empire this month is 'F**king the Frame' and is a term that defines it perfectly! The camera shakes so much that keeping up with the action is tricky at the best of times, and tension is destroyed. Within the first few minutes a jerky, blurred shot is used to show lumbering zombies and alarm bells rang in my head! 'Are they just covering up some ropey effects and make-up?' The answer is yes, and the shots of the 'big bad' Nemesis attain! Why could they not get a better make-up and effects team! Surely the people who worked on Buffy and Angel were available¬Öeven their effects were better than this 'rubber mask' effect! The overall effect is similar to that other terrible 'big bad' creation, the Spinosaurus in JP3.<br/><br/>The acting, aside from Jovovich, is terrible! Maybe it was paying homage to the games where the voice acting is diabolical, or maybe the budget just wouldn't allow them to hire anyone with any talent! If it was intended as homage¬Öwell it was a terrible idea as you just can't care for the characters. So, the blame for this very average waste of 1 ¬Ω hours can't be levied at Anderson. He wrote a decent story. The problems here can mainly be put down to the director this time, first timer Christopher Witt, who fails to get any decent results from his cast, and can't really convey a scene well.<br/><br/>Overall a film with far too much ambition! Yes, it would be tricky to convey a city in chaos without having a lot of action, but perhaps a bit of tension wouldn't go amiss! Look at Aliens¬Ölots of beasts attacking, but only a few key action points. Fans will love looking for the links to the games, but that's about it. Go play the games instead!"
"CaptHowdy1540421","10","4","9","28 September 2004"," BEST ZOMBIE MOVIE SINCE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD
","Resident Evil:Apocolypse****[4 Stars]-Seems like sequels are doing very well this year especially with this and ''Excorsist:The Beginning****[4 Stars]''. I remember Bruce Campbell referring to his movie ''Evil Dead 2**[2 Stars'' as the mother of all sequels, well that is defiantly an understatement because this movie has to be the mother of all sequels especially among zombie movies. Its also what I would refer to as the best zombie movie since ''Return Of The Living Dead****[4 Stars]''. Compared to its predecessor ''Resident Evil***¬Ω[3 ¬Ω Stars]'' this one moves at an even faster pace, adds another kickass female heroine, and has an even better ending with more twist and turns. If you thought the first one was fast paced action, think again, this starts right from the Beginning with action every minute and never once takes away from the movie's plot and storyline. As far as the female heroine Milla Jochavich brings on another awesome ''Ellen Ripley'' performance plus another bonus one by Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine. If you thought the ending was a big twist from the first one, this one has an ending just as good and makes it even better by packing in even more twist and turns."

","Oh my god... When i think that my $ 9.25 could have bought some starving child a couple of Big Macs and I spent the money on watching this bomb...<br/><br/>My mommy always said to start any comments on two positive notes: here is the first: ""the cast looks well fed"". Now the second... Wait a minute, I cannot find anything positive to say!!! Finally, he is a second positive comment: ""the trucks are clean and the wheels are well balanced"".<br/><br/>This movie is really bad. Really... Milla Jovovich is laughably bad. Her last scenes are absolutely horrible. Sienna Guillory is painful to look at, please someone feed this chick!!<br/><br/>On the other hand, Oded Fehr isn't bad. <br/><br/>Being Canadian myself, I believe I have the right to criticize the typically Canadian-made cheap-*** look of this movie. The rule is simple: you can blow up stuff, you can shoot at stuff but never, never break anything expensive. During the movie, I could hear bean-counters in the background, worrying the movie was gonna break its low budget. The helicopter crash scene is a complete joke - you can hear the producer say ""well, show the chopper in the air, then show it crashed, the audience will... imagine the crash"".<br/><br/>The choice of location is an insult to intelligence for the Canadian audience... we can see about 10 Canadian companies logos in the backgrounds. Please.... ""Raccoon City, Ontario""?? <br/><br/>The plot holes in the story are wide enough to float an aircraft carrier sideways through them. The guy who wrote this movie should go back to writing stories for ""Clifford the big red dog"" or become script editor for the Teletubbies.<br/><br/>One last mean comment: how can a director screw-up the acting of zombies??? The zombies in that movie are the worst i've ever seen. In Raccoon City, ""dead"" equals ""moronic looking"". The extras on this movie should look for other jobs, like... playing heads of lettuce in grocery commercials.<br/><br/>Please, stay home and hit yourself on the head with a telephone book!! You'll save money, you'll have fun and you'll see stars that act way better than any of the cast!!"

","After I rented Extinction and watched it, I realized I had never seen Apocalypse OR Resident Evil. I bought them rather than renting them, and I was very pleased. The actors have truly outdone themselves, and the extras are really good. If you have played the games, this movie can help you to enjoy it more. I was just as equally shocked as my friends when we saw the THREE lickers rather than the one. And that Milla did all of her own stunts.......wow. BUT I thought Nemesis, and I thought it was a little cheesy, a little over done. His make up was very fake, and the lighting on him just wasn't sinister enough. other than that, he was fine. When the zombie guys came out from the ground, I was shocked. Yet again that is how the virus works. But still, imagine being in the only ""safe"" place, and having (classic) zombies coming up from the ground. Amazing<br/><br/>9/10"
"Mat_Zombie","1","3","6","26 April 2006"," Cos its a thriller!
","When I say thriller, i mean its like Jacko's 80's video, not any kind of enjoyable film. Let me start by saying I thought the first movie was acceptable. It wasn't brilliant, and it wasn't what most of the fans wanted, but I thought it did a good job of painting a picture of the umbrella corporation and the way it works. (Why the computer couldn't just inform them of the virus outbreak remotely though i wonder, but thats another film) Anyway, getting back to RE:A, what exactly was the point of this film? I'm writing this in utter disbelief after reading some of the other reviews. Terms such as ""excellent action sequences"" and ""non stop adrenaline"" are used frequently, but i wonder what film they refer to. Certainly not apocalypse.<br/><br/>The action is jumpy and blurred, much like the car chase from the Bourne supremacy which spoilt the whole film. The camera so rapidly its impossible to tell what is going on. I wanted to see shotguns blowing heads off, zombies getting decapitated etc. Sure its gory, but hello Anderson; its a f***kcing zombie film, thats what we want.<br/><br/>Resident Evil has got a better storyline that most zombie films with the first film spending a lot of time explaining to us the whole Umbrella Company, and this is fine. The start of the film even showed promise, until they went into the Hive. (Why would you? why why why without at least 50 armed soldiers) But we already know about that, there's no need to cram so much weak plot that there is no room for any action. We don't want to see the Umbrella bosses, its a faceless company and thats how it should stay. I'm not going to point out the plot holes as I've only got 1000 words in which to do it.<br/><br/>Get James Cameron for RE3 or don't bother.<br/><br/>A poor film."

","I loved this movie for reasons that you will never understand. I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game franchise. Before RE 4 came out RE 3: Nemesis was my favorite. The movie is so true to the game as far as atmosphere goes, as well as the characters from the game. The main storyline is about 50/50 on trueness to the game. It meshes the original movie alternate universe story to the game's storyline. The acting is the best I have ever seen. The story is unbelievable (it doesn't need to be realistic folks). The movie even has the best video game character ever: Nemesis. This is going to be the most underrated movie ever, also the most misunderstood."

","This movie made me want to go out and get the next resident evil, anyone who played the games will love this movie, if you haven't played the games and are bent on seeing this movie, play the games first then watch it, I love this movie because they do nemesis justice and so many scenes relate to the games i love it. The camera angles, the small details, all straight from the games, a very nice blend between RE2 and RE3, of course there are a couple scenes that are corny, and a few confusing plot parts, of the few.

A true new modern classic and dare I say it, One of the best films of 2004. Milla Jovovich running lost in a deserted city as every pay telephone on the street starts to ring is a new classic moment in modern cinema.

","A Movie that entertains . . .? Isn't that what a movie is suppose to do? Well that's exactly what this movie does. Others may complain about the lack of award winning movie elements, but I feel this movie was not designed to win awards. Honestly there are not too many elements in this movie to comment on, though it does not fail to entertain an audience. For people who have already turned their back on this movie from the critical over analyses by the other viewers, keep this in mind. The movie comes from the world of gaming. In games impossible chain of events tend to happen out of the blue. This movie is not limited to ""real world"" applications, so crazy things will and can happen. Just sit back and enjoy this movie. It's not based on real events, at least not from the ""real world"", it's based on the ""gaming world"". If you're up for some spooky/action/adventure, go ahead and hit it up at the theaters."
"Aaron1375","9","3","6","15 September 2004"," Has more of the spirit of the video game than did the first movie.
","This movie was a bit of a surprise to me. I thought it would be a pretty decent flick worthy of passing some time, instead I find one of the better action movies I have seen all year. I am one of the few who liked the first one, but this one is much better. I just thought it was more like the game itself without taking itself to seriously or getting to campy. You are thrust into the action right away as people fight for survival against the undead in Racoon City and it all looks really good. Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi monsters. I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally cgi monsters in the movie. The nemesis monster is done completely with makeup it seems and makes me think maybe they could have made a Hulk using the same technique. This one picks up where the last one left off as Alice finds herself in the middle of a virtual war. The additions to the cast are all welcome changes from the last movie as the person who plays Jill Valentine both looks and acts like the character from the game. Scores of undead are killed and various other monsters and enemies line the path as we follow a group of survivors desperate to get out of the sealed city. Kind of sad that this one is so good and it is based on a video game and a movie based on a comic ""Alien Vs Predator"" was not nearly as good."

I think they spent more time making the 2nd movie for the resident evil game fans, but even if you don't play the games I think you will enjoy the movie and understand what is happening more then the 1st movie.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","7","4 November 2007"," Jovovich in Tomb Raider mode against Zombies...again
","Okay, one might wonder why I am watching the second part after my negative comment on the first part. The only explanation I can give is quality time with my family and to watch two hot chicks (Guilory and Jovovich) fight zombies. Perhaps I may be somewhat curious to how the story continues.<br/><br/>'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is worse than its prequel. There is hardly anything that makes this one different from other viral films. It's filled with clich√®s and obvious jumps (again most of it is unintentionally funny, or maybe it's not so unintentional). Here the story revolves around two pretty (and smart) women and a couple of idiots against zombies. Of course the ending is also such that another sequel is expected (and it's been released already).<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Jovovich performed better in the previous one. Here she's more in Tomb Raider mode (but she does act better than Angelina Jolie did in Tomb Raider). The special effects aren't so bad either. Other than that I find 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' funny too. Now I am curious about the 3rd part and to see how Jovovich continues her Tomb Raider-like war against the zombies...and of course to have a nice time with my family (who seem to enjoy it a lot)."
"Home-Brewed","1","3","7","10 May 2006"," It hurts, and always will...
","I've always loved the Resident Evil games, and consider myself a true RE-fan. After watching the first one, which became a complete disaster, I didn't know what to expect of this next installment, so I kept my expectations low - and yet, I was utterly disappointed. This film was laughable, dumb, badly written, horribly acted, and the effects were lame. The whole film reminded me of an unpleasant visit at my dentist, after him having a few drinks; I suppose you get the picture. But all in all - just to keep myself short - this film traumatized me, and almost ruined my view upon Resident Evil; luckily, with the games at hand, I found salvation. Well, to say it as it is - this film (and the first one as well), made me hurt, mentally and physically, so I'd recommend people with brains to stay away from it. I learned my lesson; if you play with fire, you get burned.<br/><br/>So, the next time I'll expose myself to true torment, I think I'll just stab myself in the eyeball - It will be less painful than ever watching this complete piece of trash, which name is - dare I say it - Resident Evil Apocalypse."
"john71180","1","3","7","15 September 2005"," Hollywood never learns...
","Forgive the crude review and its grammar and stuff as I'm dyslexic.<br/><br/>The biggest problem in Hollywood now is giving work to people like Anderson and Boll, who are pretty much dead weight. none of their films are all that great(bolls are pure crap) and neither of the films have any real originality.<br/><br/>Resident Evil was basically a combination of James Camerons 'Aliens', Renny Harlins 'the long kiss goodnight', a little bit of 'space odyssey 2001', and misc bits from other films like 'Alice and wonderland', 'dawn of the dead', and 'the matrix'.<br/><br/>Re2 seemed to attempt to take more elements from the game which was a good idea, but the nemesis was made a terribly generic monster that could have had its ass handed to it by Jason Voorhees on a good or bad day. The direction of Alexander Witt was on par with Andersons script. Not a very good combination for movie goers as it was another PG-13 zombie film that only got an 'R' for lame nudity and cursing.<br/><br/>I found it very hard to watch as I was quite familiar with Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivera, Nicholai SOlokov and the Nemesis itself. And ALL were done terribly, or made from bad guys to good guys(Nicholai, Nemesis). Jill was thoroughly unlikable and Sienna Guillroy's performance matched it very well, Oded Fehr as Carlos..well, he's too old, looks nothing like the character but god almighty the man was the only charming part of the film...Well, he and Mike Epps. I would have rather seen these two guys put together in a zombie film as a swat cop and a smart ass for about 90 minutes than watch RE2 again.<br/><br/>And finally the nemesis itself...well the body proportions did NOT match at all(Giant head, giant feet, long legs, stubby arms, stubby torso and small hands)mix in the fact it was made into a complete pussy of a creature well..thats pretty much all I can say. It was a stupid silly monster that wasn't fun to watch and blended in the background much like a lot of the performances.<br/><br/>It's a stupid film with unconvincing special effects, terrible editing, followed by terrible direction and writing.<br/><br/>I give the film a 3/10. Go watch dawn of the dead or play the video games instead."

"rbverhoef","4","3","7","28 April 2005"," Terrible sequel
","I can be pretty short about this sequel to 'Resident Evil': it's terrible. I mean, I was able to find some joy in the first film even though it made no sense at all. This one makes no sense at all and misses the ingredients that made the first film watchable. It does contain a fine looking Milla Jovovich and another actress (Sienna Guillory) that makes it easier to watch, sort of telling us this film really is for teenage boys only. Well, the ones older than sixteen since this is an R-rated film. And it's about zombies, by the way.<br/><br/>There are good films about zombies, the undead, the living dead. George Romero made them, '28 Days Later' or 'Shaun of the Dead' are recent examples. The original 'Resident Evil' belongs not to this category but at least it had some moments of suspense and tried to give us a story, whether you found it stupid or not. Here there is no suspense, just a little gore, and the story is not really there. The events from 'Resident Evil' were underground in a place called The Hive. After Jovovich survived it was locked forever to keep the virus that turned people into zombies. Why they want to keep it I do not know, but let's not ask questions here. Now they want to reopen The Hive. The Hive by the way, is located in Raccoon City, a city that can only be accessed by one bridge.<br/><br/>The Hive opens, the virus is still there, including the zombies, and the virus spreads through the city. Now they quarantine the city and people who are still in it have to save themselves. The Umbrella Corporation, the most powerful corporation in the world, is responsible but will do anything to keep their virus. They have created a secret weapon, codename Nemesis, a creature that seems to be invincible. Now the group that includes Jovovich and Guillory have to survive not only the zombies, but the creature as well. A man can help the group, navigating them with the help of his computer, but they have to save his daughter first. Jovovich has a little secret of her own.<br/><br/>I realize I have spend too much on the story since it basically is a group of people walking through a city with zombies popping up from time to time. They are shot in a stylized action sequence and the group continues. No fun here I would say. If you liked the first film or the computer game the film is based on you might find some joy, but you can do so much better. This film offers nothing we have not seen before. Here it is always night therefore the action is hard to follow, making it even less interesting. Don't waste your time on this one is basically all I want to say."

"ivo-cobra8","10","2","4","9 October 2016"," Excellent action - horror sequel in the Resident Evil franchise almost good as the original Apocalypse kicks ass
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) is an excellent sequel that follows the roots to the first film. This one and the first one are the best films in the franchise, it is not so good as the first one but it is close. I love this film to death and it is the last good film that I love. This time Resident Evil is directed by Alexander Witt and this was his first film he directed and his only film he ever directed. He works more on Camera and Electrical Department before he went and directed this movie. I can say Alexander Witt was awesome, he knew what was he doing and he did a really excellent job directing this movie and he directed perfectly. Milla Jovovich did return as fierce Alice and she is fabulous as always and Paul W.S. Anderson also returned as writer and producer. We have now a new cast Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr and no one returns from the first movie. Apocalypse I love as a guilty pleasure because there were some things I did like about it: The girl who played Jill (Sienna Guillory) was pretty good with what she had to do. Oded Fehr as Carlos was awesome probably the biggest bad ass in the film series. Also the zombies in the city were cool because it reminded me of Resident evil 2.<br/><br/>Plot: Alice (Milla Jovovich), who struggles to find out what the Umbrella corporation has done to her as she leads survivors in an escape from a Raccoon City infested with the dead. Directed by Alexander Witt, the film features several characters from the video game series including Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), Nicholai Ginovaeff (Zack Ward), and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr).<br/><br/>After narrowly escaping the horrors of the underground Hive facility, Alice (Milla Jovovich) is quickly thrust back into a war raging above ground between the living and the Undead. As the city is locked down under quarantine, Alice joins a small band of elite soldiers, led by Valentine (Sienna Guillory, Love, Actually) and Carlos (Oded Fehr, The Mummy Returns), enlisted to rescue the missing daughter of Dr. Ashford, the creator of the mutating T-virus. Its a heart-pounding race against time as the group faces off against hordes of blood- thirsty zombies, stealthy Lickers, mutant canines and the most sinister foe yet. Written and produced by the visionary director of Resident Evil, Paul W. S. Anderson (Alien Vs. Predator) and directed by Alexander Witt, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a superior sci-fi suspense sequel.<br/><br/>All three Resident Evils are wonderful pieces of work. They aren't just like every other zombie movie, they really have plots. And they are really suspenseful and just plain awesome. Rocket launchers, guns, zombies, villains trying to destroy the world. This movie rocks so much its not funny the action is just perfect not to gory not to weak its a perfect movie, this film is a great zombie film with exceptional graphics and fight scenes. There isn't many trilogy's that can say they didn't become over rated and less entertaining as time went on, this trilogy and film is amazing.<br/><br/>Resident Evil is a thrill ride with some really intense action. Fans of the game should like the costuming work done with Jill and how the monster makeup made the Nemesis look just like he does in the game. It had some of the best action I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The most in this film that I love is the dark scenes, the film is filmed at night, which I love that. I love the action in the church when Jill Valentine and a group of survivors are fighting those giant zombie monsters and Alice jumps with a motorcycle trough the window and she drove's right in front of zombie monster, jumps off the motorcycle makes a back flip from off of the motorcycle and landed, posted up and pulled out her guns and blew the zombie and the motorcycle up! If that isn't a bad ass or what. I don't know what to tell you. Alice raises her dual two-tone Heckler & Koch MP5Ks and fires them on a zombie monster.<br/><br/>I love that this film is a rescue mission on a little girl Angie Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur) which Alice with Jill and Carols is coming to school to rescue her and escape from Raccoon City before it is destroyed by a nuclear missile.<br/><br/>Overall: I love this film to death, It is almost as good as the first one, just the original will always be the best one! 10 out of 10 this excellent action horror sequel gets, I had a lot of fun and a blast watching this film. I love the bad ass song The End of Heartache by Killswitch Engage and Vermillion by Slipknot those two movies kicks ass.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a 2004 apocalyptic fiction action horror film directed by Alexander Witt, from a screenplay written by producer Paul W.

"timjohnson-98205","3","2","4","25 November 2015"," RE2 review may cotain spoilers
","As a huge fan of RE -- after watching the first movie -- though not perfect , it is a great movie , i was looking forward to RE2 , in the hopes of seeing all the unique , original ideas , characters and creepy spooky horror elements that made the game scary ( Nemesis in particular ) hoping they would do the game justice , how wrong i was . RE Apocalypse is in my top 10 of worst movies ever made. First; Paul Anderson's screenplay is ridiculous , it is full of stupid , laughable ,embarassing , ilogical and poorly thought out ideas ever conceived to film , with some of the worst continuity errors i have seen in a movie , in both storytelling and logic , that is totally unforgivable , especially a RE fan. This movie is nothing like RE , i don't care that they tuck it in another direction , but you have to stay within the world of the games or the movie will fail as this one did. Another reason it failed was due to Alexander Witt-less' direction. This is the worst directed movie i have ever seen , due to all elements of directing. Alex should stay in second-unit because he doesn't have the skill , talent and vision to helm and sustain an entire movie to him self. Errors in this movie include; Jill Valentine walks into the police station with only one gun and in the next shot another gun pops out of nowhere. Kain is standing next to a man with a bald head and next shot a man with dark hair.( same man ) sniper shoots undead in their heads but when Nemesis shows the sniper doesn't , when in reality there would be no more nemesis. It takes Umbrella 13 hours to build an entire wall around Raccoon city , when in reality it would take months to build and we're supposed to believe it tuck a few hours. How do you write and direct a movie without noticing these things just gos to show why this movie failed. Alex directs this movie with fast cutting and a 100 shots of one punch thrown an inch forward then another 100 of another inch , and when your about to see the impact he cuts out the shot and 2 minutes of the fight is missing , and also he has the camera rammed right infront of what he is shooting and thats the way the movie is from start to finish , and when the movie is over the viewer is left thinking to them selves 'Did i just not see that?' and that is not how to direct a movie because people go to movies to experience them. But the thing that was most damaging to the movie was the constant ripping off ideas of other superior movie ;Escape from new york , Aliens , John Carpenter movies,The Terminator , so blaintly ,that the essence of RE is totally destroyed.The Nemesis in the game is a terrifying fracked-up Jason Vorheeves type character ,in the movie he was the Terminator , and any true fan of RE would never disrespect the franchise in anyway , so i can understand why people think Paul WS is not a true fan of RE but for me its a case of showing how bad a writer Paul is.This movie is not RE , it doesn't deserve its title.Arter so much thought and effort was put into this movie just for it to bomb , critically ,popularity , financially and for the fans make RE2 an embarrassment in the history of film. I give it 3/10 , 1 star for the audio commentary of Mila vovovich(forgive my spelling) and oded Fehr , 2'nd for the actress of Jill Valentine."

","This is the worst Resident Evil movie I have ever seen. The music was the worst part. The way this movie was directed was weird and cheesy. The music did not fit the situations and topics, all the other soundtracks for the other RE movies were pretty good, but this was such a weird concept of music, that it just became stupid. The special effects were unusual also, I mean... i know it is an old movie but c'mon! At least make the nemesis in this movie not look like just a pile hard caramel! So that is my UNPROFESSIONAL REVIEW. And this is how I feel about the movie.<br/><br/>4/10"
"KineticSeoul","5","2","4","11 September 2010"," Ridiculous and stupid, while trying to be serious
","This is a really silly zombie flick that tries to be serious for the most part. Much more silly than the first movie in this series and there is way more plot holes, with more corny kung fu fighting. Yeah there is more action in this one compared to the previous one, but doesn't have hardly any of the survival horror elements like the first one and the plot is just stupid. Yeah it has Jill Valentine walking through dark corridors and checking rooms, but that is about it. The only positive thing I can say about this sequel is how it's dumb to the point it is sometimes more entertaining for few parts compared to the first one. And showing two girls with guns in the first one was hot, but it's a bit more hot in this one because of Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine who is one of the characters from the actual video games. And how it has a little bit of the similar aspects to Resident Evil 3 Nemesis. The plot is very simple, a group of people are trying to escape Raccoon City after a infection spread that turn the civilians into zombies, and zombies aren't the only thing they have to watch out for a giant monster nemesis and a nuke that is planned to blow up the whole city is on there way. As silly as it is, Alice this time around has special abilities from getting injected by the T-Virus instead of turning into a zombie herself. The side characters are way much more annoying this time around, you know those morons that doesn't stick with the group and goes ""I can't take it anymore"" and tries to leave where it's safe and gets the whole group into trouble. The plot this time around also almost has nothing to do with the game, same can be said about the future installments of this movie series. The first movie also had a lot of silly techno and rock action, but this one overdose that as well. Sure the creators try to add a lot of cool action sequences into this, but almost nothing about it makes sense at all.<br/><br/>5.2/10"
"quinnox-1","7","2","4","19 November 2009"," Splendid action scenes and Milla, you can't go wrong
","Another Resident Evil movie that I feel is under rated. Not as good as the third movie - Extinction, but worth watching for some crack action sequences as well as good creature and special effects. Milla Jovovich again is great in her role, and as usual a very pretty presence on the screen in her cute outfits. This movie has a lot of eye candy and is plain fun to watch. People who like science fiction, action, or horror movies would all find something to like here. I especially liked the Nemesis creature, and all the tricks it had. It was like a super ""boss"" from a video game. This had some nice production values in the various sets, and it was convincing in making a futuristic setting appear plausible."

The first RE movie was a good film, but as die-hard RE fan, it's just disappointing to see they dropped the feeling from the game series and made it to an average zombie film.<br/><br/>They definitely changed the attitude after hearing feedback from the first one and made a great integration of innovation and ideas from the game into RE:A.<br/><br/>And not only that, they've also found the trend of how RE story goes in the games (like the super-human power Wesker got in RE:codeX game) and made it part of the main storyline of the movie."

"tayz9230","7","2","4","12 March 2008"," One of the Most Worthy Video Game to Movie Adaptations
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an all around terrific film. It's a much better film then the first RE movie because it actually follows a game's plot line. In case your new, this movie is based on Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape- as it's known in Japan)and it makes a very good effort at bringing this game to the silver screen. The story is as follows, the citizens of Racoon City are in a panic when the zombies from The Hive (from the first move) are released into the city. They try to escape but most of them are locked in the city by the Umbrella Corporation, the people who created the virus that turned the humans into zombies. The film brings all the characters from RE 3: Nemesis into it such as Jill Valentine (Sienna Gullory does an absolute amazing job playing her, Carlos Olivera (not a very good job at bringing him to the screen considering the actor is the wrong nationality and has the wrong accent, but other then that he does OK), Nicholai Ginovaeff (this is my biggest complaint because the actor who plays him doesn't look right and Nicholai is evil in the games not good) and of course Nemesis who is commanded to kill all S.T.A.R.S. members. This movie, although was panned by critics, is the BEST Video game adaptation EVER because it sticks the RE 3 story really well. Some people complain that his movie is more action then horror, but even according to the Resident Evil Video Game Creator, RE 3 the game was more action then horror, so the film makers did an amazing job. 2 thumbs up and 10/10!"

","Great sequel, though i did only watch the German extended edition i got over ebay. Extended by over 5 min's, what a difference, more gore, more consistent editing, better story flow. It continues the story from the first film and sets up brilliantly for Resident Evil: Extinction. The atmosphere is spot on, its moody, there is so much action it is almost exhausting. In either case i enjoyed the German version much better than the western cut. There is not much really left to say, only that this trilogy is going strait onto the cult shelf, its all about chicks, guns and monsters. It doesn't waste its time trying to patronize us, just simple fun with likable characters, and great lines. Pure trash fun.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Get the German cut!!!!!"

But Jill definitely made this movie better. First of all she's really HOT and she carries a gun, there is nothing better than that. Finally, a GOOD character comes into the story. Milla Jovovich definitely plays her part, but if it was just her, it wouldn't be the same. Although the camera work was awful and there was barely any plot, the movie sells in its 90 minutes of packed action. A 7 out of 10 is good enough for this movie, but I wish it could have been more gory, but oh well......once again 7/10"

"DevilPaul","3","2","4","11 October 2006"," Resident Evil: Suckolaypse
","I had the displeasure of picking this DVD up on sale and watching it a few days later. I loved the first Resident Evil and thought it did well for a video game to big screen adaption. (A genre not known for producing block busters by any means!) In a nutshell, this movie sucked donkey balls. Apparently they decided to have this guy named Alexander Witt direct the movie. His name should actually be changed to Alexander Wittless or at least they could have attributed the credit to Alan Smithee. The direction was terrible at best and the first half of the movie was extremely choppy, with little regard to defining any characters, and featured some of the lamest action scenes that I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the town of Raccoon City being quarantined due to all of the zombies escaping from the Hive facility. (Where the zombies came from was shown in the original.) Milla Jovovich is back as Alice and we find that the T-Virus has managed to merge with her body making her extremely powerful. (Does this sound like Alien: Resurrection by any chance?) Her mission? Survive in the ruins of Raccoon City and try to find a way to contain the virus all while avoiding a beast named Nemesis who is hunting her. Alice doesn't do it alone in this one as she soons recruits a small gang of moronic characters to help in her quest. (One of the dumbest scenes where she crashes through a church window on a motorcycle for no apparent reason.) After a flashy opening we are left with a weak story, laughable dialogue, acting only William Shatner could be proud of, dumb music video like action sequences, and a climactic confrontation with a creature that looks like a mix between the Toxic Avenger and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. Actually, that last comment isn't being fair to the Toxic Avenger as most Troma movies are more entertaining than this bloated piece of *****. I kept asking myself: Come on, this movie isn't really taking itself seriously is it? Is this supposed to be a spoof? Is this some ""fan cut"" of the movie or something? Fans of the original: Stay away from this one!"
"boy_in_red","2","2","4","23 August 2006"," Stop assuming your audience has ADHD
","I need to learn to stop judging a movie by it's cover. Or poster in this case.<br/><br/>The first Resident Evil left me with that trademark Paul W Anderson sense of ""that was okay... I guess.""It had a couple of nice twists, some interesting visuals, but all in all it was pretty underwhelming, especially in contrast to the atmosphere of the games it was based on.<br/><br/>Resident Evil Apocalypse does something amazing- it makes the first film seem better. It's a mess- visually, plot wise- it's not even glorious adrenalin-fuelled chaos, it's just a bunch of scenes that feel loosely thrown together and don't feel like they form a coherent whole. It's a disturbing trend, I've seen in other recent action/ horrors such as Doom, whereby a few ""interesting"" visuals and flash cuts, perhaps even some loud rock track while the action steps up a gear, are believed, wrongly, to automatically generate excitement. Where's the soul? What's the point? Give me character development, not a bunch of cardboard cut outs. Give me a real plot or purpose to the story, not the sense that the characters are just wandering around aimlessly, and some uninspired Ripley from Alien Resurrection-esquire hybrid superpowers. Give me a reason to care. Even if the target audience is a teenage market (odd considering the games really captured the interest of many adults) don't assume a good story isn't necessary, and that all viewers have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.<br/><br/>I know I'm probably going to watch the sequels. I'm an idiot like that- I never learn. I just hope for future chapters, the creators focus on making the audience feel something, rather than bombard them with flash cuts and strobing images that actually leave them yawning."
"dogsoldier_spoon-1","1","2","4","8 July 2006"," entertaining yet horrible
","hello my dears, (spoilers a head and sorry for the language)<br/><br/>to be fair, I really thought this movie would be a great one. I wanted to see it in theaters, but unfortunately I didn't have the time. When I first saw this movie I was glad I didn't paid a ticket for this. Here are the reasons why:<br/><br/>there are few good points about this movie. The acting wasn't all that bad and at least they tried to make it good but they failed. The script was totally horrible! Many dumb and ridiculous things were in it and let us not forget those horrible - yet typical for American movies - lines like: ""stay!"". Honestly, who says that against a zombie dog?<br/><br/>For those who enjoyed resident evil: nemesis (the game) you will be shocked and p!ssed off. The great characters featuring in that game have been translated to the big screen in a horrible way. you won't even see your favorite characters like Carlos, Nicholai or Mikha√Øl. There is a Carlos and a Nicholai in the movie, but the only thing they have in common with their superior game characters is a name.<br/><br/>and let's not forget how they Sc¬Äwed up one of the fan's favorite enemies. Yes indeed, Nemesis. In stead of the big, great monster we here have a big zombie that gets defeated by a thin, small girl... in hand combat! Other then that he even has feelings, no tentacles but a machine gun and he can actually scan people. Other then this he actually looked like Nemesis but that's about it.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't that bad but it wasn't good either. I won't say it's the fault of the actors but the script really made them look bad. The most horrible character of this movie must be Jill Valentine. What was once a great, sweet but still kick-as heroine now turned into some boring, ridiculous, dumb *****.<br/><br/>Many people say it's so much better then the first but I do not agree. The first one had nothing to do with the game, in the second one they destroyed the game completely. The first one had better action, better characters, actually everything was better.<br/><br/>my conclusion is this one: other then the good make-up and special effects, this movie isn't really a recommended one. If you have ever played resident evil or if you aren't a fan of zombie movies, then don't see it. You only will be disappointed, if you want to see a good zombie movie go and rend ""Shaun of the dead"", ""Dawn of the dead"" or the Romero classics or buy the games. They are much more entertaining, have a much better script and much better acting and also much better zombies. <br/><br/>I gave it 2 for destroying everything they could have done and Sc¬Äwing up really good things in the resident evil universe. They should have chosen Romero's script for resident evil in the first place. Since the first one was good, I'm going to give the third one a chance, although I'm already fearing (and also wondering how) that they are going to Sc¬Äw up another great character in the resident evil games: Claire Redfield.<br/><br/>greetings from Hell"

P.S start the film all over again in make it just like the game."
"Wogle","4","2","4","4 December 2005"," A poor sequel, both as a movie and as a video game movie
","As an action movie, Resident Evil: Apocalypse serves quite well. There's plenty of it throughout. However, Resident Evil is NOT an action game - it's a survival horror. In this respect, the film has already started to dig its grave. The question is, will it lie in it? The many references that there are in the film, will make fans both smile and scream out in anger and disgust at how the film was written and filmed.<br/><br/>The inclusion of the popular heroine from the series, Jill Valentine, and her co-star in Resident Evil 3, Carlos (and his band of minion soldiers), and the fan-favourite (or feared) monster Nemesis, was a nice touch. It let people who had played the game see the movie, as if it was an alternate time-line. Of course, this is a double-edged sword.<br/><br/>The inclusion of various characters doesn't add to the story what-so-ever. They may as well have just been ordinary citizens of Raccoon City. The only reason they appear to have been put in the film, is to please fans as eye-candy... Nothing else. Jill was part of a group of S.T.A.R.S. members who actually found out about the incident in the first Resident Evil game. Nemesis was brought in to eliminate those specific S.T.A.R.S. members. This is all very well and good, but Nemesis' reason for eliminating S.T.A.R.S. members, other than that he's being controlled to do so, doesn't make sense. They're the elite of the Raccoon Police Department... So what? Who gives a flying monkeys! Tell me WHY they're being killed, not what they are! Don't imply it, TELL the audience.<br/><br/>This brings me to the fact that references to the games seem out of place, or wrong. Many fans will be annoyed that Dr. Ashford was used as one of the creators of the T-virus, when he clearly wasn't in the games. As I said above, the reason for Nemsis' killings and his inclusion of the game, is minimal, and convoluted at that. Fans who know even the most minimal details of the Resident Evil/Biohazard series will be twitching with these ""incorrect"" details. Especially S.T.A.R.S. been quoted as ""Special Tactics and Rescue Squad"" (Where it should be service).<br/><br/>Finally, the camera. It moves too much. Sometimes in the action sequences, you don't know if you're watching a horror movie, or ""The Matrix"". It fails to deliver suspense, because of this continuous switching between the angles.<br/><br/>Overall, the films is below average for me. It has too many unanswered questions, and many tings in the movie seem to assume that you know everything. Fans of the game - unless you are willing to throw all that you know out of the window and bite your tongue, avoid watching the movie."
"modelnine","5","2","4","27 September 2005"," Bad ripoff of the Alien series
","When seeing Resident Evil (the first part), I was surprised how Milla Jovovich could actually fit a role different from her ""Leeloo"" role in ""The Fifth Element"", fit a role that wasn't made to be ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now, she was nowhere near the proficiency of Sigourney Weaver in her first appearance in Alien (to which I seem compelled to compare Resident Evil to), but still, when in doubt, I give credit to the actors for a film that entertained me.<br/><br/>But: I believe I was wrong. The first part wasn't entertaining because Milla Jovovich played a leading part, but rather, because someone out there thought of a story which was fascinating enough in itself to entertain a science nerd.<br/><br/>Now, because people thought they could make money out of the franchise again, they created a second script, which basically is a bad ripoff of Alien IV in a sense. I'm not going to go into the storyline any deeper, but if you look at the premises made at the beginning of Resident Evil II, you'll see how remarkably similar they are to the transformation Ripley has made at the beginning of Alien IV.<br/><br/>Now, for Alien IV we have a certain explanation why this transformation has taken place, at least if you know the last three parts of the saga, whereas Resident Evil II leaves you hanging in thin air.<br/><br/>This isn't the only part where Resident Evil II lacks any explanation of why things happen as they do, but I'm not going to spoil the first hand experience, as the zombie-horror part of the film isn't as bad as it might seem at first.<br/><br/>Although the director experimented much too much with post-processing effects such as blurring the movements of the zombies and several other such gimmicks, the overall experience is quite OK if you just look at the zombie-splatter-horror-carnage part of the movie.<br/><br/>And, actually, that's why, lacking any explainable and original story whatsoever, this movie gets 5 out of 10 from me."

","When I finished this movie I thought to myself, who made this movie? They totally made Resident Evil into Fat Albert. It seriously had no feeling of the game. I am a HUGE fan of the games. I thought it was cool to have Nemesis in the movie, but they took advantage of it.They forgot about the zombies when they introduced Nemesis. They should really make a movie actually based on one of the games. To me, the first movie was way better. They made Jill Valentine into a bad ass but in the game she is not even like that. I am just glad Uwe Boll didn't do it. Then the movie would have received a 1. I think they should still make movies based on games but they should make them better. Like Mortal Kombat. I liked that movie it actually felt like the game. Thanx for reading this and listening to my opinions."

","Like Alien and Aliens, if the first Resident Evil was all about atmosphere, the second is all about action. The film takes off from exactly where the first film ended, with Alice waking in a hospital of some sort, alone, walking out into the city street with a shotgun to find that Raccoon has been decimated. Cars are overturned, on fire, bodies are strewn, and there are no signs of life. This, like the first had potential. Unfortunately it does not live up to expectations, but still manages to be decent.<br/><br/>Residents of Raccoon are trying to flee the city, but are being stopped by soldiers who will shoot anyone who approaches. They are trapped, and the zombie infection is spreading quickly. As night approaches, the survivors try to find refuge, led by Jill Valentine! STARS member and character from the game she takes a reporter, a taxi driver and others into her protection. Also sent in are an elite group of ex-criminal marines who are mostly wiped out. The survivors Nicholi and Carlos join the group, and they also meet Alice, who seems to be slightly different. Dr. Ashford (?) is outside the city, and via cameras watches the survivors. His young daughter is still alive somewhere in the city and he phones them with an offer- if they can rescue her, he will airlift all of them to safety. However, an evil army dude has other ideas, and the powerful NEMESIS has been sent in to kill all remaining STARS members.<br/><br/>The film has a good amount of action, but unfortunately the director decides to use that useless fast cut style which is one of the most awful inventions in cinema meaning we rarely see what is going on. The introduction of a few game characters is good, but they do not get the emotion from us that they do in the games, and in truth the script does not give them the chance. The black character is completely pointless and from the start we want him to die, though his energy is good and he does get a few laughs. Alice has become super-human and her relationship with the Nemesis is the main reason for watching. It does get better towards the end, and a few twists at the end add some quality. I was almost misled towards the end, when the copter crashes in Arklay, that perhaps now the characters would find a mansion and the real Resident Evil would begin. Something else happened though, setting up another sequel which again looks to have potential. Johovich is good again, but because of her new found power we feel less for her. The renegade survivors could be better in any following film, and Fehr and Guillory are both OK. With some better editing and direction, and more blood this could have been better. Still, it's worth seeing.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a Racoon city hospital to discover the deadly T-virus has swept threw the city, turning everything it comes in contact with into ravenous flesh-eating Zombies and genetic mutants. In the right hands, this film really could have been...something, but it was more or less botched by Paul Anderson. I don't hate Anderson, He has lots of potential to make good movies (He proved that with the atmospheric ""Event Horizon"", which is no doubt his best film to date)but his love of unrealistic action often destroy his films. First-time director Alexander Witt's directional debut is similar to Anderson's writing--all style, no substance. There's no suspense, no tension, nothing. Just lots of mindless stunts. That brings me to the most annoying fault here. The action! it's non-stop, which is NOT a good thing. There are so many scenes here that were thrown in because the makers knew video-game-obsessed and intellectually-deprived (Sorry, but it's true!) kids would make up the majority of the films audience. Because of this, the rules of the T-virus that were established in the first Resident Evil have been thrown away in favor of more action. The most laughable example is when an entire legion of zombies pop from a graveyard--even when they aren't effected by the T-virus! Good to see the people making films today care so much about not insulting the audience's intelligence, isn't it?<br/><br/>Anyways, the acting is wooden by most of the principle cast, the characters are clich√©'d typecasts (The tough female lead, the jive-talking' black dude, the deranged scientist, I'm sure there were more but it's already slipping from my mind as I write...) and the ""science""...what little science there WAS behind the T-virus, anyways...was laughable. <br/><br/>The special effects range from very good to down-right awful. The Nemesis make-up looked great, the gore effects were well-done and the zombies were alright, but the CGI here...wow, they say that CG effects are getting 'better' these days, what they *really* mean is ""CGI is getting cheaper, so now we can create it faster and not have to put any effort or work or creativity into it"". <br/><br/>The ending was just stupid. So, Alice is a god now, huh? Wow, like running down buildings and being able to jump twenty feet in the air and not getting even singed by flames during an explosion (Aided only by a fire blanket) isn't enough, now she can kill people by just looking at them! <br/><br/>This was a dumb, mindless movie with no brains, no atmosphere, nothing but action scene after action scene. It's part of the of the further degradation of Hollywood today.<br/><br/>3/10, though that's a little bit TOO generous..."

","I didn't think it was possible but this film falls even shorter than the first Resisdent Evil film. I bought the DVD only on back of the brilliance of the game it is based on - what a mistake (anyone want to buy it off me?) It bears no resemblance to the game other than two of the characters and they are hardly 'characters'. Who was that English (Austrian?) wheel-chair guy and who did he get acting lesson off - Vin Diesel? Instead of spending money on bad effects they could have got some decent actors.

","I liked more the original 'Resident Evil'. It was not a masterpiece or a very original film either, but at least the idea was rather new, and seeing Milla Jovovich as the principal action hero fighting armies of zombies created by a scientific experiment gone wrong was refreshing. The problem with 'RE2 - Apocalypse' is that the film turns again around seeing Milla Jovovich as the principal action hero fighting armies of zombies created by a scientific experiment gone wrong, and what was new a couple of years ago looks like a repetition here. Paul Anderson who directed the first film only wrote the script here, leaving the task of directing to somebody else, who could not bring too much life in this second film in what looks will become a long lived series. A sequel must have new elements, keep some surprises to attract the viewers - this is not the case here. Nothing is very wrong, the new cast around Milla is quite OK, but we have seen too many times the same or similar characters in similar situations, and as in many other movies the outcome is just too physical and too expected. So, zombie films and action films fans will get an average product that most of them will probably enjoy because this is what they expected. Fans of good cinema will come out with empty hands. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale."

There are direct parallels between this and his other most recent action movie, Alien vs. Predator: <br/><br/>the token black guy with an anger problem that gets himself killed<br/><br/>a hot female that isn't wearing enough clothes for the situation (in this case, 2 of them) <br/><br/>a plot loosely pieced together based upon the predecessors (in this case, Res Evil: Nemesis the game, and the prior movie)<br/><br/>extremely clich√© characters<br/><br/>the change of heart by the villain (in this case, Nemesis, who used to be Max in the first movie), who ends up helping out Mila & her crew after he gets beaten down by her. <br/><br/>and last but not least, an inconclusive ending meant to leave the viewer awaiting a sequel.<br/><br/>I guess I really would've liked the movie if it had a solid plot that explained a few things, a little background information that could get me more interested in the characters & character development, a decent fight to the death bout between Mila and the Nemesis (not one that was setup by some Umbrella geek, where the Nemesis ended up seemingly trying to out-jujitsu Mila's character, when he obviously easily could've punched a hole right through her face. but wait, what am I thinking? Mila can run down building walls, I forgot. All satire aside, half the action sequences were truly unbelievable), and a suspenseful escape from the city which gives a fairly conclusive ending...In other words, I would've liked the movie if it was good.

She looks like the epitome of every 14 year-old's deepest fantasy. To top that off, she has no emotion whatsoever. I'm sure Sienna Guillory was committed to making her on-screen persona as true to life as her video-game companion, a woman that dresses incredibly racy and has no facial expressions...champ job! Also, the fight scenes were incredibly lame. I mean what the hell was that duel between Alice and Nemesis all about? It looked like something out of a bad 70's kung-fu movie. To all the people who said this is a good film, you are in the MINORITY. Look up that word when you have a chance.

"kluseba","5","0","0","18 June 2020"," Frantic pace and vivid entertainment
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse was a massive disappointment for me when I first watched it one decade and a half ago. While the first movie had a clever plot, stunning locations and mysterious atmosphere, this sequel walks off the beaten path. The story is extremely thin, the gloomy locations in a destroyed city are everything but spectacular and the atmospheric passages are replaced by countless action scenes. The latter make the movie somewhat entertaining in hindsight as I have recently been rediscovering this live action movie franchise. Ignore the plot and the lack of atmosphere, grab something to drink and to eat, invite a few friends, switch your brain off and enjoy this shallow but entertaining movie for what it is.<br/><br/>The film starts where the previous one had ended two years earlier as lead character Alice makes it out alive of the secret laboratory called the Hive to come back to the surface of Raccoon City. The dangerous T-Virus couldn't be contained in the Hive and has spread across the city as people transform into monsters and attack everyone around them. The leaders of Umbrella Corporation decide to lock the city down which leads to violent riots. They soon realize that the virus cannot be contained and plan on using a nuclear bomb to destroy the city at dusk. Alice must find a way out of the city and save as many lives as possible during one fateful night. She cooperates with a doctor who has worked for Umbrella Corporation but is willing to turn against them to save his daughter who is caught at school.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the film has a perfect length of ninety-four minutes. Its pace is frantic which makes the movie entertaining from start to finish. Lead character Alice develops from an amnesiac survivor into a skilled fighter who definitely turns against the corporation she had once worked for. The numerous action scenes are intense and spectacular. The threat of a nuclear bomb adds some tension and thrill to the film.<br/><br/>However, there are also numerous negative things to mention. The story is simplistic, shallow and predictable. The new characters aren't as attaching, memorable and unique as those from the first movie. The locations are rather repetitive as the destroyed city is much less intriguing than the complex laboratory from the first film. The idea to transform the only other survivor beside the lead character from the first film into a brainless monster is lacking depth.<br/><br/>Still, the movie transforms a franchise that started as a mysterious science-fiction thriller into an overwhelming action spectacle that walks off the beaten path. The connection and transition between the two movies is nevertheless done rather smoothly. While the movie is lacking creativity and depth, it convinces with entertainment and pace. The film has aged rather well and is actually better than I had remembered it. Still, this movie is nowhere near being a great movie and can only be recommended to fans of fast-paced science-fiction action-thrillers who are familiar with the first film."

","I have to admit it: I enjoyed this movie. Being a huge fan of the original video game saga (and a major horror fan) I was pretty disappointed by the previous first chapter: Anderson's approach was too much aseptic, more of a sci-fi thriller than a Gothic horror (with splatter, of course) as it should be. Besides, the fact that no-one of the original characters was in didn't help. Instead with the sequel everything was clear even before it reached the theaters: they don't want to do - with this particular franchise- horror movies with action twists, but action flick with a little (but very little indeed) horror taste. It makes me angry, but what I can do? This is what we get. Dreaming about what George A. Romero could have done is futile. Luckily, this second installment is really like a video game: you just have to sit down, turn your brain to stand-by and enjoy it. This is a real pop-corn movie with comic-like character, impossible action scenes (some could say ""cool""...) and stylish direction. BTW, Witt's style isn't bad: he abuses of the strobo effect and stays too close to the characters in the fighting scenes (so you don't understand quiet anything), but besides this flaws it works. Very good the cinematography: it really gives the idea of wet, cold and dirty. The story has some holes, but who cares? Like I said, it's really a video game. Again, very funny.

The story was excellent, which managed to tie in nicely with the video game. Several scenes could almost cut away to various clips in the Resident Evil saga. Which to the more experienced watcher, allows them to almost feel all the various characters and games occurring simutaniously within the film. Yet the plot by itself was fascinating and well written, without many of the plot holes you see in 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead. Animals can't grow crops, but they don't seem to die of starvation either. Out of all the zombie movies done these past few years, this is the best next to the original Resident Evil movie. I hope the negative attention this movie has seen is due to the timing of its release, because I would sure hate to see the end of its line premature.

"six50joe","Null","0","0","20 September 2004"," Thoughts as a moviegoer, as a game fan
","This is my first movie review. Since this move is based on a popular video game franchise, I'll give my first thoughts to a potential viewer who hasn't played the games.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a sci fi/action movie mix. The plot and most of the characters are original, and the movie's pace is a consistent mix of action sequences and character interaction scenes that reveal the agenda of the Umbrella corporation and key figures within it. Special effects are very well done, and there are a few clever moments and plot elements. Many of the action scenes employ a modern technique, whereby you can only see a confusing flurry of swinging fists, kicks and weapons in camera closeups. I couldn't help feeling that the director (Alexander Witt) tried bludgeoning viewers with cheap tricks as a substitute for choreographing realistic sequences. This, along with the in-your-face bravado displayed by the main characters did the interesting plot a major injustice.<br/><br/>For fans of the video game franchise, like myself, there are some nice treats, my favorites being Nemesis and zombie dogs, both extremely well done and true to the games. Overall, the movie captures the look of the games faithfully- but not the style, not by a long shot.<br/><br/>In the mid 90s the Resident Evil series started a game genre called 'survival horror'. The experience one has playing any of the games is one of carefully paced tension, fright, shock, and.... desperate survival, all lacking by varying degrees in the movie. This is not to say that Apocalypse didn't have scary moments, but unlike in the games the characters weren't ordinary enough to convince me of their peril and heroism. An example of this is the introduction of Jill Valentine's character (Sienna Guillory), whose look was obviously meant to match that of her video game persona. The problem was that in the movie the look made her seem more like a prostitute with an attitude, an inappropriate juxtaposition for the plight of her character. In my opinion, this movie could have easily been much more gripping, if not a classic, if it had followed the styles of classic 'survival' sci fi films like The Thing or the first Terminator movie. I'll bet that Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami sees the Resident Evil movies as a mixed blessing; they give the franchise much larger exposure, but without his involvement, style is sacrificed."

","Exciting fun ride throughout. It's action with a touch of horror, crafted to its finest. Make no mistake - this is hardly frightening or dramatic. Instead, it is heart-pounding entertainment like a Terminator movie. There's no time to think. You're not even going to be graced with occasional ruminations over Spider Man's ""there's a hero in all of us."" Instead, RE's scene to scene action will spin you through a wild mob of zombies, a perilous graveyard, burning car wrecks, a hopeful helicopter pad, streets of retreating police, a K-9 unit (Yay!), people clawing at a prison city wall, an empty-looking schoolyard,... all the while with guns a'blazin', people a'runnin', and zombies a'chasin'. The film only allows a pause of silence for the classic slow-motion whizzing bullets, a bizarre car crash, and moments before yet another infected creature attacks. Action.<br/><br/>If you're the hopelessly logical, then this film is not for you. Your mind will inevitably wander through thoughts like if STARS knew about headshots, why didn't they bother giving the Racoon City Police a hint? Or, hmm...those zombies sure are slow on the ground; funny how they were just racing up the steps a minute ago. Don't bother. Give the brain a two-hour break, sit back, and enjoy.<br/><br/>--- My complaints? It's OK for action movies to have an ultra-powerful hero, but why god-like? There's no tension and danger when god's around. Fortunately, the characters have a habit of splitting up. Also, Nemesis wasn't frightening enough. Let a dentist fix his toothy grin and he could almost pass as a pudgy stuffed animal...with a rocket launcher."

"vidkid2k","9","0","0","17 September 2004"," No, it wasn't a BAD movie...
","RE: Apocalypse sucked... not!<br/><br/>If anyone went to this movie and expected a horror film, then yes, it sucked. But as an action film... while I have seen better, there a lot worse films out-there.<br/><br/>In defense to the movie (which I liked) I would like to offer these little insights and bear with me, I try not to include spoilers.<br/><br/>1) Logic... or lack thereof. We can make a movie based on actual logic and it will be pretty damn boring. After all, if we used logic, the head of Umbrella would have sent more than a handful of men to a situation where a para military squad was lost. Walking around in a city of Zombies? Hey, bust into an armored car (from a bank or something) and use that or if you really want to, get the police APC unit, Jill Valentine is still a cop, and they should have at least one. You can avoid a lot of needless action by playing safe. Break into the gun stores and get your supply of ammo and guns, organize the remaining towns people until Umbrella relents and either fries your collective behinds or sends in real support. Can you imagine going to that movie?<br/><br/>2) Oh, Yeah, Eeek! - Alien was a scary movie. People trapped in a small location and slowly die from the monster. The First RE could be said to be Horror due to the elements in that movie. But then what. People who saw the first movie or played the game won't be scared by an army of Zombies. So the film shifted gears and became an Action movie... like Aliens. For a Horror movie, it sucked. But as an action movie it was good. I just hope that if they do a third movie, it won't be a Aliens 3.... [Shudder]<br/><br/>3) Plot twists... gotta love 'em. Yeah they made changes, and I expected changes in the storyline. After all, if it followed the games exactly, the movie would be boring. While I would've liked to see the crows, moths, plants and perhaps some infected Zoo critters, it would have been too much for a 1hr 45 min movie. But the changes that were there I kinda liked. Nicholi's personality was better in the movie than the game and the idea that those infected with the virus could recognized others who also were infected was superb... gives the reason why the zombies aren't eating each other. (Ref. When Alice and Angie first meet.) And might explain how and why Angie alone, managed to survive the doggies and zombies. I also liked the end, I like the fact that Jill and crew thought they could waltz in and 'rescue' Alice. Yet they were 'made' by the gate guards. See, Evil Security Guards can do their work properly.<br/><br/>My only gripe was the editing of the fight scenes. The Fight between the Nemesis and Alice did not have to be nothing but close-ups. The director seemed to think that every punch/kick and grapple needed to be shown in it's own little showcase. Also the final jab (pun intended) was telegraphed from such a distance that the idea of it being an 'if' or 'when' became a statement of 'get to the point already' (another pun intended)<br/><br/>6 outta 10 seems fair tho I felt it should be higher than that"
"Leafsman_69","7","0","0","17 September 2004"," Worth the Loonies I spent to see it
","I saw this movie just the other week. this film unlike the first had a high entertainment value. this edition of the resident evil series is filmed in the streets as opposed to the underground Hive in the 1st installment. Some people have made mention of the lack of character development in the movie, however i do not believe that the goal of this film was to have you engrossed in character development. Milla suits her role just fine, especially in her b-day suit. Apocalypse is a very dark movie with more blue lights then sunlight. the action is non-stop, and the black guy provides comic relief. more appealing characters are in the movie and the setting of downtown Toronto leads for endless possibilities to occur.<br/><br/>Other then the lack of character development, the other weakness is the camera movement during the fight scenes, sometimes you can't see what the hell is going on. ironically the zombies are not the most evil enemy in the movie, neither is Nemisis, but it is the real humans who run the Umbrella co. these guys are truly hateable who u would love to see die a terrible death. throughout the movie, there is a sense all all impending doom if the characters don't escape. this puts you on the edge of your seat even more. the movie is filled with spectacular stunts and ends with a Bang! hang on to your seats, this will probably be the best big screen/popcorn movie of the year. 100% pure fun."
"KillerCadugen","6","0","0","16 September 2004"," Mindless excitement
","Listen - Resident Evil: Apocalypse is what it is: a sci-fi adventure made by people more interested in visuals, battle sequences and innovative photography than in plot or character development. But that's okay because we don't always go to movies for that sort of thing; sometimes we go just for mindless fun and that's what Resident Evil offers. (SPOILERS) With the addition of the Nemesis creature and Jill Valentine, the movie draws a better parallel to the video game than the original movie did (the Nemesis was perfect in that regard). While the original appeared to be little more than an extended music video, Apocalypse did pretty well in putting a storyline together. There were huge lapses in continuity and logic (movie logic, that is) and a fair portion of the dialogue was stupid, but I'm not afraid to admit that the movie was pretty exciting - and much better than the original. The director didn't seem to know when to end the movie, but he left it open ended and I for one wouldn't mind seeing it continue."
"Robert_duder","Null","0","0","16 September 2004"," Did Anyone actually see this movie??
","We are in a world of CGI, and special effects that are created by computer rather than man. Superman will never fly on wire and crane, and UFO's will never attack intricately made recreations of cities and the earth. Instead producers, directors, and actors, spend millions on computer technology to create something that does not only not exist, but never even really happens. Do we ever stop to wonder why we don't see the absolute smash BLOCKBUSTERS of yesteryear? Where is Indiana Jones gone, or the old Star Wars? or the Lethal Weapon type action movies where you know those actors are rolling, jumping, shooting, and doing their own stunts or at the very least they have stunt doubles? Ladies and gentlemen, after that rant we rest on Resident Evil: Apocalypse. YES this is based on a video game, get over it. It doesn't make it a bad movie, it doesn't make it any different than based on a book, or a play, or a previously crappy movie. This movie was absolutely incredible, it was the best action movie, I have literally seen in years. The first Resident Evil was good...but it could not touch this unbelievable horrorfest, mixed with kick butt action, and a great cast.<br/><br/>Best of all the CGI was apparently NIL and not necessary when you have the best action going.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The story begins slightly before the end of Resident Evil 1, but doesn't only recap but fills in some blanks that were missed at the end. Some extended information so to speak. Alice (Milla Jovovich) stumbles out of captivity having been infected with a strain of the T-Virus (confused? Go rent the movie and/or game) This tiny detail enables Milla's character to become an awesome kick butt heroine with super hero strength, speed, and power. Plus she still wields guns like nobody's business. The Umbrella corporation has succumbed to the fact that their virus is loose in the city, and destroyed everything. Although they are trying to evacuate as much as they can, they realize there is no stopping it so they quarantine the city and begin preparation to obliterate the whole works and cover it up from the outside world. Then there is Alice, stumbling around inside the quarantine...not sure what to do or where to go, her former friend/partner Matt haven been taken away from her and brought into the ""Nemesis"" program. All of us who had played the game knew where that was going. Enter the new characters. Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) makes her entrance as a rogue STARS agent. Locked in the city with a fellow STARS member, and eventually some other random citizen who stumbles upon them and turns into the comic relief of the film. Basically the story unfolds that if Jill, Alice, and the rest of her friends/team can search the city for the lost child of an Umbrella Scientist, that Scientist will help them out of the city before Umbrella nukes the whole works. What ensues is a kick-ass piece of action entertainment laced with the perfect works of a horror movie. Granted there are plot holes, how certain people get infected, and the duration of the infection before it turns people seems to change with each character, but plot holes are expected and acceptable in something that is just meant to be FUN!! This movie was FUN!! Awesome fun. First of all the weapons are just plentiful and cool!! And the moves when it was hand to hand was just perfection in fighting. I read some reviews that said the direction was choppy and inconsistent and I can't imagine where they got that from?? Granted, a few scenes seemed to be a little quick where you couldn't catch exactly what Alice was doing to these Zombies but even still you could sit back and just watch her whoop!! The one liners are a plenty and they are good, and funny, and several people even clapped in the theatre I was in. The director, Alexander Witt, who has worked on some of the most incredible action movies of the last ten years, knows his stuff and it's obvious. He knows exactly what makes a movie goer pump and he's got it all in here. The cast works together like magic, and Jill Valentine is given a dark, harsh edge that makes her mysterious and mean and a good guy all in one. I would like to have seen more of the STARS survive, but in all good horror movies, people must get picked off one by one and in their favor, more people survived then I thought would initially. That's what made this a unique horror movie was that in truth you didn't see the kills coming necessarily, and you couldn't say exactly who was gonna get it. The first Resident Evil felt almost Science Fiction but Witt took Resident Evil to it's horror roots and gave us a zombie flick to die for. Unlike Dawn of The Dead (which was good, but not great) Resident Evil has a story, a back story, a future. And frankly girls should LOVE this movie because it is one of the only, if not the only, where the lead characters are women and not just women, but women that lead, take out everything in their path and they are strong. They aren't utilized as sex symbols, or eye candy but rather actual characters who are gonna save everyone. Let's face it, Jovovich's Alice, or Guillory's Jill Valentine could make mince meat of Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft. Nemesis was an absolute awesome addition to Resident Evil and his declaration of ""STARS"" which was used ONLY ONCE (thank you for not ruining it Mr. Witt) made me smile. He was a killer enemy...or nemesis if you will.<br/><br/>Especially knowing Alice's emotional attachment. To have him then turn from her enemy to her ally, was brilliant and fun and added to the action. I hope he'll be back. Also it was cool to bring back the demon dogs which everyone loved from the first and Alice definitely got her vengeance another cool factor of Witt's story. Downsides...Jill Valentine tried her best to throw in the movements from the video game to little avail. For one thing they sucked in the game, let alone on screen. In that factor she didn't measure to Jolie's Lara Croft who perfected the noises and movements of the video gaming heroine. Certainly several plot holes made the movie implausible at parts, but perhaps one of the biggest reasons there was the length. The movie clocked in at an unfortunate ninety minutes. Everyone seems to be bitching about their attention spans and they want to pay 12 dollars for less than 2 hours of entertainment. I would have killed to see another half hour of those crazy zombies. All in all I don't know what people saw wrong with this film, it was possibly one of the best action movies I have ever seen. I pray there will be a third which there appears there will be although I am hesitant to think about what they will do with it. It probably will go sci fi which could kill the series but I just hope they'll think about it first. I don't compare this movie to anything else but itself as an action movie...I must give it what I thought and that's a strong 9/10....must see!!!"

","I went into this movie expecting something from the horror/action/video game genre. I loved Underworld, the Village, etc. The plot was entertaining, if a bit clich√©d--but I was there for the entertainment value. The ideas of conspiracy, cover up, and biowarfare were all interesting ones.<br/><br/>My major issue was with the large quantities of low frequency sound, which was incredibly painful for someone with sensitive ears such as myself. I had my fingers in my ears for half the movie and that didn't help. If you think you will like this movie but have sensitive hearing, don't see it in the theater like I did--rent it so you have control over the volume and the length of the noise affecting your ears."
"soulcharmer","6","0","0","15 September 2004"," Fan of the game series here
","This review is completely edited because as a fan translator I've made myself to produce subtitles to my language for this movie which really changed my view of it.<br/><br/>I would like to stress the prerequisites for this flick very strongly because on them depend how you will or will not like it. Firstly you virtually have to like scifi-horror-zombie flicks as a genre. Secondly you should be the fan of related game series and be decently acquainted with its style and content. Some tolerance towards cheesiness comes in handy too. If you do not meet any on these requirements, please don't bother watching this movie because there's only a slim chance you would like it. Despite the fact the authors of the movie try to speak to the broadest audience I believe only RE fans and people who simply love action flicks for action can be appealed.<br/><br/>Apocalypse connects to previous RE movie very tightly and there are tons of things you would recognize in it if you played the games. Acting is not bad but certainly not brilliant which is very understandable considering the genre. In fact I liked Jill and Carlos, the were both nicely laconic and tough but not overly tough. Action scenes in Apocalypse have their excesses better labeled as stupidities but sometimes they can be explained. If you are capable to ignore corny padding around the scenes, you realize the plot actually makes a sense and pays homage to overall RE storyline.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** For those who complained about some things they didn't understand in the movie I offer here some explanations. Through her adaptation of T-virus Alice became superhuman which explains most of stunts she had made. She was also capable to smell infected humans and monsters a mile off. That's why she charged into the church - not to save anyone but to kill those licker bastards. The wall around the city shown at graphical model wasn't the actual real wall. It was just the simplest way to show all the exits were sealed. The zombies crawling out of their graves were just scene borrowed from the game (in this case RE: Code Veronica); I still consider it a weak spot. Same as Alice's new psychic powers, how got Dr. Ashford infected or why the heck was Angie there at the end of the movie...<br/><br/>All in all Apocalypse is very flawed but as a fan of the game series I only took the good parts from it.<br/><br/>6/10"

","After rating the first RE movie as a ""10"", I have to give this a ""6.5"". Not nearly as cool as the first, as unfortunately Paul Anderson let someone else direct it. It has some MAJOR flaws (obviously the director knows nothing about zombies), but those can be ignored if you love the RE universe enough. The actress that played Jill was amazing - it really did seem like it was Jill on the screen. A few other game related goodness to be had, but I don't want to spoil it for any other hard-core gamers.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the first movie, or a fan of the Resident Evil game series, this is probably worth watching in the theater.

","So I went into this movie without any expectations whatsoever, and I think that helped. This is not a movie that you would ever expect to be good, so the fact that it wasn't terrible is an accomplishment. I simply do not understand the venom reviewers throw at schlock movies such as this when it is plainly, clearly aimed at one agenda: a cheap, Friday night date/scare movie. Does it deliver? Yes, more often than not. Milla Jovovich is a stunningly beautiful actress to watch, and there's actually some acting talent there. She manages to deliver her genre clich√©'s with actual charisma. The rest of the cast ranges from decent (a funny Mike Epps)to dismissably cable TV (everyone else). The directing is about on par with the rush jobs of this formula pic, with some stupid jarring blurry stuff that just annoyed me. I've pretty much given up that few in the American studio system knows how to stage a decent fight scene, and this film is a case in point: all shaky cameras and a blur of bodies. For sure, I much preferred the Dawn of the Dead remake to this, just as much as I preferred Torque to the Fast and Furious movies: both films were stylish, comedic spins on the genre. However, if all movies were built sarcastically there would be no reference for what they were ripping on. Resident Evil: Apocalypse gets the job done, and that's good enough for a Friday night. Two 1/2 stars out of five."

","RE2 was actually a pretty good movie. Just like the first movie a couple of parts I kind of thought were extremely cheese but all in all an entertaining and fun film. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hands down the two hottest women paired up in an action movie ever. Jill Valentine fighting the undead in a short skirt, knee high boots and a halter top, now you can't beat that! A lot of good zombie action for you zombie freaks, I loved the short and random scenes of the zombies wandering around the city. There are a lot of random characters/survivors introduced which is interesting to watch how they are surviving in the zombie infected walled off city.<br/><br/>Some characters are introduced just to have them killed to spare the main characters for the rest of the movie. My favorites are the beer drinking roof sniper, the two Umbrella security guys (kind of annoying but I liked em), the newsreporter lady (I was waiting for her to suit up in some slutty outfit and join Alice and Jill, haha), and my favorite character of all was Mike Epps playing LJ, for me this dude totally stole the film. LJ survives on his own for quite a bit of the movie, unlike the others who are paired up and grouped together. I thought the Nemesis creature was going to be really cheesy after seeing the clips of him on the trailer but they made it work where it was bearable. A lot of the details of the first movie are explained more in depth in RE2. All in all if you check out this movie, go in with a smile and you'll leave with a smile, and feel free to laugh out loud even at parts that aren't supposed to be funny. Good time!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","The original Resident Evil movie was a fine movie in it's own right, but one which had barely the right to carry the Resident Evil monkiker. In this sequel we really get to see the series come into it's own on the big screen.<br/><br/>Everything seems much more well done, and adheres much more to the storyline of the games, while still keeping continuity with the first movie.<br/><br/>Resident Evil follows loosely with the events of Resident Evil 3 (psx, pc, Dreamcast, Game Cube), while taking some inspiration from all of the other games (most notably Resident Evil Code Veronica).<br/><br/>Joining Alice from the original movie is game star Jill Valentine, donning her Resident Evil 3 outfit, and a number of other supporting characters. While the actress portraying Jill Valentine's performance was spotty at best, it adds a bit of camp value to the film, and will have long time fans of the game series reminiscing of the B-Movie style acting present in the first game.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch and really put most other modern zombie movies to shame, with Matrix-esquire action sequences, classic Romero style zombies, and a few other CG effects which are absolutely spectacular.<br/><br/>!!!warning - spoilers!!!<br/><br/>The main baddie of this movie is the nemesis, a no-nonsense killing machine reminiscent of a bio-weapon version of the Terminator, rocket launcher and chain fed mini gun included. Both Jill valentine and the nemesis are reproduced faithfully from Resident Evil 3, every detail from clothing down to the staples across the face of the nemesis monster is present in their big screen counterparts.<br/><br/>Sadly, the character of these characters is not reproduced as faithfully as their appearances. Jill Valentine, who was portrayed in the game series as the ultimate heroin, takes a back seat to the T-Virus enhanced super-alice, and ends up being a character who, if it were not for her prominence in the game series, would be all together forgettable.<br/><br/>The nemesis on the other hand, is just as strong in the movie as he was in the game, but serves a much different purpose. In Resident Evil 3, the nemesis was the silent stalker who could, and would, show up at the most in-opportune or unexpected moment, only to inspire sheer terror in the heart of the player. The movie counterpart to this silent stalker fails to instill the sense of horror that was present in the game. Our characters only have a few ruins with the nemesis, culimnating in the ultimate showdown between nemesis and Alice, but we never feel like the characters are truly being slowly, surely, hunted.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is much better than it's predocessor, yet still fails to capture the survival horror feeling in the game. While the resident evil game series will have your heart pumping and sweat glands working overtime, this movie merely shadows the depth of the game world with some nice special effects and good action sequences.<br/><br/>Best scene - Alice takes on a group of lickers in a cathedral.<br/><br/>Most glaring flaw - We see Angela stuck inside of an overturned and badly damaged car, next thing we know she is holed up inside of a school infested with zombies and Cerberus's (zombie dogs), with no explanation of how she managed to get out of the car and make it there in the first place.<br/><br/>Best Strait-From-The-Series scene - zombies rising out of the dirt in the graveyard, ala Code Veronica.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line **** (4 out of 5 stars) - While there are a few glaring plot holes, the script still manages to be very engrossing. Although the Jill character seems to have some pretty bad acting at times, Mila Jovovitch is spectacular as Alice, bringing a level of depth to the character which many other actresses might not have been able to pull off."

","Resident Evil: Apocalypse<br/><br/>I got back a little bit ago from seeing Resident Evil: Apocalypse, here are my thoughts on it (spoilers ahead):<br/><br/>OK, first off I have to say I like the first one better. This RE:A is a bigger film than the original, but the first RE seemed better thought out. I think it's worth seeing if you liked the first one, but you have to suspend you disbelief a lot more (I know, I'm talking about a film with zombies, bear with me). Things I did not like:<br/><br/>1. Ebert pointed this out, why the f**k did the STARS guys not try to shoot Nemesis in the head when all the body shots failed? 2. Jill Valentine: OK, the actress who played her is hot as hell, but some of her acting seemed very much the clich√© 'tough chick' role. Maybe that was the director's decision. Also, why does a suspended cop have to dress like a hooker? I mean, it's hot but just does not seem right to fight the undead with so much easy to bite skin exposed. 3. Sometimes the Umbrella execs are mean just to be mean, why have Alice and Nemesis duke it out to see who is better? Keep both projects going, one for all out war and one for stealth projects. 4. The zombies coming out of the graves at the grave yard. First, I doubt the brain would be intact on many of them since they had been in the ground so long. Second, something with the strength of a human most likely could not claw through a casket, a vault liner and six feet of earth to get to the surface.<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/><br/>1. Two cute female leads. 2. Alice having some superpowers was cool at times. 3. You see the little girl the Red Queen from the first film was based on. 4. Some of Mike Epps lines were great, even though he was typecast as the stereotypical 'wise ass black guy'.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad film but the script could have used some more polishing."

It was just put in the movie to look good, but anyone who knows anything about RE knows that it was all crap. how could the dead, decomposing bodies contact the T-Virus, and manage to stay in one piece long enough to fight? but i must admit, the filming during the fight scenes was unique and made you feel like you were actually there.<br/><br/>2. the dogs. OK, yea, they were really great in the first movie, but how did they get the virus in this one? as far as i know, the zombies didn't go after dogs or any other animal as a food source and in the first movie, the virus was airborne, so anything in the building contracted it.<br/><br/>3. the filming of the zombies in general, it was just bad. i thought the way they zoomed in and focused on the zombies in the first movie was good and they should have stuck with that.but, thats just my opinion. but aside from those 3 flaws, i thought it was a great movie; the action and killing never stopped, the special effects were great, some of the acting was quite good, there were some humorous scenes, and the ending still left you hanging like in the first one, but it wasn't as frustrating. I give it **** out of 5"

","OK...<br/><br/>Here we go..... Read all of the comments here, because I knew that those Bravo Channel film critics would slice it up. That is how I decided to go or not. Saw this film based on the fact that I am a fan of the Game, (I am much older than you think)and that some of you objected to the scathing reviews it received.<br/><br/>Well I went for the mindless entertainment and no high expectations. I enjoyed this film on several merits. I also heard some of the most ridiculous fight scene lines in history.<br/><br/>The Plus: Friggin' Nemesis, they did it right with his look and feel, and I mean spot on! He looks small in some of the film spots, but not up close! He stole this movie and I wanted to see more of him.<br/><br/>Friggin' Milla, they juiced her up to hang with all of the latest, and unbelievable I might add, gymnastic moves that seem to frequent the outlandish Hollywood fare that exists today. Still, I liked her a bunch and pulled for her exploits.<br/><br/>Jill's opening scene was fab.<br/><br/>I keep hoping for a ""seamless CGI"" Tyrant to get the roll call in these movies but that hasn't happened yet. But I wouldn't mind seeing Nemesis again with those FAVORITE WEAPONS of mine!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was passable, on the D+ side of acting....LOL<br/><br/>Minuses: Those Zombies en masse in the streets, was a slap in the face of the viewer.....Or...The director did that on purpose, for multiple viewings for DVD players, so that you could see how RIDICULOUS each one carried themselves!!! Roger Ebert said, ""They looked like drunk movie patrons, slogging through slushee laden floors to get to the concession stand."" I agree. Each one of those zombies wanted to stand out for his 15 minutes of fame to show his friends where he was in that pile!<br/><br/>Terrible effect for movie-goers though........<br/><br/>This picture will elicit ""audience shouting"" at this film, because of the certain portions of this film that climbs all over your intelligence, even when your intelligence is NOT IN GEAR! Plan on this happening.<br/><br/>Did I like this movie? Yes, I did....But I feel that I am adding bias to a sample of reviewers here that either liked the games or never played them. As a fan of the GAME, I KNOW what I wanted out of an RE Film, and I got what mattered most! Nemesis, Milla and some stunning action sequences. They got the ""sounds"" right too, so props to the sound fx guys at work here. Nemesis' Gatling Gun is the best...<br/><br/>Our theater did have the Volume up full blast with our BRAND NEW Surround System employed...Whew....Ears are still ringing!<br/><br/>Catch the Matin√©e or wait for DVD, it doesn't matter. Except Nemesis is at his biggest on the big screen! <br/><br/>You decide......"

","First the movie is not as good as Resident Evil. One of the best thing about the first movie is the cool action sequences which at least had some logic,but here all u see is crappy editing which takes away much of the enjoyment from the action sequences. I had a feeling the movie spent more time setting up a sequel rather than giving us a good action movie.I felt like i watched a teaser trailer for the next movie and that was not wat i paid for. I was disappointed that a movie with lots of potential was let down by many corny scenes..well at least some comic relief was there..But still I'm expecting a sequel to this movie and wish that was handled better than the first one. Was the director over-excited while filming the action sequences, i bet he wd have got confused while filming them and editing them in such a away that it will be cool only for people who have the capability to visualize lots of things fast. Overall the movie is watchable especially if u loved the first one and i loved the way they setup the sequel than the rest of the movie. The cool background music from the first movie is also missing."

","I just got back from seeing the opening showing at Cine Capri here in Scottsdale, AZ (technically, Cine Capri is in Phoenix, but anyway...). I'm a techie who loves Star Trek, Star Wars, the Alien movies, video games, almost anything computer-related, and almost any sci-fi movie. So, the high-tech and monster stuff in this movie lured me in. That and the opportunity to see it at Cine Capri - the LARGEST screen in Metro Phoenix (outside IMAX, of course) with a 40,000 watt Dolby Digital sound system! If you don't mind shelling out the dough for this premium theater, it's definitely the way to go. No, I don't work for them or anything like that. You'll see how my ""gushing"" about Cine Capri here relates to the movie in the last paragraph below.<br/><br/>But, I digress - ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a very decent sci-fi, survival horror movie. The acting was pretty good. The action was good. And, the special f/x were very good. Too, the ""bad ass"" factor was off the chart!<br/><br/>It has some very suspenseful parts that I enjoyed. However, there were some minor annoyances - the fight scenes were shot WAY too close to the action and WAY too jittery; I've seen another movie this summer that used this same ""style"" of camera-work - ""The Bourne Supremacy"" - and it was the only thing that ruined that movie for me as well. Also, let's be honest; this is yet another zombie movie. The main ""threat"" are the zombies - and, yeah, it's a bit worrisome that if they so much as nip you, you die pretty quickly from the virus and become a flesh-eating zombie yourself, but other than that, the zombies aren't too much to worry about. Their sheer numbers are a problem, but it's cake to take them out - one pop in the head or break the spinal cord and that's it - whoop de doo. Don't get me wrong, though - there are many other, more menacing threats for the characters to deal with, but the zombie threat gets pretty old pretty quick.<br/><br/>So... if you have an AWESOME theater like Cine Capri to see it in, go for it. Otherwise, wait until it comes out on DVD."
"sparksmovies-1","7","0","0","10 September 2004"," A script doctor and a different editor away from badazzness...
","So let's face it: the first Resident Evil film was OKAY at best. Mildly entertaining, but ultimately empty and horribly written like all Paul W.S. Anderson films. But it made back its money and then some. Sequel time :P<br/><br/>To be honest, I was expecting this to be the worst sequel since Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (another sequel Anderson handed off). That's NOT the case. If you're not expecting Hamlet, and are just looking for a good popcorn flick, RE: Apocalypse delivers in spades. This is one of the only video game adaptations in recent memory that's managed to take itself seriously and succeed (mostly.) I'm happy to report that this flick isn't for kids...it's an honest to god R rated zombiefest, and the violence, action, AND gore are kicked up a notch beyond Anderson's first yawn of a zombie flick. And ya know, it also has a surprisingly decent sense of humor- something MASSIVELY lacking in the first RE. Mike Epps's one liner as he runs over a zombie policeman is an absolute CLASSIC! (you'll know it when your hear it). Upon closer examination, this massive scale zombie apocalypse owes more to 80's and 90's action adventures than to anything of recent memory...(Milla's got the Sarah Connor bit DOWN PAT, hehe) and it's a good deal of fun. Beautiful lighting and camera work (when the editor isn't busy turning it into quick cut mulch), a BUTTLOAD of action (the best I've seen in recent years), and of course, superhotties. I'm happy to report the soda depletes and popcorn rests easy in my stomach. Lots of fun to be had.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with it? More than a few things, naturally. Paul Anderson's script, for one. It's sufficient, I'll give it that (perhaps even moreso than AVP.) But a script doctor could have fixed a few leaks in the plot and dialogue...really polished and delivered on some of those bigger moments. The main grip however, is the EDITING....UGH!!!! I'm actually considering contacting the editor of this film and verbally ripping him a new orifice. The editing managed to butcher 75% of what could have been the best action since the original Matrix. I've never seen so much rapid fire editing in my life, and for a person that appreciates SEEING his action (yes, SEEING is a major part of a movie), this movie steps all over the viewer's attention span. It's like a hypodermic injection of ADD, I swear. Also, the direction at times was amateurish (what can be expected from an AD though), resulting in some awkward moments here and there. More than anything though, I can't get over the hyper-MTV editing. It ruined what could have been the best scifi action film in years. ARE ANY STUDIO EXECS LISTENING?!?! RECUT THE ACTION SEQUENCES, YOU MORONS! YOU HAVE A GEM HERE! OK. I'm relaxed. But seriously...as an editor, it pains me to see this kind of garbage editing. It's a copout. If I could get my hands on the source footage, I'd whip the action back into shape. <br/><br/>All in all? It's kinda like a windchill factor- it seems a lot cooler than it really is. First time you see it, it'll feel like a 3 star action flick. Without that initial breeze though...it's gonna drop down several notches upon further viewings. The editing will make it annoying to watch, and the plot/dialogue are gonna start to unravel quicker than Steven Sommers's career post Van Helsing. Do yourself a favor- bring some popcorn, pack up a one hitter, and leave your brain at the door...you'll have a lot of fun, even if you didn't enjoy the first film."

","First, don't go looking for a Oscar winner. It serves it's purpose and was pretty good. I thought it was true to the description I read in the papers: Rated-R Non-stop violence, language, some nudity. The fight scenes weren't all that great but other than that I don't see how they could make a much better movie or series of movies based on a video game. I'd go see it again and I plan to get it on DVD when it comes out. I've read a lot of negative stuff about the director but I don't think many people could have done it much better. Stayed true to the game's over all theme of the World Wide corporation that controls everything and does as it wishes. I'd give it 3 out of 5 if they had a review bar."

"ilj-1","Null","0","0","12 September 2004"," Excellent following of the games, but what just happened?
","I recently saw Resident Evil: Apocalypse on opening night here and was pleasantly surprised by the several things. First of all, the movie closely follows the plot and storyline of the 3rd Resident Evil game (Resident Evil - Nemesis - PS1), detailing how Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera attempt to escape from Racoon City after it's residents have been infected with the T-Virus. I was also pleasantly surprised with the acting, as it wasn't stellar but not horrible either. This time around the zombies seems more vicious and blood-thirsty than in the first film which actually had me a bit scared at certain parts in the movie which was something I was not expecting going into it.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a decent movie and worth the price of admission, especially if you're as big of an RE fan as I am. Now then, you can read any one of the reviews posted for this movie and get detailed opinions of the acting, storyline, etc. However, the real reason I am writing this is to voice my distaste with the directing and filming style of this movie. It seems that whenever someone who has a history of directing music videos directs a movie, they all suffer from the same problem. Apparently, the director can't keep a steady shot for more than .7 seconds during every action scene of the movie. Now, maybe my eyesight is getting poor in my old age (24) but every time it came to killing some zombies in that movie I absolutely could not tell what was going on. I know they just decimated a group full of blood-thirsty zombies, I just don't know how they did it. Every action scene sort-of washes over you because your eyes and brain can't keep up with the seemingly still frame picture show that occurs whenever things heat up. Someone should tell these directors that they have a good hour and half to work with, slow things down just a tad, let people actually see what is going on during a battle or action scene and for God's sake, keep the camera steady.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my only real gripe with the movie. Other than that it was a great film for fans. If you see it I hope you enjoy it."

To be honest, I didn't have high expectations for Resident Evil: Apocalypse but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons I didn't have that high of a expectation for resident evil is because I really liked Resident Evil 1 a lot. I especially like the open ending it complimented the computer game perfectly. I was therefore surprised to see that a second movie was to be made.<br/><br/>I personally like how the first move was made, with provocative camera angles great lighting etc. Resident evil 2 continues with the same visual style and makes use of some of the new ideas other movies have used since Resident Evil 1 was made. I think that they have found a good balance between CGI, animatronics and classic special effect makeup.<br/><br/>Story wise Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse picks up where the original move left us. We are first introduced to the new characters in this move and then we see Milla Jovovich. The store is that the T-Virus has spread to Racoon City and everybody has to flee out of the city before total lockdown. Afterwards they will be on their own. <br/><br/>Some of the things I didn't like about the story was the way Alice meets the other main characters it seemed a bit too lucky. The last thing I didn't like was the way the monster of the movie was made. It looked way to computer-animated, and I have to agree with the guy on the forum who says that it looks like the monster from the computer game Doom3.<br/><br/>Anyway I really liked the movie, it's a great continuation of the first move.

The acting was fine, and I liked Mike Epps character, even though he wasn't vital for the plot. His comic relief was always welcome. This movie also gave a good background of what the first movie set up, which was good for people who haven't seen the first Resident Evil, but was efficient enough to not waste the time of those who did see RE1.

A few upgrades here and there with the enemies, including 'Nemesis', which I thought was extremely cool as the ultimate baddie. As if he's almost as indestructible as Schwarzenegger's Terminator right up until the very end. The character of Alice seems to be determined than ever after receiving an anti-mutation injection from doctors. She kicks butt right from the get go after escaping the lab. Then she teams up with everyone including the likes of Jill Valentine, who is one of the RE video game's characters. From there, they work out with the rest of what's left in the group. Mike Epps is wonderful as the comic relief of the movie along with Oded Fehr who plays Oliveras. They all try to find a way out of Raccoon City with the help of a little girl and her father,and steering themselves clear from a corrupt Umbrella Corp. official who wants to leave them all for dead along with the rest of the population. The movie overall might bring about the gory, violent conflicts throughout the whole duration, but the last 20 minutes of the film will bring you all a sigh of relief, for sure, as well as a new story angle in the works perhaps.

There's about the same amount of character development (maybe less except for, as with the first one, Alice) but the characters are still fun and do their jobs.<br/><br/>Sienna Guillory was great as the video game character Jill, it's too bad she didn't get more screen time.<br/><br/>The real star of the movie should have been the action and fighting scenes, but Alexander Witt seems to suffer from the ""let's make action scenes hard to follow and choppy so you really FEEL in the movie"" syndrome. Peter Jackson had it, which was my only complaint with the LotR trilogy. But those movies were beautiful anyway, and RE:A is FUN anyway, and isn't that why we go to a theater?<br/><br/>I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Higher if you love the first one or the video games."

","Much better sequel to the original film that finally captures the essence of the game and adds a sense of dread to the party as well. Milla Jovovich gives a better performance this time around as Alice and Oded Fehr is just as strong as well. The special effects are much better as well as the cgi and the city setting is much creepier as well. It still has some of the problems of the first film like a short running time and weak plot development but the pros out weight the cons by a mile here. The score is better produced and the cinematography has more style here than the original. It still lacks the shock value of the game but it does come close to capturing it as well. <br/><br/>Bring on part 3."

","First off let me say I am a horror geek. And add to that a zombie nerd. My fave film of all time is Braindead, and my top 5 include the 4 Romero Dead films.<br/><br/>OK now thats over let my tell you of my hate of the trash known as Resident Evil: Apocalypse.<br/><br/>Its awful.<br/><br/>Fist up the acting, wooden at best, aggravating at its worst. Some scenes play like an amateur porn flick before the sex kicks in.<br/><br/>The Story is beyond abysmal, and is simply beyond stupid, it lacks cohesion or any development of plot or characterization.<br/><br/>Sound is actually good, well mixed and crisply presented. The low end is perhaps a bit wooden, and the high end too sharp, but the surround is just about perfect.<br/><br/>The direction is cookie cutter stuff, with every trade clich√© finding its way in somewhere, the framing show a lack of imagination.<br/><br/>The editing is crude, with sloppy jump cuts and bad pacing. The film could have been 15-25 minutes shorter and lost nothing in atmosphere. It feel rushed and further weakens an already damaged product.<br/><br/>The fx are OK and some are impressive, but mostly they are a sad attempt at bringing life to a corpse of a film that really needed to be buried, and is just stinking up the place.<br/><br/>My major irk with the movie is that it isn't scary, or gory, or suspenseful, all the things the game is known for, and things that horror is known for. Instead we get a weak action film so dumb that only the lowliest smacktard could possibly enjoy it (i.e if you like Uwe Boll this is the movie for you).<br/><br/>I hate this film for what it should have been.<br/><br/>There are worse ways to waste a couple of hours but I cant think of any right now.<br/><br/>If you like horror skip this film, it will only annoy you. If you like action, skip it will only disappoint you. If you like film skip it, as it will only astound you at its ineptitude.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 only Uwe Boll could make a worse horror film."

","With the virus breaking out of the ""secure"" Hive, the Umbrella Corporation order Racoon City to be sealed off and isolated ¬ñ even if it traps most of the residents inside with the undead infected. The Corporation's scientists are all evacuated, with the exception of one who has lost his daughter within the city. He refuses to leave and turns to the only member of the Corporation's staff still left inside for help ¬ñ this person being none other than Alice. Joining a band of armed survivors, things don't look good with Alice running out of time - but then the Corporation take the decision, to protect their stockholders and executives, that the city will be destroyed by a nuclear strike at dawn. Meanwhile they take the opportunity to release the Nemesis programme into the city to test its effectiveness.<br/><br/>Although the first film was not actually any good, it still did enough to please those who knew what they were getting into when they sat to watch it, and enough of the target audience must have gone to see it to justify a sequel a few years later. Despite clearly having a wider playpen within the story, film doesn't feel like a massive budget has been poured into it in some areas. Specifically the plot and dialogue are pretty weak; the attempt to escape Racoon City has a few things piled onto it to try and up the ante but none of them really ring true and it mainly comes off feeling like the narrative was an afterthought. This is backed up by the poor dialogue and total lack of characterisation in all areas. Of course if you are target audience for this film then it seems unlikely that such things will matter to you and it probably does what you need it to do. There are fights, zombies, big guns, things going bang and men in monster suits. None of it is anything special but it is noisy enough for the teenage male target audience.<br/><br/>As with the first film, the theme of the big corporation is not used that well and, although it is stated how evil the company is, we are never really given a sense of them in the same way as some other ""sinister forces at work"" movies have done. The direction makes it all look slick enough but forgets to add the horror and tension that it really should have had. Jovovich is pretty handy but throwing in the odd scene where she looks angry and hurt over her past is not a replacement for delivering a character. The rest of the cast are pretty low rent and make the cast in the first film look better. Guillory is a ""feisty action woman"" who looks like she is from the same cookie cutter that produced Buffy, Charmed, Alias and a hundred others, she does the basics and no more. Likewise Epps, Fehr, Vavasseur and others just play their roles without having any real charisma or anything different, although Epps is actually quite amusing in the outtakes on the DVD! Overall this did what I expected it to do ¬ñ it was noisy, uninteresting and par for the genre course at best. It has an audience of course and I guess some sections of that will enjoy it but not that many."
"The_Void","3","3","8","20 April 2005"," How can such good video games spawn a movie this trite?
","Like all big fans of the excellent Resident Evil video game series; I was extremely dismayed and disappointed by the first movie. The characters, the style, the location and even the zombies just WERN'T Resident Evil, and as I went in expecting to see something very much like the games on screen, I came out of the movie feeling very cold. In fact, the only thing I did like about the movie was the ending, and that's where the last movie should have started. This movie, however, does start there; so is it finally the translation that us Resident Evil fans have been hoping for? Errr...no. Once again, the movie makers have failed to capture the game's spirit, which has been completely ditched in favour of several irrelevant and very two-dimensional characters, a very suspect script and action sequences that are only in the film to keep the attention of the less intelligent film fans. The plot basically follows a bunch of characters that find themselves in the middle of the outbreak in Racoon City, and obviously they decide to make their way out of the city to safety. Resident Evil 3's main villain, The Nemesis, is thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, it isn't all bad. Certain things, like the city for example, look great and are very reminiscent of the game. Sienna Guillory is another positive factor of the movie, as aside from looking great; she does look very much like Jill Valentine as well. However, the good parts end there as from there on out; the movie basically laughs in the face of the fan base it's trying to attract. Dr Ashford and Nicolai Ginovaeff, for a start, were villains in the games; and I know one thing for sure, The Nemesis would never have helped out the good guys in Resident Evil 3. It is a little known fact that the Resident Evil movie was a rip-off of Aliens; and this movie has decided to take much of it's influence from the underrated Alien: Resurrection. We've got the awful Milla Jovovich stepping into the souped up female role that Sigourney Weaver did much better, and then the whole Alice-Nemesis relationship has been ripped straight out of that movie. That relationship, like all character related aspects of the movie, doesn't work because of the complete lack of emotion in the script. This also makes it hard to care about anything that happens in the movie.<br/><br/>While Resident Evil Apocalypse is entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of a way, even this must be stripped from it's very lacking resume of good points. The film tries too hard to entertain and most of the entertaining elements pop up in the form of another explosion or Milla Jovovich jumping over some scenery and it gets boring very quickly. In my opinion, Resident Evil fans are better just sticking to the games. Leave this."
"edthehead78","2","3","8","10 October 2004"," Simply one of the worst films I've ever seen (some spoilers)
","I've actually seen quite a few bad films recently. However I can't recall ever seeing a big-budget film that fails so spectacularly in almost every single respect as Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Paul Anderson's original film was poor fare, and upon hearing of his departure from the director's chair, my expectations of the sequel were raised somewhat - how terribly, terribly wrong I was. First-time director Alexander Witt has made a mess of a film, one where scenes simply do not flow into one another - every scene in the film seemed to be the next in a series of random events that had no bearing on those that preceded or followed them. He also seems to have real trouble establishing the arrival of characters/monsters in a scene - just look at the zombies that seem to appear out of nowhere in the graveyard and the classroom scenes, or when the STARS members encircle the man. the less said about the fit-inducing 'MTV style' of directing action sequences the better.<br/><br/>The characters in RE:A are mere cyphers - anyone who has not played the video games will find no reason to care for any of them, and those that have will be very displeased with what has become of Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliviera and particularly Nicholai Ginovaef. Other than these we have Alice, our supposed protagonist (Milla Jovovich, proving somehow less charismatic than in the first film), Asian Reporter, Angry Black Man, Comedy Black Man, Creepy British Kid and a handful of others.<br/><br/>A very small redeeming feature is the Nemesis creature, which actually looked quite excellent as a man in a suit rather than a CGI. Unfortunately any menace is totally stripped from it by the changes made from the game version, and the 'coming to his senses' scene near the end is cringeworthy.<br/><br/>Don't let anyone tell you this film is merely a fun, brainless popcorn flick - it is nothing of the sort. A good example of how to make a popcorn zombie film is the Dawn Of The Dead remake; this film merely stumbles through a series of embarrassing set-pieces until its exhausting conclusion, which, by the way, promises another sequel. May God have mercy on us all."

Story was horrible (granted Anderson wrote it, please somebody take away his DGA/WGA cards... please). RE:A was not what I wanted to see. But it was still a very cleaner looking film. The Jill Valentine character was HORRIBLE. I'm sorry, I played the game, and Jill was no badass, rude, unstoppable character. Her facial expression was the same throughout the entire film and though Anderson wrote some of the worst dialog I have ever heard, well except for AVP, oh wait he wrote that one too, she delivered the bad dialog, well badly. The movie would have been much better if there was no Jill in the mix. That character kinda killed the whole movie for me. Mila on the other hand rocked. She has a very big future in the action genre. I enjoyed the look of the Nemisis, and the zombie dogs looked much better in this one, as did all the CGI work. If you're a fan of the series go see it. It's good mindless entertainment and leaves an intriguing ending th say the least. If part 3 is absent of Anderson it could have some potential.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I like this kind of thing... not because it is in any way good, but because it fails in such interesting ways.<br/><br/>That's because the original was strongly influenced by the Alice in Wonderland stories. Its a very solid structural framework, on which a zombie framework was overlain. Milla is an extremely limited actress, but is an apt Alice in an Eastern European Svankmajer/Kinski sort of way. The actors are in a world layered between our world and a subterranean world of zombies, so they have some degree of control over the undermovie.<br/><br/>This sequel reverses it all. Here, the zombie movie is in control, including the zombies that are the corporate bosses. The characters we see and follow are the background, the manipulated. In fact, every action is manipulated. Milla's charm vanishes in this situation and we are left with something that can only be judged on its merits as an action picture. And on that level, well it shuffles.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

With the quarantined city scheduled to be nuked, Alice's only chance for survival is to join a small group of survivors in a mission to locate the daughter of a top Umbrella scientist, a job made even harder with Project Nemesis, a massive mutant toting a mini-gun, loose on the streets...<br/><br/>Sometimes it's so hard to find the right words to convey my feelings about a film that it takes me as long to write my review as it took to watch the bloody thing in the first place. That's one reason why I love the Resident Evil films: they're such pure, mindless, popcorn entertainment that I don't have to struggle when it comes to typing up my thoughts. In Apocalypse, there's tons of zombies, which equals fun. There's Milla Jovovich looking fit and shooting big guns, which equals fun, plus we get a second babe in the form of sexy cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory).

"asda-man","5","2","5","5 June 2011"," Resident Evil: Rubbishalypse
","I'd like to start by saying, I didn't like the first Resident Evil, but I saw potential in the sequel, as we'd be out of that bunker and into the real world, so i liked it enough to see the sequel. And although i would say I did enjoy this one more, I'd still say it was bad.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is bad on so many levels, but I'd like to start on the good points and end on a negative (I'm in one of those moods).<br/><br/>The best part is that it keeps you entertained, in the first half I was rolling my eyes a bit, thinking that it was terrible, but the second half did wake me up a little bit, there's plenty of action and some edge-of-your-seat moments, however this can be undermined by how daft the story is.<br/><br/>That's the only good part really, that it was entertaining and enjoyable, arguably the most important factor for a film as well, however I did watch ""Martyrs"" for the fourth time the other night and is quite a contrast to this. Masterpiece to meh.<br/><br/>Now for the bad points :(. There's a lot of them, so get ya cataracts ready! Firstly, the story was a mish mash like in the first one. This whole business of some annoying engilshman finding his daughter was clich√©, his accent got on my nerves, as did his daughter's and I'm English myself! There is little to no character development, no one is likable. When someone dies you don't feel anything, in fact you're egging them on to croak! This is where films such as ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""28 Days Later"" succeed as zombie films. They aren't big budget, high concept films and so they don't just blow the budget on blowing things up for the sake of it. They concentrate on the characters, people who you care about, making them emotionally driven films. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" doesn't build on characters. That's a negative in my book.<br/><br/>The directing and editing was appalling as well! I couldn't believe what I was seeing, whenever anyone shoots a zombie the cameras all over the place flicking back and forth so that you completely miss what was on screen! It really is awful on the editing side.<br/><br/>The acting was bad, the girls just seemed to be there in the male gaze and times have moved on! I'm a male myself, but I just think it's plain sexist to make an attractive female waltz around wearing little to leave to the imagination! We should get past Mulvey's male gaze! In the end Alice ends up fighting bad guys with a towel wrapped around her! Why not go the full hog and have her shooting people naked! Well, it wouldn't be withing Barthes striptease theory then would it? I know I sound like an old man when I say this (I'm actually 16 :S) but I didn't like the use of CGI, the bit in the church was terrible! And a lot of the time it just thought it was too cool by trying too hard. Let's have a man jump out of a helicopter shooting zombies with cool music in slow motion. It's trying too hard and it just isn't ""cool"". Don't get me wrong, sometimes it was quite ""cool"" but most of the time they tried too hard.<br/><br/>In the end ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" plays out more as an action movie rather than a horror film. Leave the zombies to my Romero. There was plenty of shooting, but no blood. I like to see my zombie films gory and scary. Believe or not however, I did actually enjoy some parts. I don't think I'd be the only person who rolled my eyes at some ridiculous B-movie machine gun wielding monster in a leather jacket. Was I?"
"jboothmillard","1","2","5","6 April 2007"," Resident Evil: Apocalypse
","The first film based on the popular survival horror video games series was great, one of the only good films in fact based on a video game, but this sequel, the first of many to follow, is absolute trash. Basically it picks up where the first film left off, well, just before Alice (The Fifth Element's Milla Jovovich) left the hospital after those experiments, and Raccoon City has been closed for risk of the T-Virus infection getting out. Within the city, along with Alice, are other survivors, in Lara Croft get-up Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt) and L.J. (Mike Epps), but of course they are surrounded by the bloodthirsty undead also. The only person who can help them get out is the creator of the T-Virus, Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris), who makes them a deal to get them out if they find his surviving daughter, Angie Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur), she is the little girl that appeared previously as the artificial intelligence hologram image of The Hive. The villain is a very stupid German or something, and he has his own creature called Nemesis carrying high-tech weaponry, you find out that the creature is in fact the only other survivor from the first film, Matt Addison (eric Mabius) transformed. Jovovich is still cool, and continues in all the films to follow, and you can't complain about the makeup or some of the twists, but the stunts and most character dialogue is ridiculous, and it is not as fast-paced as the original zombie movie, in its entirety it is just a bad science-fiction horror sequel. Very, very poor!"

","Resident Evil was an enjoyable Zombie blasting piece of cheese. Now we are faced with the Sequel apocalypse and it really isn't up to scratch. The action sequences may be well constructed and the lighting throughout is perfect, but apart from that its a confused and thin adventure. The story involves a good many Zombies and a rather unimpresssive super villain so you can imagine its pretty predictable. Milla Jovovich reprises her role from the original and to be honest I cant remember anybody elses face. The acting is rather atrocious with Milla Jovovich simply doing a bad Angelina Jolie impression. The rest of the cast are feeble acting talents and that little girl is simply annoying. There are several attempts at jokes throughout the film but none really wash. The worst of them involve Zombie prostitutes. There is nothing scary about the film either. The first had a couple of chilling points but this film, is a wash with mild peril and no gore to speak of. When it comes to these kinds of sequels its always best to save the money and this movie doesn't change that point of fact."

","The game is great because you follow a single characters attempt for survival. The character is not a superhero (Alice), but is a human and therefore we relate to her feelings more. The film annoyed me because we follow several characters at once. I would of much preferred to follow the journey of perhaps 2 characters, to bring back the essential survival element. <br/><br/>The zombies were unbelievably crap. They clearly targeted this game at young teens (who would rather watch gory, sick and disturbing zombies anyway). Another indication of this was the cheesy rock music and 'kick ass' scenes. <br/><br/>If they had actually tried to make this film frigging scary, it would of been so much more successful. And why did they desert the creepy mansions? The settings in the games were so important in making it scary, which was completely ignored in the films. <br/><br/>Imagine being in the cinema, watching this bloke/girl walking around in this big twisted mansion, encountering or hearing these foul zombies. Well use your imagination, I'm sure those that have played the game kinda know what i mean.<br/><br/>It had potential. It could of been the scariest thing ever.

There is a big monster in the church. It is obvious they are going to die... But wait, out of *nowhere*, Milla Jovovich comes jumping through the stained glass windows, on a motorcycle, she flies though the air (in slo-mo of course), lands, pulls the bike to a tight stop, pulls out her mega-super-shottie and blows the monster to pieces... Then one of the occupants of the church (the ""chick with a 'tude"" caricature) goes up to Milla Jovovich and says 'Who the f*ck are you?'.</li></ul><br/><br/>Come on! There was nothing leading up to this scene, no explanation of where she got the bike, how she managed to find a ramp up to the glass stained window 10 feet high on the church wall, how she knew the monster would be there at that exact point in time etc. It was perfect example of pointless, poorly executed action that was supposed to look cool. And that line 'Who the f*ck are you?'... Who put pen to paper and thought, 'yeah that will be a cool end to that scene'? Dim witted stupidity.<br/><br/>Watch that scene (or do yourself a favor and don't) and if you say it is cool I am sorry to inform you that there is a big chance that you are not functioning properly at one, or perhaps many levels. If there is such a thing as universal appeal and beauty then this scene is its anti-thesis. I have not felt such pain since I saw Winona Ryder 'act' in Alien 4.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Zombies are sometimes extremely fierce and can hardly be put away with automatic weapons. However this does not prevent our protagonists from occasionally engaging in martial arts hand-to-hand combat with the zombies, even though they have automatic weapons readily available!!!! Pleeeeease. I don't ask for much when I rent a horror flick. I am willing to check my sense of logic and disbelief at the door but there are limits!

","I'm a fan of the games who liked the first movie. But man, how I hate this sequel. Everything that made the original so good has been either ruined or ignored here. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is more a video game than a real movie. 'That's what it's supposed to be' you may say. Well, the problem is that any of the RE games has a better story, better direction and even better acting than this boring mess.<br/><br/>RE: APOCALYPSE is basically a series of unexciting and badly shot action scenes loosely joined by a paper-thin story. There is no lack of character development here, if only because there are no characters in this movie, just cardboard cut-outs. The actors do what they can with what they are given, but you never get to care much for any of them. Milla Jovovich looks very hot again, but she seems to be sleep-walking most of the time, in spite of all the action stuff. The rest are more or less serviceable except for Mike Epps, who is deeply annoying as the supposedly funny black token character/comic relief.<br/><br/>If you thought Paul W. S. Anderson was a bad director, you are going to miss him here. Alexander Witt's direction is so bad that he makes Michael Bay look like James Cameron. Apparently, he's one of those guys who think that an action movie must be a 90 minute-long video-clip. He keeps using bad post-production slow-motion and awful editing techniques to make sure that you can hardly tell what's going on, specially during the non-stop action scenes. And just in case that's not enough, there are moments when, for instance, tenths of zombies suddenly teleport into an empty room to kill a disposable supporting character.<br/><br/>As I said, the plot is basically non-existent, in part because the movie feels very choppy. The (so-called) characters keep showing up in different locations, but we hardly see how or why they got there. We aren't even told how some of them escaped from a church surrounded by hordes of undead. After all, that's not necessary, because the makers of this movie assume that their target audience is made up of people who turn off their brains and become zombies the moment they step into a movie theater. But you know: Suspension of disbelief is one thing; brain damage is something entirely different. The former makes you accept that the dead may walk, the later forcefully feeds you with everything else in this movie.<br/><br/>In short: If you liked the original, you'll be disappointed with this sequel (to say the least). Unless, of course, you are one of those guys who only care about hot babes kicking ass and think than people like me are stupid film critic wannabes. If not, see the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake instead. It's the same, but good."

","PLOT SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Does anyone else here think that Paul Anderson should be handing in his P45 right about now? With the exception of AVP and Event Horizon this man should be hung for war crimes against the film industry. OK so he may not have been in the director's chair for this one (not that it would have made much of a difference anyway) but his screenplay is anything but inspired or original.<br/><br/>But he isn't the one who should be taking all the blame for this piss poor travesty. First time director Alexander Witt, although having a better knowledge of what it takes to make a better movie, has barely improved on the original, and considering what a mess the first one was you would have thought it'd be quite simple to make a superior sequel. Well apparently it ain't as easy as it looks.<br/><br/>As with every bad movie the acting is appalling so i wont even bother wasting my breathe givin it an earful although Sienna Guillory looks stunning as Jill Valantine. The main flaw in this film is the pacing and the god awful clich√©s that just come at you again and again and again. Mr Anderson claims, so passionately, that he is a huge fan of the games. so why, in all you mystical wisdom, did you choose to have the Nemesis have a sympathetic streak? Why did you take one of the most terrifying characters from the game and turn him into a hero at the end of the movie? He'd better have a damn good reason to justify that.<br/><br/>The timing and the overall pacing of this movie is terrible. rather than use the psychological fear that the games thrived on this movie opts for full on jump tactics every single time. OHH scary. Watch me quiver in my shoes.<br/><br/>The movie starts off well enough. Sights of the town being over run were pretty cool, echoing moments of the far superior ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004). But after the movie builds the middle just lags. And then when the climax comes in, Witt chooses to unleash a string of dumb assed action scenes that never once get the adrenaline going. Add to the mix the turning of the Nemesis and you have yourselves a terrible movie.<br/><br/>The fact that it leaves it open for a third film is just upsetting. Leave where it is now. This franchise has done enough damage already.<br/><br/>1/5"

","You know, for once, i would like a movie based on something i hold near and dear to my heart to be made with some dignity and respect.<br/><br/>Yet, this still hasn't come true.<br/><br/>I went into Resident Evil 2 with low expectations. After seeing the first one, and it being HUGE LET DOWN (im a fan of the games, hold em near and dear) Cinematicly, i didn't have huge expectations for this one. But, man, i never knew something could fall so hard, so fast.<br/><br/>Resident Evil 2 ( i not even bothing with the lame subname) Is at some times a cool movie. But those cool scenes are few and VERY FAR. The problem with the cool scenes is that it quickly becomes INCREDIBLY STUPID and LAME.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE (this might be a spoiler to some)<br/><br/>the characters are in a Graveyard. Zombies start coming out of the graves, there every were. The characters start pumping bullets into the zombies. When they start running out, Alice starts going Kung Fu on the zombies and Some how kills all of them by kicking and breaking their necks (which not only is stupid, but inconsistent, as it was laid out early on that the zombies can only be killed by a Wound I.E. a shot to the brain. You can snap their necks, but by all means, they should still be going)<br/><br/>Basically, its a poorly made film. Its not a Horror film by any means as there are little scares (the only one is a cheap SOUND scare when a tanker hits a car and it makes a loud ""BOOM"" in the theater) but it also is a very poor action film.<br/><br/>How so.<br/><br/>1. The make up effects are just god awful. Nemisis, who is suppose to be this UBER BAD ASS MONSTER, looks like a cheap holloween costume. When he first shows up, the make up looked fine, but towards the end of the film, it looks like the makeup artist simply gave up and just made a big mask for the actor to wear. That, and that Nemisis is suppose to be almost 8 foot tall, but in some scenes, he's barely over 6 and a half feet. The zombies are just plain crap. The ""NEW"" zombies, or just recently dead zombies, look like actors with powder sugar on their face. The old ones are OK.<br/><br/>2.The shotty editing. To much quick cutting in the wrong places, and its very over used.<br/><br/>3. The SCRIPT. This movie PROVES that Paul Anderson should NOT BE MAKING FILMS (or at least writing them) I mean, the man made Mortal Kombat 1, and he managed to get that right, so why cant he do it with this game, it should be so simple. Like every thing else of his after mortal kombat, it reeks of Horrible dialoge, Lame, halfed ass character who don't know what the hell their doing half the time except going around and trying to do something BAD ASS in EVERY SINGLE SCEEN that they are in. ALICE ( and i profess a love for Milla) is the WORST action star out there. She was good in 5th element, but the thing that made her good in that was she was hot and she said almost NO lines, especially in English. Jill and Carlos, after playing resident Evil 3 the game, its like shooting an arrow through my chest. Nothing good about them at all. All of the Dialoge is corny as hell (the one good line out the film that actually put a smile on my face was said by the token black guy who refers to another popular game)<br/><br/>So where to place the blame for his heap of a mess, PAUL ANDERSON. Man cant write, (watch Alien vs. Predator and tell me he can) the poor director of this garbage must cry at night for having to do this junk. Yet, the American Populace ATE IT RIGHT UP. So what dose that say, well it says America Loves Crap for Movies (how do you explain Fast and the Furious, or..You go Served *shudders* making $$$$) so of course, we'll see more of tripe like this. <br/><br/>Movies are dead.

"ajura2099","Null","2","5","11 September 2004"," He ruined another franchise
","There's only way to describe this movie- utterly awful. I found myself laughing through the whole thing since what was happening was completely ridiculous. I think they did every possible thing for this movie in the worst way, even the simple things.<br/><br/>First of all, the video games were great. They're classics, hense why Resident Evil was remade more than five years after its original release. I'm not an extremely creative person, but it wouldn't be difficult at all, even as an independent movie, to make an adaptation of the game. After all, isn't that what the point of making a Resident Evil movie is? If he wants to go on his own little suck spree with his awful ideas, why doesn't he leave Resident Evil out of it and make a completely different zombie movie?<br/><br/>Second of all, there are so many plot holes you're afraid to even wonder thinking you might get stuck with ridiculously abstract thinking (which is the only way to try to explain the things in this movie!). Jill Valentine, who was in the first two Resident Evil games and more, makes her first appearance with no background information. She walks into the police place in skimpy clothing and says, ""Shoot them in the head."" Everyone listens. As the writer has obviously taken the very minimum from the Resident Evil storyline, you can't be left to believe she survived at a mansion in the outskirts of Raccoon City. So she must have had an epiphany when she awoke that morning (please prevent yourself from thinking of any other reason, you will have literally wasted a precious few seconds of your life). Not to mention that Alice somehow knows EVERYTHING about Nemesis (God forbid there be any purposely open-ended questions), Alice makes no sense, dead people in cemeteries somehow manage to get infected while six feet underground, some guy at the end is shot but randomly gets infected WITHOUT being bit, Nemesis and Alice have a Mortal Kombat style (no joke, it beings with some guy yelling ""FIGHT!"" and ending with him saying ""FINISH HIM!"" But it ended with Alice performing a Friendship instead of a Fatality), and for some reason zombies completely ignore important characters when they're making ""dramatic"" speeches. <br/><br/>Lastly, the acting and all around film work is completely awful. You'd like to see a zombie bite someone, wouldn't you? But because they had two thousand camera angles and some guy with Parkinson's disease was doing the film editing (in case you don't catch the pun, people with Parkinsons shake uncontrollably). That might also explain why the zombies move all slow, which is cool and freaky, but for some reason they DJ the film and make it go super fast, normal, then slow? This is the way it is for every action scene, as if they're trying to rush the movie so you won't have to sit through more of it. Not like the hand-to-hand fighting scene would be cool if you could see what was happening anyway. The acting is just awful. I don't know about anyone else, but I'd be a little freaked/emotional if everyone in my city was running after me to eat me. Not these people though, they act like they're just as calm as they would be at a photo shoot. Or hell if you saw your best friend get shot or eaten in front of you, that's no reason to show emotion...is it? <br/><br/>See this movie if you want a good laugh at how awful it is, or a good cry at how good the video games are and how this writer just ruined your dreams. The movie makes a mockery of everything it can possibly touch, including the scene where someone ""hacks"" into Umbrella by typing into his Vaio- ""open hack.exe"". Not to mention they completely screwed up on doing so many things. People that aren't bit turn into zombies. Windows are broken while driving a Harley through it, and somehow pieced back together and re-broken when the lamest scene I've ever seen in a movie occurs just seconds later. Nuclear missiles can be shot from helicopters and guided through city streets...right? I'd rate this as a 2/10, only allowing for a 2 because I did have a good laugh by the end. If you enjoy dropping empty water bottles onto the ground over and over again, you'll enjoy this movie, but only slightly."
"blairco","1","2","5","10 September 2004"," A waste of time and money that leaves you irritated
","I went into Resident Evil: Apocalypse with a keen sense of hope. The trailers, although never showing much, seemed to be innovative. It looked as though a good video game adaption flick would hit the theaters. I admit, I do enjoy the Resident Evil video games. However, I would like to point out that I am writing this as unbiased as possible. This movie blew me away. I was astonished. The fact that something so terribly put together somehow was greenlit by a production company, the fact that someone in a suit thought that this film was worth giving the go-ahead, it just shocks me. Let me tell you why I cannot stand this film. First of all, the plot is so transparent, it might as well be made of glass. The 'foreshadowing' is incredibly obvious, keeping you off the edge of your seat (not a good thing for a movie regarded as a Sci-Fi Thriller/Action - maybe a Drama or Romantic Comedy...). Although the concept of the Resident Evil series is unrealistic, this film has a plot that brings unrealism to an entirely different level. The overall impossibility of the plot is enough to keep you from getting into the 'cinematic illusion'. As for the characters and acting... Most actors involved in this movie just committed Career suicide. It shows their complete lack of aptitude. The worst part was that most characters had fake accents that were so poorly done, and accents are normally given to characters to add dimension. This took dimension away, and made me care less and less about their characters. We're treated to slaughtered British, French, Russian, and German accents. There was one hope for this movie: The Computer Graphics. And they were terrible. Perhaps I'm spoiled off Star Wars graphics, but if you are going to put CG in a movie, at least do a good job about it. This movie was not worth $7.50 at my local cineplex. But if you don't believe me, find out for yourself."

","There was a time, long, long ago when the Silver Screen was reserved for for classics, for art, for the Golden Age of Hollywood. Those days are long gone. But at least movies had that special time. Video Games will never be regarded in this way. No matter how realistic and frightening the Resident Evil games can be the world of gaming will never be able to shed the geeky image of friendless, degenerate nerds playing for 11-hours straight. There's no glamour or admiration to be had here. And with the worlds of movies and video games merging closer and closer together (whether we like it or not) we can only expect a Sonic the Hedgehog live action movie soon (and some studio exec will probably cast Ben Affleck in the title role). I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but, when you think about it...not really. We've already had a Super Mario Bros. movie and Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Alone in the Dark.<br/><br/>The first Resident Evil movie was no classic that's for damn sure but it's still a far superior film to this drek. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is so wantonly awful it's almost on par with House of the Dead. No joke! These zombies are not scary! At all! Dawn of the Dead this ain't.<br/><br/>For an R-rated movie the violence is blurred and confusing, why even bother with the swearing if that is really all that is keeping it from being a PG-13? It's shot and cut with no skill whatsoever. The plot makes no sense at all and there are frequent gaps in logic that even the most ignorant viewer can point out. Like why do the long-dead people in the graveyard (conveniently buried underneath only a few centimetres of loose dirt) suddenly come back to life when the T-virus is only supposed to be transfered through blood infection? And that was only just one part of a 'plot' that was constant nonsense. And by the end it was so far removed from the (better) story of the video games that the 'Resident Evil' title is really no more than a way of selling nonsense to people who expect and deserve something else.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the characters! All I can say about them is that they might as well have been polygons. I know I'm not being really original when I say this movie is like watching a bunch of cut-scenes from a video game but...it is. It is totally NOT worth your time or money. Do not even give in to curiosity.<br/><br/>The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and (my version had) Dolby EX/DTS ES 6.1 sound. Plus a bunch of extras I care not for."

","Milla Jovovich is back as Alice in this pedestrian sequel to a pedestrian original. Alice breaks from her hibernation to walk into Raccoon City amidst all the turmoil going on in a city ravaged by a disease turning the dead into fighting machines. The Umbrella Corporation manages to close the city gates and has plans to test its newest creation/invention/experiment Nemesis. What takes place? You know the drill: lots of killing, outlandish, excessive special effects, lots of high kicks and stand offs between Nemesis and Alice, Diogenes holding a lantern looking for a real actor and coming up short, and the thinnest, most threadbare plot imaginable. I didn't like Resident Evil uno, and I found dos to be void of any of the few merits the first one was able to extol. At least in the first one, director Paul Anderson was able to create some menace and mood - as if a real threat was going on. This director, Alexander Witt, fails to achieve that. This film is loaded with clich√©s from the opening scene to the very end. I again will say that it has a nice look to it but is void of any, and I mean any, real substance whatsoever. Not letting Anderson off to lightly, he wrote this vacuum of thought."

However much I lament the fact that the film didn't make more of such plentiful opportunities to provide something a little more unsettling, and a lot less laughable - there remain FAR too many irritations, clich√©s and oversights to make this even watchable, never mind enjoyable. I'm pretty tolerant when watching movies, and will endure even the worst film in order to get the straight story, but RE-Apocalypse is the CLOSEST I've ever come to turning the DVD player off midway through, which is of course, an unspeakable crime, reserved for only the worst films known to man! Such a shame, I had such high hopes for it."

","Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Hollywood you are doing it all wrong again. This isn't a proper suspense-movie. New characters are thrown in this movie every minute, they mention there name only once, then they instantly get killed and are already forgotten a second later. The only two characters the viewer could possibly care about are Alice and Jill Valentine. And the Jill character is hardly developed and enters the film without the right introduction.<br/><br/>Now every good filmmaker knows that building the suspense during the film will give maximal impact at the end. Obviously these guys don't know. Already the first two minutes I see zombies running down the street killing of people. Cops pumping 200 rounds of ammunition into the zombies bodies and there are explosions everywhere.<br/><br/>And what is the deal with all those curse words. Don't they have any idea that kids will watch this trash to. I thought Hollywood made all audience movies these days. A PG-13 rating would give us a movie just as bad as the R rating gave us.<br/><br/>But the real problem with this movie is the editing. This is by far the worst editing I have ever seen in a film. The scene at the graveyard where Alice and her mates get harassed by zombies who come out of the ground is horrendous. The fight scene here is about a one-frame cut. The camera constantly moves real fast, and you can't recognize any moves or any of the characters who are executing them. But if you thought that this scene was bad just wait for the fight between the Nemesis and Alice. Boy what were the director, cameraman and editor thinking here. Probably 'I get paid anyway so what the hell.'<br/><br/>Admitting that I saw a 'making of' on TV before I went to the theatre, you might think they warned me enough to avoid this porker. But no I was stupid enough to pay 10 hard earned Euros. To keep you from making the same mistake, I will give you some words of advice:<br/><br/>This movie is a complete waste of money and time. Roger Ebert wrote: 'I you meet anybody who likes this movie, don't let them date your children'. I couldn't agree more. The first Resident Evil wasn't a masterpiece, but compared to this joke it could have been a multiple Oscar winner. Avoid this one at all cost except if you are contemplating suicide!"

","I read many times in several reviews that fans of the game series would love this film. I can't see why. One cannot create that 'survival horror' environment into such films (don't bring '28 days later' in comparison) and thus one, a fan of the games or not, should watch this film keeping no presumptions in mind. I was disappointed in doing that.<br/><br/>The prequel had a provocative ending, giving rise to several interesting possible ideas in my mind, thanks to the fact that I'm an avid fan of the games myself. But little could I predict about this noisy, baseless, cheap action extravaganza. There are only characters taken from the game, nothing else. The premise was good, but the results aren't. Introduction of Nemesis could have been avoided, because he is simply wasted here. Most of the action sequences come suddenly, without any link to the story. And to tell the truth, there is no 'story' involved, just an excuse.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich is not as spicy as she was in the first movie. Sienna Guillory as Jill is good. Perhaps she is one thing that perfectly matches with the game. The other characters are not worth mentioning. There are some good moments in the film, like the ending, or the incident in the school, but all over I think the first one was better. The movie leaves a chance for a third part, I am not sure if that's a good thing for us.<br/><br/>The bottomline: watching it in a theatre is inadvisable. The DVD should come out soon.

I found it hard to believe grown adults had produced something so bad.<br/><br/>My main problem was the sheer number of characters we are expected to keep track of given their limited screen time, and the fact that the first half of the film skips around all over the place. We had Jill Valentine, her partner (can't remember his name), some reporter woman (cant remember her name either), some stereotypical wise cracking black gangster and a building full of STARS members . Then there was the Umbrella soldiers with European sounding names (3 of them I think), Alice, the Nemesis, The evil boss (complete with bad German accent), The mad professor and his daughter. most of these characters are running around Racoon City, trying to find the mad professors daughter in order to bargain a safe route out (or hinder the efforts of those that are). There is no sort of character development to at least clue us in on their backgrounds or motivation, let alone even care when they get killed!<br/><br/>Another problem I had was that the zombies (which should be the main point of the film) seem almost peripheral - there is no sense of horror or dread in any of the zombie scenes. <br/><br/>The plot is so rushed and patchy that all we are left with are a collection of clich√©d action set-pieces that could have been from any John woo inspired action film from the last few years.

","They had a hit with the first movie! It was actually good! But did they decided to build off the tension and intrigue: No! RE2 proved to be another in the long line of tired sequels, a killshot to the head and to the hearts of those that liked the original. Maybe Paul W.S. Anderson should have directed this movie (of then again, maybe not: AVP stunk). The energy, the darkness, the distinct flavor of the first film were no where to be seen, for instead, they were replaced with random action sequences and useless dialogue. <br/><br/>That was just one of the many downfalls of the entire movie. It was all action, no suspense. It was completely contradictory to the first movie, even if it is following the games scripts more closely than ever. However, cannibalization of a lot of good ideas shouldn't be set aside to help bolster the street cred with those that play the game. In all, this movie needed a major overhaul, and no one seems to be up to the task to keep this franchise moving."
"wgeddings","2","2","6","27 September 2004"," Not a very good movie
","I normally love sequels and love movies based on video games or comics when they are done right. They should be able to get continuing viewers as well as new viewers involved with the story and up to speed quickly then move ahead. This movie does neither of those. <br/><br/>The movie starts out pretty good but then it becomes very confusing, very quickly. Characters are introduced with no explanation and often with no rationale. Jill Valentine is a character who seems to have been introduced solely to give another sexy woman a reason to strut around in a very skimpy dress (not that I am complaining). I gathered she was an off duty cop but why would she strap her guns on and put on her boots but not take time to put on a shirt or pants? Wouldn't that shoulder holster start to chafe bare shoulders? How did she know to immediately start shooting zombies in the head? Maybe there was something in the original but I sure don't remember it or remember her character. <br/><br/>Alice is yet another example of the movie makers trying to find ways to put her in skimpy outfits then trying to come up with a reason. They did not try very hard to get a reason. She is shown nearly nude or nude more times than is necessary (again, not that I am complaining - though I will admit that her nude is not as good as skimpy clothed in the right clothes..). <br/><br/>The camera work also distracted more than added to the movie. I do not understand the overwhelming desire of so many directors to shoot with handhelds and use jerky pictures. It makes me dizzy and almost always just confuses the scene. If confusion were the real desire, maybe it would be okay but when you have paid for lots of special effects, you want the audience to see them I would assume. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is mostly a few thoughts that are pieced together with the flimsiest of threads. There is no explanation for why Raccoon City has a wall all the way around it. The end of the movie is an obvious attempt to set up another sequel but that is a sequel I hope is never made if they cannot do a better job than this one."
"Stokley316","2","2","6","19 September 2004"," Awfully Cheesy
","I must say that I will not be terribly upset if Paul Anderson never writes another movie so long as I live. The screenplay was incredibly cheesy!!! The characters often explained what was going on through dialogue rather than expressing what was happening through action. It was also very vague about explaining what was going on in the storyline. On the upside, the movie had a good Director of Photography. They did a great job of acheiving the right look and mood of Resident Evil. Also, I thought that the part of Jill Valentine was very well casted, she looked a lot like Jill. However, they really should have gone into why Jill knew so much about the Zombies already and explain her backstory, because it sort of leaves a blank space for non-fans of the game."
"Darkside-Reviewer","6","1","2","22 April 2019"," It all should have ended here
","The first Resident Evil movie was controversial for a number of reasons mostly due to the game franchises fans not happy with the direction taken for the movie myself included but seeing how it made money at the box office a sequel was inevitable fans had hope for it with the cast of characters being closer to the game but sadly it wasted them and kept the new character Alice as the movies focus.<br/><br/>Sadly this movie went further away from what fans wanted so much so that after this movie the rest would end up being made up of action and zombie movie tropes with Resident Evil as it's name but that's as close as they ever got to the game franchise.<br/><br/>Admittedly this is a good action movie with zombies and it is action packed and gun heavy with plenty of blood and fight scenes which does entertain for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie if your in the mood to turn your brain off for a while and watch a good action movie that doesn't require to much thought just a fun hour and a half of guns and zombies."

On her route to try and get out the city, she comes across other bands of survivors and they join forces to try and escape before the Umbrella Corporation resorts to extreme measures in ""cleansing"" the city. To do this, though, they first need to rescue the daughter of Dr. Ashford (the creator of the T-Virus) who is still within in the city limits. This will be made all the more harder, however, as the Umbrella Corporation have sent in a formidable opponent to stop them...Nemesis.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a pretty decent sequel to the enjoyable Resident Evil movie, and is made much more enjoyable with the introduction of Nemesis. Thankfully, Nemesis makes more than just one solitary appearance as he is such a formidable character & presence (just like Pyramid Head in Silent Hill), and I'd maybe go as far as to say that if it wasn't for that character then the movie may have lacked a wee bit even with all the other action.<br/><br/>The action in the movie is pretty relentless from start to finish with a good few impressive action scenes, two of which being the church scene involving Alice and three Lickers, and the action following the scene where Alice runs face first down a 200 foot building.<br/><br/>The story line continues on from the 1st movie, but never really develops much until the final few scenes which lead onto the 3rd film, so don't expect much from this sequel story-wise.<br/><br/>The acting is a wee bit dire in some places, mainly from Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine, but thankfully it's not bad enough to actually throw you off from watching the film.<br/><br/>All in all, like I say, this is a decent sequel and even if you're not familiar with the game series, it's still an enjoyable action flick."

She is literally a one woman army, and her skills are impressive. Milla's character is bent on accomplishing one goal: Destroy the Umbrella Corporation. She exits the Raccoon City hospital and seizes a police shotgun out of an abandoned squad car, and begins to walk down the street littered with cars and other vehicles wrecked and destroyed. Meanwhile, Jill Valentine, a sexy and deadly STARS cop played by Sienna Guillory, is on alert as well, taking the initiative and shooting the zombies in the head. She and her partner are at the only exit from the city when a man becomes one of the walking dead and the gates are closed, sealing the city from the outside world. Oded Fehr and his team of commandos are pinned down by zombies and soon realize no help is coming. Jared Harris as Dr. Ashford has only one priority, to get his daughter out of the city. This film is as good as the first and perhaps a little better. Tina Gerussi and Robyn Ray deserve exceptional mention for their casting.

","First let me be honest, at first I was kind of scared with the Resident Evil films, I mean with all of them, I saw the trailers but I was never brave enough to go and see them until I played Resident Evil 4, which I totally enjoyed, after this I decided that I was going to watch the films. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was the first one I watched before the first and before the third, and I think It was better this way because thanks to Resident Evil 4 I knew the story of Raccoon City, the incident, the outbreak, which are detailed in this film. Therefore as soon as I started watching this film I was familiar with the story.<br/><br/>Now lets go into the film. I liked it better than the first one which I watch after seeing this one. This film has more action, better effects, good acting, and it was a more suspenseful. I liked better the plot in this film, it was more exiting and this film is at least more related to the game having Nemesis, Jill Valentine, Carlos Oliveira, Raccoon City, the first one was only related because it had the T-Virus, and Zombies. Overall this film has better effects, a better plot, more horror, it kept me there interested from beginning to end, I always watch it on TV when I have a chance. Better than the first one and it is worth watching, it is really cool. The only thing that could be better is the adaptation of the characters from the game, they had to get actors that looked more like the characters or at least make the actors they have look more like the characters, but regardless of this it still is a great film. 8/10. Do not be scared to watch it, especially if you played the games."

","I'm a fan of the Resident Evil movies. They're clearly made by people who are not overly concerned with sticking closely to the video games, and I think that's a good thing. The series boils down to basically a few action flicks with a sprinkling of zombies and Milla Jovovich. <br/><br/>Apocalypse is pretty similar to the other two Resident Evil movies, only it's set in the same city that the second and third Resident Evil games are in. There are enough familiar names and cameos to keep fans invested in the plot and its hodge-podge of movie clich√©s. <br/><br/>As ridiculous as it is to see little, 100 pound Milla fighting a 400 pound monster or outrunning an explosion, it somehow works amongst all the other ridiculous stuff that's going on. I love all the casting, (except for the Mike Epps stereotypical character) and Jill and Alice are hot and tough enough to keep the movie interesting. Apocalypse is not frightening or mind-blowing, but I just can't help but enjoy a video game movie that is fun to watch."

","I have to admit, seeing this after seeing two really terrible sci-fi crapfests probably helped my opinion (The Black Hole and Supernova--low budget St. Louis gets destroyed films), but I really enjoyed this from start to finish.<br/><br/>One, if not the only, flaw in this movie for me was that you really would have to have seen the first one to get this one. They do a brief synopsis of the first one at the beginning (I assume that's why) but it's not enough to make up for not seeing the first one, so I advise seeing the first one before seeing this one.<br/><br/>This action packed movie has no boundaries on who it kills off, or how far it will go. Many horror movies are afraid of killing children, in this one a whole school of zombie kids is there, dead and ready to kill right along with their adult counterparts, brave and kick @$$ move by the directors.<br/><br/>Most zombie movies make the zombies unimaginably slow and extremely stupid, while both are true in some scenes, it's not true for the most part in this movie.<br/><br/>I still don't understand how the experiment zombie flesh mutating thing is in this movie since my understanding was it was killed in the first one, and it was a one-off failed experiment, now there's three of them and they are killed fairly easily. . .the learning curve of Alice seems to be phenomenal, partially forgivable by the whole additional experiments they do in-between movies (explained early on in the movie).<br/><br/>I realize that there may be some plot gripes on this one, but watch ""The Black Hole"" and ""Supernova"" from Sam's Club ""Sci Fi Four Pack Collectors Set"" and you'll have a hard time putting this movie down. For me, it was a welcome break from mediocrity, and heck--it's just fun to see zombie creatures shot in the head (you don't feel guilty for getting pleasure out of seeing dead walking things shot in the head) and women as the heroes (men still dominate the hero genre, so for me change is cool). Awesome, can't measure up to the original or the video game, but awesome."

","Picking up where ""Resident Evil"" left off, ""Apocalypse"" centers around the Umbrella Project and the Hive - the place where the T virus was unleashed, turning humans into the living dead. Umbrella decides to try to re-open the Hive, but the creatures escape and begin to wreak havoc on Raccoon City.<br/><br/>Alice (Milla Jovovich) from the first film is in a containment facility, and awakens to realize that she has been injected with the T-virus, but it had a different effect on her - she's not a zombie, but she has superhuman strength. She escapes and tries to find a way out of the city, along with police officer Jill (Sienna Guillory), Umbrella military man Carlos (Oded Fehr) and civilian L.J. (Mike Epps).<br/><br/>They find out from an Umbrella doctor that they're about to level the city, and the only way out is for them to find his young daughter who is trapped in the school, so they go find her. Meanwhile, Umbrella releases their most deadly agent - Nemesis - a huge hulking bulk who's part man, part monster, and is almost unstoppable.<br/><br/>Sure, there's not a lot of character development or worthy acting, but a movie like this isn't designed for that. It's designed to bring the audience some thrills and action, and it delivers in that aspect, because I was quite entertained.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich appears to be the new action heroine (like Kate Beckinsale and Angelia Jolie), but she's more underrated. She needs a film that both audiences and critics will hail as superior, and she'll finally receive the recognition she deserves."

Witt shows some flair with action sequences, some decent visual camera work, he manages to have an good cast here but although Witt isn't quite as strong a filmmaker as Paul W.S. Anderson (Which he wrote the script) did on the original. Witt uses too much of slow motion at times, especially when the Zombies shows-up. It seems very unnecessary, it has an very bad jarring feel to it and the sequel is clumsy at times. At least, the actors kept it entertaining for the right or wrong reasons. Since it has its shares of unintentional moments.<br/><br/>I have to admit, i hated this sequel. When i first viewed it on DVD back in 2004. I was expecting to be creepy as the original did but i didn't expect to be goofier in this one. I do like the idea in the sequel that the zombies and monsters are running around attacking the city. After just watching it again recently, i do enjoy a bit more than i first seen it. But the sequel is still an mess with an truly flawed third act and it has at least two endings in the feature. But although ""Resident Evil:Apocalyspe"" was an improvement over the second one, despite the characters of Jill and Angie are not in third film.<br/><br/>On the Resurrected Edition DVD, this film is a double feature with the original. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which the surrounds on the sequel are quite impressive at times, especially the Church sequence. On the second disc, there's an additional special features were not on the original 2-Disc DVD Set back in 2004. It would be nice, if the DVD included three running commentaries tracks but they didn't. This sequel is only for die-hard fans of the video game or the first film, although some will admit... this is pretty lame half of the time. Super 35. (***/*****)."
"absolutelylucid","9","1","2","22 May 2008"," Breaks the mold. By far the best out of the three.
","While I felt the first and third movies in this trilogy were entirely average, this second part of the trilogy is nothing short of excellent. Here's why.<br/><br/>This movie breaks the mold of survival horror movies. The usual formula places a group of characters together and kills them off one at a time over the course of the movie. In Resident Evil: Apocalypse, the story progression is much more open ended. We follow the stories of several different groups of characters in different parts of a city sealed off from the outside world to contain the outbreak of a virus. While many characters do die, in this case, it is happening to unique groups of people all making their own way to survive in a city over- run by zombies. Their story lines eventually converge of course, but the storyboarding developed to bring about this connection is stellar. As icing on the cake, all of these characters feel excellently cast and developed.<br/><br/>There are special effects in this movie, but they do not overpower the realism of human acting. The zombies, and most importantly, the Nemesis monster, are real actors in elaborate costumes and makeup. <br/><br/>The directing and set design are also excellent. This movie feels like a horror movie whereas the other two simply pass as alright action movies. The sets are intricately designed, with the very smallest attention to detail throughout. They are dark, filled with well placed streams of light and shadow, and dirty looking, in direct opposition to the clean, slick nature of the first movie. Everything really feels much closer to what the games envisioned in this outing. The directing is outstanding, filled with inspired camera angels, and the knowledge that true horror does not come from throwing scary beasts at us, but through the unknown about any scenario. The church scene is particularly inspired, giving us only the smallest glimpse of three attackers stalking the characters being portrayed. The level of suspense is masterfully built slowly to a climax around wonderful camera angels and the mood of the set. It is also no wonder why the acting in the movie feels so superb as well. It may not be the stuff of Oscars, but it is outstanding by action/horror standards. A great director can bring out the best talent from their actors and actresses. Another classic scene portrays frantic citizens of Racoon city trying to leave through the one exit in the barrier surrounding the city until one man at the front of the line succumbs to infection.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse is an A grade movie, and by far the best of the series. If only all three were this good, and the director of this movie had been brought back for the third installment. It isn't a perfect film, but it is excellent in all the most important places. If you only buy or see one movie out of this trilogy, see this one. It is expertly crafted."

","Resident Evil Apocalypse is many things. Pick a profanity, the choice is yours.<br/><br/>But from a more 'creative' perspective, Resident Evil Apocalypse is the sequel to a film based on a video game franchise based on a film series based on monsters based on humans.<br/><br/>But that's what we like to see - rehashes, only bigger and louder and faster, with bigger explosions, louder guns, and faster women.<br/><br/>I could rant all day about video-game-to-screen conversions, the most fundamental point being: in video game, the narrative is merely a backdrop for the gameplay - whereas in film, the narrative is paramount.<br/><br/>The story of Resident Evil was cack, but we didn't really take note at the time, busy as we were blatting our way through legions of the undead and solving stupid puzzles. On the silver screen however, the story is right out there in all it's nonsensical glory, only now the characters are sassy clich√©s, the zombies badly framed, and the once-terrifying Nemesis a rubbery, scary-as-kittens parody of his former self.<br/><br/>Still, you can't go wrong with a huge budget and an already-eager fanbase of teenage boys waiting to spend their cash to see zombies, tits and explosions.<br/><br/>But then, if there was no money in bastardising good ideas until every shred of intelligence and originality has been sucked away, we wouldn't have fast food.<br/><br/>Or Big Brother."

For instance they use guns all the time instead of DIY Tools. The DIY tools are much more realistic. One stupid thing is that one on one fights with zombies. Good in video games but stupid in films. I always taught the games story line was stupid. And thanks to the film it proved that i am right. What's the point on having a single company turning an entire city into a zombie infested city without the government knowing. Also it's a company with an entire army. The story also makes no sense.<br/><br/>Besides a few scenes to give you a little thrill nothing in the film will stop you from yawning and complaining.

","Resident Evil: Apocalypse starts as the Umbrella corporation opens up the secret bio-weapons research facility the Hive to try & discover what happened, all they succeed in doing is releasing the T-Virus & a horde of flesh eating zombies into Raccoon city... A few hours later & Raccoon city is overrun with zombies & genetically created mutations trapped there by a huge wall around the perimeter of the city, cops Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), her partner Peyton Wells (Razaaq Adoti) & a TV reporter Teri Morales (Sandrine Holt) are trapped in Raccoon city when Umbrella decide to close off the only exit out of the city & have to fight for survival with limited ammo. They team up with genetically enhanced babe Alice (Milla Jovovich) & strike a deal with Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) on the outside who says if they find his young daughter Angie (Sophie Vavasseur) who is trapped somewhere in Raccoon city he will tell them a way out...<br/><br/>This German, French, English & Canadian production was the directorial debut of Alexander Witt & is a decent action horror film but it could have been so much better. Based on the computer game series of the same name the script by producer Paul W.S. Anderson moves along like an absolute rocket, this film is literally none stop which is just how I like them but it lacks depth as the character's are very shallow & have nothing to them apart from their names & jobs, I also don't understand how Umbrella could erect a large wall around an entire city within hours as it seems impossible, the script wisely decides not to tackle this issue though. The basic plot is pretty good & I love the basic notion of a small group of human survivors having to fight off hordes of flesh eating zombies using their wits & whatever else they can find as it reminds heavily of George A. Romero's Dead trilogy & the fact that it's based on a popular computer game where the whole idea is to kill zombies & survive means there's a lot of potential here for a cracking horror action film. Unfortunately while I love it's pace, energy & style I hated the fact that it was so tame in the gore & violence department. I would say Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the least gory zombie film I've ever seen, the potential for an out-and-out blood fest is here, there could have been countless shots of zombies having their heads blown off as well as human victims being torn to pieces & eaten but strangely it's as if the makers wanted as little blood & gore as possible. Then there's the fact that about halfway through the zombies are almost completely forgotten about & don't really feature again, very disappointing. I hated the ending as well, it doesn't make any sense & it seems to set up an entire story which obviously comes to nothing because it finishes!<br/><br/>Director Witt does a good job, he keeps things moving along that's for sure & there are some cool action set-pieces here like motorbikes blowing up, Jovovich running down a building, fights with huge mutated monsters, explosions, shoot-outs & even a zombie dog attack but the lack of blood or any decent violence is just so distracting & disappointing. If this actually had balls & had lots of memorable gore scenes as well as the action & explosions Resident Evil: Apocalypse could have been brilliant as it is it's an average horror action film that's fairly forgettable. Looking at the rating for this film it's 'R' which really surprises me as there are a few bloodless bullet wounds, some martial arts fights, a few bloodless bites & a couple of severed hands & that's it. Why oh why didn't they just pile on the blood & gore? There's a nice feel to the film with suitably dark locations, there are some effective moments here & there as well like the school full of zombie children. I also have to mention Jill Valentine's kick ass outfit, even though it looks similar to Lara Croft's in Tomb Raider it's utterly cool & as a general rule I think more cops should wear outfits like it.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $43,000,000 this is well made with good production values, shot mostly in Ontario in Canada which was where the Dawn of the Dead (2004) remake was shot so if you notice they look very similar you know why. Oh, & for what it's worth Romero's Land of the Dead (2005) was also shot in Ontario in Canada, what is it with Ontario & zombies? The special effects are good & the big Nemesis creature looks pretty mean & nasty. The acting is alright considering the material at least the cast are easy on the eye.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse could have brilliant if it had gone flat out & been a gore-fest, as it is it's a mild horror action film that doesn't really stick in the memory that much apart from Jill Valentine's outfit. I will never understand the decision to make this film so kiddie friendly, it just doesn't make sense to me. Good but not great. A sequel to Resident Evil (2002) & followed by Resident Evil: Extinction (2007)."

Apart from these facts, there is no storyline. What really irritated me are the sound effects. They are about 10 times louder than anything else in the movie, making me grab the remote all the time to put the volume lower when there were explosions and then higher again so I was able actually to hear any voices. The person who mixed the sound effect must've been an amateur, a pro would've used a compressor/limiter to make the volume of the sound effects equal to the rest of the volume in the movie."
"solidchuck19","3","1","2","11 February 2007"," Anderson resumes failure
","After the first Resident Evil film, it was inevitable because of the low budget that a sequel was in the works. Whereas the first film was a prequel of sorts to the first game, this one is (I think) a story about Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Again, departing from the story of the games is an interesting choice, but when the source material is just so much better than what Anderson can come up with, you have to ask, why does he continue to do it? He can't write a script, or direct an action scene without stealing from something else - the way he keeps himself original is through terrible editing, I guess.<br/><br/>I give Anderson credit for at least putting some characters from the games onto the big screen. These include Jill, Carlos, Nicholai, the Nemesis himself, and a few others. Though of course, these characters are the same in name only, and stray far from what they were and should have been. Jill is now cocky and soulless, who can't take care of herself without the return of Alice, aka superwoman. Carlos does nothing important, and Nicholai, who was such a badass villain in the games, dies pathetically to a single zombie dog. Ugh.<br/><br/>Now, onto the Nemesis itself. The monster looked pretty good and I was happy that they kept him mostly as an elaborate costume rather than CGI. In the games, Nemesis was nearly invincible, only dying after sustaining massive damage from a giant RAIL GUN. (SPOILERS -Needless to say, Nemesis doesn't live up to his real strength, and dies in the worst fight sequence I have ever seen. You can guess who it's against.) END OF SPOILERS.<br/><br/>The film is badly paced, badly written, badly directed, badly acted, and it laughs in the face of all fans of the series. Paul W.S. Anderson resumes his failure, and he will continue to do so. As long as the people in charge at Hollywood fail to realize that a video game turned to film has real potential, other than slightly-better-than B-grade cinema, the video game movie will be forever wasted."

","Go figure, I first saw this movie on 9 / 11 ... what an omen ! Anyway, onto the movie. Here is what I liked about this movie. There are some elements to the game that they put into the movie, such as the shootout during the outbreak between the Raccoon City Police Department and the U.B.C.S. vs the Zombies. It was a great action sequence. The scares were pretty good. Mike Epps made the movie more fun for me ! My favorite line ""Shoulda told' me you got bit, mother f***er. I'm all hanging with you and s**t !"" Here's what I didn't like about the movie. When it comes to characters, the movie really didn't follow the game much. For instance, (now I am not being a sexist) Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) isn't supposed to be all that tough, Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) is supposed to be a cocky ""ladies' man,"" Nicholai (Zack Ward) is supposed to be a bad guy, and Nemesis (coulda been bigger) was specifically created to destroy only S.T.A.R.S. members. And speaking of S.T.A.R.S., there aren't supposed to be THAT many S.T.A.R.S. members.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a really great film (can't wait for Part 3), though it would've been better if they followed the game a little more."

","Resident evil apocalypse is an excellent movie. it contains enough violence and at the same time it has that little humor that a good movie needs, for example a malicious comments. Resident evil apocalypse is an excellent and well made mix between a really scary horror movie and an exploding action movie. Resident evil apocalypse is the goddamn best movie i've ever seen, it's the perfect movie for a video gaming teenager like me:D. The only negative whit this movie is that all the characters from the games isn't correctly made, like Nicholai, he is a large man shooting zombies whit a soft-air gun. One more of the bad things, is that this movie aren't based directly on any of the games, instead the director has taken some pieces from 2 or 3 resident evil games."

","I needn't add mine despite all of that but I will. Having caught only the ending of part one, I relied mainly on my imagination of the video game (and Resident Evil is one of my all time favourites) to guess what had occurred up until that point. Then came part two, which sort of recapped a bit of the part one so I was able to catch up. I was feeling too lazy to rent part one in essence. Anyways, part two begins with Alice being trapped inside a lab and being studied after most of her friends and confidants had been killed off in part one. They are not only studying her, they are building her up to be this sort of super soldier without her knowledge. After a few guards and scientists are killed off in the beginning during a botched mission to go study new phenomena, there's a security breech and Alice awakes from her coma. She quickly overpowers everyone around her and begins to try and escape. She is quick to realise that the undead have overpowered Raccoon city but that's the least of her problems. She soon realises that she will have to battle the evil Nemesis (which I have to admit is not half as scary as he appears in the games). She teams up with a few survivors (which include yummy Mummmy alum Oded Fehr playing one part of a team of soldiers sent to retrieve the trapped daughter of a prominent scientist, and an unrecognisable Sienna Guillory as the major Arse kicking Jill Valentine) who are trying to make their way to the Barrier city. It's En Route there that they encounter Nemesis ""Stars! Stars!"" who is hot on their tail."

"shadowkun980","4","1","2","22 February 2006"," not bad as an action movie, but horrible as a zombie movie.
","The movie wasn't completely bad, like I said, as an action movie, it wasn't bad at all. I really didn't like the fact that everyone was accurate with guns, except of course, the random police officers or soldiers. They couldn't even manage to hit one zombie. It also annoyed me that the STARS couldn't, or just didn't hit or aim for Nemesis' face. You'd think that they could, but they don't. They aim for his shoulder and chest. It's weird. LG was a humorous character, and the opening scenes weren't bad. The zombies however, were too fast, too intelligent, and they could walk up stairs with ease. The ending wasn't bad either. This movie 'just' held on to the video game series by a hair width. It was bad as a zombie movie. And I love zombies, zombie movies, zombie games, books, etc... so I cried after watching this. It was utterly disappointing. The first one was better."
"da_hamster","3","1","2","4 January 2006"," OK, but disappointing (NO SERIOUS SPOILERS)
","As a huge fan of the Resident Evil video-game series, i expected a lot out of the first resident evil movie, of course, only to be disappointed. The story didn't have anything to do with resident evil except from the mansion, and the lab (which was certainly not a complex named ""the hive"".) The zombie action was extremely boring, and the zombies just looked stupid, and as the gamers know, resident evil is all about the zombies. OK, since this is APOCALYPSE i wont talk more about the original movie..<br/><br/>OK. After being terribly disappointed by this movie, which i would say suits best for young teens who just told their friends that they just saw a great movie named Scream3, i heard rumors of a new resident evil movie. I searched google for pictures and found a couple of Jill Valentine. I found a few, and was not disappointed. Se looked just like the main character of the Resident Evil3: Nemesis video game. Soon i saw the trailer, COOL!! Nemesis!! i had to watch this movie. I couldn't wait: Raccoon city, zombie hordes, Jill Valentine, NEMESIS... wow, yet another disappointment. This movie WORKS as a brainless action horror, but if you are a huge fan of the games, or have seen a few monster-action movies before, you are gonna be really bored. Nemesis is like a doll, except from when hes walking. He ain't got a personality and is only using a ""minigun"" until a cheesy fighting scene at the end, with Alice, yes! Alice! Later in the movie she enters the scene matrix style and saves Jill and the others, shooting like a terminator. Shes obviously now a super-lady, programmed to ruin the movie, kick Jill aside and use kicks and macho comments instead of guns. Pretty much ruining the movie. Now its not even survival anymore, its catwoman in a zombie infested city, kicking every things ass... And the bad-guy from the game, is now a good guy, with the same name.. like that matters to fans.<br/><br/>But as i mentioned, if u haven't enjoyed the games, you will probably survive(unless you used up the last of your money on this). But if you want GOOD zombie action without wall-running and super-kicks, you should watch George Romeros zombie series, and the remake of dawn of the dead...<br/><br/>yes i know i write cheesy ;) but I'm not English"

","OK, I'm not going to explain the story add any spoilers or whatever.<br/><br/>Resident Evil is the massive game Franchise from ""Capcom"" It is one of my personal favourites, i was so excited hearing about the first Resident Evil movie.<br/><br/>When i saw it i felt that the whole Resident Evil Franchise got screwed over. I know Game to movie tie in suck, i mean look at Super Mario Bros or Tomb Raider, those films suck. Of course the first Resident Evil movie had to follow this bi-law It's like the unwritten rule of Game to Movie But Resident Evil:Apocalypse really did appeal. I thought it was awesome and Did Resident Evil justice My favourite Characters from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, had made it onto the big screen playing alongside the ever so hot Milla Jovovich.<br/><br/>The story is actually getting interesting but the shame is that most of the main characters from the games arn't in it. Albert Wesker is most important but he is still absent. Hopefully Afterlife will bring more of the characters from the Game world into the Movie.<br/><br/>I do think it deserves a 10 because of the awesome stunts and action, also the costume design on the Nemesis was right on the money. Hopefully afterlife will prove even better than Apocalypse."

And this is just stupid it reminded me of what a complete lack of direction looks like.The story was complete lunacy delivered horribly by people who i have seen acting before just not here. Some would say that that was not the point it was only to be entertained well i was not the fight scenes were stupid and poorly edited. They also did not show a lick of originality, wow skeletons popping out of graves followed by a close-up of a worm crawling through a skull. The fight at the end was so tightly edited i could not see a single move. As Milla Jovovich who now has super powers kills random people in black body armor, i too feel like i have cheated. This movie fails on every level."
"owen_twistfield","6","1","2","20 October 2005"," Could this movie have been better I wonder?
","An average 5.7? Could this movie have been better I wonder? Well it is though. The challenge is that the movie is both a sequel and an adaptation of a video game. The latter actually goes with a note: I suspect RE to be an sort of adaptation of night/dawn/day of the living dead. This being said I laid bare one of main weak points: human flesh eating zombies. They are so run-of-the-mill you need a good twist to make the audience raise an eye lid. However, the movie hardly makes an effort to do so. <br/><br/>But how do those other guys do it? Romero uses gross shock effects with twisted humor in his (living) dead movies. Neither of these are abundance in this movie. Carpenter uses desperation and a feeling of weakness and insecurity(the thing). These are only vaguely used. Some stories rest on the sadness in losing people(Stephen king: Salem's lot). Well on rare occasion we see people being interested in the fate of others. (Who is that guy over there being eaten alive? Oh him, just one of my fellow troopers.) Some use a joyful almost childish humor (lost boys, fearless vampire killers). But this is not to be seen here. Some use the clean inhuman chilliness of advance science (Ash(the robot) and Mother(ship's computer) in Alien, HAL2000(ships computer again) in Space 2001). We are missing that here too. It looks to me that almost that the writer(s) and director shy away of going one step further. To make the movie stand out, to make it a little bit more interesting. The result is a fast paced action movie with though people and lot's of explosions and guns, zombies, some other monsters and evil scientists. And it's not strange to do so: this way you aim at the most people and it's the safest bet on a wide sale.<br/><br/>Could the movie have been better? I imagine it could have been, with more sick humor, and more chilliness and more feeling. A slight change of the script. It might have resulted in a 7 and from the IMDb audience that is quite lot.<br/><br/>Owen"

","I can recall the first time that I watched this film, that it was quite frightening for me, but soon after watching it, I wised up and realized that it was a rollicking good time, chock full of killings, destruction, a set of trigger-happy characters, and evil dead with no remorse. This film centers around Alice, the former head of security for Umbrella corporation, the corporation that is the biggest for anything in the world. <br/><br/>It seems that Umbrella, with their many areas of marketing, decided to test a new form of biological warfare, which killed many people, with the exception of the not exactly staying dead... With this, Alice was a survivor of this heinous disease, and set out to kill the evil dead, but while she did, more infected people came about killing more people, and with this, armed survivors had set out to get out from the city chock full of the evil dead, lest they get destroyed with the undead populace when it gets ""wiped clean""<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very good movie!

The atmosphere, acting and cinematics don't compare.<br/><br/>They took you away from the resident evil franchise, gave you a female character and several other people you don't know, and just made an action movie, with poor acting for the most part.<br/><br/>Resident Evil has always been, At least two main characters who are usually in abandoned castles, trains, or houses with a slow pace and a strong suspense that something could burst out, come alive or swarm you in groups. Where as this movie was basically, too many extra's who were given make up to look like they are gray, with maybe a hole in there head, or a gash....who just flail around as they slowly walk up to you. I did not like how they portrayed the undead. They were too human, and too cheesy.<br/><br/>I think they could of really done a better job at making this movie a scary thriller like resident evil was supposed to be, rather then a non stop action movie with too many swear words.

She must fight with others to escape not only the zombies but The Umbrella Corporation's cover up and a super-zombie called Nemesis.<br/><br/>Althoug the movie was not very well made, it was still very entertaining. I really didn't see any artistic value with the way it was made but I did find the story(based from the games) very interesting and the special effects to be very well done. I don't understand how zombies could come out of the ground when you have to be bitten to be infected though! The Nemesis also looked extremely lame and I could do without the corny writing but besides all of those really cheesy parts, the movie would have earned a recommendation.

There was nothing to miss, even though some of the scenes moved faster than usual. However, the more you watch the movie, the better you'll understand it. The credit goes to Capcom games most definitely. They always make great games, and Screen Gems didn't let the audience down either. There were more zombies than usual but that doesn't matter, it made the movie more interesting. And I liked the part where Alice nearly put the guy's eye out with his own pen. Shows the meaning, ""Get the point?"" The news teams were complete idiots, they're giving praise to the evil corporation, and not the journalist. For shame.

"LaBella2615","8","1","2","11 September 2005"," Better than the first...
","Unfortunately, for me I am a Resident Evil nerd, housing all the games and the books! The original RE was good but not on a video game level. What I mean is, if someone never played Resident Evil I wouldn't tell them to see the original to understand why its so popular. It would appear that the creators of the movie were not gunning to make the first RE anything like the game but, just the idea so people could get a feel for the storyline. Regardless of this it was still a good movie. Its sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse in my opinion totally surpassed the first just because it WAS video game based. To me if your going to remake something esp. a video game it should be true to form and as ACCURATE as possible. For example, people who aren't die hard RE fans wouldn't know that yes, Sienna Guillory did look like Jill Valentine, however, Jill's hair was sandy brown not black. Jill didn't smoke, and she definitely didn't have ""Im a tough b*tch and I'm in charge"" attitude. Even in the 3rd game where Jill has been through this situation already she was never arrogant. I think they portrayed Jill that way and I didn't care to much for it. I know its Hollywood and things change for movies sake, but come on, you couldn't find a bottle of light brown hair dye? As for Carlos and Nicholai. Nicholai was in his fifties and Carlos was in his early twenties. Oded Fehr was to old to play the part of Carlos and Zack Ward to young to be Nicholai. Again I know that its a movie but this are little things that they could have gotten right.<br/><br/>Even though Alice (Milla) has absolutely no relation to the game what-so-ever her character brought so much to RE as a movie. Giving you a back story that definitely ""fits"" into the game world as a possibility allowing Alice to head the storyline. I love Milla and think she does an excellent job in both movies. If anything see this movie to watch Milla Kick A**! She definitely fits as a strong, powerful woman, but still feminine. They couldn't have casted anyone better for the part.<br/><br/>The biggest thing about this movie that would have MADE it for gamers was the ""Nemesis"" Any one who knows RE games immediately recognized this terror! They depicted the Nemesis to a T! It was incredible to learn it was an actual person in a costume! Everything from head to toe was absolutely perfect! They did an amazing job on Nemesis! Perfect! Overall, this one definitely went above and beyond the original. Mabe I just feel that way because this was the type of RE remake I was waiting for. Although I have to be honest. I would love to see them remake the 1st game! As accurate to the game as possible. Then, I would wowed! Bottom Line: See it, you won't be disappointed!"

Resident evil main characters should be always on the run saving each bullet as if it was the last one, with the only goal in their minds is to survive the blood thirsty zombies. No Miniguns, no Roketlauncher, no genetically engeneered hero, no choppers, no atomic bombs! Or...at least....don't call it Resident Evil.... because it insults its fans."

I don't follow the video game, so I don't know if this film is following the game story line, but I liked where the movie headed. Alice meets up with another hot bad *ss chick, Jill Valentine, and some STARS members as they fight to find a way out. They are given an offer by one of the Umbrella's scientists- if they find his daughter, they can escape on a helicopter.<br/><br/>During this time, Umbrella activates the Nemesis project, who turned out to be really cool. Nemesis is the guy from the last movie who's been turned into a monster. The monster makeup looked cool. My only complaint is the movie needed more Nemesis footage. The two fights between him and Alice were kick *ss. Who knew Milla could be so tough! And the ending just left me wanting more. Now there needs to be a third sequel. I want to know what happens when an evolutionized Alice leaves the city.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like horror and especially if you liked the first film, then this is a must see.

","Similar in science-fiction and horror themes as the first RE, but soooo much better in a way as an action-genre movie. It reminds the first part, but develops the plot a bit farther now that everybody's out (including the disease so remarkable in these movies) from the Umbrella corp. labs.<br/><br/>Otherways, a lot in common with other classic scifi-action movies like the Terminator or/and zombie-movie genre. The only thing I dislike in this movie is the way it is directed, like the director had lost his slightest ""sense"" of filming. The scenes are developed quite typically and the story goes on slightly boringly (but there's enough action to make us forget the details) and keep the film interesting.<br/><br/>Compared to the first part of series this is somewhat less notorious from its main plot but more ""entertaining"" in a way like most follow ups. Naturally, that's because it is probably made with more money, more effects, more acting, in short, more of everything. Fundamental question still remains... will anybody walk out from the theater alive?"

","I thought this movie was magnificent. It focused on how Umbrella dealt with the infection in it's sick way. It focused on why the T-Virus was created and who created it and who it was created for. It was gored action packed. Plus the fact that most of the actors did most of their own stunts is amazing and well appreciated and respected. It is also the first movie in history to have a helicopter gun used by the Nemisis. I believe this is an excellent movie and fully recommend it to all horror sci-fi fans. I feel all resident evil gamers,like myself, will be pleased with the outcome of this movie as they were with the first movie. The ending is open-ended, which I think is great cause it again leaves us with all sorts of questions, which leads on to RE:3."

","Where 'Apocalypse' fails, it delivers. I heard someone suggest a 'PG-13' would be favourable as a marketing suggestion, but thank god, that was shoved aside.

The action sequences deliver incredibly.<br/><br/>With no real motive but to get the zombies and humans fighting, the action starts unrealistically but manages to hold the attention. On occasion, this manages to be cool, though the flaws are so unbelievably obvious it seems credit to the director to even pretend they're not there. To much detail is unnecessary, and will probably prove notice to how bad this is.<br/><br/>And though the script is simply silly Mike Epps is great to add comedy to the supposedly 'scary' backup. Some of the characters decisions are so utterly ridiculously unexplained it turns into unintentional comedy. The characters have no motives: they're doing the script, nothing more.

Some parts are bad, like the Lickor's skin, but I'm glad they are back. The graveyard part was just stupid. It has humour in it, JD seems to be in there just to be funny. The zombies have multiplied, and Alice, Jill and the crew are always trying to avoid them, but thanks to the addition of Angie, the film seems to make the T-Virus a thing to fear, its a great film, watch it for a good night of moderate horror, in fact, watch Resident Evil 1 and 2, make your judgement, and let everyone know it."
"au_law2001","5","1","2","22 April 2005"," I still say they should've sticked with Romero's version
","I've seen this recently and I must say it was a bit of an improvement but not that good, because was too much action and face-paced thriller than horror, at least they put a few lickers, and perhaps the only things I found worthwhile in this movie is that it had some characters similar to the ones in the game, it had Nemesis(except he also had a chain-gun), and it had Jill Valentinte, Carlos, Nikolai, but Ashford was a bit different. And at least Nemesis was almost the same as he was in the game, but my complaints are also that Nemesis was a bit of the hero at the end and that other STARS members like Chris, Barry, Rebecca, Brad, and Wesker weren't in it, and there weren't enough monsters and they didn't deliver enough fear. But overall it was okay as a sequel but lousy as an adaption and horror."

","this movie was excellent storyline was very good cant stop watching the movie sienna guillory was probably the most sexiest girl playing Jill Valentine.It contained more better graphically pictures and this time it was based on the city , raccoon city. Overall i rate this film 10/10 it was superb. It took nearly 1 year to make the film so you can see they spent a lot of time and money to make the viewers like the movie and i think they have succeeded in that. Personally the whole overview of the movie mixed in with the game so when you are watching it your like ""wow i was there in the game"" so the director was thinking a lot. Well done guys i hope there's another resident evil coming out soon:)"

","Okay, when I heard about the first part, I heard that none of the characters in the game were going to appear, and a lot of fans complained about it, and I must say, I'm a die hard fan of RE and I didn't felt that way, because if either Chris, Jill, or other character appeared i knew that they couldn't die. So i was very happy with this.<br/><br/>The first one was more like the first game of RE: atmospheric, creepy and with good horror, I liked it very much, and when I learned that Nemesis was the theme of the sequel I was anxious to see it.<br/><br/>Now I have seen it, and it applied the same ""rules"", while the first and (a little) the second were horror games, the third, ""Nemesis"" was more like a action game, no horror, no suspense, just action. I'm not saying I didn't liked the game, in fact, it's in my top ten of my list, but somehow I knew the second RE was going to be like the third game, and let me say, I wasn't disappointed, it was like seeing the game, the action, and Jill, who kept me drooling the entire movie, was a very good addition. So, if you want to see the same story, same characters, the same thing, then play the game! If you want to see something different, watch this, you'll be pleased :)"

","Okay, let's start by saying that the movie has a great premise: Evil corporation builds its own town, accidentally turns everyone in the town into zombies, and then decides to use the accident as a free research opportunity. Let's also say that in theory black, unmarked SUV's going into pleasant suburban neighborhoods and picking up high-level employees and their families is cool/creepy, as is the idea of the city being locked-down for quarantine. All right, all the legitimately interesting points of this movie are on the table.<br/><br/>Now let's say that the acting is atrocious, the special effects are a cheesy, the ""bad-assedness"" of the slick production is over-the-top and hilarious, the editing is jarring and commercial-fast, and the movie pays tribute to its video-game roots with silly characterization, techno-infused action set pieces (which weren't part of the Resident Evil video games to begin with), and acting - at least on Sienna Guillory's part - that is taken straight from a video game character.<br/><br/>Watching this movie, any number of questions spring to mind, like: Why is Jill Valentine wearing stiletto heels in her first shot? If the mansion incident just took place, how was there time for her to - evidently - learn about the zombies and be disciplined for killing them? How did the movie manage to foul up the prospect of a school filled with zombie children and render them totally un-scary? Why, if they had zombie dogs, did no one spring off a wall and kick one Matrix-style? And why does anyone think it's a good idea to fight flesh-eating zombies in tight, revealing tops? For that matter, why are all of Umbrella's special-ops soldiers Russian (I realize this is taken from the video game ""Resident Evil 3"", but it still doesn't make sense)? Why does the movie use its sole black character, with his blinged-out handguns, for comic effect? Why didn't Paul W.S. Anderson direct this one (not because it would have had any effect on the quality, just that scripting AND directing this thing would've cemented IL' Paul's reputation as the Number One Hack of the new millennium - of course, he did make ""AVP"") And, for godsake, WHY DO THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVEYARD COME BACK TO LIFE (again, I realize this is taken from the video game, but someone should have exercised some common zombie sense: even if the corpses in the graveyard came back to life, they'd have a hell of a time busting out of their coffins, out of the stone vaults that enclose coffins in most cemeteries, and digging through six feet of mud - they're DEAD for godsake!)? This is definitely an entertaining movie: After the two hours was over I didn't feel cheated. It's good that someone makes movies this terrible; they're hilarious without trying. When Carlos jumps out of a helicopter on a safety harness with two uzis, it's almost as hilariously over-the-top as the sequence in which Milla Jovovich 1) drives a motorcycle through a stained-glass window 2) aims it at a monster, revs up, and jumps off 3) fires two bullets that travel in slow motion toward the motor cycle and 4) ignite the gas tank, destroying the monster and leaving Milla free to 5) squish another monster with the giant crucifix over the altar. It's indescribably funny; it's the horrific, bastard, mutant child of all the post-Matrix techno-kitsch that's dominated action movies in the last five years. The real joy of this movie is that it's the same kind of spliced-together, reanimated monster as its principle villain, the Nemesis; just as alternately lumbering and hyperactive, just as polished in its nastiness, and just as much fun to watch."

","~Spoiler~ <br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse starts off pretty strong...and then goes WAY downhill. The beginning is really atmospheric with everyone trying to get out of Raccoon City. Mobs of people are waiting at the gates of the city but no one is allowed to leave. The city has been quarantined and the zombie plaque quickly reaches the gates. It's like actually seeing the scene that Mark describes in 28 Days Later. There was also a severely claustrophobic scene where a woman is running up a flight of stairs with a gang of bloodthirsty zombies on her heels. It was an effective moment to say the least. However, the flick enters ridiculous territory pretty damn quick. Bad elements include, but aren't limited to, terrible CGI monsters, comic relief by Mike Epps, Milla Jovovich running down a building, and the Nemesis himself. I read tons of interviews where the creators claimed the Nemesis would be the next horror icon. Sorry guys, it ain't happening. Perhaps my biggest peev with the film is the obligatory to be continued ending. I'm really not interested in a Resident Evil 3. Paul W.S. Anderson obviously just belted this script out super-quick so he could go ruin other franchises. So, sadly, the best thing about this film was the teaser trailer that looked like an actual ad for the Umbrella Corporation (done by Texas Chainsaw redux helmer Marcus Nispel). They should have just based this on the Resident Evil 2 video game."

","There is a long list of movies that rode on the back of successful computer games, all the way to the box office. This is a pantheon that includes such illustrios titles as ""Wing Commander"", ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""Street Fighter"". This movie suits this list perfectly. I saw the first Resident Evil movie and was delighted to see a film credible in it's own right. I also saw the second... and that's about all I can say.<br/><br/>Ignoring the game link, there was also the hurdle of the first film. Not many sequels successfully stand next to their parent, and this one was inferior by a long shot. Fans of the game will enjoy this film. It has acceptable portions of zombies, bullets, women and comedy. It is short of plot, but we don't all look for that in zombie movies now do we! For those that demand credibility, the power of the mighty umbrella corperation is ridiculous to the max and, having consulted my associate, a specialist in the field of combat, the payload of the nuclear weapon used was nowhere near man enough to clear the city!"

The same bad guys are in it again the zombies, Lickers, and those killer poochies!

","Resident evil 2 by far blows the first resident evil away. I'm not saying the first one is bad (i still recommend it) but the second one is better on so many levels. I think the 2nd one does a much better job of explaining the disease than the 1st. In the 2nd movie, you also get a wider and more colorful cast. All the cast in RE2 played their parts very well. The one thing that sets RE2 apart from the first is the action. RE2 is non stop action from start to finish. You also get a wider variety of enemies. In RE2, you get a much more varied environment than in the first movie (which took place entirely in the ""HIVE""). You also don't have to have seen the first one to appreciate the second movie. The RE2 gives a brief summary of the first movie in the beginning. The movie is sometimes labeled as horror, but that is very wrong. The movie is not at all suspenseful, which is one of its flaws. Overall RE2 is a good action movie that will satisfy your need for violence. 7 out of 10"

But I thought it was a vast improvement over the first. The horror emphasis has died down a little - but it is more of an attempt to make an action film in a horror context. Alice has even more superhuman powers than the first film and she takes on zombies and monsters in a ""Matrix"" inspired combat style.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the ending of this film - just when you think the film is over - it has a few twists and turns right up to the end.

"jayce2279","10","1","2","7 January 2005"," The best zombie movie since Dawn of the Dead
","If you felt the first ""Resident Evil"" movie didn't quite capture the atmosphere of the original game, you can sleep a little easier now. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" has EVERYTHING: from dark, creepy graveyards, a Gothic cathedral and classic lorries in an ""Escape from New York""- style deserted city to a cigarette smoking Jill Valentine and half naked hooker zombies. Although this sequel clearly had a much bigger budget than the original film, director Alexander Witt has kept it credible and didn't use digital technology to bombard your senses and keep your mind of the lack of a decent storyline. Rather than making you feel like you're watching a computer- made movie where nothing seems real, the special effects help create a desolate and panicky atmosphere with credible characters who struggle to survive in a city that's infested with their undead compatriots, partially decayed K-9s and other creepy lifeforms. The scene where one survivor has to go up against a class of elementary school zombies is just terrifying. Unlike the director of the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, Witt and producer/ script writer Paul W.S. Anderson have opted not to follow in the footsteps of the fast- moving ""28 Days Later"" zombies, but has clearly been inspired not only by George Romero's view of walking corpses, but also by his opinion of our western society. The real evil in this movie is not the zombies or even the killer mutant Nemesis (who looks and sounds like he has just stepped out of the original game and into this movie), but a Big Brother- style multinational that puts itself above the law and has no respect whatsoever for morale, decency or anything human. Even if you've never played the video game, didn't like the first ""Resident Evil"" movie or don't care for a lot of high tech military action in a horror film, I'd still highly recommend you take the time to watch this one. If you liked both the 1978 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Aliens"", you're going to love ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". Besides, if internationally acclaimed Milla Jovovich agreed to add it to her r√©sum√© of, among others, ""the Fifth Element"", ""the Messenger: the Story of Jean of Arc"" and ""the Million Dollar Hotel"", it has to be good!"

","I think I'm about three fifths of the way through this discombobulated, mish-mash of a sci-fi/schlock jock escapade into stupidity...I have seriously never seen a movie make such little sense. Perhaps because it's based on a video game that itself is based on some bizarre pedophiliac, masturbatory death orgy of zombies and sex. My favorite part is how every time a zombie is shown, the action gets all slo-mo to disguise the fact that the makeup team behind this movie couldn't paint a clown for a 6 year olds birthday party. Dialogue: Total crap Action: Let's just blow everything up and show computers Story line: Is there one? That 'Nemesis' thing is the only halfway decent character in the whole pile of horse pucky... and he's hotter than that disgustingly putrid looking girl who carries around her camera hoping for an Emmy. And how stereotypical for the ""funny urban black guy"" to be all zany and wacky and, somehow, still humorous in light of an entire city gone retarded. But hey, I blame it all on my wonderful fianc√© who thought that RE and RE2 for $25 at Best buy was a DEAL...she likes 'strong female characters.' Yes they are strong. But speaking of stereotypical, why are they also beautiful, big breasted and white? This movie sucks."
"natasliah","10","1","2","3 January 2005"," Deserves nothing less...
","This movie deserves nothing less than a 10. The people who put this movie together, took the Resident Evil saga (in which every game was an fragment), and created a complete movie. In every single Resident Evil game, you were automatically the underdog. The camera angles weren't very likable, and neither was the hand to hand combat or the voice acting. Example of bad voice acting: ""Jill...don't open that door!"" ¬ñ Resident Evil Director's cut. In the first movie, Alice was a force to be reckoned with, and now the undead have a more evolved Alice to deal with. The first movie took place in the Hive, whereas this movie takes place in many parts of Raccoon City. All in all, I'd prefer this movie over the first one any day. If you love the undead from the RE games, if you love fear, or if you just love Milla Jovovich, I recommend that you check this movie out! And after you see this movie; be sure to buy the CD Divine Comedy by Milla Jovovich anywhere CD's are sold."

The cast includes Milla Jovovich, returning from the first film, as Alice. She creates a sense of feminine power with her character. Sienna Guillory appears as Jill Valentine, from the game series. Oded Fehr plays Carlos Olivera, also from the game series. I believe that if you enjoyed the first Resident Evil, then you will like this one as well. That also goes to the fans of the video game series.

"Danny_G13","8","1","2","12 December 2004"," Far better than the dismal original
","I was appalled by the first Resident Evil film. As a big fan of the games it was based on I hoped for something which tied in with it. Indeed, George Romero agreed with this philosophy and coined a script featuring recognisable characters from the franchise, and a similar setting. This script got him fired and the final movie bore pretty much no resemblance to the games bar the locale of Raccoon City and the name of the Umbrella Corporation. If alienating the fans wasn't bad enough, the actual quality of the picture was quite dismal, and though it was successful on the name, the film content left the majority of neutral viewers fairly apathetic, and actual fans mildly annoyed. Bearing this in mind, the sequel would have to rectify a lot of the mistakes the first one made, and contrive something far better than the original.<br/><br/>They succeeded admirably.<br/><br/>Apocalypse picks up exactly where the original left off, with Milla Jovovich's Alice staggering out of some kind of Umbrella medical installation to be greeted by the chaos of the town of Raccoon City under the state of emergency the outbreak of T-Virus has left it in.<br/><br/>However, Umbrella have plans to use the situation to their advantage by way of the Nemesis program, and endeavour to test their bio weapons within the carnage.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) members are still in Raccoon City and trying to escape, but after Nemesis slaughters a crew of them, it is left to the few remaining ones to try and escape. They are flanked by Alice who doesn't feel quite herself any more...<br/><br/>Resident Evil Apocalypse succeeds on the vast majority of levels the original feebly capitulated at. Firstly, and very importantly, there are far more references to the actual games in evidence. Carlos Oliveira, Jill Valentine, Nemesis, an Ashford reference; there are more than enough superficial homages to the games to satisfy the connoisseurs. Moreover, the 'feel' of the movie is vastly more akin to the games. Rather than the slightly sci-fi sanitised original which felt a million miles from the games, this one gets the scenarios and general ambiance closer to what purists wanted. Also in evidence here is the fact it's a mix of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis video games. Jill has her Nemesis outfit on, Carlos from 3 is here, the underground lab from 2 is featured. There are plenty of game links to satisfy. Sure, there are some slight modifications to the game plot, with certain details quite different, but you don't find yourself holding such facts against the film.<br/><br/>Secondly, and crucially, the actual movie itself outside of being faithful to anything is a genuinely enjoyable tale. Sure, it's hardly realistic, with plenty of gravity-defying stunts and absurd moments of combat, but it demands you suspend your disbelief for the duration and assuming your compliance you'll get a kick out of the action and explosions et al.<br/><br/>Then we have Alexander Witt's far more engaging direction compared to Paul Anderson's drab attempt in the first movie. Witt achieves an engaging ride here, always making each scene buzz with life. Never a dull moment in this one.<br/><br/>The cinematography is more than competent as well, with some great aerial shots and some effective street scenes. You feel part of the action at all times, and you're certainly never bored. Set layout is especially good, so good you actually don't notice it.<br/><br/>Finally the acting. OK, that's always going to be a weakness here, but besides the corny accents and overdose of cheesy dialogue the actors do a decent job of getting on with proceedings. Hell, they even manage to look like they're enjoying themselves. <br/><br/>But this film is not about acting; clearly the narrative is centre stage. And as a result of a reasonable script, good direction, and close ties to the game, Resident Evil Apocalypse manages on every level its predecessor failed at.<br/><br/>If you're a fan, highly recommended. If you're not, you will probably still get a blast out of it."

Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi monsters. I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally cgi monsters in the movie. The nemesis monster is done completely with makeup it seems and makes me think maybe they could have made a Hulk using the same technique. This one picks up where the last one left off as Alice finds herself in the middle of a virtual war. The additions to the cast are all welcome changes from the last movie as the person who plays Jill Valentine both looks and acts like the character from the game.

","As time goes by, everyone becomes wiser, or at least the saying says so. These sequels, always such intricate matters! Especially if you think you're a smart bastard and don't bother appreciating the work of others, who actually facilitated you're ""creation"". Most will probably agree that Anderson is a terrible screenwriter, lacking creativity and originality. But when you give up on a film to wreck another, I can't but ask myself how that looks in the eyes of a professional. It doesn't look too good in my eyes. Actually it proves lack of interest. I guess all have their priorities, don't they?<br/><br/>RE:Apocalypse is a film like few other: little to nothing dialogue, zero character development, endless fight scenes. But is that really bad? It definitely isn't great, however, if you take into account the intention of the creators, you have to agree it fulfills its purposes, but not its potential. I regret that no one bothered to add some depth to the movie because it would've rocked, especially if there had been some time to breathe without hearing a few bullets swoop by. A bit of mystery and a bit of suspense, would've made this here creation a real killer. Sadly, though, P.A doesn't bother that much and simply relies on other people and films to do the job for him. <br/><br/>Spoiler<br/><br/>What is even worse, is the way he chose to prepare us for a sequel. I have to admit, it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen and it didn't even nearly equal the cliff hanger of the first film. All that I can hope is that Anderson will somehow miraculously step down from this project, or at least leave the script to someone else. If I were to compare Apocalypse with the original title, I'd be content to say it's a teeny, tiny bit better. RE loses because of the little details which make the movie rather annoying at a second viewing. Actually, it loses because it's very sloppy.<br/><br/>End of Spoiler<br/><br/>Then there is also this Alexander Witt. He does a decent job for a first timer, but he just doesn't succeed in blowing you away. His attitude towards the audience doesn't involve the viewer enough, and even though this is where that screen writing issue pops up, I still believe Witt could've done more about it. I also think I have to agree with some other people: there's little to no visual eye candy, something Anderson is pretty good at.<br/><br/>I feel I have the obligation to mention that I am a big fan of the games (which kind of means I'm totally against this ""Resident Evil"" that has reached the cinema screens). I've even read Romero's script (which isn't that great, but I suppose it would've summoned in one film that which Anderson spreads over this possible trilogy - or whatever it will end up being), expecting RE:Apocalypse to be just more than its predecessor was. I suppose I should be satisfied, but I'm only half satisfied, because it could've been so much more! But, hey, couldn't life have always been so much more?"

","Spoilers<br/><br/>'Raccoon City' is represented on the screen by a place known fondly to us a good old 'TO', alias the City of Toronto¬Ö¬Ö.First Canadian Place, Royal Bank Plaza, Commerce Court, Scotia Place and, last but not least, Nathan Philip Square ('city hall' in the movie). It's wretchedly heart-breaking to see the whole place blow up and vanish in a mushroom cloud.<br/><br/>Resident Evil II is popular video game with the same name (second version too) brought to life (screen life, that is). Not only Alice, but also Jill Valentine is a character in the game (and Jill in uncannily remarkable likeness, so I heard). Plenty of zombie and creatures are also reproduced, although not all (e.g. we don't see killer plants in the movie). On the other hand, Alice's rescue of the little girl is so reminiscent of Ripley's rescue of 'Newt' in Aliens (the 2nd, and the best, in the series).<br/><br/>In addition to the good action series and the attention-demanding sound effect, the movie offers a good variety of characters and groups involved in the game: the main rescue party for the girl, the good-guy soldiers trying to escape, the zombies and other assortments of affected mutants, the bad-guy soldiers from Umbrella Corp, Nemesis¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö.one shouldn't really complain about being bored. <br/><br/>As to the superficially clever suggestion that Trinity (Matrix Trilogy), Selene (Underworld) and Alice are all alike¬Ö¬Ö..Nonsense! To suggest the first two are alike simple because they both wear tight black leather is about as clever as suggesting that the Washington Redskins and Manchester United are alike because they both wear red and play a game called 'football'. The opening of my comments on Underworld on 30 November 2003 pointed out one of the differences. More generally, Trinity focuses much more on action relating to physical combat and even when she is shooting, the choreographed action takes precedent. Selene on the other hand is mostly shooting, very much of John Woo's double pistol style, with a focus on FORM rather than ACTION. Alice, while doing both, is neither. The 'action' we see Alice engaged in is mainly produced by deft camera work end editing.<br/><br/>Instead of offering one Amazon (this not a subliminal advertisement), the movie offers two. While in a supporting role, Jill Valentine played by Sienna Guillory seems to have captured the imagination of the audience. If they ever make R.E. 3, would certainly like to see an even heavier role given to her."

","Rating: * (out of *****)<br/><br/>The sequel to Resident Evil capitalises on the rebirth of the zombie genre that's been evident this year in the Dawn Of The Dead remake and Shaun Of The Dead. The difference is, this one's purely about blowing the creatures up, with the help of a special being.<br/><br/>When I watched this film in the cinema, there was no need for the projectionist to show the end credits. Does that, alone, explain how laughably bad this film was?<br/><br/>Well, truth be told, the film has its potentially redeeming facets. Both Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory look really fit (now there's a definite plus for teenage fanboys), and Mike Epps provides very rare comic relief. But these are hardly reasons to buy a cinema ticket for this.<br/><br/>Everything in Resident Evil: Apocalypse has Hollywood written all over it. Look at the dodging of bullets and the jumping through windows that most modern films have been making fun of. If I knew for one second that the director and screenwriter weren't taking this seriously, I may have given it an extra star. But nearly all of the laughs I got from this were from laughing at the bad dialogue and the cartoonish violence. And before I forget, the bad guy's German. (Yeah, what's new?)<br/><br/>It's fine for the plot to be contrived and make no sense. It's another to be having little or no fun when watching. At least I can claim to have enjoyed parts of the Tuxedo. I suppose that this may be some people's cup of tea, purely for Milla Jovovich and the violence, but in my opinion this is a brain-dead video game masquerading as a film. Not recommended."

The acting was pretty bad and over the top. There was no psychological tension in the way the film tried to scare you, it was just with sudden loud(where i watched it, VERY LOUD) noises with sudden extreme close ups. I could list every point what made this film bad, but I'm gonna be writing too much as it is...

A previous (apparently flawed) version of president-zombies escapes the lab and decides to run for the presidential post on its own.<br/><br/>The lab is furious and to take the rebel out of the race they send a zombie supermodel who must derail his campaign by using persuasion, treachery or... love.<br/><br/>After getting attached to each other in a zombie love the rebel persuades the model to break free from the lab and help him win the race. In a tight election he becomes the new president... The country is saved with a victory of the good.<br/><br/>Viewers are allowed to suspect that she is the real one sent by the lab to rule the country as the First Lady.<br/><br/>Evil wins because it is more sophisticated than the true love.<br/><br/>President Evil 2 =============== The greedy biotech lab (see President Evil 1) has become a greedy multi-billion dollar corporation. Zombie presidents have risen to importance in many countries and companies. The world is ruled by biotech monsters who make no errors in business or politics. Their only not-so-good feature is extreme cruelty and hate of human beings.<br/><br/>A ""competitor"" biotech firm decides to end this unfair game.

To achieve this they send him for training with an old guru who lives in solitude in the jungle.<br/><br/>The guru is not happy to help a corporation but desperately needs a student.<br/><br/>In a year's time the new student learns the thousand-year wisdom and returns to the biotech nightmare to fight robots.<br/><br/>To achieve this he infiltrates the government and starts to turn off its zombies one by one by confronting them with illogical riddles. But however hard he tries, their numbers only seem to increase¬Ö<br/><br/>At the President's Thanksgiving dinner he meets the head of the greedy biotech giant. Believing he is a zombie, the protagonist is unable to answer his enemy's riddle. The surprise help comes from the evil zombie First Lady. Puzzled at the no-hate attitude, the protagonist presents her with another riddle and gets an answer only a human would give. Enlightened, he recognizes she is a human¬Ö and so is he.<br/><br/>Why would a human assist zombies in rising to almost absolute power?

The guy who played Christopher Titus's brother in ""Titus""! Another was the chemistry between Alice and Carlos Olivera. In RE:N, there was more of that with him and Jill.

I know I wasn't the only one in the theater who saw the ending in the first one and had their jaw drop! The creators of the second movie realized that the ending in the first one was absolute genius and had the same feeling given to the ending of Apocalypse.

I know RE inside and out. How can people say the first movie was irrelevant, when the books and games never went that far back, yet?<br/><br/>CAPCOM has made it clear that they wanted to focus on what the books and games did not show, giving us a more broad view of what happened instead of making us relive games we already had beaten 5 times each.<br/><br/>Somebody said something about ""What is up with he gargoyles coming to life?"" Well, friend, that was a ""Licker"" from RE2 and RE3. It was merely sitting next to gargoyles.<br/><br/>Jill on th side? Why do people complain of this? There are many points of view in RE. Jill was not the only person to experience it. We know her entire story, why the heck do we want to see the same stuff, this time in a movie? This movie showed the behind the scenes, so to speak. It showed what the games could not fill in; without getting to be too long of a game.<br/><br/>To those who dog the movie, you are ignorant of the games and the storyline. The story and time lines were perfect in both movies. Think I am full of it? Then read the books and play the games in sequence according to time line of the story.....you will then see that the movies were objective, efficient, and perfectly tailored.<br/><br/>One more thing: Umbrella was trying to create the perfect biological weapon.

In contrast, Jill (Sienna Guillory), another heroe in the game, is slim, sexy and relatively more feminine. The two girls' clothing reflects this point also. Jill is totally the same as in the game.

The plot leaps from one scenario to another, the character's are awful, and there's nothing remotely scary about it. The first film was just above average, though it created considerable suspense with the malevolent hive being an entity in itself and the discomfort of impending zombie attacks around every corner. This film has none of that, and is desperate to rigidly follow a computer game plot, which usually works, doesn't it? No, actually, it doesn't. Boring, seen-it-all-before action and lame acting are major problems, and the fact that Anderson was involved in the script is no surprise. It's the worst part, and feels like the uninventive dialogue was put in simply to break awkward silences between the unengaging characters."

This is a good idea that way you don't know what will happen every scenes. There are parts in the movie that are not explained but like in the first one they will probably have a 3rd installment that would explain some of it. The mercenaries weren't explained in the film and the S.T.A.R.S team had a shallow explanation. Some of the dialogue was PG-13 for an R film. The strong use of women in the lead parts was too much for me but its a great money making move.<br/><br/>The finer points of the film was the nonstop action, The comic relief was great,and the zombies where kind set aside as secondary threats. I love the Nemis he was right on the money. The licker's were sad compared to the first film. The K-9's were much more fun in this film. The gore was notched up a bit but wasn't suspenseful like the slicing dice scenes in the first film, that was great, all in all this film was a ten.

That's a different story.<br/><br/>OK, Resident Evil, the first movie...my gripes: The zombies had metal teeth it seemed Glossed over the entire game for the most part Had cheap heavy metal music in the action scenes Too many action scenes as opposed to horror/suspense Clich√© ""we're not leaving you behind"" dialogue<br/><br/>I'm sure I could think of others.<br/><br/>Anyways, Resident Evil : Apocalypse comes along. Different director, same writer (who did such classic crap as the first Resident Evil, as well as AvP and that Kurt Russel flick Soldier). So I initially think...great, how much will this one suck.<br/><br/>Then I see the preview. It had seemed as though my thoughts were backed up. We have a very sexy Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory)...perhaps the sexiest female lead in the movies this year..at least in that character. Then we have Nemesis. Also see a lone Jill walking down a deserted hall. I'm thinking OK, they may have some horror elements this time around. Then comes Nemesis with a machine gun, elite commandos, and helicopters. All hope was lost.<br/><br/>Then...I stepped into the theater.<br/><br/>For once, the trailer did not do the film any justice...at all!(Granted Nemesis still toted a machine gun around but, it didn't matter when you saw him. Why? Don't question me..it just didn't!)<br/><br/>The unexpected happened: THEY FOUND A BALANCE BETWEEN ACTION AND SUSPENSE IN THE RE MOVIES!<br/><br/>Yes there was elite commandos kicking zombie ass, and all the S.T.A.R.S members knew some pretty nice hand to hand combat, but the action wasn't bad! It didn't have cheesy heavy metal guitar riffs, or one man armies, aside from Milla Jovovich's Alice character, but hey, she has a reason.<br/><br/>This movie was good! It wasn't very scary but, it wasn't very tame either. It had it's downfalls, such as two extremely cheesy parts, one is the entrance of Alice once she has clothes on(well...more than that paper thin hospital gown looking like it was made of..well..paper), the other a line spoken by an Umbrella soldier, ""We're expendable and we've just been expended"". Is Expended even a word?<br/><br/>The make up effects on Nemesis were the best I've seen since Lord Of The Rings, mind you they don't rival it, but that would take a lot.<br/><br/>It did fall prey to having the generic token black guy in there, which the audience seemed to just eat right up(no pun intended). He was tolerable though. In fact, although I couldn't help but think he was added for comic relief his character did make me kind of smirk the odd time.<br/><br/>The movie went by at a nice pace too, not too fast, not too slow. The zombies still attacked in packs but, in Resident Evil 2 and 3 it seemed to be the norm, so it was better. This time as well, there were no metallic looking teeth. <br/><br/>Also, they did a great job tying the two films together, picking up before Resident Evil ended and after the events in the first one. Very reminiscent of Resident Evil 3 taking place during and after Resident Evil 2. Deliberate? Perhaps. Nice homage? Definitely.<br/><br/>The ending left room for a sequel and I must say, if they improved on it this much from the first one, I am rather looking forward to seeing what they do to the third one permitting they make it.<br/><br/>Until then, I suppose I'll just have to keep hunting down S.T.A.R.S members and eating my braaaiiinss...."

I also think they should have titled this one ""Nemesis"" instead of ""Apocalypse"" because now they're going to be in a bind when they actually get to the one that's supposed to have that title. Oh well...I'm sure they'll think of something, they always do.<br/><br/>Final Call:<br/><br/>Movies : Enough action and special effects to make this worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>DVD Purchase : This may just be a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Rental : Yes but this one is better to see on the big screens."

","I thought this movie was amazing and entertaining. It had non-stop action and a few cool twists to it. I also enjoyed that there was a little comedy in this film as well as jumping-out-of-your-seat moments. Some people say that this movie does not stay true to the video games or to the fans. I couldn't disagree more. I was obsessed with all of the Resident Evil games and thought they put a great amount of the game into the movie. I would have been so bored sitting through both Resident Evil flicks knowing everything that was going to happen next. That would not be very entertaining or interesting. I highly recommend this movie to people who love action, adventure, and suspense. Also Milla Jovovich is insanely cool!!!"

","RE: Apocalypse is about what I expected, your garden variety sizzling hot women with guns shooting zombies movie. It won't be one of the top contenders for the Oscars this year. Just get a big bag of popcorn extra butter, turn off the brain for awhile, and enjoy! It was a great movie to cap off the end of the summer season. I had a few minor logical problems with the (simple) plot. And the director/cinematographer chose to use that extremely close/blurry camera, jumpy-cut editing style which seems to be in vogue right now (see Bourne Supremacy), which made some of the hand-to-hand fighting difficult and dizzying to follow. I detected an homage or two to other zombie flicks, but it is hard to tell as this genre is full of classic clich√©s (by now, everyone knows the ""rules"" of a zombie movie, just as everyone knows the ""rules"" of a vampire film). <br/><br/>I liked that the story picked up right where the last one ended i.e. the scene where Milla Jovovich walks out of the hospital half-clothed and grabs a shotgun out of a police car in the chaotic ruins of Racoon City. <br/><br/>Sienna Gullory, the other female lead, is mesmerizing on-screen as she very much looks and acts like a video game character (a super, smokin' hot video game character BTW). Michelle Rodriguez in the last film did the tactical commando/gunplay stuff better, IMO, but I'm not complaining."

","Resident Evil: Apocalypse<br/><br/>Picking up where resident evil left off.<br/><br/>Alice wakes up in the raccoon city hospital only to find the city is infected by the T- Virus. The city in chaos by the legions of undead residents of raccoon city, infected by the T- virus from the hive.she forms a loose relationship with some of the survivors and battle's her way through the city trying to locate a Doctors daughter who's hiding in the school. in exchange he will get them out of the city alive. also finding herself has been ""enhanced"" to be stronger, faster, smarter and with more endurance. She also confronts the monster ""nemesis"" developed by the umbrella corporation. I thought the movie was very action packed but felt that they would get a clue as to how to drive off the undead by shooting them in the head instead of the body. The movie, to me, showed just how bad and ruthless the umbrella corporation was really is by shutting the gate and then nuking the city to cover all trace and having a cover story about a nuclear reactor melt down. I believe there will be another movie in the works to see what further enhancements the umbrella corporation has made to Alice."

""Alice"", the heroine of the first movie, awakes to find Raccon City swarming with zombies (and more), while the REMFs at Umbrella Corp. coldly observe the chaos from afar, calculating the money they can make with the T-Virus.<br/><br/>We finally meet the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad), most notably Jill Valentine, who is sporting a blue tube top and black miniskirt--straight out of ""Resident Evil 3: Nemesis""! Oh, and speaking of the Nemesis, he's here, too; what was left of Matt from the first movie has been transformed into a hulking bruiser who carries a rocket launcher *and* a Gatling gun! Oddly enough, the movie sort of humanizes the Nemesis near the end (you'll see).<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very good movie, much better than the first one, with an ending that sets up (hopefully) another sequel!

I like the way the zombies move and all the other monsters/mutants act (ex Nemesis). Also the whole mystery about Alice, and how she becomes the T-virus is very exciting.

The movie take place where the first one ended which is good because it combines the first movie to the second which explains the first one better of how everything got started in the first place with the research of the T-virus. This movie had a lot more action, comedy, and heart stopping scary scenes where you know something is about to happen but you don't. Resident Evil even had as some one said in the theater it's that scary girl from the first movie, but this time she was real and go figure she was the first with the T-virus developed by her father to make her walk because it does reanimate dead cells. The movie also had good fight scenes with the two main nemesis the guy that started mutating at the end of the first one and Alice.

You'll just have to see it for yourself though ^_-). The film felt much more for the most part like an RE game then the first one did, the action was great, the story was fine. Overall a solid *** to **** action/horror film (that is to say I compared it with other films in that genre instead of movies in general).

","Outline (The brief story is for those who haven't seen the first movie, without which they might not understand the second one):<br/><br/>In the end of the first movie Resident Evil, we see only two survivors out of the T-virus tragedy at Umbrella Corporation's hi-tech 'Hive' research facility, one of them being Alice (Milla Jovovich). For those who have not seen the first movie, the Hive is the secret underground research facility of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's most powerful commercial organization that specializes in high-end genetic research and mutation. The two survivors have been tested and have been genetically altered to gain superhuman strengths. One of them is Alice, and the other is an armed killing machine, the Nemesis.<br/><br/>By the beginning of Apocalypse, we see that the dangerous T-virus that induces people become Zombies is out in the open in Raccoon city. The umbrella corporation loses no time in unlawfully quarantining people and leaving them to the mercy of the T-virus that spreads through zombie bites. What follows then, is a series of mindless adventures.<br/><br/>Comment:<br/><br/>The movie seems to be a desperate attempt to revive the success of the movie Resident Evil that had raked in a hundred million dollars. A viewer who has previously not seen the first movie would rather feel like running away from the movie hall in the middle of the movie. However, as the movie approaches the end, it gains a little better sense.<br/><br/>One of the most seemingly realistic things projected by the film include the dangers of overtly powerful corporations that can threaten the future lives of people with their genetic experiments.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich's performance is purely action oriented and is exponentially better than the earlier movie (thanks to her character 'Alice' becoming genetically powerful). The other performances are just around the average performance that you would see in a usual Hollywood sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Bottomline: If possible, please leave your brains outside the theatre entrance. Else, you might become a T-virus carrier Zombie¬Ö ;)"
"jaywolfenstien","Null","2","8","15 September 2004"," A bit too far . . .
","Usually people go into films with preconceived expectations, and when those expectations are not met that person is disappointed. I went into Resident Evil: Apocalypse with lots of expectations, every one of them was met, and part of me is still pretty disappointed. I enjoyed the film, knowing before hand what it was and the mindsets it was made for, but this was a case where I would have been overjoyed if Alexander Witt proved me wrong and went for something more. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint involves the writing and direction surrounding the Alice character (nothing against Milla, herself, or her performance.) So many camera moves, editing choices, scenarios, and ill-conceived action cues came across as cheap gimmicks to pander to mindless fans and elevate Alice to a larger than life, superhuman, camp comic-book level that just did not feel a part of the Resident Evil world. <br/><br/>Sure, making one of the main characters genetically enhanced levels the playing field against the hoards of infected zombies and monsters, but the beauty of the Resident Evil games was the fact that you played on Umbrella's turf with a very distinct disadvantage, and there we had a real reason to worry that the characters might not survive. Then again, this film isn't made for those appreciative of a challenge; this film was made for the people buying the strategy guide and downloading walkthroughs since designer's have taken out cheat codes enabling God Mode. 'I won.' Congratulations, I'm still not impressed.<br/><br/>I praised Paul Anderson for excluding the game characters in the original film. I for one realize Raccoon City has enough people in it that we can focus on different people within the Resident Evil world (hell, Resident Evil 2 on the Playstation followed new characters.) I've played the games, and I never had any interest in watching a scene for scene, character for character, non-interactive remake. If I wanted to see Chris or Wesker or Leon, I'd play the games.<br/><br/>The inclusion of game trademark characters has also killed suspense for the film. Is anything significant going to happen to RE's precious 'master of unlocking' on screen? Answer: No on two accounts. 1, Capcom won't let it happen, and 2, the obsessive fans will whine so loud and long we'll never hear the end of it. As a part of the audience, how am I supposed to be worried about the characters in this film when I know beyond all doubts that nothing will happen to them in the end? The games have suspense because Leon, Claire, Jill, and Chris can die at any time. 'Game over man! Game over!'<br/><br/>If you're going to include a trademark character, don't pander to obsessive fanboys and show them doing nothing but kick butt without getting a scratch (or the obligatory 3 hits that don't even phase the good guys). Go ahead and kill off the trademarks and let the audience know that anything can happen to anyone. Then they'll really have reason to be worried about the characters that they care for. I mean really, in a film like this the game-characters won't even get a story arc. So why bother inserting game characters?<br/><br/>Final set of irritations: the endless reminders that this is based on a video game, reminders that all but halt the on screen action just to reassure the fans who need it spelled out to them that this is, indeed, based on the game. I do like and appreciate nods to the Resident Evil games when done right. I loved hearing Jill say, 'We can run around them (the zombies); they're slow.' I loved hearing sound effects from the game, or when Jill went off on her own in the church to investigate and stumbled across a set that reminded me of an early scene in the first game. Throwbacks to the game are perfectly fine, but this film wants to advertise them, wink at the audience, wave and get your attention then point at 85 percent of the game elements (Jill's outfit, the Umbrella logo everywhere). Then it's just obnoxious. (Thank God they didn't recite the 'master of unlocking' dialogue from the game.)<br/><br/>Anyway, praises for the film ¬ñ though Alexander Witt's direction bothered me, I do think the film shows some promise for him. There's a mixed bag of nice touches and not so slick moves combined in an 'eh' way. Overall the film felt a bit shallow, like someone who's learned to play the notes but not the music. Apocalypse is a pretty decent start, granted, maybe Witt will learn the underlying music and soul of his craft.<br/><br/>Sienna Guillory notably stood out in my mind. As much as I did not like the idea of Jill appearing in this film, it was interesting to see someone suit up in the characters wardrobe, look and move like the game character, and finally give a personality to that generic polygon creation we were introduced to in the games years ago. <br/><br/>Overall, the film delivers exactly what someone should expect from the next generation of MTV action flicks based on a video game. It could have been much better, but it was just meant to please and entertain on the level of the lowest common denominator like just about any horror/action flick these days . . ."
"Quicksand","3","2","8","10 September 2004"," Alexander Witt's Filmography Doesn't Lie
","Don't believe the hype. The facts don't lie-- this movie was buried in September for a reason, and with an Assistant Cinematographer at the helm of a multi-million dollar franchise. What could go wrong?<br/><br/>I won't go into it here-- click on his name-- but there is nothing in this guy's past to indicate he has even marginal directing talent, let alone something with a budget this size. And it shows. ""RE:A"" lacks character, any kind of dramatic arc, and the action sequences are shot in that choppy, what-just-happened blur that I thought went out with the Reagan Administration. Also on that list, the Wacky Token Minority. Where ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a step forward for the action horror movie, ""RE:A"" is a leap backward of such incredible crap-taking proportions, it should have its own Olympic Event.<br/><br/>I've never met Alexander Witt, but based on this pile of garbage he actually thinks is a film, we can deduce the following facts about him: ONE, he has never directed a film before. Even without the IMDb, this is obvious. Characters show up and disappear for no reason, the living AND the dead disappear from the story after the first 10 minutes, 30-second side-scenes of cross-town events are inserted at random into a large action sequence, and every sequence in the movie is shot from 12 angles and edited together at random. TWO, he has no taste in music. I'm no huge Slipknot fan, but at least it fit the first movie. The sequel is all ""dramatic score"" and only two metal songs to speak of, both of which kind of lay there like old people having sex. Yawn. Oh, and THREE... Alexander Witt must REALLY be Paul Anderson's b*tch, or else how did Anderson look at this film, as a producer, and say ""Oh yes, we should release THAT.""<br/><br/>In all likelihood, Anderson cranked out this script in a weekend, then threw it at Witt on his way out the door to make the Only-Slightly-Better (which isn't saying much) ""Alien vs. Predator."" The only difference I can pinpoint is that ""AvP"" had production values. In ""RE:A,"" everyone who isn't the Production Designer should erase this one from their resume, and fast.<br/><br/>Where the first film had a plot, a purpose (escape the Hive, find out who Alice is), this film just kind of wanders, like the living dead. I think 30 minutes in, some characters are told to rescue a girl from the city, but that takes all of 5 minutes, then we're back to wandering again. For your action fix, rent anything else. For your Milla fix, well... she's naked in this one, but not as naked as the first one. Which sums it up, really-- if your sequel is worse than the original, the franchise dies. So now Anderson has killed the Predator, Alien, AND Resident Evil franchises in less than a month. Dude, maybe it's time you made up with the guy who wrote Mortal Kombat Part One?"

","Video games turned into movies are about as fascinating as the undead becoming ravenous zombies and vice versa as the case may be in this non-stop action sequel to the adaptation of arguably the most viscerally gory video game to begin the trend of graphic violence as an adrenaline rush for joystick fanboys.<br/><br/>Picking up where we last left off in the equally popular first film, lone survivor security specialist Alice (leggy hottie Jovovich) reprises her original Ripley Jr. character as she has been subjected to horrific scientific experiments in the wake of the terrible synthetic virus that managed to wipe out the Hive of the Umbrella Corporation's subterranean unit of technology and biochemical engineering which turned its expendable team into crazed cannibalistic zombies.<br/><br/>Alice reawakens to a chaotic police state in Raccoon City and finds herself to be practically indestructible as she teams up with a ragtag motley crew of survivors attempting to flee the city which has been earmarked for nuclear wipe-out by the panic stricken powers that be in the unrelenting horde of undead clamoring for brains (and other vital hunger satisfiers). Along for the ride of a lifetime is a few commando tactic soldiers/cops including tough-as-nails and feistily sexy Jill Valentine (Guillory, perhaps best known as Guy Pearce's doomed fianc√©e in 'The Time Machine') whose ballsy estrogen fueled tactics come in handy with a few well chosen weapons of destruction; Carlos Olivera ('The Mummy's Fehr); Peyton Wells, Valentine's partner (Adoit); plucky telejournalist Terri Morales (Holt) and a street hustler LJ (funny-as-hell Epps, the sorely needed comic relief whose expletive Greek chorus nearly steals the film). <br/><br/>Alice and company must band together as one when they are located by Dr. Ashford (Harris), the paraplegic scientist responsible for the virus (but not for the dastardly schemes by his associate the hissable Glen as Dr. Isaacs) who tracks them down to offer them a helicopter out of the no-man's land if they agree to find his young daughter Angie (Vavasseur). With the clock ticking and the non-stop army of dead on the warpath you can bet one thing: a high body count on the way out!<br/><br/>The film moves at pell-mell speed thanks to veteran cinematographer Witt making his directorial debut by ratcheting up the original film's helmsman Paul W.S. Anderson's screenplay with some wicked fast moving zombies, sudden bursts of unsuspecting violence and quicksilver editing that keeps the heart pumping with sharp anticipation of 'What the hell is next?!?!' He returns to the fold the nasty looking tongue wielding beasties and Doberman critters as well as the new horrific Nemesis, which resembles the Alien creature and one of HELLRAISER's Cenobites outfitted in Terminator togs (!) You have to see it to believe it, trust me.<br/><br/>Jovovich is in excellent shape and proves it by jumping, diving, defying gravity, delivering bone-crushing roundhouse kicks and in general kicking ass and taking no-prisoners with her amped up Alice testing her newfound powers like any video game heroine would (she's even fitted in pseudo Lara Croft togs) and Guillory provides ample support with her gritty Valentine as well providing some neck snapping √©lan to the carnage at hand. Epps ¬ñ Whom I normally can barely stomach ¬ñ is laugh-out loud funny as a pimped up dude who provides some truly hysterical dialogue sprinkled with 'Mother****er' every other word.<br/><br/>The non-stop action, null getting blown up and gruesome monster mash may feel a bit tiresome (ok, I'll admit it by the end of the film I was exhausted) but it works on all cylinders and (drum roll) does indeed set the franchise for yet another unstoppable chapter.<br/><br/>Buckle up and prepare to be jolted out of the summer ending doldrums in this last stab of seasonal glory."

","Jill Valentine and three other people are holed up in an abandoned church trying to escape the ever growing army of zombies within Raccoon City (one of the stupidest names for a city ever!). They are in a battle against a group of Lickers and almost out of ammo, things look bleak.<br/><br/>Suddenly a bright shines through the huge stained glass window...Alice blows through the glass mounted on top of a motorbike. She lands perfectly, informs the survivors to take cover and proceeds to blow away all the Lickers one by one in an eye shattering display of slow motion action enough to give any fanboy a hard on. At this exact moment the franchise dies, this is where the Resi Evil film franchise loses the gritty grown up 'Aliens' clone formula of the first film and enters the realm of hyper martial arts and lots and lots of slow motion action.<br/><br/>The character of Alice has been experimented on since the last film, apparently, which now gives her superhuman strength, speed and agility. This in turn takes the character and the film into the world of 'The Matrix' and absurd action set pieces.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the film isn't entirely bad, the atmosphere and visuals of the film are decent whilst the abandoned Raccoon City is created very well. You do get a great sense of dread from the deserted city, it feels dangerous and eerie with a really nice dark tone. <br/><br/>The film is still pretty adult I must say, there is plenty of blood, some gore and quite a few jump in your seat moments. The general survival concept is along the same lines as the first film with a small band of people trying to escape the City, its a solid idea which works. The problem is the inclusion of Alice who drags the film down utterly with her over the top macho invincibility.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Nemesis was of course required by all Resi fans and he is faithfully created, amazingly, although a bit rubbery. Not being a fanboy myself I just don't get why the Umbrella Corp would release this huge monster simply to kill the remaining S.T.A.R.S. members. Was this some kind of field test? and the fact they planned to nuke the City wouldn't that somewhat negate their precious creation? On top of that they make Alice fight this big guy for no real reason other than to have an exciting finale fight in the film...oh and something about seeing who is stronger, err why??? All that work just to have him fight Alice?!<br/><br/>The problem as said before is quite simply the character of Alice and the fact we have to follow her around from one superhero sequence to the next. On top of that you have the pathetic alpha female rivalry between Jill and Alice (and both actresses) as both compete for sexiest zombie killer. Jill wins purely down to her ridiculously skimpy outfit which is obviously in there just for the teen male audience. Because of course most special unit cops wear tight hot pants and a tight vest when in terror situations...wait this is a serious film?<br/><br/>Its a brave attempt which literately just keeps its head above the waves and manages to be a reasonable film. Shame about all the slow motion crap but this is what happens when Jovovich is in a film. The film is basically let down by stupid action sequences which vomit on your suspension of disbelief, had these bits been more sensible or relatively realistic then the film could have been pretty solid.<br/><br/>5/10"
"MaximumMadness","3","1","3","11 January 2014"," Oh, good lord... The first movie had a lot of entertainment value (even if it completely ignored the source material), but ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" just stinks.
","You ever been in a friendship or relationship that has so many ups and downs, you can barely think straight? One day everything will be fine, but the next, there's some sort of meltdown and it all goes hell... before suddenly getting better again?<br/><br/>That's what the ""Resident Evil"" film franchise feels like to me. It's like a volatile relationship with someone that I probably shouldn't be spending my time with, but I like them just enough for some strange reason that I continue to spend time with them. Much as this film franchise keeps alternating between dopey fun (the first and third entries, for example) and outright awfulness (This entry...), yet even though I know I could be doing much better things with my time, I keep watching.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a 2004 follow-up to Paul W.S. Anderson's first film. Directed by Alexander Witt (from a script by Anderson, who also produces), this is a prime example of a heinously messy, amateurish sequel that suffers not only a wonky script, but truly amateurish direction that just makes everything fall flat.<br/><br/>We follow Alice (Milla Jovovovich) once again, this time as she navigates the quarantined and zombie-infested Raccoon City with a motley crew of survivors, attempting to find the daughter of a top-Umbrella employee, as part of a barter agreement to be set free. However, unbeknownst to her, a new threat in the form of the ""Nemesis Program"" has been unleashed onto the city, and she will have to face this horrible creature (as well as corrupt Umbrella employees) in order to survive.<br/><br/>The acting this time is a lot more mixed. Some of the performances are great. Jovovich is a blast as Alice, this time with almost super- human powers following the experiments done on her. She's a fun female action-hero and is one of the strengths of the thus-far five entries in the series. Oded Fehr is also a blast as a comrade of Alice, a commando formerly employed by Umbrella. And Jared Harris as an Umbrella employee whose daughter is lost in the city gives probably the best performance in a good parental figure. However, performances by the likes of Sienna Guillory (as a disgraced police officer named Jill Valentine), Mike Epps (as a wise-cracking comic-relief character) and Thomas Kretschmann (as one of the most generic villains I've ever seen) all give pretty bland performances and drag the film down quite a bit.<br/><br/>The production and the script are where the film really falls apart, though. And they are very, very messy.<br/><br/>First of all, I need to address Alexander Witt's direction. Witt has proved himself a very capable, talented man, generally as a second- unit cinematography and second-unit director. However, here he displays that his experience did not help him obtain a strong enough visual sensibility to help a major production. (At least at the time of its release) This film is one of the most identity-less, bland productions I've ever seen. I'd even dare to say soulless at times. Frankly, Witt's aesthetic choices (in everything from composition to style) feel amateur, akin more to a first-year film student than an experienced filmmaker. I don't know how, but he managed to take so many cool action set-pieces and some interesting creatures, and make them boring. Outside of one cool sequence where the ""Nemesis"" creature is awakened in a Frankenstein-like laboratory, the direction just sort of... sucked.<br/><br/>The script by Anderson is also very problematic. From a rushed pace, to a very poor structure, this is essentially a film about people walking from point A to point B over and over again, with some goofy action and bad dialog thrown in. I also take issue with how the film treated its one major minority character, turning him into a stereotypical one- liner spouting goof-ball.<br/><br/>The rest of the production is decidedly a lot worse this time around as well. The production design is far less inspired, and even laugh-out loud hysterical at times. (Pay attention to the plethora of computer monitors throughout the film- they are the fakest-looking and most over- the-top blatant displays I've ever seen.) The costume design is also quite cheesy, making the characters look like Saturday-morning cartoons. And the music is a lot less polished this time as well.<br/><br/>Honestly, after being surprised by how enjoyable the first film was (even though it completely changed the story from the source material video-game, which I found upsetting) in a ""dumb fun"" kind of way, I was shocked by how horribly this film compared.<br/><br/>This is just a stinker all around. It's poorly directed, poorly written and despite having a few good performances, generally poorly acted. Thankfully, I am pleased to report that the third film managed to up the ante and more than made up for this mess.<br/><br/>But as it stands, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" gets a poor 3 out of 10 from me. The only reason to watch it is if you want to watch the entire series without missing an entry."

","Compared to the first film, Apocalpse does nothing different except taking the viewers out onto the streets of Racoon city. Fans of the video games will be glad at the arrival of Jill Valentine and even more so the creation of nemesis. But taking these two characters sway from it all, Apocalspe still gives fans plenty of moments to click their fingers and remember exactly where they have seen the current action on screen before in the games. Sadly though, as a follow up, proceeding with the immediate events after the pandemic outbreak being released from the hive, the film just doesn't do enough to bring you into the story.<br/><br/>The problems mirror the ones in the first film: Poor characters, terrible action and a loutish villain. Likewise with the lasers and opening of the first, Apocalypse can boast at delivering some cool moments like the havoc being caused from Nemesis' turret, ( just hearing him grunt the words 'stars' was enough to make me smile)and the chaos surrounding the city; yes, Racoon city makes for a better atmosphere than the underground hive.<br/><br/>So overall, the film suffers the same problems that can be found in the first film.

","Where do I start?... Possibly one of the worse films I have ever seen. I honestly thought they couldn't get any worse then the first one. Hands up to Paul W.S.Anderson for achieving this. The story line is pure and simply rubbish, the nemesis was a joke, one of the most important character in the Resident Evil games Jill Valentine is hardly introduced with any kind of background or understanding of who she actually is in this film. Alice once again is the main character when she's a waste of space. The cheese factor of this film is incredible e.g. the motorbike scene in the church. The strange use of camera affects on the zombie's was dreadful and yet again the zombie's themselves, the special affects and the action was as bad as you'll see in any film. Once again it's use of the game is literally non existent, yes there is Jill and Carlos but there characters have no relevance. For anyone who's thinking of making a parody of this film, there is no need the film does it itself."

","Others have already explained how bad the plot is. But on top of that, I seem to be one of the few people who thought the acting was absolutely horrible. Sure, the actors had lousy dialog to work with, but Sienna Guillory was particularly unbelievable as a badass cop, not just from the delivery of her lines, but in her body language and poise. I don't mind having hot chicks play action leads, but at least make it believable, like Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton or even Milla Jovovich. Actresses who know how to carry themselves with poise and confidence and make every single motion with a high degree of intent behind it. Guillory gives us the mannerisms and trappings of a tough cop without any of the inner presence, and she moves around like a little girl pretending to be a cop. Fail. Complete fail. Just because a woman is pretty and has a nice rack doesn't mean they can act. Oded Fehr didn't fare much better, coming across as way over-the-top. But Epps was decent, as was the little girl.<br/><br/>The plot was also a joke. The original made good use of multiple players with motives that were hard to discern. This one makes it pretty clear off the bat who the good guys and bad guys were, and what the goal would be, and events unfold fairly predictably without much of anything new.<br/><br/>The action sequences were okay, albeit nothing special or memorable. Nowhere near as good as ""The Matrix"" but not as bad as, say, Joel Schumacher films. And the climactic fight was a bit problematic, given that your bad guy is wearing this ridiculously bulky costume that is clearly not suited for hand-to-hand combat. And the characters aren't developed well enough for you to feel much suspense during any of the action sequences, but they're entertaining enough.<br/><br/>All in all, not worth paying money for.

Sorry, gamers, but I want a movie, not a game.<br/><br/>Alexander Witt had scads of experience as a second unit director and cameraman, and did a decent job in his directorial debut. Unfortunately, he was up against some real zombie action, now (Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead), so the film fell short for some. Their loss! Milla Jovovich was back and juiced up with the virus and evolved into a kick-ass beauty that would give Jet Li a run for his money. She is accompanied by Sienna Guillory from Love Actually, Helen of Troy, and the Principle of Lust, and that gives us a duo of beautiful action babes.<br/><br/>Say what you will, but Nemesis was as bad as I've seen since Robocop, and damn ugly to boot.

Just Google Rosie O'Donnell.)<br/><br/>A few questions... Where does Jill hide her cigarette pack?

The same goes for Jill, whose tube-top and miniskirt don't offer a high degree of protection.

"gavin6942","7","1","3","11 December 2006"," By Sequel Standards, This One Is Pretty Impressive
","After Alice escapes from Umbrella Corporation's secret underground laboratory (The Hive) as seen in the first film, she stumbles into Raccoon City, which has already become overrun with people infected by the T-Virus. Umbrella Corp closes the city to leave everyone to die.<br/><br/>First, I must confess the first film took two viewings for me to appreciate it. I watched it once and was not moved, but was very impressed the second time. This sequel caught my attention the first time. Now, sure, very little happens in it and it has some flaws, but as I say, by sequel standards it is quite good. A film series never really manages to make a great sophomore effort (with the exception of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II""), so take each one with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>I could debate the merits of director Alexander Witt versus Paul Anderson. Anderson still wrote this film but declined to direct, and Witt is admittedly a very inexperienced director. But he did fine... and kept the similar style that Anderson had, leaving the two movies very seamless (which is important when they run one to the other without pause).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the subtle references to other films, like the line ""10 points"" that I assume to reference ""Deathrace 2000"" and the line ""Finish him!"" that clearly is from Anderson's previous effort, ""Mortal Kombat"". Very nice work.<br/><br/>The Nemesis was a great creature. Not exactly like the game, but a formidable foe. The move to make him the counterpart to Alice was a good plot device and plays out well. I also liked the dogs, which are more true to the video game version. Those dogs in the game can be quite the pain in the butt. I think the way the zombies walked was perfect, exactly how zombies should. Many films get this wrong these days, not making the corpses Romeroesque enough. This movie gets it, keeping the tradition alive.<br/><br/>It's a long tradition, too: this is a sequel to another movie (""Resident Evil"") based on a video game (""Biohazard""), which was based on an older video game (""Alone in the Dark""), inspired by Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" series, which was inspired by Roger Corman's ""Last Man on Earth"", which was based off of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"".<br/><br/>I disliked the fast movements by the people and the fast camera work that went with it. Many times things happened too fast to really see what was going on, and I found this to be a real setback. I don't recall the first film doing this (another Witt/Anderson difference?) and it seemed very strangely paced for a horror film (though maybe properly paced for an action film).<br/><br/>The geeky guys get the ladies: Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, which is crucial since geeky guys are obsessed with Milla and have been ever since ""The 5th Element"". They also now have their Jill Valentine, the darling of the ""Resident Evil"" games. The film creators did a great job keeping the costume for Jill very close to the game, though I think the actress could have looked more similar. (And in the third film we have Ali Larter as Claire Redfield, which is an even bigger stretch.) As you can probably tell, I endorse this film. While I think Paul Anderson would have made a better sequel than Witt did, that's just being nitpicky. For what we were given, we have a great package and a respectable bridge between the first and third films."
"TheScottman","3","1","3","30 May 2006"," ""Valentine!""
","In this sequel to 2002's ""Resident Evil"" Milla Jovovich returns as Alice and joined by Sienna Guillory (The Time Machine) as Jill Valentine, which we all know as the petite cop that becomes stronger throughout the first game. She is not anything, but strong in this flick. I never notice Jill Valentine worn such an inappropriate wardrobe in the game she was always in her uniform, but in this movie she looks like she'll fit in on the corner with all the other prostitutes.<br/><br/>I really don't want to ruin the movie for you, but since this has nothing to do with the rest of the plot I'll tell you. Jill walks into her police station and shoots ""Zombies"" in the head (Nobody knows these people are the undead yet) and all her boss has to say is ""Valentine!"". She gives him a small speech about they're not alive and she goes on shooting as he walks away. Wait, she'll be arrested on the spot no matter what she said in that situation.<br/><br/>Anyways, Mike Epps (Next Friday, Bait) joins the cast, (yes I said Mike Epps) as the token black guy, I mean L.J. and of course Nemesis is in it, but he even lacks something, maybe like realism and/or loyalty to the video games.<br/><br/>In my opinion, stay away from the whole Resident Evil series, it's nothing but a waste of time and money. Even if Leon shows up, they'll find away to mess his character up, so what's the point? If you do end up watching this, don't expect much."

","I really enjoyed this movie. There could, however, have been come changes such as Milla's 100lb. co-star acting like a big bad girl when a strong wind could've knocked her over, one or two cheesy action movie clich√© like cocking the shotgun after a phrase when she didn't intend to use it at the moment, and the motorcycle scene was too far-fetched. Other than those 3 things I loved this movie!!!! I am so happy that Milla opted to look the part by packing on some muscle! She looks very good in muscle, as most women do. I also liked the fact that during most of the movie you can tell that her hair was barely brushed between scenes which made her action part look all that believable. When you see women fighters in movies and their hair is always perfect it annoys me."

","Resident Evil Apocalypse a must see movie. you will love it. I'm a resident evil fan I should know. I personally loved this movie. I saw Resident Evil 1, and it wasn't as good as the 2nd one. Following the success of the 2002 adaptation from video game to film that was 'Resident Evil', comes its tantalizingly-trailered sequel, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. Let's start with a brief synopsis. Firstly, this film picks up literally days after the first drops us off. 'Apocalypse' opens with a rehashed explanation of what we learned about the two main characters in the original, Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt Addison (Eric Mabius). Again, we are told that this Umbrella Corporation is an international super-power and that Alice is (or more accurately was) the head of security in an underground research facility dubbed ""The Hive"", which harbored research and specimens pertaining to biological weaponry. After that, we are treated to the scientists who wheeled Addison away at the closure of 'Evil', opening the zombie-infested annals of ""The Hive"". Immediately before the audience 'knows' what happens (its pretty obvious and is given away in the final shots of the first 'RE') we transition into a militaristic evacuation of important personnel associated with Umbrella Corp. After a few assorted events that do (and simultaneously do not) move the plot line (a 'do not' being the lead-scientist asking how bad the situation is). After this, we are introduced to nearly a half-dozen other characters, including a renegade police officer (Sienna Guillory), the remaining members of an elite task force (Oded Fehr, Zack Ward), a VERY stereotypical Black man (Mike Epps) and a hulking creature (which, if you paid attention to the first 'RE', you would be aware of its appearance) that totes both a rocket-launcher and a hand-held chain gun named the ""Nemesis"". The ending lets you know there will be a third."
"Neil_MacLeod","4","1","3","25 August 2005"," Boring. (no spoilers)
","Despite the stilted dialog and hard-to-connect with characters, I liked the original ""Resident Evil"" for what it was, a stylish conversion of a video game with undead mutant dogs. Just can't get enough of those. The sequel is just a snore. Jump cuts and WAY too much slow motion get in the way of the action sequences; characters who (once again) you don't care if they live or die; and long stretches where there is no tension or excitement, despite the intent of the director. Certainly not bargain basement awful like ""House of the Dead"" but not even a decent rental for a Tuesday night at home. Better to rent a George A. Romero flick if you want zombies, ""Underworld"" if you want a slick leather clad heroine, and any action flick by james Cameron if you want run and gun shooting."

","I don't know about you but I found the first Resident Evil to be a lot of fun. And I don't know about you but I feel the sequel is a lot of fun too.<br/><br/>I will say I was disappointed on some levels. Let me go ahead and get this out of the way.<br/><br/>Gore is a problem here. And it was a problem in the first film. For a film to be based on an extremely bloody video game I think it should have more of the stuff. <br/><br/>Secondly, there is very little suspense. That was an element the first film had PLENTY of. But I believe this is compensated for by providing more action sequences.<br/><br/>Lastly, the zombies themselves are seen very little. And when they are shown they often use a filming technique I practically loathe. It's kind of a slow-mo 'every other frame' technique and it just comes across as ineffective and distracting.<br/><br/>Other than these problems this film provides plenty of the goods. We have lots of lickers and dobermans again. It's been said that the lickers seem to be beaten rather quickly in this flick whereas one single one posed such a threat first time around. I have to agree with that to an extent, but it didn't really bother me at all. I was just glad to see lickers again.<br/><br/>Tons of cool action sequences. None of it is very realistic, but why sacrifice outrageous crazy fun for realism all of the time? Sometimes it's best to turn that brain off and forget reality for awhile. This is a video game movie we're talking here!<br/><br/>We get a wise-cracking black guy which may seem kind of clich√© but I have to admit the man made me laugh! Some of the most memorable moments feature this dude.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich returns and I can't imagine a Resident film without her. Her character is definitely bad ass.<br/><br/>Also the Nemesis turns out to be a real bad ass as well. I really liked this character and how he'd stomp out of the darkness just to nuke people.<br/><br/>Can't wait for 3 and 4!"

","No. We do not need a third movie in this franchise. The filmmakers are far too obsessed with referencing the games and showing off Milla's very nice nipples to make good movies. This one is about as good as the first, which is not very good at all. The acting, except a few bit players(Jared Harris especially) is mediocre. The scares are recycled, the plot twists are boring, the nemesis looks like the wussy brother of the Chatterer cenobite, and the zombies are not scary, or cool, or fun. I can not finish playing Resident Evil, because zombies are the only thing that scares me. This movie can't even duplicate a fraction of the game's creepiness. It is a poor substitute for the game. It can't even nail the single scariest aspect of zombies, claustrophobia. You can't escape them, because there is nowhere to go. This movie negates that by giving the people a ""safe"" zone. As Tom Hanks would say, there is no ""safe"" zone in zombie movies. This is a poor man's Romero movie and should be the end of this series of films."

Zero character development, except for the embarrassingly racist ""Uncle Buckwheat"" character who proclaims (with anachronistic glee) at one point, ""I usually drive a Cadillac."" <br/><br/>Rarely have I been so fully and painfully aware of wasting precious minutes of my life as when sitting through this snoozefest, hopefully waiting for it to show some semblance of intelligent story development.

If you see Resident Evil: Apocalypse as a braindead actionmovie, you might enjoy it and see it again. If you see Reasident Evil:Apocalypse as a fan of the games, bring a bucket and tissues.

","I really liked the movie. I don't think it was geared toward all audiences, but mainly for those that truly follow the game and can truly enjoy the inner plot of the movie. The only thing that bothered me a bit, but was still OK, was that Nemesis helped out in the end. In the game Nemesis was a bad-a who didn't take any crap. I love some of the inner sequencing that gave homage to the games like RE: Code Veronica. The scene towards the end when Alice is running from a helicopter and the helicopter is shooting at her is from RE: CV. It's awesome. In the game, which the character running the scene is Claire, does the same type of scene and the ending of the scene in both the game and movie is alike. They get stopped by security, drop the gun, catch it halfway down and fire at them. I hope they make a third. If they do, I'm there."

","Well i have been a BIG fan of Resident Evil since the first game hit our shores down here in the later 1995 early 1996, The game was fun and different....to my knowledge it was one of the truly first superior Horror/survival games created....well at least on the playstation. Then in 1998 and 1999 two more Resident Evil titles landed it's trade marks here: those were Resident evil 2 and of course Resident evil: Nemisis.... These two games were far superior to the already excellent first game. So i guess you could say i was really thrilled to learn they were making a movie called : Resident Evil. Sure enough i went too see it the first day it opened..it didn't really follow any of the games but that didn't stop me from loving it!! I felt it added like a new chapter to the resident evil saga.... Then i was to learn of a sequel not too long after. Now after a year and a half of waiting for this baby to finally be released down here in Australia all i have to say is.....It Kik-zombie-non zombie-A$$!! Thats right, i loved the movie....It follows to some degree both resident evil 2 and 3 plus the first movie. Which i think is good due to this movie too feels like a new chapter, i think of it this way....This movie lies inbetween two and three and adds to the story. Once again Alice (Milla) is the main star, she has just been set loose to wonder the now decaying streets of raccon city. But she has been genetically tested on with the T-Virus making her motive abilities more enhanced e.g she is stronger, runs a lot more and can fight huge ass creatures hand to hand. Paul WS Anderson has thrown into the movie some of the character, i assume this was due to the no character references to the first movie.. I didn't care either way. Jill Valentine played by (Sienna Guillory) was well done, it was nice to see jill come alive on screen. Plus there were a few other characters from game three such as Carlos and Nicholai, and i feel the little girl was roughly based off of Sherry from game 2.. But admittedly you can tell that Alice is still the lead in this movie, the games are about jill, the movies are about alice and i am glad they are set this way. Then there is the Nemisis that looks totally rad, and they have kept his design pretty close to the game, his make up looked cool! The acting was so so but enjoyable, and the plot was thrown at you fast with a lot of guns, explosions, breaking of necks and zombies. This movie didn't contain a lot of gore but it didn't seem to really matter. For this more was Style over Satire and for that i am thankful. I'm looking forward to part 3 and have high hopes for it as well. For those who are hardcore game fans like me, this might please you. For those who are hardcore of the first movie fans....this is sure to please you. For those who are gore junkies, look else where. For those who are action freaks, climb aboard this baby. All in all i give this movie 9.5/10 It rocked, now an instant favourite of mine. P.s i even dragged my poor old mother along, and she too liked it so i guess it can't be all that bad then."

I'm sorry, Milla fans, don't ax murder me, because I am a huge Milla fan, too. But no one can honestly say, after watching this movie, that she hasn't been overdoing it on the coke/pot/booze.

And what happened to those semi-curves she had in the first ""Evil""? Now she's a virtual stick, which that ugly costume they had her in didn't help at all.

","I liked the first Resident Evil movie. Okay so it didn't really stick to the games, but it was a good movie... if a lil' pointless. There was only one thing that pissed me off about it and that was the lack of zombies.<br/><br/>I thought they'd sort this out in the sequel, I mean, c'mon, that's the main point to the games: ZOMBIES! But no, there were even less zombies this time 'round. Instead, we have the Nemesis. This guy looked so damn class in Resident Evil 3 (the game that is), and they've recreated him here exactly how he looked in the game. This may please fans, but you just can't take this thing seriously. He just looks... uh... funny, like something from a Power Rangers episode. <br/><br/>But that doesn't matter, 'cause the Nemesis is only in the movie for about 3 and a half seconds. The rest of the time is spent showing Alice kicking stuff, jumping through windows and flicking cigarettes at stuff. I thought that this movie would be a great 'leave your brain at the door' kinda action movie, but no, it's DUMBER than that.<br/><br/>There is no point to the movie at all. Nothing happens. The gang just walk through the most dangerous places they can find for an hour. THAT'S IT!<br/><br/>Every action movie staple you can think of is here too.

Don't even get me started on the token black guy.<br/><br/>If you've seen your fair share of action movies, you'll hate this. It offers NOTHING new, NOTHING AT ALL! Instead it's just a random mess of recycled action scenes from other movies. You've seen this before a million times, trust me.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I just had this image of some Hollywood big-wig handing a 10 year old a few million dollars and saying ""Hey kid, wanna make a movie"", then he leaves the kid to do whatever the Hell he wants.<br/><br/>POINTLESS, UTTERLY POINTLESS."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>In 2002, the original ""Resident Evil"" was released to mixed criticism. Whilst some watched the film and enjoyed it for it's violence and gore, some watched it and hated it because they thought it dull or because it wasn't close enough to the computer game. That first film did leave a blatant path open for a sequel however and two years later we've been given more of the same.<br/><br/>Carrying on almost straight after the original, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" deals with the Umbrella Corporation accidentally infecting the whole of Racoon City with The T Virus. Within hours people are running for their lives as former friends and loved ones try to rip them limb from limb. With Racoon City quarantined and sealed off, Alice (Milla Jovovich reprising her role from the original), Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and others all work together to escape and to survive attacks from the un-dead and from an old friend of Alice's.<br/><br/>A lot of people will chastise ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" for being unfaithful to the games. Whilst personally being a relative newcomer to the games, it's apparent that certain major characters are treated lightly in this film and never given the chance to shine. Unlike the abysmal ""Street Fighter"" (1994), Paul Anderson's script has not compromised itself by keeping all of the main characters alive and well. Willing to kill off one or two of the less well known roles, Anderson has also missed a few out altogether (leaving the opportunity to introduce them in the, blatantly planned for, third film).<br/><br/>Another large criticism of this film seems to be this feeling that it is dull. This is an amazing accusation since from the first moment we have death and destruction on a large scale. We are given fight scenes between Alice and Nemesis, we are given un-dead dogs running wild, we are even given blood thirsty un-dead children. Personally there seems little else Anderson (writer) and Witt (director) could have done.<br/><br/>There is little doubt that this film was ever made as anything more than a continuation of a franchise. With a beginning recapping the first film, and a conclusion which is so blatantly in need of a follow up that ""To Be Continued"" should have been shown, the creators of this series are playing the money card. The problem though is that it's almost as if people didn't expect this to be the case. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" was never going to round off nicely and leave us fully satisfied. It's one aim for a conclusion is to make us want to watch it again and to make us want them to hurry up and make number three. On a personal note, both these criteria were admirably satisfied.<br/><br/>To summarise, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" was never going to be anything but a violent bloodbath blockbuster. It's faced serious criticism, but this was also to be expected. This film might not really have introduced anything new and fresh to it's audience, but it's kept a lot of people entertained. With violence from the start to the finish, it leaves some of the audience bored whilst it leaves others happy. With a third no doubt in the pipeline, those who enjoyed this film (myself included) will wait patiently for the story to continue, whilst those who hated it will groan at the thought of another. Obviously this is just one of those times where a violent no-brainer can't satisfy everyone. Shame."
"jmc4769","7","1","3","5 October 2004"," The least you need to know
","Character Development: Not much, but typical for an action movie.<br/><br/>Character Appeal: Milla Jovovich plays a kind of female Arnold Schwarzenegger, a grown-up Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She's no great actress, but she's convincing as a zombie-killer. She also has a natural, unaltered-by-plastic-surgery, beauty that makes her very appealing to the male target audience of this movie.<br/><br/>Cinematography and Editing: OK overall. However, as in some other recent movies of this genre, you can't really see much when the zombies are being hit by punches, kicks or bullets due to a combination of quick cuts and rapid camera movement. This may bother some people, but I didn't mind it too much.<br/><br/>Gore: Surprisingly little for a zombie movie, mainly due to the camera movement and editing mentioned above.<br/><br/>Holes in the Plot: Typical for an action movie. The biggest one I noticed--zombies only appear when they are necessary to the plot. At times the city seems completely deserted, not a zombie in sight. At other times, on cue, masses of them appear out of nowhere. <br/><br/>My Take: I liked The Apocalypse better than the first movie because it takes place in Raccoon City rather than in the subterranean Hive, which I found to be too monotonous and confining. This movie delivers what it promises--non-stop action from beginning to end. It's not going to win any Academy Awards, but it's good escapist entertainment. (6 out of 10)"

Nothing new, nothing exciting, and above all nothing scary. The Nemesis character was wasted in a few short scenes, too many subplots, and too much ""evil corporate shenanigans"". Where was the edge of my seat suspense the first one created so well?

"Kallanta","Null","1","3","16 September 2004"," I wouldn't DOWNLOAD a movie this bad!
","I remember walking out of the original 'Resident Evil' pleasantly buzzing but at the same time wishing, just a little bit, that a few more aspects of the video game it was based on were present in the film. For what it was Paul W.S. Anderson, the very same person who all but raped both the Alien and Predator movie franchises not too long ago, managed to craft a nifty little zombie horror film that catered to fans of the game series and was still perfectly accessible to the average Joe. The editing was tight, the scares were plentiful, and the action was well staged. It's main failing, as in any overly-stylish mish-mash of blood and guts, was its dialogue, which was stilted, shiftless, and generally silly. But that was okay-it was fun anyway!<br/><br/>In 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', first time director Alexander Witt gets the big chair while Mr. Anderson takes a step back, putting himself instead in a producer's role as well as writing the movie's script. Yep, that's right! The primary weakness of the first film is the foundation upon which a completely green director is to turn a film into a franchise. Ultimately, then, I can't really blame Mr. Witt for the miserably stupid movie that he's made; rather I prefer to praise him for the one star he did earn, instead of killing him for the remaining 3 he missed out on. The fact is I would not even download this movie. It was neither worth my money, nor especially my time. <br/><br/>The set-up is simple. You've seen it before in a million other, better films. A town is filled with zombies and a few characters need to escape. Fewer will actually succeed. In this case, we have Milla Jovovich's character Alice, sole survivor from the first film, walking around barefoot in nothing but a hospital gown, eventually meeting up with another vaguely interesting group of characters. Among these is Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the primary heroine from the games and who is given absolutely no set up or back-story or even much for clothing, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), a mercenary for the dastardly Umbrella corporation on a special mission to do something that never gets explained, and a pimp named LJ played by Mike Epps who is there for the racial slang and stereotypes that only a sassy, loud-mouthed pimp can provide. Meanwhile an extremely well armed, leather clad super-zombie called the Nemesis hunts our heroes with a chain gun and a rocket-launcher.<br/><br/>All of these factors worked in the video game (Resident Evil 3's subtitle is 'Nemesis'), but that's the problem: video games are perfectly justified in creating ludicrous ways to threaten the player-as long as it's fun, it will rarely if ever be questioned. Movies have the extra burden of plausibility.<br/><br/>The first movie was half-way believable, so therefore this movie should be, right? So why do we get a movie where armies of undead, from whom a single bite will un-kill you, are completely ineffective against kung-fu? I like kung-fu in my movies just as much as the next guy and I freely admit that kung-fu and zombies are a combination I had yet to be exposed to, but this is just ridiculous! And if the dead are coming back to life by the legion then why, oh WHY, are they taking a shortcut through a graveyard?! While we're at it, why doesn't anyone think to shoot the Nemesis in his unarmored head? Oh and how did that motorcycle ramp end up behind that stained glass window?<br/><br/>Let's take a look at the teeny-tiny bright side. There are a few funny lines, including a particularly funny reference to the Grand Theft Auto, or GTA, series of games. The special effects are solid and that's always nice.<br/><br/>There are some nice superhero moments here and there and some of the stunts are cool to watch. The camp value is running overtime as well, so this will probably be a good film to invite your friends over for a few beers with. Otherwise it's just loud, violent, and stupid.<br/><br/>All said, this movie is as brash and silly as any film could possibly dare to be. The fact that it comes from a decent pedigree in both video games and in its prequel is only a further slap in the face to both art forms. Paul W.S. Anderson is by no means a talented director. He is mediocre and occasionally lucky at best, but for once I think I wish his hand was a bit more prevalent to this movie. I hated this film. Maybe after a lot of alcohol I could be convinced otherwise but until then I want both my time and my money back.<br/><br/>1 star (out of 4)."

","Possible spoilers throughout entire thing.<br/><br/>Alright, first of all, yes there were many great action-packed scenes, but not one of them made a lick of sense. There were so many coincidences that I though the movie could never end, because at the last second everyone was bound to be saved by some character who was brought in to save a main character, only to die immediately after. Let's talk about the massive amount of plot holes and terrible, TERRIBLE instances where I just wanted to see the preview for the Grudge one more time. So some people find refuge in a church right? Then there are these lickers who are too fast to be killed, and they are running out of ammo. LUCKILY, Alice just happened to be riding by on her motorcycle and was like, hey, maybe there are some people inside who are being attacked. I should probably drive my bike through a stained glass window just in case. And sure enough she saves the day. Then, for no reason whatsoever, they find themselves walking casually through a graveyard. Now there should be no real danger here because the corpses buried in the ground have not actually been infected by the T-Virus. Only people who were in the hive or were bitten by people from the hive turn into zombies. But lo and behold, the dead rise from the grave, again for no reason except there hasn't been a fight scene in ten minutes. Of course the zombies fight one at a time, because they still have morals, and none of the main characters get a bite or a scratch on them. Oh, and then the worst part of the movie except for the eyes bleeding scene, occurs when they go to the school looking for a little girl. ""Wow! This is a big creepy place, the three of us should split up. Oh, you've never fired a gun? It's easy just aim for the head."" Yeah, this is what I'd want to hear too. Then, the chick who can't fire a gun finds a horde of kiddie zombies, but because she sucks, she dies. But then the little girl, who has no weapons shows up in the very room where these zombies just were, and she's fine. Yep, a little unarmed girl should be just fine in a school full of zombies, and those dog things, especially when shes following them around so she can see who they just killed. Real plausible guys, thanks. Then Jill and the girl are in the kitchen and are attacked by a dog when you guessed it, a no name character saves them, but is tragically killed in the next 30 seconds. Who knew? Then when Jill turns on all the gas to blow up the dogs, her match goes out. But again Alice is there with a lit cigarette and she thinks to herself, you know what, Jill probably turned on all the gas, I should throw my butt into the kitchen and save the day. Worst of all ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the movie, Alice stops the guard from sounding the alarm by, wait that can't be right, oh no she DID just make that guy bleed from the eyes by LOOKING AT HIM THROUGH A CAMERA! Oh yeah and then everyone becomes a member of Umbrella, the company they were trying to destroy. Makes sense to me! Basically it did have action, and the black guy would have made the movie, if it hadn't sucked. Whoever wrote this probably should have tried to make one scene lead into another, instead of just saying hey this would be cool, but it wouldn't make sense, oh well those jackasses won't know the difference anyways. All in all, good action, terrible acting, terrible plot, and you guessed it too many coincidences. I wish my life were like this movie, then everyone who wasn't important enough for me to know their name could always sacrifice themselves so my life, which makes no sense at all, could continue. Thank God they set up for another sequel. This one will take place on Mars, or under the sea. Why? Apparently it doesn't matter why. But all I know is next time I'm in a church or a school surrounded by the walking dead, I'm going to suggest we split up and pray Alice comes to the rescue. I think I'll save my money for the next one and I'll rate this one a -2/10, because I hate Hollywood now."

Seriously, almost the third movie I've walked out of, the other two being ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Speed 2""<br/><br/>Where to start? Flimsy excuse of a plot which really gives no background on ANY of the characters, except save Alice perhaps; but most of that I knew because the ""plot"" was pretty much the basis of the Resident Evil 2 video game. The writers seem to just make up anything they want next without any explanation (shining example: At one point the gang is helpless, hands binded behind the back, then moments later, with no explanation, everyone is holding pocket knives behind their back cutting their own bonds.) Choppy-edited fighting scenes try to disguise the lack of any actual stunt work. Throw in Mike Epps as the token ""black guy who says funny things"". Gee didn't see that coming. As a matter of fact, I think I've seen everything in this and every other half-assed movied that's ripped off ""The Matrix"" since 1999. Oh yeah, and Alice can also jump 20 feet high and run tethered sideways down skyscrapers at 50 mph.<br/><br/>Honestly, I thought the same guy that must do the Mountain Dew commercials wrote and directed this. Maybe a seventh-grader put together the storyboard for him. Whereas Alien Vs.

It's a sad day indeed when a video game has longer scene takes.<br/><br/>I suggest fans of the genre skip this one, check out any other zombie film they can think of, then write Anderson a letter begging him to keep his ape-like mitts off genre films forever.

The first movie was laughable at best, but Apocalypse makes it look like pure gold. Don't believe me when I say its nothing like the game?

I'm sure all you people who never played the games were at least curious as to who the heck Jill was, since they never even brought up any information about her.

His presence in this movie thus makes it twice as good as the first one and sadly is the only good thing I can say about it. <br/><br/>What's not to like? Plenty. Many of the action sequences seem to have been directed by Michael Bay on a big dose of meth and a six-pack of Jolt. The result: a mostly indistinguishable blur of images. My guess is that this technique negates the need for having to spend money on the required special effects needed for clear footage.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in regards to the acting, I would have wished that some of the scenes were blurred out so I could not see such pathetic performances. I wonder if the actors involved were ever surprised that an emotionless take was deemed acceptable by the director. So sad that in a zombie movie, the undead emote more than most of the main characters.<br/><br/>Finally, the matter that annoys me most about this film is the completely ridiculous scenes defying all logic. For example, people out run bullets and missiles, deliver more damage with punches and kicks than massive gunfire, and in one scene are even saved from an explosion by a PLASTIC garbage bin! <br/><br/>An almost complete waste of time and an insult to the intelligence of the viewer."

Things like, oh I don't know... plot, coherent scene structure, oh and a side of enjoyment. <br/><br/>OK, enough of my random whining. Down to the meat of this rancid corpse of a movie. It was nothing like the original. That can be expected, but when the original formula went so well (styling, action flow, pacing, and the great music), you shouldn't change things. The new action sequences were way too fast, to jumpy and all-in-all just incomprehensible. <br/><br/>The zombies were as unpredictable as a crack junkie with nothing but a rubber chicken to his name and the will to use it. They freakin' appeared and disappeared as if Sigfried, Roy, Stephen Hawking and the entire cast of Diff'rent Strokes were on the sidelines, messin' with all of Raccoon City. Maybe I'm just too much of a Romero-Zombie fan, but I think that an entire city block of zombies shouldn't pop in to eat one person and then wander off 'aimlessly' in less than 4 seconds. Oh, and what about the graveyard full of zombies that clawed their way out of the ground in unison? This isn't 'Return of the Living Dead,' man. There was no set up or explanation for that, dude. I thought that in order to become a freakin' zombie, you had to be infected with the T-virus... What, did they claw their way from inside the Hive or something? ""Hey, man, let's get out of this hive thing and go eat some brains. There's the door right there."" ""No dude... I've got a better idea. Hope you brought your shovel."" When they popped up, I half expected Jacko to pop in and lead them in a synchronized dance to the rap stylings of the late, great Vincent Price. OK, I'm running out of room here.

Well, instead of keeping the both of you as an unbeatable pair of killing machines... We're gonna' make you fight each other..."" Milla: (looks to Nemesis and throws a wild stance) ""Now we must kung-fu fight!"" The icing on the freakin' cake was the ""Finish Him"" line from the boss man. I was reaching for my portable arc-welder just to keep my mouth shut long enough so I wouldn't scream out ""Give 'im the pit, Kitana!! What are you waiting for? FORWARD DOWN FORWARD X, CHICK!!""

","Just saw RE: Apocalypse today. I don't play the game and I'm not a particular fan of zombie flicks - I watched it to see Milla Jovovich. She looked incredible in the first RE film. This sequel was, in most cases, a big disappointment. Yes, the story structure was better than in the first movie, but essentially just as insubstantial, if not more so. This is mindless action, with scenes incredibly quickly cut in order to disguise the lack of both real choreographic ability and good-looking martial arts moves. Jill Valentine was a bad Lara Croft imitation (complete with the blue-green top piece), whose only function was to be upstaged by Alice. This is a really bad movie, a major reason for which being that it was wildly underlit, so we couldn't really see what was going on - a flaw that many bad low-budget and over-commercial movies have. More seriously, we couldn't see Milla's face very well. *Sigh!* Now THAT's a crime!<br/><br/>There were one or two cool scenes in the movie, but that doesn't do much to redeem it. This movie gets from me a rating of 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>Incidentally, one of the cool scenes is at the end, when Milla looks into the surveillance camera wearing that crimson lipstick... Whoa! In fact, what this movie mainly failed to do, IMO, was to feature Milla's face more prominently. It should have built its entire shooting style around that great face, as, to an extent, the first movie actually did."

But I thought that Sienna Guillory just didn't fit her part. She was too skinny, and didn't look half as tuff as she acted. She is very pretty and all, but that just didn't do it for me. She acted almost too tuff. I mean, what girl (cop) runs around in a corset to fight the living dead? That was what got me the most. Overall I would give this movie a 2 out of 5.

The whole problem with this is that they did not explain much about the whole project. Also, the Jill Valentine actress was very stiff and the black guy that got whacked by Nemesis was stupid. The movie did make me jump a few times, but overall I was very disappointed, as I liked the first movie a lot. It just seemed to have way many more interesting action scenes and a 100% better ending. I don't think they could really end this movie all that well because they had a bad story to build up to a climax.

"mentalcritic","2","2","12","26 October 2004"," An insult to its predecessor and the audience
","I used to believe that Paul W.S. Anderson was not getting a fair break from the Hollywood studio system. It's an easy belief to support, given that every film he has made so far has been hacked apart by the MPAA or a film studio acting upon MPAA orders. This evening, however, I witnessed a film so indescribably awful that not only do I believe my mother's pet silky terrier can puke up a better script, it has erased any respect I might have one had for Paul Anderson.<br/><br/>The MPAA's R rating is quite meaningless, and that studios cut their film in order to get it is a telling sign of what is wrong with Hollywood today. In Australia, Resident Evil: Apocalypse was passed with the very softcore M rating, and this attempt at a film is a mild M at that. The atmosphere of the first film is absent, and the violence is so toned down that it resembles one of those Modified For Television cuts that were so reviled here in the 1980s.<br/><br/>I now know why they changed the name from Nemesis to Apocalypse. There was once a belief that the Nemesis name is cursed, given that the Star Trek film with the same secondary title tried to compete with a Lord Of The Rings film and failed miserably. I have a funny feeling that Capcom saw the script, imagined what it would look like on film, and quietly asked that it not be associated with their excellent video game. The Nemesis in this film isn't so much an unstoppable killing machine as he is a drooling idiot in need of a friend. The Hunters/Lickers also take a beating here, too, having been confused with Speedy Gonzales.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing in this film are beyond a joke, too. Like all incompetent directors, Alexander Witt rarely keeps his camera still for more than a few seconds at a time. During the hand-to-hand fight scenes, the extraneous camera movement is enough to make me fight off the urge to vomit. I doubt I am the only one, and it certainly makes me glad that I don't have epilepsy. Contrast this with the stable, well-angled shots of the original. Better yet, watch the fight scene with the Nemesis, then contrast it with the shot of Alice putting her foot in the final zombie dog's head during the original. The camera-shaking fad has outlived its welcome by a major factor. Then there's the editing. In the original fast-paced action sequences were mixed in with slow, languid sequences that helped set up an atmosphere.<br/><br/>That's another thing basically lacking from this sequel. Atmosphere. As there is rarely a shot or sequence that lasts more than two minutes due to the incoherent editing, none of the characters are given enough background to seem even slightly human. Anderson spent some time explaining the skills that his characters were meant to have, so it seemed natural when they made use of them. In Witt's film, characters constantly display abilities or skills that the audience was never made privy to before. Constantly-repeated, blurred, obscure footage of doctors injecting a character with their virus do not count.<br/><br/>The worst part, after all these insults to the viewer, is the ending in which we're set up for another sequel. After the dog barf that was served up in the other 85 minutes of this film, to spend another five suggesting that there's going to be more is like a punch in the eye. They should have ditched their plans for a sequel and instead filmed another half-hour of footage for this one. An extra half-hour of exposition or setup would have saved this accident from being a total write-off.<br/><br/>I gave Resident Evil: Apocalypse a one out of ten. The MPAA is constantly moaning about how piracy is eating into their profits, and yet they continue to make garbage like this. Seeing an organisation that controls billions of dollars worth of assets in this kind of denial is really sad to observe."
"dineshaishu","9","1","4","21 May 2019"," Resident evil: apocalypse(2004)
","Following the success of the 2002 adaptation from video game to film that was 'Resident Evil', comes its tantalizingly-trailered sequel, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. I have to say, I was entranced by the trailer of this film. I seriously thought that this film had the potential to rise above 'Mortal Kombat' (1995) and 'Resident Evil' as the best cinematic event to spawn from a video game. 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong, but it certainly doesn't do everything right.<br/><br/>Let's start with a brief synopsis. Firstly, this film picks up literally days after the first drops us off. 'Apocalypse' opens with a rehashed explanation of what we learned about the two main characters in the original, Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Matt Addison (Eric Mabius). Again, we are told that this Umbrella Corporation is an international super-power and that Alice is (or more accurately was) the head of security in an underground research facility dubbed ""The Hive"", which harbored research and specimens pertaining to biological weaponry. After that, we are treated to the scientists who wheeled Addison away at the closure of 'Evil', opening the zombie-infested annals of ""The Hive"". Immediately before the audience 'knows' what happens (its pretty obvious and is given away in the final shots of the first 'RE') we transition into a militaristic evacuation of important personnel associated with Umbrella Corp. After a few assorted events that do (and simultaneously do not) move the plot line (a 'do not' being the lead-scientist asking how bad the situation is). After this, we are introduced to nearly a half-dozen other characters, including a renegade police officer (Sienna Guillory), the remaining members of an elite task force (Oded Fehr, Zack Ward), a VERY stereotypical Black man (Mike Epps) and a hulking creature (which, if you paid attention to the first 'RE', you would be aware of its appearance) that totes both a rocket-launcher and a hand-held chain gun named the ""Nemesis"".<br/><br/>As far as performances go, the aforementioned actors and actresses do well with the material that they are given. Guillory has Helen of Troy (not from the film 'Troy') on her resume, as Jovovich has Joan of Arc, Fehr has the mummy hunter, Ardeth Bay from the 'Mummy' series and Epps is credible in several comedies. There is no real emotion in the script, so the viewers really can't ask for any emotion from the actors (sadly true).<br/><br/>That is where 'Apocalypse' stumbles, and in many places, falls on it's face.<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the audience until the last ten minutes (which is a near-complete turn around from the original, which actually evoked SOME thought from the audience). It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot 'em up. The small sub-plots really vary from little to no relevance in the story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of 'oh no, my friend was bitten and eventually, I'll have to kill him just before he bites me' situation, and the big action/set pieces are blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot, with their arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an ass-kicking femme fatal, and finishes the film being...oh, you guessed it, an ass-kicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine (Guillory) is another one of these masculinely tough females, although sans Alice's super powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the epitome of black stereotypes, played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic, however that my favorite bit of 'Apocalypse' involved a reference to another video game franchise.<br/><br/>Again, 'RE: Apocalypse' is not completely bad. Although few, it has its moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience, which was something needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time (although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and h"

","This film is just so poor, and what is disappointing is that it had so much potential. Like many other commentators have noted, it is true that the cinematography is good - it has been executed expensively by people who know what they are doing. The script not only lets the film own, but is the hole that the the film falls ungracefully into. The movie makers obviously wanted a sequel, but had no idea of how to create one along the imaginative lines of the first film. What happens to the sequel, is that it falls into 'Dawn of the Dead' territory, and desperately does not know how to get out of it, bar repeating various scenes from the first film in mildly varying forms. The continuing masculinsation of the female characters is tedious - although the fight scenes are great. Milla continuously pops up at perfectly the right time with the key equipment - be it a motorbike or a cigarette. This film is so far removed from reality that it disappears up its own removed rear, without ever truly capturing the imagination which a fantasy feature simply has to do."

Anyway, it couldn't have been better since the script gave me that 'Batman & Robin' feeling that would work for a twelve-year-old and maybe even bring them to a slight exaltation but would leave everybody above the age of fifteen with the feeling that they're not watching the right movie. Compared to the first part, this one was like 'Tom & Jerry' to 'Beauty & the Beast' - lots of action - no story at all."
"Tweekums","5","1","4","19 September 2008"," Not scary enough but okay if you are in the right mood
","I wasn't expected too much from this film but I was expecting a bit more than I got. The one thing that all horror films need is to be scary and this sadly lacked any real scares.<br/><br/>The film is set in Raccoon City where the sinister Umbrella organisation has released hoards of Zombies infected with the T-virus, anybody being bitten by them catches the virus, dies within a few hours and becomes a zombie themselves. They also release Alice who has also been infected with the T-virus but for some reason she isn't turned into a zombie but instead gets super-human strength. The other main characters are two cops and a reporter who are among those trapped in the city. After meeting up with Alice the group gets a phone call from a scientist who promises to get them out of the city if they find his daughter and bring her out with them. Along the way they meet another cop who worked for Umbrella till the abandoned him in the city and a civilian who appears to be there for light relief. On top of the regular zombies we see dog-zombies and a creature known as Nemesis that seems to be part of the same experiment as Alice.<br/><br/>While the film isn't good it isn't totally with out merit, I thought that Sienna Guillory was pretty good as Valentine, one of the cops and I did chuckle when the when the comedy-civilian crashed his car because he was distracted by a couple of topless zombie-hookers. I wasn't too keen on the ending which just seemed like a set up for the next sequel.<br/><br/>As I've not played the game that the film is based on I can't say whether or not the film follows the same plot or if the films characters are good representations of those in the game. I wouldn't recommend buying this film but if it is on TV and you are bored it passes a couple of hours."

They make sure you see tough characters smoking cigarettes. I've never seen anyone I gym or jog with smoke a cigarette. I realize we aren't supposed to fixate on reality, but we shouldn't have to be force fed complete garbage, either.<br/><br/>Everyone is an acrobat, unless we're talking about someone who doesn't deserve to live.

We could almost accept old time zombies being brainless, but now these new ones have incredible motor skills. Where from? Again, more goofball crap.<br/><br/>A few likable characters keep this from being a total bomb. Clearly not a good movie, however.

So, while I didn't expect very much (because of the reviews) I still expected to be at least somewhat entertained for 90 minutes. Problem is: I wasn't entertained for 90 minutes. I wasn't entertained at all.<br/><br/>The main problem with the movie is that there are no characters. Sure, there are people in the movie, but we don't get to know them. They're just there, running about, shooting zombies, acting cool. I couldn't care less about what happened to these mannequins. Another problem is the disjointed narrative. It takes way to long to get the main ""characters"" together, and before they manage to do that the movie is very boring. This is because, as I said, it feels disjointed and episodic. Yet another problem is the acting. Most of these people couldn't act to save their lives.<br/><br/>It's probably unfair to compare it to other recent zombie flicks such as 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Dawn of the Dead. All of these movies I like a lot. But they're not only action movies, they are as much dramas or comedies with a bit of horror in the mix. I guess the only movie I can fairly compare RE: Apocalypse to is the first RE movie. The comparison is sure to be unfavourable.

","As a big fan of the first movie I am somewhat taken aback by the terrible plotting and execution of this film. Frankly, ""Apocalypse"" was a big disappointment. However, it has enough cool action sequences, special effects, and Milla in yet another gams-revealing outfit with sexy fetish boots to be worth a rental. <br/><br/>The movie takes place immediately after (and a little before) the ending of Resident Evil. The T-virus quickly spreads throughout Raccoon City and only handfuls of unlucky non-zombie citizenry remain. The Umbrella Company & their evil henchmen are more fleshed out in this movie, fronted by a blonde, Aryan man with a German accent (infer what you like) with no regard for human life. We are also introduced to a new kick-ass gammy heroine, cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory, who in comparison gives us a whole new appreciation of Milla Jovovich), T-virus creator Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris, who deserves soooo much better), and jive-talking' 70s throwback L.J. (Mike Epps). Acting across the board is quite wooden, with Milla giving the most heartfelt, textured performance (which says a lot).<br/><br/>The strength of the first movie was The Mission, which provided a strong narrative line that kept you riveted to the action until the end of the movie. In contrast, the plot for ""Apocalypse"" is a mess, going off on a dozen different tangents and never giving you a chance to feel attached to any character other than Alice. Another thing about Resident Evil Uno that I liked was the way things didn't neatly work out for the characters, and how they and us had to accept some harsh realities. ""Apocalypse"" has inexplicable saves, coincidences, and total candy-coated clich√É¬© situations that infuriated me--it reminded me in no small way of an Irwin Allen disaster movie from the 70s. And the miserable ending seemed tacked-on and particularly stupid.<br/><br/>Special effects and zombie gore are decent but quite watered-down in comparison with a Dawn of the Dead (either version) or 28 Days Later. The most memorable zombies are in the school scene and the pair of topless hookers. The hulking Nemesis monster looks ridiculous with guns and a missile launcher--it's like giving The Hulk an Uzi. The score is decent and sounds quite similar to Don Davis's work on The Matrix, but I longed for the minimalist yet creepy sounds of Marilyn Manson's work on the first movie. <br/><br/>Overall an unmemorable sequel that you'll begin to forget almost as soon as the end credits roll--unlike the first film, from which I continue to remember scenes like the infamous ""laser hall"" and Rain Ocampo's valiant struggle against her own doom. <br/><br/>And remember kiddies--when the dead walk the Earth, take that shortcut through the graveyard!"
"ajbzerosignal84","4","1","4","23 January 2005"," An action film that offers a visual experience and nothing else
","OK, let me get straight to the point and start off by saying that this film is functioned by one simple pro and one massive con. The pro being the near endless action that occurs in RE:A, (even though the majority of it lacks any realism or sense) and the con being that the dialogue in this film has got to be some of the worst in any film that I have seen in 2004 - even though I've avoided such proverbial stinkers like Catwoman and House of the Dead. The film's plot is as basic as ever. Following the events that occurred from the first film, Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakes from the Umbrella hospital to a desolate Raccoon city which has succumbed to the T-Virus that once infected the Hive, here she roams the zombie-plagues streets in a bid to find survivors. Among them she finds S.T.A.R.S member Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and a batch of RPD officers, and together they unite to escape the city. However, their problems are increased when they are pursued by a colossal hulking monster called the Nemesis which is being controlled by Umbrella. What follows (after the plot literally falls apart in front of your eyes) is the most unbelievable, non-sensical action you'll probably see, ever, in an action film. Hollywood cinematographer veteran Alexander Witt makes his directional debut with this film under the screenplay of Paul W.S Anderson, and it blatantly seems that Anderson had spend more time focusing on his Alien Vs. Predator project more than the work on this film. Because RE:A really does seemed rushed due to the fact that there is absolutely no character development whatsoever, enormous plot holes that would require an uneducated deaf-blind monkey to not acknowledge. But, if its any consolation, this film pays more homage to the video games than the previous film did, including several references and shot-by-shot scenes which are taken straight from the series. And because of the bigger budget, the visual effects have vastly improved from that of the original, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it still comes of as a failed attempt to create a wholesome action film. Its a good thing I'm such a fan of the Resident Evil game series, because if I wasn't - or if this film wasn't Resident Evil - the following score would've been a lot lower.<br/><br/>Score 5.5/10"

For a film about zombies it sure doesn't pay much attention to them, instead focusing on some of the most fake looking monsters I have ever seen.

"Kallanta","Null","1","4","16 September 2004"," I wouldn't even DOWNLOAD this movie.
","I remember walking out of the original 'Resident Evil' pleasantly buzzing but at the same time wishing, just a little bit, that a few more aspects of the video game it was based on were present in the film. For what it was Paul W.S. Anderson, the very same person who all but raped both the Alien and Predator movie franchises not too long ago, managed to craft a nifty little zombie horror film that catered to fans of the game series and was still perfectly accessible to the average Joe. The editing was tight, the scares were plentiful, and the action was well staged. It's main failing, as in any overly-stylish mish-mash of blood and guts, was its dialogue, which was stilted, shiftless, and generally silly. But that was okay-it was fun anyway!<br/><br/>In 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', first time director Alexander Witt gets the big chair while Mr. Anderson takes a step back, putting himself instead in a producer's role as well as writing the movie's script. Yep, that's right! The primary weakness of the first film is the foundation upon which a completely green director is to turn a film into a franchise. Ultimately, then, I can't really blame Mr. Witt for the miserably stupid movie that he's made; rather I prefer to praise him for the one star he did earn, instead of killing him for the remaining 3 he missed out on. The fact is I would not even download this movie. It was neither worth my money, nor especially my time. <br/><br/>The set-up is simple. You've seen it before in a million other, better films. A town is filled with zombies and a few characters need to escape. Fewer will actually succeed. In this case, we have Milla Jovovich's character Alice, sole survivor from the first film, walking around barefoot in nothing but a hospital gown, eventually meeting up with another vaguely interesting group of characters. Among these is Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the primary heroine from the games and who is given absolutely no set up or back-story or even much for clothing, Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), a mercenary for the dastardly Umbrella corporation on a special mission to do something that never gets explained, and a pimp named LJ played by Mike Epps who is there for the racial slang and stereotypes that only a sassy, loud-mouthed pimp can provide. Meanwhile an extremely well armed, leather clad super-zombie called the Nemesis hunts our heroes with a chain gun and a rocket-launcher.<br/><br/>All of these factors worked in the video game (Resident Evil 3's subtitle is 'Nemesis'), but that's the problem: video games are perfectly justified in creating ludicrous ways to threaten the player-as long as it's fun, it will rarely if ever be questioned. Movies have the extra burden of plausibility.<br/><br/>The first movie was half-way believable, so therefore this movie should be, right? So why do we get a movie where armies of undead, from whom a single bite will un-kill you, are completely ineffective against kung-fu? I like kung-fu in my movies just as much as the next guy and I freely admit that kung-fu and zombies are a combination I had yet to be exposed to, but this is just ridiculous! And if the dead are coming back to life by the legion then why, oh WHY, are they taking a shortcut through a graveyard?! While we're at it, why doesn't anyone think to shoot the Nemesis in his unarmored head? Oh and how did that motorcycle ramp end up behind that stained glass window?<br/><br/>Let's take a look at the teeny-tiny bright side. There are a few funny lines, including a particularly funny reference to the Grand Theft Auto, or GTA, series of games. The special effects are solid and that's always nice.<br/><br/>There are some nice superhero moments here and there and some of the stunts are cool to watch. The camp value is running overtime as well, so this will probably be a good film to invite your friends over for a few beers with. Otherwise it's just loud, violent, and stupid.<br/><br/>All said, this movie is as brash and silly as any film could possibly dare to be. The fact that it comes from a decent pedigree in both video games and in its prequel is only a further slap in the face to both art forms. Paul W.S. Anderson is by no means a talented director. He is mediocre and occasionally lucky at best, but for once I think I wish his hand was a bit more prevalent to this movie. I hated this film. Maybe after a lot of alcohol I could be convinced otherwise but until then I want both my time and my money back.<br/><br/>1 star (out of 4)."

Kill a bad creature, then kill a hundred of them, and then face a worse creature. Move to next board, where you face a hundred of the worse creatures, and then get introduced to another character, who meets the next level in depravity.<br/><br/>This film lacks all intelligence - you can take a thirty minute bathroom break and not miss anything, except for violence and gore. Very similar to watching a hardcore gamer play through a video game. <br/><br/>If you think this review is too cynical, whatever.

The special effects seem pretty decent as far as action shots mostly involving the character Alice (Milla Jovovich) trying to out bad the Terminator. But most of the Zombie shots are intentionally kept quick or blurry (did we spend all our money on BOOM effects and not save any for make up?). The Lickers are okay as far as CG goes but don't really satisfy. To give credit though the Nemesis outfit is pretty cool looking.<br/><br/>The best sequence in the movie is probably the first meeting of Alice and Nemesis.

A few effects were very nice and had that 'ooh ahh' factor, which is the only reason one might opt to see this movie at the theater. Other than that I don't recommend spending those $9. The story was very predictable and worse had many cheesy lines. Of course that is to be expected in an action film, which is what the movie ended up being.

"tenten76","6","1","4","15 September 2004"," Only suitable for the braindead.
","First off, if you're reading my comments you need to know: I loved the first Resident Evil film, and know all about the videogames (although I'm rubbish at them, and couldn't care less if the movies 'stick to the plot').<br/><br/>Right then, here we go - Resident Evil 2 is the victim of more bad directing decisions (and lack of talent) than Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.<br/><br/>In fact, Jar Jar Binks had better lines than Milla did in this one - and a deeper character.<br/><br/>I don't want to criticise the cast & crew too much, because RE2 fills all the boxes on looking good - but the (first time feature-length) director Alexander Witt deserves all the stinging criticism you can throw, with lesser vitriol directed towards the people in charge of Sound, Editing and (apologies to Paul Thomas Anderson), the utterly abysmal script. The plot is no better or worse than the first one; it's the execution that stinks to high Heaven.<br/><br/>I'm used to seeing films screened for a media crowd - people who would sell their Grandmother and throw in their own sister to 'hit target', who know (and care) absolutely nothing about films, and see no shame in asking a row of people to 'shove along' 5 minutes into the movie because they've been sitting in the bar and couldn't be bothered to come and take a seat. They are scum. And even they laughed along with me throughout this pile of unmitigated nonsense calling itself a sequel.<br/><br/>I don't want to ruin the film for you (the Director has done a fine job of that himself) and I'm not going to tell you to avoid this at all costs, because I ignored the same advice myself.<br/><br/>So, in the style of the film, here's a few random thoughts: Milla and Sienna are both gorgeous, but it's hard to keep a straight face when you see what they're dressed in, or how 'hard' they think they are, or the absurd stunts, moves and decisions they make all the way through the film. (special mention for Sienna, who would surely want to leave her performance - if you can call it that - off any future CV). Oded Fehr carries a lot of weight in this film; problem is it's on his face. Old chubby-cheeks makes the most ludicrous entrance, and you can't help thinking that somewhere in Raccoon City there's a kebab shop with nobody behind the till. The top Umbrella scientist had me howling with laughter, like a bad Stephen Hawking joke, and the evil Umbrella leader-guy suffers from a comedy-Euro accent. The zombies are just poor; badly lit and directed, as if they only had make-up for a dozen, and new extras drafted in on a daily basis. Unusually, the comedy relief character is actually amusing from time-to-time. The monsters are rubbish - three lickers left over from RE1 (in the most outrageously terrible, over-the-top 'fight in a church' I've ever seen), a handful of demon Dobermanns (also left over from #1) only now even less intelligent, and the big reason for the sequel - Nemesis, who appears in a sequence which was surely left on the cutting-room floor from Terminator 2 (and for good reason). I've been more scared by things that have come out my nostrils, and if you're going to have 'super talents' including super-jumps TRY not to make it look like the actor is on a trampoline. There was a lot of talk about Milla's 'running down a building' bit. Well, Pierce Brosnan has done it way better in Bond, and in fact it's not a patch on that jeans advert where the boy & girl crash through walls and then run out into the sky. And - skipping to the end - Alice vs Nemesis is poor, followed by a blatant (and totally over-extended) setup for a third sequel (think what they did to Ripley for Alien3). At least we got to see Milla naked again, which seems to be the obligatory book-end of these Resi films - something I am in favour of. Perhaps the worst thing of all is that (a) there is virtually no gore or horror (who the hell do they think the audience for this film is??) and (b) the MTV editing and idiot-level direction kill any flow or interest in any & every fighting scene. Did I mention that even pets would be able to follow this film, given the constant and embarrassing exposition - either through 'futuristic graphics', or trite dialogue.<br/><br/>My God this film is bad. By all means see it, but don't say I didn't warn you."

","Paul W. S. Anderson flushes another film down the can... For the first half of the movie it seemed like it had a chance, though if you've never played the game you would really be lost by some of the new cast, such as Jill Valentine. A few newspaper clippings and suddenly she is an expert on infected people. How does she know about the virus, she has no real background story unless you have played the game. Even so she was never involved in the previous film yet she already is aware of the outbreak. Now Nemesis was the biggest disappointment of all, the make up effects lacked so much detail, he was the biggest, bulkiest, and lamest enemy. Unlike in the game he is very slow and dramatic, not at all frightening. A good opening, a bad corny enemy, cheap ploys from the game which serve no purpose to the story. I found the movie lacking in such a high degree, that i would rather watch Return of the Living Dead rather than Resident Evil: Apocalypse. At least Return of the Living Dead was a comedy horror that i could laugh at.

","You know that moment in every action or horror movie when the baddie is just about to kill, maim, bite, or otherwise put the hurt on a sympathetic character, when another, unseen sympathetic character shoots/stabs/whatevers the baddie in JUST the nick of time? ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is an entire film based around just repeating that moment again and again and again. Each time, the director (who's somehow less famous and reputable than Paul W.S. Anderson, if that's conceivable) honestly seems to expect us to react to it, which borders on insulting. While it's not the worst movie of the year (""Day After Tomorrow"" and ""AvP"" have it beat, while ""Chronicles of Riddick"" has it just about even), it's easily the most repetitive, predictable and stale--pretty much every shot or sequence you see is blatantly ripped off from some other movie.<br/><br/>If there is a redeeming quality to this movie, it's the nice assortment of surprisingly subtle visual references to the classic ""Resident Evil 2"" video game, on which it is loosely based. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have abandoned that great game's penchant for eerie atmospheric thrills in favor of constant, ridiculous action. Making an action movie out of ""Resident Evil 2,"" a game firmly routed in the cinematic traditions of horror, is akin to making a horror movie out of ""Virtua Fighter""--it's just the wrong idea.<br/><br/>Though they may draw similar audiences, horror and action actually aren't all that compatible, and nothing drives that point home like sitting through this movie. It sacrifices scares for explosions, atmosphere for flashy edits, and human fear for superhuman kung fu heroics. The constant use of the aforementioned just-in-time device is an attempt to artificially inject some real fear and tension, but it fails because of its predictability.<br/><br/>I'd compare this to the first ""Resident Evil"" film if I could remember anything about it besides Milla's brief nudity. This film, thankfully, seems destined to fade from memory just as quickly--leaving only fleeting glimpse of Milla's goodies behind."

The first ""Resident Evil"" was a pretty cool movie though it didn't have any of the characters from the games we've come to enjoy. Milla's character though was cool enough to make up for that combined with the promise of Nemesis in the second. In terms of the second story though, the only good thing about it was Nemesis and even that was flawed due to the writer's decision to give him a conscience .<br/><br/>The cliffhanger at the end of the first movie implied the second would be just as freakish with man-eating zombie tension all around. Instead we get some Matrix/Crouching Tiger-type super powered Milla saving the day everywhere she went, taking the point of the story away from what many of us have come to know as the real ""Resident Evil"" - zombies run amuck in Raccoon City due to the nasty Umbrella corporation's inability to keep the T-virus in check. You have the Lickers for all of 10 minutes and Jill Valentine is turned into a shadow of the character many are use to. Ironically enough - though not surprising - the one thing they did get right about Jill's character was her style and clothing. Believe it or not, she did wear her trademark short skirt and breast-riding top, though her personality left much to be desired in terms of having one. Then you have Carlos, which for the most part did his job and did it pretty good, even though the character was actually suppose to be Spanish. As for the Umbrella corporation and the Stars officers...I don't even want to go there. <br/><br/>In terms of action, naturally there was a lot of it, with the highlights being the all too brief first encounter b/t Milla's character and Nemesis as well as the face-off later. Editing took much of the enjoyment out of it though with too brief of scenes abruptly cut off even more to imply fast action but really giving you nothing but a headache. On an upside, the cinematography was striking throughout the movie to offset editing gone wrong. Unfortunately, as disappointed with ""Apocalypse"" as I am, I'm also guilty to admit that I'm compelled to wonder what the 3rd installment would bring - if there is a 3rd. This did leave you in true cliffhanger fashion, with the possibility that the writers actually have a plan. The question lies in whether or not it's any good."

","Saw Resident Evil: Apocalypse tonight. It didn't suck, but it certainly wasn't great. Paul W.S. Anderson needs to stop writing for a while. Just stop. AvP sucked and now this. Everything he writes is glaringly, obviously, PAINFULLY the same. <br/><br/>I liked the first movie. It was atmospheric and chock a block full of zombies. This was...not. There are a few zombies, but you don't see any make-up effects, the actor's direction is horrible, but the action direction is great. Lots and lots of good action...but that's not what I want to see in a Resident Evil movie. I want to see zombies and Lickers (only three?!) and even though the writing in the first movie was lacking, this one lacked any sense of intelligence.<br/><br/>*MAJOR SPOILERS IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH*<br/><br/>How in the hell did the corpses in the cemetery get infected? How did the dogs get infected? How did the infection get from the mansion which is supposed to be far away from the (walled) city all the way into the heart of Racoon City without, oh I don't know, being seen? The brain is the key, destroy the brain, you destroy the zombie. If the doctor's brain was already destroyed (when he was shot by the Major Asshole in charge), how did he come back?!?!?! Why did he infect himself with the T-virus? He was still in the wheelchair so if he were actually testing the virus out on himself, and it didn't work, would he not have considered the whole thing a failure?<br/><br/>*END SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Alexander Witt should stick to second unit work...that is where his true talent lies. Or, perhaps he should find a partner and have them direct the actors while he focuses on the action. Milla Jovovich was good...the rest of the cast was not so good.<br/><br/>And Nemesis. Ugh. I'm glad it wasn't CGI, but the bloody thing looks so fake and...well, it needed some shine. And those boots were ridiculous. They looked like moon shoes. And I laughed when Nemesis and Alice fight at the end. *shakes head* <br/><br/>I dunno. I hope it does well so that George A Romero doesn't lose financing for Land of the Dead and we can get some good zombie movies back into the marketplace instead of poorly written tripe like this.<br/><br/>Ugh...the more I think about it, the more I dislike it. If it weren't for the fact that there are quite a few good zombie scenes (zombies are my favourite ""movie monster""), then I would most definitely downgrade it to Suck."
"bruceleroy","1","1","4","10 September 2004"," Worst Horror Movie EVER
","This ""film"" officially supplants House of the Dead as the worst horror movie of all time. Sure, there has been some low-budget, straight-to-video junk, but I cut them some slack due to budgetary constraints. RE2 obviously has no shortage of money, so it has no excuse for being such a piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Those who think Paul Anderson is such a hack director should realize how competent he is comparing the first RE to this hatchet job by first-time director Alexander Witt. He has no clue how to direct action, as everything is done with quick cuts and shaky camera work, as if he doesn't want us to see how bad the action is (he succeeds). He also obviously is no zombie fan, as he takes the soul out of the movie by minimizing the zombie content in favor of guns, kung fu, and every other bad Hollywood action movie clich√© out there. What zombie footage there is is nullified by bad camera work and an ultra-annoying slow motion/strobing effect that obscures the zombies. Plus, there isn't even a lot of gore. The general story idea is OK, but it takes some stupid turns, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 8 year old. People who make movies based on video games need to realize that the two genres are different; movies require more substance than games. I've haven't played the RE games much, so I don't know how much is included in this movie, but you don't have to throw in every over-the-top element from the game. I don't care about zombie dogs (I overlooked it in the first movie) or all of the characters, who are in fact ridiculous caricatures (what's with the Lara Croft chick?). And who wants to see a zombie with a rocket launcher??? I love zombie movies, but I'd prefer to have no more made than to have any more like this one. I wouldn't even call it a zombie movie (barely even a horror movie); just a standard action movie made for 10 year olds with ADD that just happens to have some zombies."

","First off, I didn't mind the first one, even though I wished that it had more blood and gore in it. Don't expect any more in this installment. I didn't like the twist that they have given the RE storyline with alice being infected and given matrix like powers. It seems like when there is a female lead in this types of movies, they are so over-the-top in their toughness it seems too unbelievable and makes them less sympathetic and likable characters. Jill Valentine and Alice fit right into this category well. Overall, the movie is what you can expect from a video game based movie and has not improved from the first one. Don't waste your time on this movie when movies like 28 days later, shaun of the dead, and the re-make of dawn of the dead are available."

","My basic thoughts on the film are as follows: As a zombie/action movie, it's decent and entertaining; however, it still lacks severely when compared to the awesome Dawn of the Dead remake. As a movie based on a pre-fabricated story and set of characters, it is utterly and horrifyingly terrible. If you like the Resident Evil games, please try and forget that, since it will only make you hurt. Severely. Characters are completely changed. Why even keep the names? Subtracting the name form the equation, the characters are, again, in possession of room-temperature IQ's. ""We need more ammo,"" Jill gripes. Then she kills at least twenty heavily-armed commandos and doesn't even glance at their devastating and superior hardware. Ugh.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that my thoughts will not be dismissed as rabid fandom. true, I like the games. I admit, it's a decent, perhaps even above-average zombie/action movie.

Not because of excellent comedy, but because of how little effort was put into a plot. Besides Milla Jovovich, the acting was aboslutely horrid, I can't believe Sienna Guillory gets roles. Looking at her filmography now, it all makes sense. This could go on and on but I'll stop now. I'll end by saying that you CAN enjoy the 90 minutes you waste in the theatre viewing this film.

It really seemed like the story was just some filler that they had to put in between dead people attacking Milla. The plot holes were glaring and worst of all the acting was terrible, especially Sienna Guillory who just was not believable in her role.

"williambertram","3","1","5","1 March 2020"," Not as good as the first one.
","I loved the first Resident Evil, and rated it 8/10, which in my rating system puts it in my top 60 movies. I loved the Marilyn Manson intro, the Red Queen, the setup, and the fact that it aspired to do something other than excessive pajama fighting, and zombie shooting gallery. It wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" in terms of profundity, but there were enough well done horror and sci-fi / cbyerpunk elements to score well with me. Some of the scenes, particularly early in the movie, were very well done.<br/><br/>In contrast, Apocalypse is nothing but a minor revision of the original plot, excessive pajama fighting, and zombie shooting gallery. I understand Milla Jovovich was supposed to be a bio-enhanced human, so her kung fu now has extra wires and CGI, but super pajama fighting is not, in and of itself, interesting to me. This entire movie could have been reduced to two or three scenes, and appended to the end of the first movie to much better effect.<br/><br/>I have read other reviews which say Apocalypse is closer to the video games than the original, but I have not played them, and don't plan to.<br/><br/>The worst part is, there was no real reason to dumb Apocalypse down. The actors were half-way decent, the budget was there, and they had better effects technology available. Someone could have spent some time removing a lot of the redundant fighting, and try to resuscitate the flat lined second act. There were SOME good ideas, so the production wasn't completely devoid of creativity.<br/><br/>The audio was pretty good, much more electronic than the first one if memory serves. Nothing nearly as good as the Marilyn Manson intro in the first one, still pretty good.<br/><br/>Not recommended. Watch Escape from New York, The Raid Redemption, or Aliens (the second one) if you want a much better ""escape from the hostile zone"" type movie."

","Dumber and more annoying than the first one, Alice now has mental powers, can walk down walls and has x-ray vision, so she can calculate the exact moment in which she crashes down a church with a bike right over two enemies. The cast is as disposable as the one in the first movie, the direction less obsessed with matrix gimmicks, but equally easy to forget. The plot is still as interesting as counting cracks in a wall: citizens trying to escape zombie infested city, yes, Paul WS Anderson once more makes zombies boring. Talk about having the magic touch of dullness.<br/><br/>Anything else to know? There's a token black guy providing comic relief, a sassy female reporter (and surprisingly this is not a Van Damme movie) and bad guys with British accents. Every minute that passes feels dumber and more boring. If you are done with puberty there's no way you could be enjoying this. There are amateur films in youtube about zombies with more creativity than this derivation of a dozen of better zombie movies. Also Paul, i know Milla is hot, and your wife and everything, but she's about as good at acting as you are directing and writing. Stop doing this, for everything that is sacred in this world, just stop and go back to direct music videos, matrix fan films or whatever you were doing before trying to make real movies."
"Electrified_Voltage","4","1","5","26 January 2010"," Way overlong zombie fighting, weak scripting and acting, and other problems make this sequel fail
","I have never played any ""Resident Evil"" games, and didn't see the first movie based on the video game series until last month, over seven years after its theatrical run. I could see how cheesy and immature it was, but with all the adrenaline, it still left me reasonably satisfied. That might not be the case if I were to watch it again, but much of it was a guilty pleasure for me with one viewing. If I hadn't liked it at all, I obviously wouldn't have bothered watching this sequel, but I was impressed enough with the original to be interested in seeing this one. However, I was not too pleased with ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", as I found it not only cheesy, but also not very entertaining. It basically has all the flaws of its predecessor plus more.<br/><br/>After Alice wakes up in the hospital and leaves the building, she discovers that the virus which infected the people in the Hive (Umbrella Corporation's underground facility), and turned them into flesh-eating zombies, has escaped and made it to the surface! Raccoon City is now flooded with these monsters, the kind Alice was previously forced to fight underground, and the city has been closed off under quarantine! Alice has been used for genetic experimentation, and as a result, she has new superpowers, which will come in handy in this infected city. A group of Umbrella soldiers who have not yet been infected find themselves having to take on many members of the Undead and creatures known as Lickers, and just as it looks hopeless during a battle in the church, Alice comes and rescues them. She joins the group, and all of them must fight many enemies in order to have any chance of escaping Raccoon City! <br/><br/>This sequel contains some unimpressive acting and dialogue, as well as underdeveloped characters. All the same can be said about its predecessor, but here, it gets worse. So much of the film seems like one big monster fighting scene, and watching it reminded me a lot of ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" in that regard. Even though I haven't seen that film in a few years, I clearly remember that a lot of it, probably most of it, is like one big scene! Now, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" isn't quite as horribly tedious as that ""Speed"" sequel (I think I've yet to see another film that actually is), but the non-stop monster fighting here is still a big problem. It doesn't help that this first ""Resident Evil"" sequel skips around too fast, and the slow motion effects, among other things, are also cheesy. At least I found a lot of adrenaline in the first film, which is more than I can say about ""Apocalypse"". There are SOME exciting moments here, but certainly not enough.<br/><br/>The first installment in the ""Resident Evil"" movie franchise is hated by many, and I could understand why after seeing it, but since I found that movie so exciting, I couldn't join the haters. When I rented this sequel, I thought maybe it would be a lot like its predecessor, cheesy but certainly not boring, but it turns out I was wrong. It could have easily turned out to be slightly inferior to the original, as sequels usually are, but to me, it turned out to be worse than that. For most of the film, I think I had a puzzled look on my face. Basically, I think the main problems here are that 2004's ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is even more ridiculous than its 2002 predecessor, and it's certainly not very well written. Also, unlike the first film, Paul W.S. Anderson wrote this one but didn't direct it, and Alexander Witt's direction just might have been another factor. Mindless action is common in modern blockbusters, and it can sometimes be entertaining, but unfortunately, this is one of the cases where it's not."

","Well, here we have another vehicle to demonstrate that the typing error with a skirt, Milla Jovovich, really cannot act. Still; there's a lot to be said for being a casting-couch queen. Especially if your bit of giblet happens to be a director. No matter how wretched your ability, you get a starring role in whatever movie twaddle he happens to be knocking-up. <br/><br/>'Resident Evil' had all of the standard formulaic elements of a modern sci-fi horror work. But at least they were put together in a more-or-less orderly and well-paced narrative. It wasn't much, but it was better than nothing.<br/><br/>'Apocalypse' however, is a touch too much. It has all of the predictable elements of the earlier outing but with a far more confused narrative. Flesh-eating zombies are so passe as to be boring in themselves. And the various 'engineered' special creatures have little or nothing new to offer over the original. There's gore a-plenty. There's preposterous 'Matrix'-style action and effects, crassly engineered drama, wooden acting, a lacklustre script. The set-pieces are still solid, there's clever lighting and decent sound-engineering, but they alone can hardly rescue what is, after all, an overlong, clich√©-ridden turkey starring a drab eastern-European hen. A sort of 'Cheeky Girl' with attitude.<br/><br/>'Resident Evil' had just about enough surprises to justify a watch.

"film-critic","3","1","5","13 January 2005"," The infection is spreading faster than anyone could have anticipated.
","I have to admit I loved the first film. It was one of the few films that I thought best represented the video game that it accompanied. Milla was perfectly cast as the lead and the non-linear structure of the film allowed us to see the who, what, where, when, and why of the events. There was just the right amount of terror, the right amount of action, and a whole bunch of originality. I wish, I really wish that I could say the same about it sequel. As the credits rolled and we were brought back up to speed from the last events that occurred in the original only to discover that a new director had decided to helm this project and was obviously handed more money and forced to follow the footsteps of Hollywood. Everything from the original was lost and discarded as a mainstream horror film with maybe zombies (couldn't tell due to the blurry nature of which they ran) moved in to take its place. More money was on the table with, in this case, meant more explosions and less story. A disgrace to the name of both the video game and the original film came in several ways with this inferior sequel, mainly horrible acting, clich√©d characters, a recycled plot, and especially with a amateurish, craft sale created monster known as the Nemesis.<br/><br/>To begin the characters were very disrespectful to the original. I remember hearing of this sequel and hoping they would build more on Milla character, giving her more to work with and more past stories of her time at the Umbrella Corporation. I was a hopeful viewer who wished for more deeply rooted characters with many layers, but found the Hollywood clich√© instead. The entire character known as LJ could have been eliminated with the greatest of ease and without any remorse. His lines were the epitome of every other zombie film created while trying to bring his own game references into a franchise that was doing well on its own (the GTA line nearly took my rage over the top). Like any good supporter of films and video games, I don't mind when they bring in more characters from the series, but let us know who they are first. There was no introduction to Valentine for those less familiar with the series other than she knows how to shoot zombies and she was disbarred from the force (see the writing on the wall). This goes the same for Carlos, who just wandered through his part without really contributing anything worth while, and Nicholai, whom I always considered another villain of the series. Oh well, I guess when tons of Hollywood cash is being thrown in your direction, you can just go crazy with creativity and forget the basis of your film. Yet again, who am I to say? Milla was the only one worth watching in this entire film, and even her character seemed to be turning to cardboard by the end. It was a sad change of events for the Resident Evil group.<br/><br/>The bad acting was the only trouble with this film, the horrible script allowed the Hollywood character and plot clich√©s to pour in like the flood gates had been opened. The wise cracking character that always has something to say and obscure pop culture references that try to gain a couple laughs from the audience was present. The no-nonsense female cop that has a strange past, but finds out that she has the heart of gold. The corporation boss that is willing to kill everyone for the sake of science and proves that he has no heart what so ever. Finally, there is the large overbearing monster that was nothing more than table scraps of every other Hollywood big budget horror movie, which discovers the true meaning of Christmas. YUK. Could director Alexander Witt either not do his homework or just try for once to build upon the original instead of slicing and dicing. Not just the characters were clich√©, but also the story. Lines were replaced with explosions and CGI. Gore replaced the sci-fi element and 1984 Big Brother moments were just the mother load. Seriously, I would love to know what happened.<br/><br/>I would like to end this review by saying that I laughed at Nemesis the entire time it was on screen. For any of you that did not, I question your sanity. The reality, if that is what you want to call it, the creative imagination of the original was lost when Nemesis made his screen debut. It was sloppy and cheap. Definitely not something for Witt to be proud of.<br/><br/>Overall, this was not a crowning achievement for the series. The themes were jumbled mess of save humanity and science is bad. Milla did the best with what she was handed providing some of the better parts of the film, but everyone else were just worthless. I hope that the makers of this film see the error in their ways and the fact that they completely butchered a great concept. Video games are an amazing source of imagination, but sometimes when Hollywood money becomes involved, you get projects like Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I loved the video games, but after the original, this series needs to tighten up to regain control.<br/><br/>Grade: ** out of *****"

","I've seen and laughed at a lot of bad zombie movies. This one isn't technically the worst, but it comes pretty close. The ""plot"" is like any other Paul WS Anderson movie, with action sequences followed by characters telling you exactly what you already know and have seen. It even includes the trademark time frame that characters have to escape in in order to survive. You know exactly which characters will die in the movie because they are either not top billed or act dumb or rudely from the moment they step on screen. People and zombies appear out of nowhere as the only basis of moving the ""plot"" forward.<br/><br/>Direction is actually worse than the original. The slow-motion blur shot of zombies isn't even remotely scary. The film is so fast-paced in action and edit that it is hard to even make out how the characters killed zombies and Umbrella Corp. guards.

","A few hours before we began watching Residen Evil: Apocalypse, I was actually pretty hyped. I saw the first movie 2 years ago and in my opinion it was a good movie for it's genre. About a year ago I saw the trailer for it's sequel: It worked out as a sort of cosmetic commercial which had a very creepy sterile feeling to it. This trailer led me to believe Apocalypse was gonna be a nice horror once again... Man, was I misguided. This movie picks up where the first one has finished. Alice and Matt were taken by Umbrella and both of them got injected with the T-virus. Alice somehow managed to escape and found her way to Raccoon city where citizens are trying to evacuate town because the virus has spread around town. In the first 10 minutes already I was getting irritated by the amateurism of the director Alexander Witt. During action sequences he changes his camera angle so often that most of the time, due to the large cast with everyone having their own name, you'll just don't understand what actually happened. For example, there is a scene in the church where Jill Valentine had to inspect something in the room where the priest lives. She finds a zombie and gets attacked..end of scene. Only seconds later you'll see Jill running away from the tongue creatures I believe, without knowing what happened back there with the zombie. All zombie sequences by the way are worked out poorly and they don't form a threat to anyone except those who are extremely stupid. What made the Resident Evil series a masterful game? I would say the cold stellar atmosphere and the sound of silence. But it is the shortage of ammo and weapons that make the games challenging. Even though the movie slightly stayed true to the game's storyline, the director obviously never played RE before and must've thought it's a brainless zombie shooter. Well, that's pretty much how this movie was. GTA meets Lara Croft meets ANOTHER Lara Croft meets House of the Dead and they happened to come across Nemesis. Never ever have I been so disappointed (okay exaggerating), but I mean what I say and I say what I mean. This is by far one of the worst Hollywood movies ever made and I really hope Alexander Witt would from now on just watch movies instead of making them. 2.5/10"

So I'll keep this brief as it is just too painful.<br/><br/>The direction of this film can be explained in no other way than just plain irritating. Aimed at people with an attention span of roughly less than a second, the film never manages to stick with one shot long enough for you to actually take in anything, and the fight scenes are so jerkily shot that you have to simply take an educated guess that its the zombies who are getting beaten up. Awful dialogue is combined cleverly with worse acting to achieve a spectacularly terrible spectacle. To cap things off, Jill Valentine (an absolute legend from the games) is pathetically underwritten almost to the point of obscurity. Seeing her in that famous little blue top partially compensated though.<br/><br/>Maybe not up (or down) to the horrific computer game-to-movie standards set by Mortal Kombat, but Resident Evil:Apocalypse still managed to annoy, bore and upset me in equal measures. 3/10."

","I didn't care much for either RE movies. Its like the directors only are inspired by the action part of the game and not the brilliantly creepy atmosphere that I loved so much. Where is the part where our heroes walks alone in a giant scary mansion trying to survive all kinds of horrors, like they do in the first 3 games? NOWHERE!!! Its like the style of both movies are inspired by the fourth and least creepy game, ""Codename Veronica"" , with the exception of the Terminator like mutant zombie in RE:Apocalypse, that obviously is taken from the third game ""Nemesis"", and with success. It looks much like the mutant in the game and he also acts the same way.<br/><br/>But what i find really annoying, especially with RE:Apocalypse, is the marvel comic action that the movies are packed with. I didn't get the feeling, while playing the games, that the heroes were SUPER heroes, but i certainly do that when I'm watching the movies. It takes out all the suspense and horror (which leave only action) when Jovovich fires a one-liner, while hanging in the air kicking 5 zombies to ""death"" at the same time. And the worst part is, that ALL heroes in RE:Apocalypse are like that. Its just as scary to look at as watching ""X-men"". Jovovichs arrival in the church says all that i feel about especially this sequel. Laughable and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now i can only look forward to the cinema versions of ""Silent Hill"" and ""Fatal Frame"" and hope that they wont be ruined as much as Resident Evil was.<br/><br/>I'm sure that when the second sequel to Resident Evil comes up i wouldn't be surprised if Jovovich learns how to fly... Yikes!<br/><br/>I gave it 3 out of 10"

","I really liked the first one, but they seem to have gotten it all wrong on this one.<br/><br/>The story does not really have a clear structure but is very predictable anyway. Additionally, most of the characters are pretty flat and the attempts they made to discuss a bit of ethics or morality failed terribly. While in the first RE they had some ambiguous characters on the verge between good and evil who develop during the movie, the division between good and bad is extremely simple and profane in RE-A. They couldn't keep up the frightening atmosphere which was just so great in the first part but tried to go with some slow-mo pictures which merely remind of some really cheap B movie. And to top it off, a lot of elements are clearly stolen from other movies, without really being references.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich is great again, but everything else in this movie just spoils the opportunity to enjoy her performance.<br/><br/>All that one can hope for is that there will be no further sequel, although one has to fear this could happen someday. Which finally at least gives one scaring aspect to this movie."
"Tobbes","2","1","5","28 September 2004"," Much worse than the first one
","Where the first ""Resident Evil"" did quite well in capturing the look and feel of the video games while also managing to score as a surprisingly good horror film, this second one fails in all points. Nothing is left of those creepy tunnels of the hive or the scare of zombies in the dark. Instead all is replaced by a whole city. Wisely used, this setting would work as well as the first one. Instead, the director uses it as a huge playground for stunt and demolition displays of the most uninspired kind. He really likes to break glass and blow stuff up. And he likes the female characters doing stupid and pointless matrix-like martial arts. Another point for criticism is the way this movie ist cut. Very often, the cuts are lightning-fast, jump around locations and would suit a music video much more than a horror movie. The same applies to the frequently used way to show moving zombies. It is a strobe-like visual effect that results in staccato movement of the zombies. For many visual and action elements of the movie, the director doesn't use own ideas, but seems to have watched quite a lot of action movies with similar content an tries to copy as best he can. Not much success here. Reading this, you might ask yourself: O.k., there are flaws in craftsmanship, but is there at least an interesting or in any way innovative story to it? Well, no. <br/><br/>Enough bashing now. So what is the recipe of the whole thing? Take the Resident Evil concept, strip it down to only the action parts of it, make up a generic story, stuff in two scanty-dressed heroines and a rubber monster, stir well and blow everything up. Done. If this works for you, you will be entertained. For me it didn't.<br/><br/>Rating: 2/10"

","I don't know if I should slam this god awful crapfest of a movie or blame myself for even going to see it after I saw the ""EXTREME"" trailers for it. I'll do the movie for now as I have years to blame myself for my misjudgment.<br/><br/>RE:A just proves the fact that no matter how much money and shine you add, a piece of crap is a piece of crap. This movie is really aimed at the extreme sport masses that must all prize glitz and special effects over substance.<br/><br/>Now, before I say more, I have to clear up the fact that I love horror/zombie flicks. I'm not some film snob that will only patronize artsy and independent cinema (though I probably should after seeing this smoking load). I enjoy a good visceral escape like the next person. In fact, I love the original Predator very much and that really doesn't have any substance to speak of.<br/><br/>That being said, if you want a good action movie experience and are one of those poor folks who can excuse a terrible flick by saying, ""Yeah it was bad, but the special effects were awesome!"", then by all means, GO! You'll likely love the film and give blowing reviews on every message board from here to the end of the internet. However, if you are someone who looks at the schmuck and wants to slap him in the back of head for saying something so stupid, then take my advice and skip this one. The characters are terrible, the plot is horrendous and dashes the logic of even the first RE, and it's filled with way too many EXTREME moments for it's own good. From rappelling cops with guns, to heroines who can smash through glass without getting cut, RE:A just says to heck with reality and goes on without a second thought. I was laughing during the whole thing and kept imagining the mulleted masses that this movie was aimed at. Then, I was shaking my head when I realized that this must be what America really wants. That made me plan my escape route to our brother from the north. Canada, here I come!<br/><br/>3 out of 10 stars.

","Really what the hell did I just watch? Admittedly the first film was mediocre at best for all but the last five minutes, and it was only that final scene in it of Alice standing with the shotgun in a decimated Raccoon City that sucked me back in. +SPOILERS+<br/><br/>This movie didn't deliver on that ending on any level. Milla Jovovich, is far from one of the better actors out there. But she could act circles around the assembled cast here. Particularly the wooden actress who played Jill Valentine. Mike Epps is a pretty good comedic actor and everyone else in the audience cheered and clapped anytime so much as his elbow appeared on screen (but then again I did see it with the most rowdy ghetto audience ever, at a midnight show in Universal City). I guess going by other people in the crowd he must have been Oscar-caliber given that they would stand up and cheer/clap anytime he uttered one of his token one liners. Horror movies still seem to do pretty much the same thing with African-American actors and it's getting really old. <br/><br/>The camera style was bordered on irritating throughout. The fight scenes looked cheap and poorly choreographed because of the druggy, jerky camera effects used during the majority of them. The FX that were obviously the most expensive often came out looking the cheapest and most out of place. There was no sense of claustrophobia of fear at what might lie around the next corner like there was in the first. Honestly, scares were really hard to come by at all in this movie. The movie is rated R, but somehow felt like it had been toned down a lot.<br/><br/>I realize that most horror movies don't have to make a lot of sense, but this took the gold on that. The story is primarily about escaping a city full of zombies but it seemed like the director only remembered this periodically. These characters were supposed to be in a metropolis full of the walking dead, where the hell were the damn zombies? The scene where the cops were fighting back the oncoming horde, the whole movie should have been a lot more like that. The whole last thirty minutes forego the notion of zombies in favor of dumb looking military guys in motorcycle helmets and ridiculous stunts. This movie really could have taken a page from this years remake of Dawn of the Dead. The dogs in the school. If dogs and other animals can get infected then don't you think they might have run into some more animals and city that size running amock? Don't put something in a movie just to fill space and say it looks freakin cool. And the Nemesis with a heart of gold thing? Please. <br/><br/>Again the end was relatively cool in comparison with the rest of the movie. Alice with the telekinetic powers turning all the TVs to her and making the guy bleed from his eyes was the best scene in the whole movie. But if and when the third film comes out, I'm not feting sucked back into this trap."

","first of all, anyone who hasn't, should go play the games. hopefully your eyes will be opened to how truly awful this movie is. sometimes i wonder who green lights this cinematic poo. the acting was atrocious. there were so many things that were wrong that shouldn't have been. my number one gripe was the way the story was portrayed. the whole purpose of resident evil was to be scared sh*tless the entire time. either by taking on the undead with 3 bullets from a broken gun or a dull knife or just general fear of the unknown .resident evil was supposed to instill this sense of dread. the only thing dreadful was the movie however. the superhero idea (played by jovovich) was just to much. this isn't alien vs. predator. what the heck was anderson thinking? jovovich may be a good actor somewhere else, but just wasn't right for this part. the movie attempted to make her seem like a super being. unfortunately, the things she did and said were just plain out cheesy. i would say something else, but i forgot the rest of the cast. so much potential character development was left out. carlos olivera was my favorite character in RE3 and they just butchered his character. valentine wasn't even introduce in the first movie. how are people supposed to know, nor even care who she is. her character was horrible in this movie. she was nothing like that.<br/><br/>AND<br/><br/>nemesis WAS NOT a friggin sissy like this movie made him out to be. what were these people thinking? to make one of the scariest and most feared characters in video gaming history into a caring, sensitive, disfigured person in his early 30s. when i saw nemesis coming, i usually didn't try to fight if i had the chance to run. i sure as hell didn't get into a BOXING match with him. of all of the things in this movie that should have been invulnerable and unstoppable, it should have been him.<br/><br/>this garbage only has the resident evil name stamped on it. appealing to the younger generation shouldn't be this horrible."
"BartlebyScrivner","2","1","5","11 September 2004"," Mediocre action film, so-so horror/sci-fi film, poor film
","Loud and nasty; those are the two most appropriate synonyms I can think of to describe this film, which most likely won't be going down with either of the ""Dawn of the Dead"" movies, ""28 Days Later,"" or any of the ""Return of the Living Dead"" pictures as a hallmark of zombie/rampaging virus victim movie-making. <br/><br/>Virtually devoid of plot, RE:A opts, instead of the more sophisticated, unsettling approach of any of George Romero or his successors' works, to give us 99% action and 1% dialogue, a poorly constructed ratio if there ever was one. The film is full of jump cuts, with captions and on-screen images implying sequences which would've been devoid of action and all talk had they been included. Those unfamiliar with the games will be left virtually clueless as to what's going on as the time line jumps between hours and days during the first quarter or so of the relatively brief film (about an hour and a half, according to my watch). This is a game-to-film transition gone very, very bad; it would be time much more well spent to actually play the game. The movie comes across as a Cliff Notes version of watching someone else play Resident Evil: Nemesis, except using live actors instead of CGI.<br/><br/>In a city of the undead, the human element is nil, and oft times the question comes up why we're even watching these people; Milla Jovovich is the only character even really remotely root able for, and the only reason for that is that she's a familiar face. Characters quickly come and go in rapid succession, getting killed minutes (and in one instance, seconds) after we find out their name, with no explanation as to who they are or why they're doing what they're doing. In a quarantined city about to be destroyed, there's only one motivation: Get out. This could've been played on similarly to the way Night of the Living Dead played on a similar situation, but every character aside from Alice has the same thought process, reactions, and attitudes, and are differentiated only by their physical appearance and dialect/slang (for some reason, Racoon City, apparently in Illinois according to the globe at the end, has equal parts population British, French, Russian, and American citizens). Had the director/producer/writers decided to include any dialogue in place of the unending action, and had that dialogue been well written, this is a film that could've had some potential maybe not as a great horror flick, but at least as a good auctioneer. Instead, from beginning to end we're subjected to computer graphics, CGI sequences, and virtually un-ending stretches of poor camera work and amplified gunfire as the undead are dispatched in poorly lit, badly focused environments that barely gives the viewer time to try and understand what they just saw. <br/><br/>What little speaking and character we're left with is divided evenly into clich√©s (the cold hearted business executive, the steely soldier, the tough woman cop, the token funny black guy, the token tough black guy, the mindless, unstoppable killing machine) and clich√© ridden dialogue (an evil corporation/the government causes disaster because of greed and immorality; aforementioned steely executive has innocent people killed by steely soldiers; a pseudo-pimp drives around in a Cadillac shouting obscenities at white people; a brainwashed monster remembers love and relents). It comes as no surprise that one of the people responsible for this is Paul W. S. Anderson, who gave us the ""inspired"" House of the Dead, which opted to include images from a 1980s arcade game in lieu of actual footage. Anderson seems to like zombies and guns, but otherwise has no grasp on any sort of movie-making mechanics. He doesn't give the viewer a reason to care for the people getting killed, or even explain why they're getting killed, in some parts; early on in the movie, characters are confronted in a church by giant, apparently zombified lizards, who attack with enormous tongues and climb down walls. But as the film demonstrates, the virus causing zombification doesn't create anything, it simply reanimates dead cells, leaving us to question what these things were exactly, and where did they come from? Nowhere in the ""living"" world are there six foot tall, ten foot long reptiles that can snap a human neck by wrapping its tongue around one. The entire film follows this err in logic and lack of creative input, right up to the convoluted last five minutes of the film, wherein we're all but given the announcement that there will be no resolution, only the promise of a third film."
"djen303","1","1","5","12 September 2004"," VERY disappointing
","Well, mark off yet another franchise ruined. This movie was disturbing, but not in the horror movie sense. No, it was disturbing because of how similar it felt to House of the Dead, quite possibly the lowest grade zombie movie made in the last 10 years. The really sad part is, House of the Dead had more horror in it than Resident Evil 2 did! This movie was practically gore-less, no doubt to keep the ratings low to attract the cash kiddies.<br/><br/>Like HOTD, Resident Evil 2 feels like the director ran around Toronto with the cast, going ""ok, a grave yard, this will be a cool place to film"". It felt scriptless, like it was made up on the spot. While some may thing that this would lend a little spontonaity to what might otherwise be a formulaic movie, they'd be wrong. All the lack of direction added was a boat load of cheap one-liners, bad dialogue, and the worst attempts at European accents I've ever heard. It felt like the director simply came up with ideas on the spot; anything he thought was cool he'd add it, regardless of it not fitting at all. ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if Alice drove a motorcycle through the stain glass window to get into the church!"". This sort of stuff isn't mindless entertainment, I'm a big fan of mindless, but this was just idiotic.<br/><br/>The whole movie plays out like a music video, with fast edits, and machine gun cuts. HOTD also pulled this trick numerous times. Both films even share a similar flashback sequence where they show all the previous events in the film strobing to the drum beat in the background music.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this movie REALLY lost the scope of the first film. The first Resident Evil, like the game, was a ""survival horror"". It featured people trapped inside an enclosed space with deadly zombies and mutants. In RE2, the whole scope is broadened too far, making it feel more like Escape From New York rather than a survival horror."
"icarus550","5","1","5","11 September 2004"," A formulaic clone of the original with more explosions.
","First off I must say that I am rather disappointed in IMDb for catergorizing this movie as Horror and Thriller, which it most certainly is neither. However, it also lists it as Action and Sci-Fi which it definitely is. <br/><br/>If you loved the first movie, you will probably be quite entertained by this action-packed sequel, though if you were like me and were hoping for something a little more true to the video game on which it was based you will certainly be disappointed. Really the only similarities to the game that I could find where the use of familiar names such as Umbrella Corp, Racoon City, STARS, etc. The plot progression in RE2 is even more contrived than that of RE1 and I found most of the action scenes to be way over-the-top. <br/><br/>Although there are plenty of walking-dead in this movie I would hardly consider it a ""zombie flick"". What's missing here is any semblance of horror or suspense. Really the only suspense comes from when characters inadvertently sneak up on each other and suddenly grab their shoulder from behind. I would think with everyone being on edge and ready to shoot at anything that moves, you would want to be a little more subtle in getting your teammates attention. I am also baffled by how many times someone gets bitten. Everyone in the movie is well aware that if you get bitten by one of them, you will turn into one of them, yet no one seems to be wearing any protection against that sort of thing. <br/><br/>I feel guilty for putting so much money forth to see this type of cinematic crap (It cost me $15 after ticket, food and drink to see a matin√©e showing!), further provoking them to blow even more money on huge explosions and big-budget effects on an inevitable third installment.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of big budget, highly implausible action movies such as Blade or Van Helsing then by all means drop $10-$20 and go see this. If you are a fan of zombie flicks, it is still not worth the bother, go rent Shaun of the Dead instead. If you are a fan of Suspense, Thriller, Horror movies then go see something else---anything else!"

","I'm sorry, but this movie was really bad. I don't understand how are these other reviewers giving this movie credit and stating that it is one the best video game adaptations ever to be put on screen, How?! These are young teens that think women in tight skirts can save a movie. DEAD WRONG!! Paul Anderson has now screwed up three franchises (Alien, Predator, Resident Evil), and he's not even considered the audience he's making these movies for. The style and impact of his direction and scriptwriting has decreased so bad that sometimes his movies become unwatchable (Alien Vs. Predator). Alexander is nothing but a flunky to Anderson. That's a shame.<br/><br/>Alexander Witt helms this movie as his first directorial debut. But, its a stinker!! Whoever thought filming a movie, calling the set Raccoon City, and disguising it as Toronto would work. People who live in that area are probably laughing at this more than I am. This movie lacked wit and substance. There was really no point in making this sequel. These movies prove that Hollywood truly is a business about making money. Apparently Anderson had too much influence on Witt because his style and direction are very similar. Quick shot editing, big explosions, a lot of glass breaking, describes this movie. The camera shots were so bad that it was laughable (worse than Alien Vs. Predator). The theater audience can attest to that. What's the idea of using all of these Matrix elements (slow-motion bullets, cheap sound effects). This is nothing but a big B-movie with a lot of explosions and fine women. I didn't find nothing wrong with the SFX in the movie. They got at least something done right!! But, make-up of the Nemesis monster seemed like I was watching another movie of the Toxic Crusader. <br/><br/>The zombies were some of the worst and really took a backseat to whatever the movie was trying to do. Survival horror is what I think of when hearing Resident Evil, not martial arts action. There was no horror factor at all in this movie. It was laughable at the most. The cast, OMG, the cast!! Mike Epps served no purpose but a comic relief in this feature. A few laughs are not going to save this one. Oded Fehr's badass character was decent, but Sienna Guillory in a tight mini-skirt is unbelievable. Sexy, YES, but not for this movie. Milla, Milla, Milla. Being sexy on-screen does not save you either. With heightened superhuman powers and strength, this seemed more like a Saturday morning cartoon. But, she had to work with what she was given. <br/><br/>The first RE at least was paced throughout and had some form of style. It almost seemed like a four-star movie compared to this one. I regret paying my $6.00 to the fullest. I went in very skeptical about the results, and what I received was failure to deliver. Boycotting some of Hollywood's movies seems logical these days. Being let down by Hollywood is nothing new. Why the movie was set up for another sequel, I don't know. This is a disgrace to the video game, and Anderson knows it. The style was below average, and the gore factor wasn't present. Dawn of the Dead, both original and the 2004 version, are better movies.<br/><br/>Final Judgment: 1/2/****"
"MSUstar","3","1","5","11 September 2004"," Horrible Movie
","I'm a huge fan of the Resident Evil video game franchise and I thought this movie was horrible. I think that the writer/director of the first movie did a great job of bringing the story to the big screen. Video game inspired movies are not the easiest to do, just look at Street Fighter, House of the Dead, etc. I think it was a HUGE mistake to have a different director helm this film. To be honest, I don't think it would have helped this film much if Paul Anderson had directed it either since he wrote an incredibly stupid script with incomprehensible plot. I know this is a movie about zombies, but can we please have a little bit of realism and logic here. Can we at least keep our story consistent? We understand that the T-virus reanimates dead cells and that it is protean, it can be borne through the air, etc but how is it that the dead buried in the cemetery are reanimated? From what I understand, there was six feet of soil and various man-made implements(such as a coffin) separating those dead people from the T-virus. Unlike in the first movie, the air had not been infected with the virus or everyone alive would have gotten it too. <br/><br/>It is an interesting stunt to have Alice running down the side of a building, but let's answer the question of how in the heck she got up there in the first place. How about the brilliant disappearing zombies. A hoard of zombies will be somewhere in one instant and then gone the next and vice versa. How are they walking about the city for long periods of time with out seeing even one zombie? What happened to that large group of people in the beginning who was turned back into the city at the beginning of the movie? Why would you split up in a building full of zombies? How did Alice know that the people barricaded up in the church needed help? Why would she crash through the window leaving it open for zombies to get in? Why? Why? Why? I could go on and on, but I think the ultimate question is...Why did this movie suck???<br/><br/>I likes the multiple sets, I liked the additional action, I liked the use of characters from the game. I even appreciated the comic relief that Mike Epps provided, but the movie was a dudd overall. I gave it 4/10"

","In order to write this comment, I scanned the film by fast forwarding to remember, did not watch it again, but still you can't imagine how it was agonizing. Resident Evil: Apocalypse begins with a bad opening scene that everything is explained in a scratchy way and we see pictures from the previous movie. As some people say, yes, mostly the scenes that zombies appear are very odd, so frustrating, it is not slow motion, it is not digital camera, I don't know what it is, but it is not entertaining for sure. Zombies do not walk very slowly and they are not fast like the zombie movies called next generation zombie movies. I cannot tell anything more! The whole movie is almost non stop action, but every action scene is extremely tasteless and sometimes too showy, so if you ask me no entertainment, I don't know whether there is such a word or not, but this movie is anti fun in most parts. Moreover, a heavy rock music in every action scene, helicopter sounds, walkie talkie sounds that's what the director understand from stylish film. Set designs are too superficial. There is a terrible looking and very ridiculous monster called Nemesis (wow! Nemesis is in the movie! people say) who can say only S.T.A.R.S. Even stop motion King Kong in 1933 was much more impressive than this. The plot is nothing, uninteresting. A high school student who plays the game would write a much much more better script, I am seriously sure. In a scene, the monster and Alice fight each other, but they are in a kind of tournament!! However, every bad has its worse, it gets more and more ridiculous, tasteless. This movie is the zombie version of Battlefield Earth to me, so the end of the world!"

It was never really explained what happened to Milla, and personally I felt they got a few ideas from Alien Resurrection (the whole using mutations to whoop ass deal). The ending was confusing and made me feel like I was watching someone playing the game rather than a film version of it - I kept waiting for her to advance to the next level. The first film was much better, a good blend of horror and sci-fi action, good actors and you could actually make out what was going on!

","Let me start with this contains lots of spoilers and if you haven't seen the film don't read this. For me all the ingredients were there, a super villain like no other, millions of creatures to choose from, a few beautiful girls and an already huge following from the video games. So how did they manage to cock it up.<br/><br/>Lets start with the Nemesis which i must say did look quite good, but anything after that was rubbish. First of all, rather then the ultimate monster we get the ultimate weapon. In the game Resi 3, the Nemesis is a relentless killer hellbent on destroying all its enemies particularly stars members. He was scary he was like a nightmare that wouldn't go away, then we get this pansy who gets given orders, needs weapons and gets his ass kicked by a girl, (one girl) and he had a weapon. Whats more he turned good, how is that going to be scary. The nemesis was what got me excited about this film after a drab first one but he really was lame. He didn't chase any stars members just shot them, then faced with Mike Epps failed to kill him, and we didn't get a look at those fearsome tentacle thingys he used in the game. Away from him is the next character Alice<br/><br/>Why was she needed in the first place? The games main characters are Clair redfield, Leon S Kennedy, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. Each one as kick ass as the other, then Alice comes along and destroys the legend. She kills zombies with her bear hands beats up the Nemesis and practically like neo in the Matrix unbeatable. In one part for example Jill fails to torch some dogs that are chasing her, then guess whos their to spoil the thrill Alice. Her mere presence made me want to boycott the film. She was just untouchable. Whats the point of having a zombie film with a super being. Whats the horror in that. Oh my God zombies have ransacked the city and there's only a few zombies...Don't worry there's Alice they'll be fine now!!!, She even gets carlos to fancy her, in the game he fancys jill, what utter rubbish.<br/><br/>Jill is good but takes second stage to super bitch Alice, Whereas i thought her character was perfect for main role, she fought in the mansion but hey alice did that instead. Mike Epps was cool he injected humour into it which was needed when you have incensed resi evil fans around you. other then that i believe everything was rushed, rather then the next freddy kreuger we got the big 7ft teddy bear. I personally hate this film after the way it betrayed the games, if you haven't played the games watch it and judge again if you have and are a fan i advise you stay well clear"

","When the original Resident Evil debuted during the video-game-movie frenzy, it held a lot of promise. The formula for such a movie was almost guaranteed given the detailed and interesting nature of the game itself. And then followed the movie, with the convincing lead, Milla Jovanovich, whose protagonist role in Fifth Element proved she could handle action. The film held plenty of disturbing scenes and good CGI. And at the end we were given the intimation of a sequel, which was delivered in the form of this film, Resident Evil: Apocalypse. But instead of a bunch of zombies locked up in an underground laboratory, they run amuck in Raccoon City, with the T-virus spreading like wildfire. <br/><br/>Obviously, the film could simply enough had Alice (Jovanovich) just go out and wipe out the entire city of zombies, with a little help, of course. But no, this film wanted to flex its muscles and push the envelope. Not only is Raccoon City scheduled for termination via a nuclear attack by the Umbrella Corporation (the bad guys), but it turns out that there is another danger looking in Raccoon City, Nemesis (a biogenetically-engineered killer). And to take things up yet another notch, it turns out Alice has been injected with the T-virus by Umbrella and has superhuman strength as a result. Talk about amp'ing up the plot!<br/><br/>For all her fight scenes in Fifth Element, I could not believe the botch job that was done with Alice's combat scenes against Nemesis, as Umbrella has a final showdown before they send the A-bomb in. The action sequences were so fast and jumbled together that it was impossible to make any clear distinction of what was happening. It's almost pathetic.<br/><br/>As to the ending, I won't spoil it, but be prepared to go round the ferris wheel once again as yet another sequel is hinted at, this one even more preposterous. After watching the ending of the film (if you choose to), ask yourself why Umbrella didn't just ""activate"" Alice in the lab when she was ""spazzing"" out on them. Why wait until she was outside the gate...? 5/10"

","Oh man. Where to start? In the first place, I rather liked the first Resident Evil. I rented it to have good laugh, and found myself enjoying it far more than I expected to. Which makes this crass, awful sequel an even worse disappointment for me. From start to finish, this movie was just painfully dreadful. <br/><br/>My biggest complaint, besides the so-called 'plot' and the horrible fight scenes, are the characters. The female ex-cop was such an annoying, grating person that I was praying to every God in the universe that she be mutilated in the most painful way possible. But no...Now we'll have to sit through yet another sequel with her in it, and watch her laughable attempts at acting. And maybe she'll stalk around in ten inch high heels and another tight, hard to move in outfit that a whore would be proud of wearing. That'd be great, huh?<br/><br/>Odod Fehr is usually a pretty good actor. It took me at least twenty minutes just to RECOGNIZE him in this film! And his cop had all the personality of tofu. Not so his 'russian' partner, being hilariously overacted by Zach Ward, who I best remember as the stoner younger brother off the Fox sitcom Titus. <br/><br/>The whiny reporter wasn't an asset to the cast, but then no one was except for the comic relief, a stereotypical black criminal dressed like a pimp and with gold plated guns. He's a hoot as he flees through the city trying to get out, stopping for a moment to ogle some dead, topless strippers. The Alice character isn't bad, although some of her powers seem a little overdone. She's superwoman, right , we got it.<br/><br/>I have a lot of niggling questions about what little plot that there was. For one thing-in the graveyard, the dead were rising from their graves to attack the fleeing group. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the virus only works on people who've been dead for no more than a month or so. It revives dead cells which still carry traces of electrical charge, which the body still does for about six weeks or so. So how can half rotted corpses like the one with worms crawling out of its skull still come to life and attack them? That corpse was probably over a year old. Perhaps its foolish of me to think that the movie should have internal integrity and coherence, but one can hope, right?<br/><br/>My brother-in-law was laughing over the scene in the church where Alice rides a motorcycle through the doors, flips off of it so that it crushes the uber beast, and then shoots the bike so that it explodes. Did she stick a grenade in the gas tank first? Maybe the creature had exploding boogers? Who knows.<br/><br/>The fight on the rooftop between Alice and Nemesis was just the height of lame. And the death of Nemesis-death by helicopter-just left me roaring with laughter. And shaking my head, as well. Honestly, they couldn't have come up with something better? Not really, I guess, if you consider the lame dialog, bad acting, and stupid action scenes that proliferate in this film. You're left scratching your head more often than not, wondering if the screenwriter and director had both stayed up together sucking down a giant bong hit, and then decided to make a movie while still stoned out of their minds. My theory is that they spent their entire budget on the cool trailer, and didn't have enough left to put together a decent movie. Either that, or the director shot the entire film without looking at it."

","""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" is a 2004 horror film and video game adaptation directed by Alexander Witt starring Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory. After the catastrophe the original film has been, my expectations towards the following films sank even lower. I wasn't hoping for anything anymore, to be honest. So I was mildly surprised that the first sequel was a minimal improvement to the first movie. Still not a groundbreaking achievement, but better. First of all, it was appeasing to see that the film finally has drawn on its source material in any way and created the apocalyptic scenario that followed after the outbreak in Raccoon City. It's obvious that the film was conceived on the basis of ""Resident Evil: Nemesis"", focused more on the action than on any type of horror and that's probably the best thing that could have happened to it. Former director Anderson now functions as the writer and leads the audience through a story that least feels more like an actual RE adaptation, even if it is far away from being as packing as the original game. Honestly, it even started out decently. For example, I literally screamed when I saw that it finally included one of the game's actual protagonists, Jill Valentine and that they even made a great casting choice in her case. On top of that, she's furthermore wearing her iconic ""Last Escape"" outfit and also nails her movements and other character traits. What's wrong then? The thing is that they degraded her to nothing but a meaningless side character who doesn't really get the chance to shine. The same applies to the mercenary trio centered around Carlos Olivera: great to see them featured in a similar scenario, but underused nevertheless. They might have copied whole sequences from the game shot by shot, but to me it feels like they were only written into the movie in the fear of fan's repeated negative reactions. Oh, and how they misused the Ashfords was dumb as well. The biggest disappointment of the whole film is how they depicted Nemesis. At first, I thought it could be actually great, but in the end they characterized him absolutely wrong. How could you even fail this simple task? In the game he's this giant, inevitable threat and haunting demon that terrorises you restlessly, makes your heart race and gives you severe nightmares you will never really recover from. What the hell is he here? A regular sized, way too lame and absolutely harmlessly looking abomination that's neither a danger or somewhat scary. He does nothing but walking slowly, shooting with the same two weapons over and over again. Not running mercilessly once. Not killing someone brutally once. Not becoming his totally gross final form once. It's not underwhelming. It's a shame and it almost made me cry that they wasted such a great opportunity and made him so absolutely meaningless. At least it hasn't kept me from finding some sort of guilty pleasure in this film, though. Milla Jovovich is more badass than ever and she goes along with the side characters pretty well, even if I wished they had more screentime. What surprised me the most though is how it was finally able to develop a nearly decent atmosphere the first outing dismally lacked. Not only had it obviously better visual effects and some actually enjoyable scenes, the way it started out and how the story developed even gave me the feeling that I might be watching a film that's gonna be more than mediocrity. I was dumb to think that. Probably forgot that one of the most incompetent director's was still in charge of writing the story. While the premise was acceptable the film became more stupid from scene to scene. Until the final act. It gave me the rest. Not only has it some laughably obvious plot holes (""How did she get up the skyscraper so quickly?"", I uttered) it's total garbage as both a final conclusion and as a decision in general as well. I lost my mind when Alice was forced to have a fistfight with Nemesis and even more when he developed some kind of emotional world and saved her while sacrificing himself. Absolutely ridiculous and brain melting all the same. What happend from there on is beyond my understanding. Setting up the next sequel, obviously, but it's so unnecessarily dumb. All in all, it's definitely better than the first entry of the franchise, but still a terrible film nevertheless. While it shows more understanding of its source material, it still wasn't able to comprehend its full potential. In the beginning it wasn't even that awful, but the unrealistic and just laughable ending make it what it is: Another failed attempt to bring a classic video game to the big screen. When it's not possible to adapt it perfectly due to missing technology there's one advice: Just don't try it. Another proof for me that Anderson shouldn't have done this. It's even more ironic after I have read that he heavily criticised director Witt for his work on this film. He's definitely not the most competent director, but as if Anderson made the perfect adaptation, you know? So ironic. This series can't get any better than this, I know that, but it's without a doubt cheesy fun to watch. Onto the next one."

I have known seen every ""Resident Evil"" movie. I'll at least give them props for being better than oh, 70% of video game movies, not that that says much.

Heck, there's nothing that the other films in the series hasn't done better. It's completely mindless violence with random shooting, which unfortunately could be interpreted as a faithful video game adaptation. We have in fact gotten better video game movies this year like ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Rampage"" which, while not masterpieces, at least treat their stories like actual stories. I'm not that familiar with the games, but I was able to recognize Jill Valentine at least.

","The quest for mediocrity continues with this direct sequel. Despite the change of director and a full on charge to the action genre, it still falls short of being a good film. Alice wakes up, Raccoon City is ravaged by abandonment, she walks around until she stumbles across Jill Valentine. They are tasked with extracting a young girl out of the quarantined city before it becomes decimated in order to fight back against the T-Virus. Would I class this as an improvement over its predecessor? Tough to say. Most fans of the series will say this is the best instalment, and I can see why. Jill Valentine, despite Sienna Guillory looking like she is cosplaying, does kick ass and gives Alice a run for her money. Two strong female protagonists is refreshing to see. The stunts were well executed, including Alice running down a building whilst being attached to a cable. Nemesis looked great, although unfortunately incredibly underused and not nearly as threatening as he should be. If you played the game, you would know he is relentless. In this, not so much. The horror aspect obviously did not work in the first instalment, so completely shifting this into action gear was more suited. Milla Jovovich gives an enjoyably daring performance as we watch her grow into an action star. It is unfortunate that the story is somewhat underwhelming...again. Point A to point B to point C. Roll credits. The way the seperate parties unite feels far too coincidental. Although really do we care? They are so one dimensional that if any meet their demise, I feel nothing. The fight choreography has this generic annoying sound effect for every punch and kick. The over reliance of tilted camera angles makes Alexander Witt's directing style feel amateurish. Also, the full five minute expositional introduction was a waste of time that could've been spent developing the characters. Again, the series remains mediocre but somewhat watchable."

","The first RESIDENT EVIL movie was a scary fun romp. It's key downside was having nothing to do with the original video games outside of a few characters designs and settings. RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE is the sequel and tries to right the ship by introducing us to some of the characters from the actual video games. Video game characters Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivero and A few others are finally adapted into live action and the results are amazing. The movie finally feels like an actual adaptation, taking the setting of RE2 and 3, as well as many plot points and faithful recreations of key scenes.<br/><br/>The movie starts when the Umbrella corporation opens the underground facility known as the Hive in which the T-Virus outbreak occurs. The virus spreads to nearby Raccoon City (which looks a lot like Toronto Canada) turning the dead into zombies and showing us the chilling societal degeneration into chaos. Amidst this chaos, Umbrella head scientist Doctor Charles Ashford loses his Daughter Angela during a frantic evacuation. As local armed forces attempt to stem the tide of undead, Umbrella corp releases a newly weaponised Alice, having been granted superhuman abilities. In a desperate bid to reunite with his Daughter, dr Ashford manipulates Jill, Carlos and Alice together to rescue his Angela. But a new bioweapon is loose in the city. The hulking, chaingun toting Nemesis. <br/><br/>Alexander Witt in his debut role as director eschews Paul WS Anderson's claustrophobic filming style of the previous movie and instead ops to mimic the ""camera"" placement of the video games. Gone too are the scares of the first movie replaced by a straight forward action movie plot. The cinematography is crisp and clear, showing the action in full. But that also means it shows some poorly crafted special effects in full.<br/><br/>The infamous cgi Lickers are back, though now half enshrouded in darkness so they do not look as bad as before. On the other end of the spectrum is the Nemesis bioweapon, a hulking behemoth with a mini gun that looks exactly like a big guy in a suit and rubber mask. His platform heels, obviously meant to make the actor look taller, are laughable and makes this lumbering leather bound lunk move stiffly. He looks exactly like he does in the game though, which I guess is another plus, and he is meant to hunt down our main characters. Not that he exudes much air of menace or as if it the audience would care about the main characters.<br/><br/>Protagonist Alice (Milla Jovovich) has developed a hint of personality here which can be summarised as ""badass lady"". That is it. Still as shallow as a pan with an abrasive snarky attitude, Alice is near invincible with her superhuman agility, strength and cunning, taking the spotlight away from others in what is blatantly becoming Paul Ws Anderson's fan fiction. Which is a pity as Carlos Olivero and Jill Valentine make for much more appealing protagonists. Sienna Guilroy looks exactly like her game counterpart from the outfit to the way she walks and holds a gun. An intriguing backstory is hinted at but never developed on, instead cutting back to Alice since she is the main character.<br/><br/>While I do give points to RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE for being an action packed zombie blockbuster with a plot hearkening back to the shallow 80s macho action movies, its underdeveloped but wholly more appealing side characters and insistence on a bland protagonist does hurt the enjoyment. It is a mash up of my 2 Favourite genre of films and more faithful to the games yet it is plagued by Low Budget special effects and horrible antagonists."

","No matter the genre, a second film in the franchise is always expected to up the ante. Whether that entails expanding the scope and scale or just developing your characters to a new point of awakening is up to each film individually. Resident Evil Apocalypse adds nothing new to what the first film already established. In fact, besides a slight setting change and some new faces, this is the exact same movie.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that Milla Jovovich got so tied up with the Resident Evil films for all those years. She's a talented actress, and quite good in the movies, but she's never given much to do besides wear inappropriate clothing (especially in an apocalypse) and throw some punches. Alice's character arc is the same as the first film. She initially finds herself estranged to her surroundings, she finds companions, punches are thrown, guns are shot, bad people try to take her and shake her world to the core, and then she revolts. It's quite laughable.<br/><br/>For whatever weaknesses the first film had, at least it felt original and grounded with reality. 'Apocalypse' has a ton of action and new set pieces, both of which may wow the casual film-goer, but those sequences are constantly tied down by fast and lazy editing. A lot of films in the mid-2000's fell victim to jump cut fight scenes where you don't actually know who's punching who, you just get caught up in the excitement. With 'Apocalypse', not only do you not know who's punching who, you honestly don't care where the punches are landing anyway. It's not that I overtly disliked any of the new characters we were introduced to, such as Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivera, Angie Ashford, L.J., or Terri. But I found nothing unique or interesting about them, especially compared to the original gang in the first film.<br/><br/>Sure, Jovovich is always entertaining to watch as Alice, but with nothing new added since the last outing, I can't possibly give the film a positive review.<br/><br/>+Jovovich keeps it watchable<br/><br/>-Lazy editing<br/><br/>-Rehashed plot<br/><br/>-Nothing unique about the new team<br/><br/>4.4/10"

","Previous readers may be aware that the original RESIDENT EVIL wasn't one of my favourite genre flicks, despite the presence of flesh-eating zombies, and the sequel follows in much the same vein as the first. There is one major difference, however; this film dispenses with the story altogether, and the result is a typically mindless action fest with absolutely loads of shooting and martial arts high-kicking action. Normally I'm all for that, but sadly APOCALYPSE succumbs to the same clich√©d formula as the original, in its story of a bunch of people running around in a sealed-off location and trying to avoid getting bitten by zombies.<br/><br/>Director Alexander Witt (Paul W. S. Anderson isn't missed) has some annoying techniques of shooting his zombies in slow motion like in a Michael Jackson video, the result being pretty funny and not at all scary. Hardcore gore lovers will enjoy the flesh-biting fun but the camera always shies away from anything stronger than a little nibble on an arm or neck. The action tends to be repetitive, but kids will love the noisy theatricals with the incessant bam-bam of the guns and the outrageous stunts on hand. In this film, Jovovich is a kind of super woman who runs down the side of buildings and can jump over parked cars. The background to the plot is pretty murky and left unexplained. Jovovich is a strange lead in that I find her half sexy, half unappealing; she's back in her skimpy attire but still looks like an undernourished supermodel and I'm sure she has a cold sore on her lip at one point ‚Äì not the most attractive of heroines, it has to be said. Much better is Sienna Guillory, who resembles and acts like Lara Croft far more than Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>Special effects are the main draw of the film, with the zombies looking fine and those skinless dogs back and just as good as in the original. Sadly, the pink mutant from the original's climax is back and seems to have multiplied in a church, still as unconvincing as ever. The film does score points by having a massive monster running around, a really ugly guy with a minigun who stomps and shoots in equal measure. I love men in monster suits and this inclusion ‚Äì his name is Nemesis and he was once human apparently ‚Äì is no exception; any scene with him in is so OTT as to be a whole lotta fun. Sadly, the bits involving the zombies are clich√©d beyond belief ‚Äì at one point they burst out of a graveyard, yawn ‚Äì and the weird ending, which starts a whole new story, will leave viewers thinking ""what the heck?"". Pretty much the same experience as the first film offered then."
"bowmanblue","7","0","2","3 January 2016"," Well... I liked it!
","I'll start by saying that Resident Evil 2 (or 'Apocalypse' to give it its correct name) wasn't that well received. The first film was (loosely!) based on a computer game and kind of went some way to revitalise the 'zombie' genre (or at least bring the undead back into the mainstream again). However, whereas the original was widely well received by people who like a good B-movie, its second outing was pretty much trashed. And, yes, I can see why ‚Äì but I still liked it! It carries on nicely from the original after a zombie outbreak occurs in a secret lab complex under a major (fictional) city. Now the virus has been released on the above ground population and the city is basically falling to the numerous walking corpses while the authorities struggle to maintain order. Throw in the only survivor from the first movie (a semi-naked Milla Jovovich) and you have your film.<br/><br/>I'll start by listing its ‚Äì numerous ‚Äì faults. The cast are wafer thin cardboard cut-outs and every piece of dialogue is by-the-numbers and feels like it's been written by a first year film student. There's no such thing as 'character development' and you'll see every plot point coming. They even bring back the 'zombie dogs' from the first film and sort of rehash the scene again. The villain (yes, there's a human villain as well as the zombies) is ‚Äì again ‚Äì your typically badly-written Bond-villain rip-off. Then you have the 'Nemesis' ‚Äì which is basically a man in a rubber suit pretending to be a monster. Everything here is 'style over substance' ‚Äì the story (and maybe I should put 'story' in quote marks?) moves from one stylised fight-scene to another. You really will have to leave your brain at the door to get over the gaping holes in the plot which lead up to all the major characters getting together.<br/><br/>Yet, despite all that ‚Äì I confess to actually owning this film on DVD and watching it every few years. I found it quite fresh at the time. I've been a fan of the zombie genre since the seventies and missed them so much that I was quite glad to see a big budget film where you get to see a glimpse of society falling while the zombie outbreak is underway. The trick to getting something out of RE2 is basically lowering your expectations suitably to ignore all its faults. You'll probably have to know what Milla Jovovich's movies are generally like, i.e. superhuman female kicking the hell out of numerous faceless baddies (or zombies in this case). Don't expect too much. It's a complete B-movie where you can wander in and out of the room at will and still know exactly what's going on.<br/><br/>I like it, but even if you do really hate it as much as the majority, it's still head and shoulders over every last sequel which follows (and there are a lot of those!)."
"willcundallreview","4","0","2","13 September 2015"," Zombie horror that falls flat
","Milla Jovovich is back in a style, well a style that is exactly the same as before, in poor style. We now see Zombies roaming the streets of Raccoon City and they're just hell bent on getting some of that human flesh, the zombies consist of a mix of normal or stereotypical zombies, and then some really quick really weird and really stupidly created CGI zombies that we saw in the first movie, but now we see them just a little more. The series I felt could have taken itself into new territory, cast away its first instalment and really gone for it with a promising new plot and a big city to play with. My previous point is not met and we see yet again a poor movie, not one that is near to being hateable, but dislikeable nevertheless.<br/><br/>The plot plays out like a video game (oh wait the whole film is based on a video game) and really goes all out on the violence but also rather disappointingly the crazy stunts too. One such stunt that I felt was superbly unneeded was a motorbike crashing through a church window; it was just a pointless bit of thriller filler and had nothing to add to the already dull prospect of an adventure with these characters. And what about those characters? ,well what can be said really other than Jovovich is not bad but far from great, she plays the role in a kind of mediocre way in which she can seem like she is really going to do some OK acting but then scuppers the chance. Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine is again a failed prospect, one thing I hated about her character was the way she is portrayed as this hard cop who is skillful with a gun and yet we see no evidence really, poor yet again. The rest of the cast don't offer much, and the fleeting glimpses of OK actors like Iain Glen are too short to make any acting alright. <br/><br/>A lot of the mistakes of the film also lie in the controls of director Alexander Witt whose hand is one that is well hardly one at all, he never fully takes the reigns and the whole flow of the movie can at times lose its rhythm. The writing from Paul W.S Anderson is nothing to help either here; the director of the first movie fails to create a story that is fun or exciting, only yet again that word, poor. The whole technical aspect side of this is also not the best, I mean the productions look isn't all bad and at least it looks the part but it doesn't help too much. The camera work is shoddy and the strange sort of shaky look they give the zombies is horrible and it only creates a sense of motion sickness not horror.<br/><br/>So really in conclusion I can only say this is horror not done so well but to be fair it isn't completely just bad. The movie has it's high leg kicks, seemingly impossible jumps and of course gun shots galore and that is all fine and will probably please those who like that kind of thing. The problem I have is the lazy directing and writing and the basic plot which to me is unforgivable and should have been addressed and not just thrown out onto the screen before properly having a look. So anyway before I go off subject about recommending I think many can enjoy this but many won't, depends if you're won over easily or enjoy zombie horror that much."
"bradman1118","2","0","3","30 December 2014"," mindlessly entertaining action does not make up for the awful direction and cheap story-telling!
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a zombie/monster action film that is based on a video game. This movie does have a great amount of action. And much the action is entertaining, despite the ineffective shaky-cam technique, poor CGI, and quick cut shots leaving the audience unable to actually see what is happening. After seeing films like ""the Raid: Redemption"" and ""the Raid 2"" I have learned not to tolerate for this awful style of film making. Again, the action is entertaining, but it is in no way well-filmed. The story is ludicrous, makes little sense and is riddled with plot-holes, both big and small. For example, the scene in which the zombies come from under the ground in the graveyard, I laughed at. If the zombie infection portrayed in this movie is spread by blood, then how the HECK did zombies IN THE GROUND come out?! And where is the rest of the world? Where is the military? Surely they have been informed about this huge crisis happening. How did the girl survive in the school without getting eaten by zombies? No one else besides Alice decided to raid the gun store in a zombie apocalypse? The special/practical effects are horrible. The monsters in the church literally looked like something out of a old video-game. And the zombies themselves looked like people wearing Halloween costumes and makeup. The dialogue is cheesy, unconvincing, and terrible. This film has one of the worst, most under-developed romance I have ever seen in a movie. The action in no way has any suspense or tension, it is simply just random events happening with no substance or purpose. I don't expect a movie like this to be well-made or have a great-story, but at the very least give action that we can see!"
"GeorgeRoots","4","0","2","7 August 2014"," The Apocalypse In This Franchise Could Not Happen Sooner.
","In this chapter of the film series, it becomes painfully clear that the franchise isn't going to treat the audience like adults.<br/><br/>Sure it has a lot of action scenes to ""up the ante"", and they give the fans a little more what they want. But it all seems such a waste on what they should've been doing in such a large city. They have a chance to portray the epidemic in such a way, yet they resort to keeping it all contained in buildings. Rarely do you see any large hoards of zombies outside and where the makeup on villain ""Nemesis"" was fantastic, the ""walking tank"" is reduced to a former good guy. Pardon my language, but what a ""F@%* Y!$"" to the fans and one of the series best villain.<br/><br/>God bless Milla Jovovich for actually trying, and Sienna Guillory was not bad as Jill Valentine. She looks the part, but every time you see her she drops an F-bomb (I think I'm in love). What better way to cap off all this sadness by adding comic relief Mike Epps (Whose actually pretty funny), and wasting the effort of confident talents Oded Fehr, Thomas Kretschmann, Jared Harris and Iain Glen.<br/><br/>To be completely honest, the best thing about this movie was the superb teaser trailer directed by Marcus Nispel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRnp4UPI-Qk). It's one of my favourite marketing trailers ever, and I've made it a personal mission to show as many people as possible.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Just one great big missed opportunity. Has anyone ever watched a George A. Romero Film? 4/10."

","The Umbrella corporation's secret underground lab quarantine has been breached. Zombies and other mutants are escaping into Raccoon city up above. Umbrella has sealed off the city, and intends to nuke it to wipe out any evidence. Alice (Milla Jovovich) and various people are scattered in the city trying to survive. Meanwhile Dr. Ashford who has escaped is guiding them to rescue his daughter who is still trapped in the city.<br/><br/>This has the unenviable position of opening up the scale of the franchise without the needed support. The virus has spread out into the open. This movie is city wide, but the CGI has barely improved. It needs mass zombie armies, and that means lots of CGI. Instead, they're relying a lot on real stunts and real people. Director Alexander Witt just doesn't have the skills or the people to make it work.<br/><br/>The other problem is that the characters are widely scattered.

"ashleynwaldron","1","0","3","12 December 2012"," Absolute worst in the series; maybe worst movie ever
","I read somewhere that Sienna Guillory only got the part because she looked similar to the character from the game; watching her acting skills, I can definitely believe it. I can think of very few movies with worse acting than hers.<br/><br/>And that's only the start of this train wreck. Having never played the games, I can't comment to the similarities, but I've been told that this movie more than the rest was based off the games. If that is the case, they obviously didn't repeat that mistake with the latter films. Poor casting, worse acting, plot holes you could drive an eighteen wheeler through, terrible dialog, things so unrealistic as to give even the most avid zombie-genre fan pause.<br/><br/>For example... The dead are coming back to life; Alice, Jill, and their rag tag team have to leave the 'safety' of the church, so where do they go? Traipsing through a graveyard. Genius. Nemesis using a chain gun to destroy all the STARS members, but leaving the lone civilian standing in the middle of said STARS members still standing, even though the bullets never stop. Dead STARS to the front, rear, left and right of LJ get blown away, but not him.<br/><br/>Then of course, there's the actual plot holes. We go from seeing Alice leaving the hospital wearing little more than a bib and a lab coat, to her fully dressed (although I use the word loosely, considering the clothes she put on where nothing more than scraps), fully armed, with a motorcycle... and riding in to the church where a small group is huddle, saving them just in the nick of time. From there, we follow them around as the 'desperate doctor' calls them on every phone in the city, offering them a deal: if they save his little girl, he'll get them past the walls. What walls, you ask? Why, the walls that Umbrella installed, walls that completely seal off the city... Walls that apparently nobody was concerned by in the first place.<br/><br/>I could go on, and on about this disgrace of a movie... But suffice to say, there wasn't a single redeeming quality to this movie. If I hadn't started watching this series after the fourth movie came out, I probably wouldn't have, if I had seen this train wreck first. Don't waste your time, or your money."

","If you are mindless action movie freak who doesn't care about plot or good acting, go ahead and watch this. I myself am a huge fan of the RE games and this was an awful movie. First off please tell me who the hell is ""Alice"". This character has never appeared in any of the video games, for those who have never played the games, and on top of that this is not a horror movie it's pure mindless actions with awful one liners. Jill turned out to be horribly portrayed. She was supposed to be the main protagonist not ""Alice"". The UBCS team featured Carlos and Nicholai so I'm guessing they just left out their leader Mikhail. Nicholai was another important character which had other intentions during the incidents of Raccoon City, meaning he was supposed to die a trader. The only ""OK"" thing about the movie was the Nemesis, but they still managed ruin him too. The nemesis looked amazing but that was it. I guess it is okay to make some changes to the original story, but this just has no plot. As I stated before if you want to see a million bullets and some explosions go ahead this might be the film for you, but if you are a die hard RE fan like I am then I would pass on this one."
"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","6","0","2","15 September 2012"," Better Than The First. A Campy Trashy Fun Action Movie
","Let me start this review off by saying that I hated the first Resident Evil movie. It was a boring and poorly done film and i've never understood how anyone could think that it is possibly a good movie. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is considered by many fans to be the worst in the series. However, I personally think it's better than the first film. However, it is NOT a good movie by any means. It's actually a really bad movie. But, it's bad in the sense that it's so campy and trashy that it's actually fun.<br/><br/>Like the first film, this one doesn't have much of a plot to it. It's just Alice and a group of survivors trying to escape Raccoon City while fighting a bunch of zombies. Now as I mentioned before, the quality of the film itself is pretty terrible. The acting is awful, the dialouge is atrocious, and we still don't feel attached to anything or anyone in the film. However, the film pretty much plays out as a non-stop action movie which is what keeps it from being a bore. There's plenty of zombie action and everything from shoot-em-up gun-play to martial arts. Some of it is actually pretty damn cool to watch, and some of it is so over-the-top and silly that you'll be laughing your ass off. Despite how bad it is, it makes for a fun watch.<br/><br/>Considering how bad the first film was, I find it hard to understand why so many of the fans of this franchise hate this movie. It had much more of a video game feel to it and was more of what I imagined a Resident Evil movie being like. Is it anything like the games? No. But, it is a fun trashy action movie that while isn't a good movie, is still fun and very much in vein of a video game movie. I would never recommend this to someone who is looking for decent movie to watch. However, I could totally recommend this to those looking for a zombie action movie (although there are much much better zombie action movies out there) and people who love cheesy bad movies."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","3","4 September 2012"," Slightly Better Than the First Film
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The second film in the series is a slight improvement over the first but there's still no question that we've seen this type of thing way too many times. Raccoon City is about to be blown up with a nuclear missile after it's discovered that it has another zombie outbreak. Alice (Milla Jovovich), a survivor from the first flick, leads a group of people as they try to make it out of the city before its destruction. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE is a film that I found to be slightly better than the first and for the first fifty-minutes or so I was having a decent time but the thing eventually ran out of gas and led to a pretty boring final act where deja vu was running ramped. Again, the first portion of the film is slightly entertaining even if we've basically got a NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD type of situation where our group tries to find shelter to defend themselves but then they learn that they're going to be dead no matter what if they stay in the city. The entire zombie or missile thing should have been used to a much better effect but very little is done with this aspect. The final thirty-minutes or so of the picture pretty much has a bunch of plot twists going on but none of these really work or are all that interesting. The zombie attacks are more memorable here and I think we're given a couple good sequences. The big addition here is a giant creature who actually makes for a nice villain, although in the end he's under used. Once again Jovovich is in fine form in the lead role and she's certainly fun to watch as she kicks one butt after another. The supporting players are also a bit better here, although no one really stands out. When the film runs out of gas it's simply because we've been down these roads so many times before and this here just isn't giving us anything new. The second portion of the film turns into a rehash of the first movie and while fans might enjoy that it just left me cold."

AND their cover-up for this massacre is atomic bomb!? They said they would tell the rest of the world it was explosion of the nu-clear plant, but huge amount of the residents who watched freaking zombies were already left, so what about them? capture and kill them too? if it's so, why did Umbrella Co. let the people go through the gate in the first place? that was just ludicrous. <br/><br/>And second, about the Nemesis, people made this film should have created him by CG because he looks absolutely stupid.

"sameera-69","Null","0","2","19 July 2011"," 'RE: Apocalypse' is not completely bad
","The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the audience until the last ten minutes (which is a near-complete turn around from the original, which actually evoked SOME thought from the audience). It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot 'em up. The small sub-plots really vary from little to no relevance in the story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of 'oh no, my friend was bitten and eventually, I'll have to kill him just before he bites me' situation, and the big action/set pieces are blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot, with their arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an ass-kicking femme fatal, and finishes the film being...oh, you guessed it, an ass- kicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine (Guillory) is another one of these masculinely tough females, although sans Alice's super powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the epitome of black stereotypes, played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic, however that my favorite bit of 'Apocalypse' involved a reference to another video game franchise. <br/><br/>Again, 'RE: Apocalypse' is not completely bad. Although few, it has its moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience, which was something needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time (although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and his head piece actually shifts visibly on the actor's shoulders) and makes a formidable villain for a good margin of the film (although his closure is a bit weak). Many of the action sequences had great potential...but the majority of those action scenes were fast-cut, much like 'AvP', so much so that it was very hard at moments to see exactly what was happening in the shot. <br/><br/>'Apocalypse' suffices much more as an action movie than it does as a horror film, and it struggles to keep interest, even for someone who has faithfully played the video games. I will be glad to admit, though...'Apocalypse' has the BIGGEST, most unexpected scare of 2004. I won't say when or where...but I am glad to have experienced it. 'Apocalypse' isn't exactly worth all eight dollars of your admission fee, but it doesn't make a bad Saturday afternoon matinee...6/10."

The action sequences and explosions were good to watch but in some of the scenes felt like it was there to impress thirteen-year-old teenagers to keep their attention. I also noticed it follows the games a lot more in Apocalypse than it does with Resident Evil which is a plus since Resident Evil hardly followed any of the games. Gamers will be glad to see Nemesis, zombie dogs and Jill Valentine return on-screen and will also be glad that the design and make-up for Nemesis was superbly done. Yet again, Milla Jovovich was spot-on as bad-ass Alice as was Sienna Guillory who played as Jill Valentine and Mike Epps who added a little humour to this zombie action movie as L.J. The characters were done well but they wasn't done well enough that you would care about what happened to them.<br/><br/>The visual effects were done quite good and the action scenes were executed very well, especially the scenes in the church and the graveyard which showed great camera-work and special effects. The music wasn't very memorable and didn't fit some of the scenes well like the last movie although the theme tune was good.<br/><br/>The ending in this movie, for me, isn't much of an improvement from the last but it's good enough for a mediocre movie series.

"ozymandiaskingofkings","6","0","1","23 August 2009"," Starts off great, then goes horribly wrong.
","I was one of those people who really didn't like Paul WS Anderson's original ""Resident Evil"" film for several reasons. I thought it was too stylised, not scary enough, and that it had no respect for the source material whatsoever. I was also kind of sore that Anderson and his awful script had been chosen over the vastly superior Romero script.<br/><br/>To start with, the film seems far more impressive than the first one, with a plot that is not only more ambitious, but much more like that of the games. In REA, the T-virus outbreak has reached epidemic levels, spreading throughout Racoon City and turning much of the populace into flesh eating zombies. The plot itself is predominantly drawn from Resident Evil 3, following STARS babe Jill Valentine (accompanied by Alice from the first film) and special ops grunt Carlos Oliviera as they try to outrun mutant killing machine Nemesis, although the lost child subplot from RE2 is also included (sadly, Leon Kennedy isn't).<br/><br/>At first, this film's reputation as the worst of the Resident Evil films seems unwarranted. The first 2/3 are excellent, action packed, survival horror with a lot of nods to the games and some real standout scenes (especially the extended action sequence in an abandoned church, where it emerges the priest has been feeding his ""sick"" sister). There are some impressive visuals, some effective gore and lots of hot chicks kicking arse.<br/><br/>Then at the last 1/3 of the film everything goes to hell in a handcart, any semblance of horror thrown out and replaced with brainless, incoherent, heavily clich√©d CGI action in which Alice fist fights with Nemesis, and ultimately leading to a scene so unspeakably awful that it negates the whole film, as Nemesis is revealed to be Alice's ex-boyfriend and then, realising his feelings for her, joins the side of the heroes.<br/><br/>The acting could best be described as variable. Milla Jovovich is great as Alice and Sienna Guillory nails Jill Valentine so well she could have just stepped out of the game. The rest of the cast are less than impressive. Oded Fehr is wooden as a Spruce as Oliviera, while Mike Epps' LJ is essentially little more than a racist stereotype. The direction is also something of a mess. The camera is all over the place, the editing is sloppy and there is way too much fake looking CGI.<br/><br/>All in all, it makes for frustrating viewing. Unlike the first film, it does attempt to do the games some kind of justice and follow a canonical plot and I really wanted to like it for that. The trouble is, while it starts off great, it loses focus before the end and just panders to the ADH brigade, degenerating into a popcorn action flick. I personally prefer it to the original. Is it a better film technically speaking? No."

","I really, *really* didn't like the original Resident Evil movie, so quite why I decided to pick up a DVD triple-pack of all three movies in the series I'm not sure. Perhaps I was in the mood for something stupid; real MST3K fodder for a boozy weekend. Or maybe it was because it was cheap. Either way, I knew what to expect from rewatching the first film (basically, nothing) and had even lower expectations for the sequels.<br/><br/>So I was rather surprised that I quite enjoyed Resident Evil: Apocalypse. It's not *good*, not by any stretch of the imagination. Like the videogames on which it's based, 'cheesy' would be as good a word as any to describe it. But the difference is that the games took themselves fairly seriously, whereas Apocalypse knows exactly what it is - a big dumb action movie based on an entertaining but rather silly series of horror games - and embraces it. So it's filled with references to the games, but unlike the first film's tenuous background nods they actually play a part in the story... which is just as nonsensical as the games themselves, but knowingly so (and thankfully lacking in fetch-quests for emblems!).<br/><br/>Witt doesn't really bring anything especially interesting as a director (Paul WS Anderson, here only writing and producing rather than directing, may not be a great storyteller, but he at least has some visual flair) and the 15 certificate saps any impact from the action - like the original, it's a zombie movie with very little blood. But overall it's a definite improvement on the first film... which places it squarely in the 'average' category.<br/><br/>Will I be surprised again by Resident Evil: Extinction? I guess I'll find out soon enough..."

Milla is strong again in her performance but other than her and Sienna Guillory as Jill, there's barely any talent to be found in this mess, with weakly made-over monsters that barely pass for zombies and a ludricous pace.

","It seems to me that I've heard many articles stating the Resident Evil movies are ""terrible"" or ""a waste of my life"". There reasons? They do not conform with the game. You cannot say that these were terrible movies just because it didn't directly relate to the game. Would you want to watch a movie that you knew what happened behind every door? It takes the fun out of it. Paul Anderson gave this game-made-movie a fresh approach. Capcom, that creators of the Resident Evil franchise did the same thing when they made multiple spin-offs: Survivor, Survivor 2, Outbreak, Outbreak File #2, Gadien, and Dead Aim. None of these titles have a direct connection with the game; unless you consider the Outbreak series being located in Raccoon City. Resident Evil 4, the most recent released game, has a story line separate from the normal T-Virus/Umbrella story. They do in fact mention Umbrella and have characters from the other games just as the movie does. These movies were made to intrigue the fans of this franchise as well as introduce it to others not familiar with it. In my opinion, these movies are a great installment to Resident Evil and I'm glad I spent time and money to watch them."

","I was surprised that I enjoyed the first resident evil film, despite its soundtrack being off pace and lack of character development. This film starts where it left off with Alice being left in a world of destruction by zombies. I felt that there was too much emphasis on special effect shots and slow mo style matrix type martial arts. Obviously this film appeals to a younger audience, but overdoing it to make it look cook can wreck its appeal. Jill was a good add in but there could have been more engagement amongst the characters in general. Some scenes are pretty dumb at times - the graveyard scene with the zombies was not scary at all - and usually I'm terrified of graveyards (imagination takes over!).

","Video game based movies are a shaky ordeal. The original video games have their visuals and story so a director trying to make a movie based off of one might feel cheated since he/she won't really have to imagine much, just recreate and transpose onto the screen. That way the film will be faithful and fans of the game (the only real surefire audience) will be happy. However, directors who are presumably naturally creatively thinking people, won't want to stop there and instead add a bit of their own flair to the film. The first entry in this now franchise had that from Paul W.S. Anderson. It wasn't a great movie, but it was enjoyable with its action scenes and overall design which included some fun on screen deaths and gore.<br/><br/>This sequel is pretty much a direct continuation and goes right from the ending of the first film, but soon into the film you can see that things are missing. The design is pretty good and you feel like you are in the devastated Raccoon City, but the plot is tissue thin and the action very mundane. Action movies never really need deep plot (just watch the first ""Resident Evil""), but they do need visual flair (also shown in the first ""Resident Evil""). Here the action scenes are just one after the other quickly edited chaos and carnage. If you manage to see the deleted scenes on the DVD you'll see they're mostly dialog, Essentially any shred of a plot is there, while the film as released is just action. But done in a mundane way. And naturally the end sets the scene for another sequel. --- 4/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and profanity. Ages 13+"

","I played all the first 3 chapters of Resident Evil for so many times that I can't count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre. I think it's important for me to say that for Resident Evil I gave 3 stars. But unlike I did for Resident Evil, I will not split this comment as a game player and as a non game player because there's no need for doing that as the mess has been done with the first movie and we can't go back in time.<br/><br/>The second chapter of the game starts with Claire Redfield going to Racoon City in search for her brother disappearance, Chris Redfield, the character from the first chapter. Also there's Leon Kennedy which is coming to Racoon after his admission for the local police department. Claire and Leon meets each other when both of them were running away from the zombies attacks. An explosion split themselves, both go to separate ways to find survivors and a way to call for rescue. During their search for rescue they discover what happened to the city, the people, and all the responsibilities of Umbrella Co. over the happenings. That's the story of the game.<br/><br/>Backing to the movie, Resident Evil ended with Milla Jovovich discovering the complete caos surrounding Racoon City. The city is completely destroyed everywhere, there's no sign of any human being. She's alone. The first movie was a huge piece of crap but its end was a sign that everything could be better in a sequel because its end is a lot like the way the second chapter of the game starts. I thought they would start the movie from its prequel finish... but they didn't. Crap again.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse, had all the qualities to be a better and interesting version of Dawn Of The Dead if it had been made over the original game plot because it also takes over a city fulfilled by zombies and there's a complete caos everywhere but with more interesting characters, but the movie wasted again all the potentials of the game plot and that's a shame.<br/><br/>Nemesis is quite the same of the game, but at the end of the movie he saves Alice from the dead, because, you know, at the deep of his heart there's a human. Oh, cmon, that's so dumb!!! Nemesis is the toughest monster of the series, he destroys everything he touches and there's no way to scape if you do not have a rocket launcher because he never dies with punches or simple bullets, he was made to be a destruction machine.<br/><br/>Milla is worst than ever, and when you think that Milla is the worst actress of the movie than you'll be surprised with Sienna Guillory. Siena is Jill Valentine, it could be fine to have this character if the plot of either Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse were some kind faithful to the game plot, but they're not, so... what the hell she's doing there? And Why she's here using the outfit of the 3rd game? On the game there's an explanation for her to be using that outfit, it's silly, but still being an explanation, but that outfit on the movie is bullshit! She's there and using that outfit just saying there's finally an original character in the movie and she needs to look hot for the audience. And there's more... Jill Valentine doesn't have that personality. She's fragile but also courageous, she's not that kind of kicking ass girl that is shown in the movie. The first scene where Jill appears is so clich√© and laughable, making all those choreography with her pistols and shooting perfectly on every zombie. That's awful... it's a scene to impress 8 y.o. kids, and it's a shame that this movie is full of scenes like that. The other original character there is Carlos Oliveira, original but useless for the movie.<br/><br/>There's no way to fix this series... I don't know who are the people who enjoyed this movie so much to make the studio work on a 3rd chapter. I hope some good director take the Resident Evil project serious someday to redo as it should had be."
"jaredmobarak","7","0","1","21 September 2007"," Project Alice is online¬ÖResident Evil Trilogy
","Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.<br/><br/>It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.<br/><br/>The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutes¬óthey go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.<br/><br/>And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crows¬óyes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.<br/><br/>Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10"

","OKKKKKKK, ummmmm........Resident Evil Apocalypse....errrrr.....where do I start with this one? Right. I have to say that this movie is not without merit. The action is kind of enjoyable, the characters were pretty good characters, and there are moments where you want to laugh out loud. But the first film was better. A survival movie to an extent with a few extra bits added on, freaky looking zombies, and a sense of intensity.<br/><br/>There are a few points wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>1) The film begins with zombies in the police station and Jill Vaneltine going in to zap them perfectly in the head. How could they possibly arrest zombies? 2) The film's score was rubbish. The first film had a hardcore intense rock score. This one had a terrible jittery instrumental one.<br/><br/>3) The zombies didn't look as nasty or dangerous.<br/><br/>4) The director made it oh-so-obvious who the main characters were with OTT entrances: Jill walks into the police station and begins slotting zombies, Carlos jumps out of a helicopter and begins slotting zombies as he drops, hitting every one and kicking the last one in the face as he lands, and Alice drives a motorbike through a church window before driving it into a licker, jumping off and as it floats up she shoots it and it explodes, and....well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>5) The action scenes were sometimes visually indecipherable, especially with nemesis.<br/><br/>6) Carlos' buddy was killed too suddenly.<br/><br/>7) The director decided to have the dogs blown up with the pathetic cigarette trick.<br/><br/>8) The end action sequence had nemesis and the others attacking the umbrella guards together in a ridiculously OTT style.<br/><br/>9) The nemesis' suspense is ruined by revealing his face too early.<br/><br/>I could go on, but there are too many mistakes made. The main reason behind this is the director, because Alexander Witt is too much of a techy guy rather than a visionary director type. If it had been done properly it would be better."
"ShadeGrenade","1","0","2","24 August 2007"," Alice In Zombie Land!
","It used to be the case that zombie movies were purely the preserve of filmmakers with low budgets and no stars, now it seems everyone is making them. In 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', a virus escapes from a top secret facility known as The Hive, infecting the inhabitants of Raccoon City, and a small group of survivors have to battle their way through an army of flesh-eating zombies to freedom.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why George A.Romero's early 'living dead' pictures worked so well was due to their documentary approach. No matter how far fetched the premise, you felt as though you were watching real people caught up in a terrifying situation. The main characters in this film, however, are anything but 'real', consisting mainly of young, good-looking people well acquainted with the martial arts, armed with weapons Rambo would be jealous of, and who never tire. No sooner have they wiped out one gang of zombies with karate kicks and expertly aimed shots than they are ready to wipe out another without so much as pausing for breath. Hence the suspense factor is nil.<br/><br/>Milla Jovovich reprises her role as 'Alice', and admittedly she looks great crashing through a church window on a motorcycle ( or rather her stunt double does ), but the script gives her no opportunity whatever to establish, much less develop a character. She is as every bit as inhuman as her opponents.<br/><br/>Like many modern horror movies, it over-relies on C.G.I. for effect. The action scenes are shot and edited in the style of an M.T.V. rock video; bullets fly out of guns in slow motion, people do back flips and execute perfect leaps over fences, and Milla still manages to look sexy no matter what happens.<br/><br/>The appearance of 'Nemesis' is a hoot; resembling nothing less than one of Clive Barker's 'Cenobites' with a Schwarzenegger complex. If you can sit through the scene where it uses a rocket launcher to wipe out the S.T.A.R.S. without laughing, you are made of stronger stuff than I.<br/><br/>Alexander Witt must have thought that the visual trickery was enough to carry the film, and decided not to bother with such trifles as a strong plot, believable characterisations and dialogue. Did anyone understand that ending? I certainly didn't.<br/><br/>For a superior example of a zombie picture, check out the original 'Dawn Of The Dead'."

","The biggest problem with some movie sequels is that you need to know what happened in the original to appreciate what occurs in the sequel. Fortunately, ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse "" (*** out of ****) recaps ""Resident Evil"" during its first few minutes, creates an even bigger crisis for another motley crew of characters, then this exciting video-game inspired sequel resumes where the original left off and goes for the jugular. In other words, if you missed ""Resident Evil"" or don't recall it well enough to fill-in-the-blanks, the filmmakers do it for you, bringing you up to speed for the sequel. Happily, L'Oreal international spokesmodel Milla Jovovitch reprises her athletic, gun-toting, butt-kicking role as Alice, ex-head of security at The Hive, while scenarist Paul W.S. Anderson provides some additional surprises for audiences since they last saw Alice. Brighter, bloodier, and more hyperkinetic than ""Resident Evil,"" ""Apocalypse"" pulls out all stops with spectacular, high-octane combat, eye-catching photography, and charismatic characters. Although he falls back on the oldest plot in the apocalyptic genre: the rescue story (anybody remember ""Escape From New York"" or ""Raiders of Atlantis?""), Anderson conjures up a new group of take-charge heroes that you don't often find in these bone-numbing, written-by-the-numbers, chiller thrillers. Meaning, a larger number of good guys survive ""Apocalypse"" than their ill-fated counterparts in ""Resident Evil."" Whereas ""Resident Evil"" took place underground in the top-secret Hive Viral Research Facility, ""Apocalypse"" transpires above-earth in the city around normal, everyday, urban surroundings where the scares get scarier. For example, after the contagious T-Virus infects the city, a Catholic priest struggles to save a zombified woman by roping her down to a chair and feeding her the human body parts of less fortunate victims. Veteran second-unit action director Alexander Witt, who cut his teeth helming big-scale action sequences for ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""XXX,"" ""Daredevil,"" and ""Speed,"" takes over for ""Resident Evil"" director Paul W.S. Anderson. Anderson departed for the opportunity to call the shots on the new ""Alien Vs. Predator"" sequel. As the first ""Evil"" epic did, ""Apocalypse"" indicts corporations who imagine themselves exempt from the rules that govern society.<br/><br/>As the action unfolds, Raccoon City--which sprawls above the Umbrella Corporation's underground testing facility the Hive--has been infected by a T-Virus that kills people then transforms them into flesh-feasting zombies. Scene for scene, ""Apocalypse"" surpasses the original. The mutant Dobermans pinchers in ""Apocalypse"" put those pups in ""Resident"" to shame. The only drawback is the Umbrella Corporation's newest monster, the towering Nemesis figure who resembles Chewbacca, the ""Star Wars"" wookie but with a severe case of the mange. Once the T-Virus spreads throughout the city, everybody panics and wants out. Umbrella officials with corporate armed security guards block all exits and prepare to nuke the city. Not only do they want to cover-up their debacle, but also they want to eliminate any witnesses. Caught on the wrong side of the wall are supercop Jill Valentine (sexy British actress Sienna Guillory of ""The Time Machine"") who wears a tube-top and a miniskirt and can out-shoot the Lone Ranger; Umbrella policemen Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehur of ""The Mummy""); and smart-aleck African-American street hustler L.J. (Mike Epps of ""Next Friday""). A wheelchair-bound Umbrella Corp. scientist Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris of ""Happiness"") who lost his junior high school aged daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur of ""Evelyn""), during the evacuation, tracks down Alice and company. If they find his daughter, the good doctor will direct them to safety.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Resident Evil,"" ""Apocalypse"" isn't all about the reanimated corpses. Again, scenarist Anderson furnishes more revelations about the contagious T-Virus, while he lets the heroes get away with the darnest things. The mile-a-minute action sequences will spin your head, and watching Jill and Alice blast away with their mega-weapons at hordes of these evildoers really ramps up the adrenaline factor. Of course, it's as far-fetched as flying rabbits, but wow how those rabbits do fly! Witt makes an impressive directorial debut, orchestrating elaborate action scenes with occasionally jolting blood & gore. ""Apocalypse"" will reanimate anybody who enjoyed ""Resident Evil."""

Oh yea then the writer thought lets make one of the best video game charters be a bumbling retard that does nothing other then stand there because thats what the lovers of the game want. oh and as proof of the fact that there are more haters then lovers is the user rating i hate most people on IMDb but at least they can spot the worst movie of all time"

","No plot, no character development, cheesy scares and silly action. That's in the nutshell everything, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has to offer. The first film was okay, if you could appreciate the comedic aspect of the film, but RE:A hits the action throttle so far back, that every scene in it turns either unintentionally funny or just plain boring.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a horror film turn away, as RE:A doesn't have slightest bit in common with the genre. It is more of a brainless action in style of Commando, though you could argue that at least Commando HAD some kind of a plot thingy in it.<br/><br/>This time the film has two babes killing off the deaders, though that doesn't matter the slightest in terms of personality or characterization. They both are more thought than anyone else and all the other characters are in the movie just to be killed off. Milla Jovovich makes a return as Alice and the other chick is Jill, played by Sienna Guillory.<br/><br/>Special effects are okay, but far from the greatest ever. In more than one occasion the CGI is far too noticeable. Music isn't anything worth mentioning and neither is the acting, or any of the actors for the matter, as it all is just so... ordinary.<br/><br/>Score: 3/10 Camp score: 3/10"

","Many mistakes were made translating it from game to film. Such as who's a bad guy and who a good guy? what can this monster do? and others, but I'll write about the film errors.<br/><br/>The movie lacks tension that the games have, due to lack of ammo, you never have the gun you need when you need it most, and a few cheesy one-liners. In the game you're by yourself, and surrounded by monsters and zombies, and quite often you make a run past everything just to avoid conflict. Witt (Director) doesn't seem to understand that Resident Evil game are titled ""Survival Horror"" for a reason, you have to survive on some basic supplies and fight or run from the horror. In the movie its, ""See the monster, shoot the monster. Next!"", type of action. Alice(Jovovich) and Carlos(Fehr) have almost endless firepower, and it takes away the stress that is felt in the game. It also makes a cheep shot with some naked stripper zombies just for a few extra buck from the guys. The film has this really bad habit of using bad film to make the zombies look like its running on the PSX console, but to me it makes it seem like he's hiding a bad makeup job, as if their wasn't enough makeup to go around. The end fight before Racoon city is blown up, is laughable to boring, and insulting to the RE franchise and (most importantly) it's fans.<br/><br/>In its defence however, I liked the mini-gun Nemises is now armed with, and how the Nemises was introduced. The musical BGM and soundtrack is written well to the action happening in the movie. Unfortunity that's all I can defend for it."

If I am not ""engaged"" by 20 minutes into the film, I don't end up keeping enough interest to like it.<br/><br/>I got the DVD from my public library to see Milla Jovovich who is Alice. And, pretty Sienna Guillory who is Jill Valentine. Maybe I was hindered by not having seen the first ""Resident Evil"" movie, because I had no idea what was going on in the first 20 minutes, and there wasn't much in the film to make it clear.<br/><br/>So, this is not a particularly good review. There are a few monsters, some dead people who attack in a sort of trance and try to eat healthy people. Some people get shot and killed, but they don't give up on them. Sometimes they put them into a big tank of water with a scuba-type of breathing magpie's, and eventually they live! This is the movie that has the scene of a nude Milla in a tank, and when she is taken out you briefly see her extra long nipples, which look a bit funny on her extra flat chest.

In a desperate attempt to control the situation, the Umbrella Corperation impose a lock-down on the city, trapping all its inhabitants. Our main character's fight for survival has begun.<br/><br/>This sequel is set in the streets of Racoon City and is much more action based than the original. We now enjoy breathtaking martial arts fight scenes and unbelievable stunts, the most spectacular of which involves Alice ramming a licker with a motorbike in a church propelling it and the bike several feet into the air. In one smooth motion, Alice draws her guns and fires two shots into the bike's fuel tank blowing up the licker.<br/><br/>The graphics of the creatures have also improved. The new Nemesis is now played by an actor in a body suit and a bigger budget has resulted in far more believable lickers than the one featured in the original.<br/><br/>The writers have also felt the need to add elements of comedy as we witness the antics of the hapless L.J. who talks tough but has hilarious fits of panic in the heat of battle.<br/><br/>All in all, the film has all the action and suspense of the original and then-some.

","I write this as a fan of both ""Resident Evil"" and Milla Jovovich, neither is fully served justice in this film, which struggles to impress. The first Resident Evil, was a tense low budget affair , which used the contained environment to it's full potential.Paul Anderson, who has ruined both ""Alien Vs Predator"" and ""Mortal Kombat,"" came out of it, with some respect and Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigez both supply good performances. The second though, tries to be an action film, and a horror film and fails to be great at either. The director , Alexander Witt, is out of his depth , this being his first film. But there is flashes of brilliance in the church scene and in the big face-off, between Alice and Nemesis. On the other hand Alexander Witt didn't stand a chance, which can also be said for Oded Fehr, Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guilroy, who all give good performances. This is because the script by Paul Anderson is both pathetic and lazy. The inclusion of Mike Epps character is extremely inadequate, and screams of the ""token black guy"" routine. All and all, flashes of brilliance , but not enough to justify it. The worse new Paul Anderson is going to drag the series even lower , a new sequel is being filmed in May, 2006 or so I hear. Personly I pray not."

I have not seen the first ""Resident Evil"" film, nor have I played (or even heard of) the video game. So, I am coming at this film from a sci-fi action flick direction. While the movie largely fails at this, it really could have been a lot worse. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory were decent enough as the tough-girl video-game-type heroines. Somebody named Mike Epps tried to play the clich√©' smart-ass black guy part. The best acting came from Sandrine Holt, as the TV reporter trapped in the nightmare. There were huge plot holes, as you might expect. Seem to me that this one is worth skipping, but isn't terrible."
"dimlim77","9","0","1","27 March 2006"," Once again it does what it supposed to
","First off, the rating of 9 out of 10 is based on a video game movie rating and how it keeps true to the game itself. I have read both positive and negative reviews on this movie and I do not want to say right and wrong but the negative commenters are expecting too much.<br/><br/>The action is even better than the first one, which I loved, the characters and the cast chosen to play them are even better and their chemistry really shows. No, they are not great actors but they are good enough to do the job. This movie mostly stays true to the game (actually I have never seen a movie that is 100% on with a book or a game) and any gamer should enjoy it.<br/><br/>Basically Racoon City has come under attack by the T-Virus. This is an engineered virus that makes humans into the walking undead but there is a twist. There is a woman and a little girl, Alice and Angela, who were purposely injected with the virus. Alice worked for the Umbrella corporation and she was injected to be the super-human fighting machine and Angela was injected to help overcome some childhood illnesses. The movie is then basically an attempt to escape the city before the corporation launches a nuclear warhead. From there on the action is non-stop and exciting but there is some light comedic relief by Epps. <br/><br/>To make this short, if you like video games and realize that this is a VG movie then you will like this movie. But if you are one of those people who have never heard of the game and go to theater, see this title and decide to give it a shot then you will probably not like it and be very confused."

When all of a sudden, ""people"" start emerging from graves. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but graveyards are for people who are dead. By the looks of most of them, they had been dead for some time. If they have been dead and not exposed to the virus, why are they coming back from the dead and trying to eat these live human beings? I know people that are watching are not supposed to think of these things, but perhaps I've missed something. Maybe someone could post what is going on that I may have missed. I just saw it as a useless fight scene with no connection to the actual plot. The plot being that the living in Raccoon City were being infected by the virus, dying and returning to life on some sort of primal level and trying to feed on what is left of the live human beings. Where do these already dead people fit in?"

It was a fun action film that didn't have a lot to it and didn't do anything terribly wrong. Nemesis was kind of corny, but I could deal with him.<br/><br/>Apocalypse picks up exactly where the first movie ended, which is always a plus in my book. They brought this one closer to the game, as Jill Valentine of Resident Evil 1 and 3 was a main character. Not a redhead in the movie, as they already had a redhead in Jovovich's Alice. The plot seemed mostly based on a combination of Resident Evil 3 and Resident Evil: Code Veronica. It involved the cover-up of the virus incident by Umbrella, but included elements of survivors being hunted by Nemesis while escaping. These two stories worked well together.<br/><br/>My problem was that, because of this, the movie didn't focus enough of the zombie battles, but instead took a turn to humans fighting each other near the end. But all in all, a fun movie if you don't want to think."

Remember that this is not a horror-film nor really a zombie-film but an action film...with zombies.<br/><br/>Where the plot may be lacking it rather well mirrors that of the games. The main-reason I like this movie is the characters. The over-all look of the film is also something I enjoyed though it wasn't quite as impressive as the cold visual appearance of the first film. Musically the film unfortunately did not have the same level of electronic ominous presence as the first.<br/><br/>One of my favorite elements in this film is Nememsis. He has a bizarrely demanding presence. I also thought it was kinda cute how they tied up the loose end from the last film with him.<br/><br/>While it is nowhere as good as its predecessor the film is definitely watchable, its stunts and visual effects work brilliantly and the movie assures that the viewer will never have a dull moment.<br/><br/>Hardcore RE fans however, don't bother."

It looks great, sounds cool and is wonderfully camp, a tongue in cheek homage to computer gaming fluff. You can't watch a zombie movie in seriousness - the genre was created as a way to satirically represent modern society, not to be judged alongside Merchant Ivory or Federico Fellini.

In fact, in the first halve of the story the main character Alice, played by Milla Jovovich, is hardly used in the movie. The movie tries to follow too many characters, it doesn't make the movie confusing but it does make this movie a bit odd and uneasy to watch at times. The movie doesn't always flow and despite its potential the story makes some odd choices.<br/><br/>Again the movie has some good action and as a Zombie movie it also certainly isn't a bad movie but still the movie has an awful B-movie feeling over it at times. The actors (I really like Thomas Kretschmann as an actor but he was terribly miscast in this movie and simply didn't fit the part) and their dialog is horrible and the movie has some at times horrible editing and use of slow-motion. It also again 'borrows' too many elements from other more successful movies. It isn't exactly the most original movie to watch. Still there are some good elements in the movie, such as with the Nemisis character, that is one big cool villain with some serious heavy weaponry.<br/><br/>A different director and writer would had certainly done some good to this movie.

Alexander Witt did a great job as a second unit director in M:I and Black Hawk Down, but turn him into a director is a kind of huge risk. Anyway, RE: Apocalypse (known before as RE: Nemesis) is a good movie for this director to came up with a visual style, that is like a copy of Ridley Scott visual style with some acid added. The story of RE evolves and now we move to the city of the second and third video game, we have characters from the original games (Carlos Olivera and Jill Valentine) and the bad-ass villain known as The Nemesis. Milla Jovovich is cool as Alice ""The gamer"" as I am used to call her, and finally, hearing the voices of the ones who saw the original movie, we don't have licker puppets anymore. This movie is more a monster movie than a zombie movie, and I still missing a couple of them like The Tyrant and the Mutated Sharks.

","The original was aimed at the fans of the game and the director and Mila only expected a cult audience. What they succeeded in doing was creating a film that not only appealed to the fans of the game but reached out to others. Resident evil 2 is no different although in areas is falls short of the original movie in other areas it surpasses it.<br/><br/>One of the areas it definitely pulls up short of its counterpart is the jump factor. The original was full of little jumpy moments where the director shocked the audience, and he used many of the same ideas the games had in them to scare the audience. In the sequel the scariest moment would be without a doubt in the church as Jill Velntine and her companions are trying to avoid being eaten. Apart from that however there is little in the movie to make you jump.<br/><br/>The main area the sequel improves on is the special affects. This is obviously due to the fact the original was made on a budget of about 10-20 million dollars and this one was made on a real Hollywood budget.<br/><br/>The score to this movie was excellent with the music fitting the feeling of the movie perfectly. Although again I would have to say I preferred the score for the original with Marylin Manson's incredibly creepy and cool theme song.<br/><br/>All in all however this movie is worthy sequel. Don't go along expecting to be moved to tears by the story. This movie dosn't aim to do that it aims to entertain, scare and make the audience think about the power of corperations in America today."

","This movie is not that bad. I saw the first one but it didn't really live up to it's expectations. This one is much better than the first. Of course not everyone will agree because it's hard to please both movie goers and video gamers. I like the fact that most of the movie had some type of reference to the original games (expectation on the first resident evil video game). There are some differences between the game and the movie but overall it was still enjoyable. Millia Jovovich was alright, although i don't like that they made a non character of the game as the main ""bad ass"" good guy er girl. Jill is a major character that should have been the main focus. Olivera was alright, he was like a reference to chris but he wasn't great, he was just well... there, at least he was in resident evil 3. Jill Valentine was the best actress in the movie, (one word cleavage). Not only did Sienna look good (damn she was hot, never heard of her till now), but she played Jill Valentine to a T. I even read that she studied jill from resident evil 3, she even moved like her. The second person or i guess ""creature"" that was awesome was Nemesis. Nemesis reminded me of Terminator in a way, just plain bad ass. Some of the bad elements though was that the movie didn't flow perfectly, some things were just plain weird and there was some plot holes. I think the only thing i didn't like to much is they just threw the people inside the movie without explaining their origins or overall depth. Like Jill, she just runs in the police stations shoots zombies and thats pretty much it. I thought at the grave she was going to say "" i've encountered umbrella, at a mansion on the outskirts of this city"". But of course that didn't happen. The only character that really had depth was Alice. Another thing, why did Dr. Ashford bite the main bad guy? He wasn't even a zombie, he just got shot!? Overall though an enjoyable movie in some respects, other respects it was OK. Good rental but don't know about a buy."

(AKA there about to nuke the living f*** out of the city to keep the virus from spreading) now Alice, a reporter a black stereotype, two stars police officers, and some Russian mercenaries must race against time and zombies to save the daughter of an umbrella scientist while avoiding an even worse threat if they are to escape alive.<br/><br/>Quite frankly this isn't anything original but this movie doesn't succeed because of originality it succeeds because it takes the elements that have been used millions of times before in zombie movies but uses them in a way that is both interesting and suspenseful, with just the right blend of action suspense and comedy to appeal to fans of the original video game series while still reaching a larger audience. The only things holding the movie down from going from good to great are, its lack of originality in plot, a script that kept the actors from going beyond there stereotypes, and the fact that despite everything that went on in the movie none of our questions are answered we still don't know umbrella's goals we still don't know Alice,s relation to the umbrella corporation and we still don't know what umbrella intended to use Alice for. Overall the movie is in the end better than I thought it would be, but don't go there hoping for any groundbreaking effects or storyline. While not a great movie it's worth watching."

","I'm the fan of the first movie and the game but this movie is nothing compare to both. It was sort of the disappointment cause it look so good in the trailer. This movie has lost its believable story and style that the first movie was built on.<br/><br/>It is not all that bad, if you look in the action movie wise and not comparing it to the first. The movie picking up where the end of the first movie left off. They have done a good job with the Nemesis makeup and costume, really look like in the game. And Milla did look hotter than the first movie.<br/><br/>The casting and acting of this movie is very average (though, much worst than first movie). This time there is hardly any dialogue. They concentrate too much on how the character in the movie should be like the game rather than trying to develop more realistic storyline.<br/><br/>Anyway I have to warn that if you're planning to watch ¬ñ expect more of an action fighting rather than zombie movie. Also expect the cheesy ending (unlike the first) and also tacky battle scene that you normally seen in Mortal Kombat and Kick Boxing movie but uses here between Nemesis and Alice.<br/><br/>The most disappointing of all in this movie was - there're hardly any Zombie.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Yes, But Don't Expect It To Be As Good As The First.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C)<br/><br/>Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It - Thanks"

","I am really biased when it comes to movies based on computer games, especially computer games that I'm fond of. When you think about it, it's very unrewarding to make such a movie - you gotta please the fans, yet make an entertaining movie for general audience..not an easy task to do.<br/><br/>The main problem for me is, well, things that work in a computer game don't usually work in the movie. In the game you have a heroine who runs around as scantily clad as she could be, blasting zombies with her dual guns, and well, why the hell not? If I have to play about 12 hours to get to the end, I'd rather be watching an attractive girl then a beefed up hunky Arnold type guy. But if you have that same character in the movie, and she still runs after zombies in a top and a miniskirt AND there is no a convincing explanation why exactly does she think that's the best attire for zombie-hunting, then it usually looks just plain silly. But let her wear something else and pretty soon you'll have fans on your neck (why is she not wearing her trademark miniskirt? Huh? Worst-game-adaptation-EVAR!!!) <br/><br/>Resident Evil: Apocalypse tries so hard to fit as many elements from the game as it can, be it the characters, the enemies, even the original cut-scenes from the games themselves. But the problem is that it does just that - there's no story to speak of, no character development, no nothing. Just our ""familiar"" characters running around killing everything that comes at them. It's not even a good zombie movie, since zombies are more a part of the scenery now, a distraction from furious action sequences and explosions.<br/><br/>The movie aims to achieve many things at once, but fails on almost on every note. Is it scary? No. There are some so-so scary scenes, but nothing worth mentioning (btw one comment speaks of the BIGGEST SCARE IN 2004 - I must say I didn't see anything even remotely justifying that remark). The action scenes are intense, but again nothing spectacular or not seen before. There is comic relief in the shape of stereotypical ""jivey black guy"", a few of the obligatory ""oh no, a good character is bitten and will soon turn into a zombie"" elements and that's it.<br/><br/>If you are not a fan of the games, don't see this movie. If you are, check it out for some familiar references, but don't expect too much. I mean, sure, Jill Valentine is in it. AND she wears a miniskirt. If you think it's worth the money for the movie ticket, than go for it. But I think you'll have much more fun staying home playing through the games again."
"tdawgg29","10","0","2","9 July 2005"," A must-own DVD for video game freaks!!!
","I want to let you know that this is my 3rd time I've watched the DVD version of ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse."" I truly enjoyed the sequel 11 times better than the original picture.<br/><br/>Based on the popular Nintendo GameCube video game and other platforms, Apocalypse picks up where the first film ended. After escaping from the Hive facility of The Umbrella Corporation, Alice (played by Mila Jovovich) fights once again in a war between the human race and the undead. Under quarantine, Raccon City is completely locked down. Then, Alice teams up with a small band of vigilant soldiers led by S.T.A.R. officer Jill Valentine (played by British actress Sienna Guillory) and an outcast of Umbrella Corp. Carlos and Nikolai portrayed by Zach Ward from ""A Christmas Story"". An action/horror film isn't complete without some comedy relief. After Friday and Friday After Next's Mike Epps adds laughter and ad-libs to the picture and never gets very awkward or bored.<br/><br/>Filled with undead zombies, Lickers, mutant dogs and Umbrella's ultimate weapon of mass destruction, Nemesis, special effects and incredible stunts, film director Alexander Witt have truly revolutionize the way how a video game to film should work. I'm sure that director Paul Anderson (also produces this film) should learn a thing or two about directing films.<br/><br/>My highest possible recommendation is to buy the DVD. On the first disc, you get to see 2 different formats of the film (wide and full screen), and special features that includes deleted scenes, exclusive behind the scenes, and movie trailers on the second. For all of you video game freaks out there, go out and buy Apocalyse right now. But to some of them who don't like graphic violence of the film, do not buy or rent... this is only for the hardcore sci-fi horror film buffs. Overall, Resident Evil: Apocalypse earns a frighteningly perfect 10!!!! Way to go, Alex and Paul...!"
"the amorphousmachine","5","0","2","5 July 2005"," This turd of a film is better than the original turd of a film.
","That's right! 'Resident Evil: Apocalyspe' is better than 'Resident Evil' because, in my opinion, it captures more of the essence of the video game it's based on. We actually see Racoon City this time, and our characters actually walk through this deserted city with its creepy cemeteries and churches. Add to the fact that the Nemisis is in it, and that certainly helps. However, every friggin character is a card-board cut out with extra cheese added on top. From the Swat looking guy working for the Umbrella corporation to our hero in Milla Jovovich, who is super-charged and strong. Yes, we see some outlandish action sequences, where heroes arrive just in time with crazy motorbike stunts to save the day, to doing the over-the-top by numbers death scenes. This film is never scary or ""real"" in my eyes, and the characters are annoying to boot. 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is simply a dumb action movie with zombies. Slightly better than the first film, but that's not saying much as they both have the same score from me- for the sequel not a significant improvement over the original adaption of an excellent video game. Given the strain of Zombie films to be released in the past 2 years, 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' deserves to be ranked well below them.<br/><br/>**¬Ω out of *****!"
"cherold","7","0","1","3 July 2005"," a little weaker than the first, but fun
","Another efficient little thriller based on the Resident Evil games. This one isn't quite as fast and focused as the last, but it's got a number of very good moments in it that get your attention and it does have a good pace and good performances, to the extent one can be said to perform in a movie that is almost entirely about running around shooting things.<br/><br/>Some people complained that the first movie wasn't much like the games. I would say this movie is a little more like the games, at least in places, and I think that's part of the problem. Games are structured in a very meandering way in which you just wander around exploring and fighting and occasionally get a little exposition, which is why I never considered the complaints about the first movie not being enough like the video games valid.<br/><br/>Still, I had a good time. I'm giving this movie the same score as the first, even though I didn't think it was quite as good, perhaps just because I'm just in a mellow and generous frame of mind."

In fact i was expecting this movie to be a complete & utter load of pants. But i actually thought that it was pretty darn good, better than the Tomb Raider series of movie game tie ins. I think that most people who have played & enjoyed the games will appreciate this film. It has great action & suspense, there was some humour & the characters were well portrayed too, i mean i felt i did care about them. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie & think it's a shame that it got slated so badly in the reviews & maybe put a lot of people of seeing it. I think the reason it got such negative reviews are because it is a movie of a computer game. Anyway if you enjoy a movie with plenty of action some scares, suspense & humour & especially if you enjoy the games. Get this one out & enjoy it."
"aimless-46","4","0","3","12 June 2005"," Wretched Excess Piled on Top of Wretched Excess
","John Huston once said that a good story should have ""excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony"". Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"". What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.<br/><br/>The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching ""Beauty and the Beast"" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.<br/><br/>The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.<br/><br/>Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads. Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh every time they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's ""Zoolander"" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in ""Dummy"" than she does in her ""Resident Evil-Apocalypse"" outfits.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","It's very rare to combine action, horror, and humor in one movie, but somehow they pulled it off. I'm still wondering how Mike Epps go t a part in this movie. It's not that he made it worse, but to me he actually made it better. It's amazing no matter what movie you put him in he still acts hilariously ignorant. Had me laughing with every scene he was in. This film was better equipped with horror than the first one was. There were some parts where it was really surprising. Mostly it was in the school. But the did better with the suspense. The action was good, too. I was actually surprised. The action scenes were good and at least this time there's a reason why she's such a gun expert and good fighter. The first one became too unrealistic with the dog scene. Overall, the movie was good. The whole movie pretty much held my interest and is was worth watching. Kudos"

","when i first heard of this movie i jumped for joy at the offer of going to see it, but was thoroughly disappointed when i was told that it was not going to be released into the cinema but straight onto DVD! Why? i do not know, but so when i finally brought this DVD i was very impressed with the amount of extras that there were! now, when it came to the actual movie, i was of many opinions. i am a die hard fan of resident evil, and loved the first movie to death! when i came to watch this sequel i was enjoyed practically to extinction, i love it in every way. once again i thought the acting was of high standard from such people as Milla, Sienna and Oded. all three were of continuous high acting and didn't stop once to catch their breath. other actors such as Zack Ward and Sandrine backed the rest of the cast up, i was really upset when they were both killed off, why didn't L.j die, i hate him! although for the actor who played Dr. Ashford, i really wanted to strangle him!! his voice was monotone without expression, every time he was on screen i just clasped my hands over my ears and screamed at his lack of acting.<br/><br/>The all out action was again to such a degree immense and the stunts were impeccable, especially where Milla (Or rather the stunt woman) ran 100ft down the vertical side of a building. the special effects were higher and upgraded to be more realistic than the previous movie.<br/><br/>However, Milla could have really tried harder, as i feel she acted better in the first movie. I feel the movie would have been made a whole lot better if such characters from the first movie would have returned, such as the likes of Kaplan who you didn't actually see him die! However, although the all out action and the zombies and the acting were to a large degree good, the story line was, well, not at it's best. The only reason i thought this movie was good was the above things, and they just managed to cover up the fact that the plot wasn't that great. they could have built it more into the movies, as the movie goes totally against the events in the games.<br/><br/>But overall, this was an enjoyable watch and i would definitely see it again. It's just the only few things that should have been changed- Nicholai and Terri should not have died, L.J and Carlos (Who died in the game) should have died. Alice's humanity was lost due to the norm of experimentation turning her into a zombie killing machine (Extremely bad, it would have been better if she was like how she was in the first movie) old characters such as Kaplan should have returned, and events in the games should have been added.<br/><br/>overall, i feel although this movie's CGI was better than the first and the acting was of the same standard, it highly lacked story and plot such as the first and had much less jumpy or scary moments when compared to the first (The only scary bit really was when Terri got eaten by lots of children)"

","I hired out a copy of RE:A recently, mainly because it has the German Actor Thomas Kretschmann in it, he was very good in ""Stalingrad"", ""Untergang,"" Downfall in the United States, and he was also in Blade 2, and the Pianist as a German officer, like Stalingrad. he's one of the few European born actors to have a career on the screen in Hollywood, even if he does play villains, b/c he's German? Besides that the film was worth watching, twice, and that's about it. The production team focused on making the film seem as though it could happen in reality. Ironically, the film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during the outbreak of SARS, which caused the entire city to be quarantined, very much like the film ""Raccoon City"". The production team attempted to borrow from the game, as much as possible while still having a plot beyond a simple Duke Nukem style shoot em up. I have not played the game version, and probably still will not play it. Given the current trend for Super-Heroine films with a slightly film Noir feel, it is only a matter of time before BloodRayne gets on the big screen with either Franka Potente or Michelle Rodriguez as Agent Rayne. Back to RE:A do listen to the commentary and explore the special features, it does not make the film worth purchasing, but it does amuse, which is all this film is intended to do."

Only two people survived, Matt Addison and Alice. Alice was clean but Matt was infected. But it all counts for nothing when Umbrella re-opens the secret lab to investigate, thus releasing the T-Virus upon the innocent Residents of Racoon City. The virus spreads quickly, and Umbrella Corporation seal off the city. Meanwhile, Alice finally wakes up in a hospital, after being subjected to many bio-genetic tests. She joins other survivors of the epidemic, and soon finds herself another enemy, the Nemesis, Who is Matt, after being subjected to further bio testing. To further the problems, Umbrella is preparing a nuclear strike on Racoon City, to cover up their mistake.

Both of these actors were stiff and therefore unconvincing.

Utterly convincing in every detail she commits acts of martial arts that even I, a great skeptic of females knocking over 200# soldiers - believes.

Resident Evil, Apocalypse is an above average action movie. one scene, for example, has Alice running away from Nemesis. the whole entire time i was at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and i got another treat from the next scene as well. there was another thing that made this movie, in my eyes, the best killer of ninety minutes. i am a big fan of the resident evil video games, and one thing disappointed me about them. there were no damn zombie children. this movie fixed that though. in one scene, a character is exploring the city middle school, looking for another character. when the character enters one room, a crowd of moaning zombie children came running for the character, tearing them apart with their teeth! one thing that was bad about the movie is all the characters are stereotypical. there is the bad ass chick, the bad ass dude, the pity full funny dude, the determined news reporter, and wait for it..... another bad ass chick. the characters never really change during the movie ether. and there is another thing. if u r looking for a scary thriller, this isn't your cup of tea. although there is a couple suspenseful parts in the movie, it is more of an action flick than anything else. and a pretty damn good action flick. if you r looking for a powerful, action packed action movie, this is a good time killer for you to watch with your buddies. i will give it an eight out of ten. (warning: this movie is not for children ;-))"

","Well, what can ya say? Resident Evil Apocalypse followed the games in the fact that, it kicked the ass of the first one just as RE2 annihilated RE in the game series. As to the movie itself, it was pretty cool, though it had several BIG flaws that seriously bugged me <br/><br/>1 - Nemesis, he was wicked up until he decided to turn good guy...ruined it there, though I see why they did it.<br/><br/>2 - Nicholai, sure he was played good, but Anderson totally screwed with his character, he's supposed to be a cold hearted back stabbing murderer, but he turns out to be a perfectly humane save your life Russian...lame<br/><br/>3 - Mikael, where was he? where? oh yes thats right Anderson had a brain fart and named him Yuri -.- small detail but every little thing helps, especially when ur an RE fan like moi <br/><br/>4 - Lack of siggy characters...lets count - Jill, Nicholai and Carlos...OK Nemesistoo i guess he counts, I was hoping to see some of Leon...maybe not Claire...explain later <br/><br/>5 - Alfred Ashford was also another faulty character, in RE Code Veronica he's a perfectly mobile cross dressing whack job with a bolt action sniper rifle <br/><br/>6 - Don't think I have a number 6...but it was pretty great over-all. Can't wait for Afterlife as it will take off Playstation 2's RE Code Veronica X with Project Alicia, she will be a bad guy if this goes through the way the game did, it could ruin it which ever way she goes if its not done right. Either way, I could see Alice getting killed off, I only guess that through Andersons words of ""I really like doing Trilogies"" Well done Anderson, you've brought out a film that (while isn't perfect) it was great...and done so Fox 20th Century wouldn't butcher this movie like they did with AvP."
"jdgratz","7","0","1","11 February 2005"," Don't take bad reviews to the bank (mild spoiler only)
","I'm not going to say that this is the best flick I have ever seen. It's not! But, I've seen much worse. Granted the Zombie-Movie is a bit overdone, but so are many other genres which still produce watchable movies.<br/><br/>I don't play video games very much. I own the traditional Nintendo with Tetris and Dr. Mario. Maybe once every 2 months or so do I even take the time to plug it up and waste away. I do, however, watch a lot of movies.<br/><br/>So I don't, exactly, know the original basis behind the Resident Evil video game. With that in mind, I see a decent plot. The story-line is fairly easy to follow, and the action seems right on. Where I see all kinds of action films set in real world situations with beyond-belief sequences, this series is at least set in an improbable world. This gives freedom to some fairly improbable activity.<br/><br/>After watching a recent Bond film the other day and witnessing the main character pound through load bearing portions of several structures with a tank and with no recourse, Apocalypse was much more believable. If you abandon reality with the entire plot, (and here's the mild spoiler) then a genetically altered person being able to kick the butt of various other genetically altered individuals is not so far-fetched.<br/><br/>So watch this movie with a grain of salt. And, if you are one of those who is dedicated to whatever the real story is, then watch it with an entire cannister. This viewer was able to sit through all 90 minutes without wanting to turn it off, so maybe you will, too."

","Given that game-to-movie transfers are inherently poor, Paul WS Anderson's 2002 big screen adaptation of zombie survival horror Resident Evil was no worse than most, offering a scantily clad Milla Jovovich and sharp production design in place of the game's claustrophobic scares.<br/><br/>Anderson wrote (or, rather, regurgitated) this by-the-numbers sequel for Alexander Witt to direct and it's a pretty unimpressive effort.<br/><br/>Picking up from the original's close, Alice (Jovovich) joins the remains of a combat squad to fight clear of a city swarming with the resurrected dead and facing the lumbering zombie behemoth born of the Nemesis Project.<br/><br/>There's action aplenty but the living dead are largely in the background and when it's not ripping off better movies it's a plodding slog."
"watchmegoss4","7","0","1","9 February 2005"," What will the next RE movie be?
","First off, I just have one question: What will the next movie portray? When the first Resident Evil ended, Alice was standing out in the streets of Racoon City, practically naked, due to the experiments that were done on her while she was unconscious, and she's holding a shotgun in her hands. Now the sequel begins with her standing there still, but then she remembers the Umbrella team taking Matt into the white room and saying ""I want him in the Nemesis program"" and you see him mutating. Now, since Resident Evil was about the game Resident Evil 1 (or 2 since their the same practically) and Resident Evil: Apocalypse is about Resident Evil 3: Nemesis the game, When Resident Evil: Apocalypse ends, and they zoom in on Alice in the black SUV, it makes you think ""Whats next!?"" Maybe, in the next Resident Evil movie, it will portray Resident Evil Code: Veronica, since that is the game that was made next. Who knows though. Although, it would be nice if they kept it in order to make it easier to follow. So, will their be another Resident Evil? and if so, What game will it portray, AND, what challenges and obstacles will be presented and will the ""Team"" be capable to handle it without losing their lives to the swarm of ""un-dead""? (E-mail me back if you wish to respond please, @ watchmegoss4@comcast.net. Thank you)"
"darkangel-5","8","0","1","1 February 2005"," Upgrade version of the prequel and ROCKS!
","There are movies which, especially if you shut down your brain cells, can really rock. Resident Evil, both of them, are definitely two of those. Although this time around you don't really have to minimize your brain activity or intellectual in order to have fun watching this movie, and it's also enjoyable for those also, who have never played the video game. And it's definitely suggested for those who like to watch hard and beautiful girls kicking a$$. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is by far the best video-game-into-movie project I have seen so far. It's a tough area for movie-makers to write a decent plot and make a watchable movie of a video game.<br/><br/>This story, again, takes place in Raccoon City, which is obviously Toronto... I had an inner smile while watching the opening scenes showing the unmistakable Toronto skyline with US flags all around, and I was wondering that whether A) the USA invaded Canada and renamed the city (maybe as a retaliation to the continuous humiliation in ice hockey), B) Americans loved Toronto so much they copied it, or C) the German director and actors were not able to make a difference between Canada and the USA anyway. Well, it's not Chicago at least, for Toronto played Chicago in that overrated cheesy award winning musical hype... Besides Vancouver, Toronto is probably the most occupied Canadian figure in US movies. :-)<br/><br/>The first part had a cliff-hanger ending, which became the starting point of the sequel. This one is definitely an upgrade version of the prequel, I guess the director and co. learned a lot since finishing the first part of the series. Which is a lot better in the sequel is definitely the casting. Since it's a zombie movie and resurrection is possible, I was wishing that Michelle Rodriguez, one of the least-talented actresses in Hollywood by my opinion, wouldn't come back to life. (Wonder why she hasn't yet won any Razzies...) And YES, she won't! It was fun watching her character die ugly in the prequel, and her character (No.2. hard-a$$ chick) was replaced by Sienna Guillory, who's a very talented actress, played Helen of Troy and had a heart-breakingly wonderful performance in Sorted. I wouldn't have thought she fits in this character this much, but she's really convincing! She's been a good pick for the role. Mike Epps adds a new color to the movie and it was great to see Sandrine Holt again in an action movie, even if her character is a little drawn back this time. And Milla Jovovich (Alice) delivers the same good quality as in the prequel, but this time the acting skills of the characters are more balanced, thus the movie is more enjoyable. The only irritating thing regarding the actors is the constant German accent by a bunch of actors. It's especially irritating when it comes to a US government official... At least you cannot say it's not multicultural enough: US government officials with a German accent in a (ex-?)Canadian town...:-)<br/><br/>Other bad things I can mention: the zombies are so lame and boring. They move the same, look the same, and the same extras are used in different street shots... The other one is the lame and a bit cheesy final showdown between two main characters (I'm not telling their names in order to avoid spoiling). <br/><br/>To sum it up: it's a great and enjoyable movie, definitely suggested for those who want 90+odd minutes of action and entertainment.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the third one, especially since this one has a cliffhanger ending too."
"pericote1","5","0","1","31 January 2005"," Much Better Than The First ...
","I, for one, hated the first film. I found only the film's last few minutes to be exhilarating. The first film boasted bad CGI effects, poor make-up effects and it's biggest flaw was that it did not utilize the scenarios that played out in the ultra successful video games. That, however, has been corrected in this slam bang sequel. Non-stop action and the films fast-pace nature helps the viewer forget (or ignore) the film's weaknesses. And the film's weakness is mainly the script written by Paul W.S. Anderson. Weak dialog and a flimsy story are certainly things that may completely annoy a less-forgiving viewer. The film's direction by Alexander Witt is fair but flawed. I, for one, hate the use of slow motion and sped up frames that are consistently used in today's movies. However, with a bigger budget that improved the CGI and makeup, made it possible to make RE: Apocalypse an entertaining way of spending an evening. Just don't over-analyze the film and watch it for what it is. A 'leave your brain at the door' horror/action film."
"enkephalin07","6","0","2","30 January 2005"," But is it Resident Evil?
","Like the original games and the first movie, this has the lurching zombies and a population infected by a powerful and recklessly insensitive megacorp. It has loads of firearms, comic-book action sequences, and characters in contemporary clothing that are just distinctive enough to look like comic hero costumes. It also has homages to previous horror films.<br/><br/>Every other Resident Evil game and the original movie has presented new stories that take advantage of the setting, situation and themes without disrupting the continuity, proving that it could have been done for this movie. This movie deviates from the canons by reinventing characters and running roughshod over the established story lines.<br/><br/>Was this necessary? Viewers who've been following the story before this installment will find the contradictions distracting. Audiences new to the series could've been given a good story without revealing or revising what had been served up before. Is it such a bad idea to give them just enough to leave them wanting if you still have games to sell? Resident Evil was rich with mysteries to be explained, new territory to be explored, but instead of cultivating the franchise this movie ham-handedly grabbed for the quick buck.<br/><br/>Alice and Jill were easy on the eyes and very powerful action figures, far too good at surviving to be good survival horror figures. Superhuman kung-fu masters aren't exactly beating the odds as they engage in battles that you know they'll win before they begin. Ho hum. No suspense. No menace. Even the monster is just another action figure in latex. I wasn't surprised to find Jill Valentine likable and interesting because I never cared for her in the previous Resident Evils. With that great a character discrepancy between the game and movie, I'm pleased to see no adaptation of the characters I actually did like (geniune thanks to Emily Bergl for dropping out.)"

This is for your entertainment. This is not going to make you think or ponder over anything. It's an action horror film.<br/><br/>I really liked the first one. The whole concept, the 'evil corporation' the secret testing, the Hive. It was all like ...well... a game. ""Umbrella"" is evil and you pit evil against tough people who you are rooting for. The Alice in Wonderland angle was outstanding. In the final shooting script there were even more references that were cut.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the sequel. It didn't even feel like a sequel -- it just felt like the continuing saga. The new chick, Jill Valentine, was awesome -- it was very much a woman empowerment movie. Epps was so funny. It all made sense to me on its own terms. It never tried to be anything it wasn't. <br/><br/>So when's part three coming out? And you know what -- I'm in my mid 40s.

"griff66","7","0","2","2 January 2005"," Schlock classic
","I really wasn't expecting this film to be up to much, especially after the godawful atrocity that was the original ""Resident Evil"". However, there was a glimmer of hope on the horizon (some great preview shots of Sienna Guillory as Jill, and a new director onboard), so I went into this with fairly low expectations, hoping for some fairly enjoyable shlock if nothing else. What was so surprising was how well the film delivered on this and became my favourite ""guilty pleasure"" movie of 2004.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with another recap of the storyline (it doesn't really matter all that much to be honest, and it's been retreaded a thousand times in other user comments, so check it out there if you must). All you need to know is that is basically tries to shoehorn in the plot of the RE3 game into the foundations set by the end of the first movie, with game stalwarts, Jill, Carlos and Nikolai joining the fray in the fight against the Nemesis and the de rigeur zombie outbreak courtesy of those nice chaps at Umbrella.<br/><br/>Looking at this objectively, it's a fairly low-grade piece of entertainment, but somehow it managed to hit pretty much all the right buttons and leave me exiting the cinema with that ""OMFG!"" feeling. The opening scenes with the outbreak and the subsequent last-stand of the defense forces was beautifully handled, and matches the feel of the original RE3 intro very well, with some nice tense firefights to start things off. Action sequences as a whole are well-handled, and the film zips along at such a breakneck pace you're seldom left bored. Milla performs fairly well, as does Oded Fehr as Carlos, but the real standout is relative big-screen newcomer Sienna Guillory as Jill, who perfectly personifies the game chara's ass-kicking persona and steals every single scene she's in with ease. From the first thirty seconds she's on screen, you want more of her, and the film doesn't disappoint. I'm a huge fan of the games, and after seeing this film I simply couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>RE:Apocalypse improves on the original in every way that matters, so much so that I'd recommend you avoid it entirely and skip straight to this (there's a handy recap in the intro anyway). Where the original shied away from the more ""adult"" nature of the games, this is much more full-blooded, with just the right amount of blood and profanity without descending into overkill. Headshots are back, the zombies are meaner, and it takes a lot more than one pesky licker to put these guys at bay.<br/><br/>Okay, it's not without it's weaknesses either. Towards the end the fight scenes seem to degrade into quickfire editing without any actual content, just blurs of arms and legs at a hundred cuts per second. Also, there's possibly one denouement too many at the end, no spoilers here but let's just say I'd have ended it at the finale of the chopper scene. But these are fairly small concerns, I'd still recommend it heartily to anyone looking for a good night's no-brainer entertainment."

The music works well and the fight scenes are great; there is some cool kung fu fighting going on and they make the actors look like heroes. But there is one thing that i did not really like about this film. The acting of some of the actors was not convincing enough and certain special effects did not amaze me at all; those red monsters in the cathedral were ridiculous. The movie is based on the game which I never played but I am pretty sure that the game fans will love this movie. Yovovich is one of the most beautiful actors/models and in the movie she gives a very close resemblance to the main character in the game. The theme and the plot of the movie is based on infected humans turned to zombies. But I'm really fed up of watching zombie movies this year (Dawn of the dead).

Racoon City has been over run with those infected with the T-virus, the Umbrella Corporation who have been carrying out top secret research into Cell re-growth, Re-Animation of dead cells and the creation of a super soldier-type procedure. As soon as the infection stretches to the city limits Umbrella seal off the perimeters to the city leaving the remaining inhabitants trapped inside. <br/><br/>Along with them is Jill Valentine (also a character in the games) and various members of S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And Resque Squadron - i think) they and Alice are being hunted not only by the ravenous undead but the unstoppable behemoth the Nemesis who is Alice's friend Matt who had been experimented on.

","This movie amazed me beyond words. The concepts were well used. I felt energized after seeing this movie on the first day. I know that people complain about not being scared, but that part is over. We got all of our scares from the first movie. All that's left is the showdown between man,mutant, and the powers that be. Alice was superb. As far as the ending. It left us open to an unnervingly distinct possibility. Alice will turn evil, and Jill and the others may have to kill her( which would in the end follow the original scary movie rules that dictate that the heroine can't survive the second sequel)and Jill as a result would become the new heroine( which would make the game purists ecstatically happy). As for Alice taking over, remember, she is the only surviving team member from the first movie. She demonstrated her skills as a superb officer without the enhancement procedures. Naturally, she would be even better as an operative after enhancement. Remember also, that Jill and the others were relatively new to this. They may have been aware of a few aspects of T-virus contamination, but nobody but Alice and the upper echelon knew the true level of the problem. As far as the brain power, it is a known fact that humans of average intelligence only use 7% of their brains. Einstein used 33% of his. Were the T-virus to activate other parts of Alice's brain then yes, she would have extra-sensory abilities.I mainly enjoyed the fact that the movie showed us what the T-virus was actually designed to do through Angie Ashford and Alice Abernathy, instead of it being a complete mistake that involved disastrous side-effects. As far as Dr. Ashford becoming a zombie at the end, there is an obvious assumption. The T-virus worked more efficiently in Angela, and she was able to walk as a result of implementation. He, also having taken the T-virus, was not able to walk afterward. Perhaps it was a matter of metabolism. Compare the exposure and infective transformation rates of Carlos and Yuri,Alice and Matt, and Rain, Kaplan, and J.T. The movie made perfect sense and far surpassed its predecessor.*****/*****"

","Despite having so many things wrong with this movie, I can't help but love it. And there are a lot of things wrong. For the most part the foreboding atmosphere of the games is just totally gone, there are some characters who seem totally pointless (LJ anyone?), and the fight scenes are quite possibly the worst I've ever seen put on film. Word of advice, when filming a fight scene, make sure the audience can actually see what's happening. The fight in the graveyard is the worst, other than one kick (that's in slow mo) it's impossible to tell who is doing what.<br/><br/>However, I feel the film is saved simply by its inclusion of Jill Valentine, who steals every scene she's in. Sienna's performance is wonderful, and makes the film (or at least, her scenes) immensely rewatchable. Her introduction is probably my favourite introduction of any character to any film, ever.<br/><br/>Overall, a hugely flawed movie, and other than a few nods here and there not particularly faithful to its source material. But for some reason I still love it, and it's worth seeing just for Jill Valentine alone."

","I didn't have very high hopes for Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I thought the first Resident Evil was a typical Paul W.S. Anderson outing. Meaning an action film making a lot of noise and really trying to be cool and heart-pumping, and failing in every respect. The first movie was in my opinion slow, rather boring and with special effects that needed a lot of work.<br/><br/>I don't know if it's because Paul W.S. Anderson has given the directing job to someone else this time around (he was too busy destroying the promising ""Alien Vs. Predator) but something has at least changed for the better here. The action scenes actually seem to have a pulse! We are still quite a distance from what i would call ""blood-pumping"", but we're closer than in the first movie. <br/><br/>The story here should be pretty easy to guess for anyone who saw the first movie. The first Resident Evil ends with Alice (Milla Jovovich) standing in what's left of Raccoon City. And basically this is the plot, the virus is loose in the city. To make things worse another Umbrella creation, the Nemesis, is also loose in the city and looking for Alice. Oh well, the story seems to be more or less besides the point here.<br/><br/>So, what's good and what sucks? Well, as i said the action scenes do have a bit more punch in them than in the first movie. Also they are longer and seem to be made with a larger budget. The setting is also a bit more interesting this time, an abandoned city is almost always a good place to set an action movie. So what sucks? Well, Milla Jovovich is still one of the worst actresses ever to star in a major Hollywood outing. Also, and more importantly, i'm still looking for that sensitivity from the director. That little special gift that makes the action scenes leave you breathless. You know, that thing James Cameron has?<br/><br/>Anyway i guess for popcorn-entertainment a Friday night this is not too bad. But don't expect to remember it more than a few minutes. I rate it 5/10 for effort."

","First off, I'm a huge fan of really cheesy and overdone movies that lack any plot, character, yet entertain at the same time. If there's going to be zombies, ridiculous fight scenes, and really bad dialogue... You better believe I'll be there watching whatever it is.<br/><br/>That said, you'll understand why I love this movie so much.<br/><br/>What we have here is a great slice of B movie greatness. We have our lovely super powered heroine, Alice, a ridiculously Rambo like Jill, and some side characters that don't really matter to much... Top that off with some super zombie that shoots a rocket launcher and you're in for a great time.<br/><br/>The storyline of the movie is quite ridiculous compared to the first. The first movie at least had a fairly decent story and managed to be a decent thriller with some good IL fashion zombie killing. It was slightly cheesy, but not nearly to the degree of this movie. Alice from the first movie is trying to escape the city, meets up with Jill and her buddy... They find a few more people, need to escape the city before Umbrella nukes it, and the only way out is some scientist that wants his daughter to be safely escorted out of the city. Of course, this means that legions of zombies must be fought, as well as the giant nemesis creature. This leads up for lots of overblown action sequences that will bring a smile to your face as you laugh at how awesomely bad they are.<br/><br/>To get technical We have special forces units capable of delivering head shot after head shot to zombies in a most ludicrous fashion. Everyone who is part of the main cast is also the same, they have dead aim no matter what position they're shooting from. <br/><br/>The only major flaw I can think of with this movie is that if you're a serious sort of person that doesn't enjoy a cheesy movie, then you're not going to enjoy this movie. Stay away from it and watch some stupid movie like The Grudge or something instead.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously and can be enjoyed if you're watching it in that mindset. It's definitely one of my favorite movies of the year and I'll be purchasing it the moment it hits DVD shelves. If you're looking for a great time at the movies and enjoy a healthy amount of B in your flicks, then this one is for you.<br/><br/>9/10"
"deepion","8","0","1","14 October 2004"," Better than the first?
","I always expected the worst from this movie. It's not the sort of movie that does well in the eyes of its fan base, it always seems to fall short and this is exactly what has happened here. 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is bigger and better than its predecessor ('Resident Evil: Biohazard'). However, it is not completely perfect. Not by a long shot. For starters, the whole movie completely looses any sense of tension present in the first 'Resident Evil' movie (when they were trapped in a large underground laboratory along with hordes of the undead) and replaces it with full-on action. The result is a movie which is more like a computer game, and which follows the line of the 'Resident Evil' games much more (which is a bonus for fans of the games who felt disconnected with the first movie) but isn't scary or shocking in the slightest. The movie also has a lot of plot holes. These can be overlooked but some parts of the movie really do ask you to be almost brain-dead to enjoy it (and also ask forgiveness for the inclusion of completely stereotypical characters which seem to be lifted from a computer game with absolutely no character development at all). Saying this, the movie is also partly confusing. It tries to follow too many stories and doesn't explain anything in a great detail. The ending will also test even the smartest of brains. The movie just doesn't get the balance right. Perhaps this can be chalked up to the first-time director Alexander Witt, but it seems for likely to be from trying to please everyone, and ultimately pleasing no one. Despite being different from the original, it still manages to include throwback references including an outline of the plot from the first movie, and a few ideas which were used in the original are used here again. If your looking for a movie like 'Biohazard' in the sense of tension, then look elsewhere. If your a fan of the game or the first movie, then there is still plenty here in order to keep you entertained. All we have to do now is wait patiently for the third movie installment of 'Resident Evil' (names which have arisen so far include 'Aftermath' and 'Afterlife') to determine whether this turns out to be a cohesive unit when placed together as a trilogy ('Apocalypse' ends on a great cliff-hanger which will leave you hungry for the next movie and gives little hints about what the next movie will be about). It's a shame that in a year seemingly filled with great zombie movies such as 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' doesn't manage to bring anything new to the genre, but still manages to be entertaining."

","I remember seeing the trailer to the original Resident Evil and thinking, 'oh dear, they've really gone and ballsed this one up quite badly'. On going to see the movie, I left the cinema if not overly impressed, then at least mildly surprised that director Paul Anderson had managed to pull one out of his ass to create a reasonably enjoyable pop corn munching horror flick. My impressions Alexander Witt's sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, were much the same. <br/><br/>Following on almost immediately from the original, the sequel opens with the monstrous T Virus being let loose from the previous movie's lab complex into the city above. The movie follows the survivors of the disaster, including Sienna Guillory's ridiculously attired Jill Valentine, Oded Fehr's hunky mercenary Carlos Olivera, Mike Epps' stereotypical black pimp L.J. and of course the only true survivor of the original movie, Milla Jovovich's zombie beating Alice. Also set loose in the city is Nemesis, a seven-foot tall mountain of a monster packing a minigun, a rocket launcher and a bizarre S&M outfit. <br/><br/>Pillaging it's inspirations from a number of sources, including Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil 2 & 3 and 28 Days Later, it's fair say that Apocalypse's plot and dialogue are not its strong points. Anderson's script is at times laughably poor. Lines like 'we're expendable assets, and we've just been expended' are so horribly clunky that it's hardly surprising the movie's acting is getting such bad press. The movie's narrative is equally cumbersome and also badly fractured. It jumps around constantly in a vain attempt to keep track of multiple plot threads, never really spending enough time with any one of them to create any satisfactory pay off at the movie's end and as such there is little depth to either the story or its characters. There are however some nice tips of the hat to existing Resident Evil fans, including an action sequence ripped straight from the opening movie of Code Veronica and little dig at the games fixed camera perspective.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, well I'm sure the actors were doing their best with what material they had but it might have helped if they had some slightly more talented performers on board. Milla Jovovich has proved herself several times in the past, most noticeably to the wider public as Leeloo in the Fifth Element, but she is miscast here as a tough as nails, steely eyed zombie slayer. Guillory's Jill is equally awkward as she tries to pull off a worryingly similar character Alice, all the time struggling with bad dialogue and an embarrassing costume that sticks a little too close to Resident Evil 3 for comfort. Fehr's Carlos has little to do except shoot big guns but at least Epps gets some surprising mileage of what is essentially a one dimensional comic relief role. <br/><br/>Beyond these faults there are numerous others. Nemesis is quite frankly an awful monster. Like Jill's costume, his design sits too close to the game for comfort. Perhaps someone should tell Witt that what looks good in the stylised environments of computer game does not always transfer well to the heightened reality of a motion picture and Nemesis is a case in point. He just isn't scary, looking more like the Toxic Avenger than any kind of formidable uber mutant. Witt's direction is also lacking in many areas, particularly in the movie's slower, talkier moments. For scares (the meat and potatoes of any good horror movie, even one as action skewed as this) he relies far too much on cheap jump scares, lurching things unexpectedly into camera with an accompanying blast of audio. Anderson pulled the same trick in the original movie but at least managed to pace it a little better. Here Witt succeeds only in deadening the viewer to it, until even his best attempts don't even elicit so much as a twitch. His experience as a second unit director does shine through in his panache with the movie's visual side however, and he occasionally manages to evoke some surprisingly effective imagery, so long as Nemesis isn't on screen.<br/><br/>Fortunately Apocalypse has two saving graces, it's frenetic pace and capably handled action. The movie is nothing if not action packed and here Witt manages to exceed Anderson's handling of similar sequences in the original while the actors make up for the sleepy performances with some energetic gun and hand-to-hand fighting. Some sequences are really quite enjoyable, most notably the trailer moment of Alice running down a building. At times however, his overly jerky camera work can become distracting, hampering the viewers ability to see what is going on. Compared to movies like the recent Bourne Supremacy, Apocalypse is relatively restrained in this regard however. The movie's adrenaline fueled progress never lets up and also lends it some much needed energy that was otherwise in danger of being sapped away by its leaden dialogue and unoriginal premise.<br/><br/>Above all though, Apocalypse manages to be a decidedly passable action romp through a zombie fueled nightmare city. It may lack Shaun of the Dead's biting humour, or 28 Days Later's horrific imagery, but it does succeed in sweeping the viewer through some fun action sequences and some intermittently pretty photography which in this kind of film is really all that matters."

I think it is about time she started acting in serious films and not JUST silly sci-fi kids films {as i recall she put in an excellent performance in Spike Lee's classic HE GOT GAME).<br/><br/>This film does not have the intellectual punch of 28 DAYS LATER and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD nor the humour and irony of the forthcoming SHAUN OF THE DEAD. However you will find Resident Evil 2 much more entertaining than the dull remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD that came out a few months ago.<br/><br/>This film does not try to be anything but pure entertainment...and it works. The film recognises that premise of Zombies taking over the world as being so far fetched and implausible that it is impossible to take seriously. So instead of trying to just shock you with gallons of blood and pig guts (like the Dawn Of The Dead remake} this gets a bit more shylock in its approach and gently laughs at it self and while trying to take you on an entertaining roller coaster of a ride.<br/><br/>Resident Evil 2 is the 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and 13 GHOSTS of the zombie genre"

And when that guy with glasses in the church freaked out and booked it, tell me you had no idea that he was going to get exed in about five seconds. Throwing in some senseless nudity and a few f-bombs (mostly coming from my favorite Mike Epps) to give it a more just R-rating makes it a true winner.

I guess you could say I'm on a crusade to keep people away from this movie, fearing it will cause incredible damage to our already Hollywood-ized society. In all honesty, I went into this movie with little hope. The first Resident Evil was not good by any means. But it did have some, and I mean very few, good sequences here and there. I was hoping this, the second film in the franchise, might be a tad better. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the worst sequels to have come out of mainstream Hollywood in quite some time. Sounds harsh huh? Well, it's something you have to see to believe. There is honestly nothing redeeming about this movie. The acting is dreadful. They all sound like they are auditioning for a bad daytime soap opera. It's flat and forced. The direction is uninspired. No, it's not even mediocre. Anderson's direction in the first was at least decent in some areas. Now however, his companion Alexander Witt takes the reigns and the results couldn't be worse. I found myself actually wishing Anderson had directed this. That's not a good thing either.<br/><br/>Of course, Anderson still wrote the movie. It shows. This man shouldn't be allowed to touch a screenplay, ever. The dialogue is horrible. The characters have nothing to them. The plot, well, it doesn't have one. There's no build up to anything. There's not one character we as an audience can care about. I found myself hoping everyone in the movie would die so it could end. Even the action is terribly written and shot. It's almost so clich√© that it spoofs itself. It's overblown, unexciting, been there done that, peppered with metal music to ""highten"" the action.<br/><br/>To get this out of the way also. I don't mind mindless action movies, but when the action isn't even worth watching what's the point?<br/><br/>This of course brings me to another point being a horror fan. This movie is not scary, one bit. It's a bunch of ""boo"" scares that occur every five seconds. It gets real old, real quick. Just like the rest of this absolutely awful film.

We discussed it a bit and so I was a little bit scared it would be lame and rather sure it wouldn't be great.<br/><br/>Considering how the last one left off, this movie has a bumpy beginning. They couldn't exactly show the same 10 minute ending; plus they had to introduce new characters etc. The result was OK but somewhat lacking.<br/><br/>Beyond the opening, this movie wasn't nearly as much about zombies as the first one was. By the movie's climax, I was so focused on what else was happening that my mind did a doubletake when the hoards reappeared. ""Oh yeah, that's right, I forgot"" my mind said to myself. Rather than the focusing on ""THE ZOMBIE"", Resident Evil: Apocalypse focuses far more upon ""THE VIRUS"". Zombies are just an unfortunate side item of what is actually important to everyone. Maybe this is a good thing and maybe not. I liked it. The name is Resident Evil after all, not Resident Zombie.<br/><br/>The movie continues the ruthless violent killing in the manor of the first one. There isn't anything slow about it. This ""manor of fact"" way of approaching death is a fantastic. I'll never forget my Sister's face when her favorite character was killed off within the first quarter of the film#1. It leaves you all the more freaked out and on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>There were a couple of cheesy parts. The big fight scene wasn't something I'll always treasure but I really enjoyed the overall effect the movie had on me.<br/><br/>The end of this movie was very bizarre and I've read it had a tacked-on feel.

Although I liked REA, it was neither clever or good enough to recommend to anyone who expects anything anywhere close to the infinite amount of creativity evinced in the ""Matrix"" films or as 'literary' as ""Lord of the Rings.""<br/><br/>Strangely, previously released films such as ""The Mummy"" (1999)and the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, came to mind while I was watching REA. <br/><br/>(NOTE: Oded Fehr, from Mummy, appears in REA)<br/><br/>Jovovich seems destined to only appear in TV makeup commercials or sci-fi-action films. For those movie-fans unaware, she also appeared in the orig. 'Resident Evil' film and ""The Fifth Element"" with (Yawn!) Bruce Willis."

","Had some good surprises and some good 'little guy' heroes parts. I'd say certainly worth a store rental, but not sure that it's worthy of a full fare price at the theaters. It seemed like it had the ideas right but was just barely missing that edge to make it a really good thriller/ horror flick about gene warfare gone batty. Perhaps they covered more of that in Res1...still seemed like they could have delved into the belly of the beast a bit more...like giving someone on the outside a conscience.<br/><br/>I thought the Zombies were a bit lame. Not menacing as a group - though there were certain close-ups that worked well. They just looked like sorta badly made up bicycle accident victims that were poorly directed. What's frightening about an opponent that travels at 1/4 speed? Right up there with dolls that can take down an adult, ya know? When the action did get heated it seemed like there were too many cuts - no flow to the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Don't look to close or expect there to be much logic in the plot line. Entertaining, but not as entertaining as Van Helsing on any level."

","I really don't understand why some people seem to hate this movie. If you're not into this genre, don't vote for it just to lower the rank, skip it, let others enjoy it! I played the games and I found the movie really satisfying, it used characters from the game, locations, too bad it didn't use any of the creepy music. But it was OK anyway. On the other hand, I think that anyone could enjoy this movie, even if they don't have a clue that it's based on game characters. In my opinion, this sequel did justice to all the fans who were disappointed by the first installment. I was one of them. Not that I didn't like it, it's just that I would have preferred other sceneries, not just laboratories, which I find boring. The first movie didn't seem very well connected to the game story, but the sequel really surprised me. It offered everything a fan could desire. OK, the first half of the movie was only ""ok"", but once Nemesis was introduced, everything became awesome. Oh, and I taker a bow before the creators of Nemesis! He turned out really, really awesome. I didn't really expect that, but I surely hoped it would come out like that :-) And I loved the fact that they added some sort of drama to the ending, with Alice recognizing the human side of the monster. Way to go, Sony Pictures, I'm looking forward to the sequel! I just hope I won't have to wait another two long years for it :-)<br/><br/>Just a tip, why not use the in-game music a bit? Just a little bit? I mean, like the creepy RPD themes and other (in my opinion) masterpieces from Resident Evil 2 and 3? Anyway, WAY TO GO!"

","Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:<br/><br/>What a LOAD!<br/><br/>Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.<br/><br/>I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.<br/><br/>The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.<br/><br/>It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the ""R"" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.<br/><br/>All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of ""Aw, man, I really liked him/her too"".<br/><br/>Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.<br/><br/>The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say ""Oh yeah, they're here too"". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, ""Holy crap, they're screwed"".<br/><br/>Not necessarily so, Lois.<br/><br/>Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).<br/><br/>Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our ""Zombie Reminders"" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.<br/><br/>Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.<br/><br/>Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.<br/><br/>All of this combined makes me want to se the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.<br/><br/>Very Little."
"gothor","Null","0","2","23 September 2004"," A fun action/horror film with a great monster.
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a fun action/horror movie with good creature effects and an ending that makes you want more (in a good way).<br/><br/>If you were disappointed with the first movie's sterile environments and lack of any connection to the videogames, you'll be happy to see familiar faces Chris and Jill and the Gothic interior of the Church. Ammo is scarce, lickers are everywhere, and it's a whole lot more like playing the video game. (Not one evil child A.I. in sight!)<br/><br/>And, of course, there's Nemesis. Nemesis is great. An eight foot zombie with a chaingun, rocket launcher and prize winning snarl, Nemesis can stomp through a hail of bullets like it was a light rain. The best thing about him is he's actually there. You heard me, the big man ain't CGI.<br/><br/>It's amazing these days to find a rubber suit monster in a major motion picture, and after watching RE:A, you have to wonder why. Nemesis has an actual physical presence. The actors look far more intimidated by this hulking deathbeast than any of the CGI beasties they have to pretend are there. (Look for their expressions of actual horror, rather than the wide-eyed wonderment you get when actors have to share the screen with cartoons.)<br/><br/>If there is a problem with Resident Evil, it is of course, the zombies. Yep, for a zombie movie, they sure don't get much push. The rotting wonders terrorize our heroes for the first third of the film and then are quickly forgotten. But who cares, by that time Nemesis rolls out. And he's a really *big* zombie! That's got to count for something. (Ah well, at least it's not the first movie, where you had to wait 45 minutes to see that the zombies were poorly made-up, not very scary and actually quite goofy. In RE:A, they tell you right up front!)<br/><br/>In summery, go see Resident Evil: Apocalypse for the pure joy of it. It's not a ""hardcore"" zombie movie, but then again, it's not trying to be. It's a monster flick, plain and simple. And it's a damn good one."
"UltramarineX","6","0","1","18 September 2004"," Plenty of action at the expense of plot and dialogue
","**Warning: Minor spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>Honestly. What can I say about this movie? If you've seen the trailers for Resident Evil: Apocalypse, or have seen the first Resident Evil movie, then you know what kind of movie you're in for. Anyone expecting a deep storyline (although I think most movie goers are smart enough not to expect one) would be advised to look elsewhere. Apocalypse is a B-movie through and through. It's heavy on fight scenes with gun-fighting, explosions, blood splattering, and limbs being broken every minute, with plot and dialogue taking a back seat. <br/><br/>Apocalypse's story is pretty standard fare. It takes place soon after the events of the first Resident Evil movie. A virus has spread through Raccoon City, turning its inhabitants into flesh eating zombies. Those who have not yet been infected (i.e. the main characters in the movie) have to find a way out of the city while surviving the onrush of a zombie horde, and a super-zombie called the Nemesis. In most B-level zombie movies you wouldn't expect the acting to be all that great¬Öand this movie is no exception. I don't blame the actors however. Milla Jovovich (who plays Alice) and the rest of the cast try to make the best of the movie's stilted dialogue with varying degrees of success.<br/><br/>However, my main problem with the movie is that the plot is not much more than a string of 'money shot' sequences that make no real sense. One prime example of this is during the fight at the church. Jovovich's character smashes through a stain glass window on a motorcycle and saves the lives of the humans inside. A few problems with that whole sequence include: 1) How did she know what was going on inside the church? 2) How did she know exactly where to land? 3) Why didn't she just go through the front door? Apocalypse is filled with many horror movie clich√©s (i.e. going into a dark room alone in a zombie infested building) where you know someone is going to die. Also, there was one scene where Alice and the gang walk through a graveyard to try and escape the zombies. Of all the places you could go to hide from the walking-dead, why in the world would you go into a graveyard?!<br/><br/>Now, you're probably asking why the heck I would expect a coherent story in a zombie movie? Because it has been done before. Movies like 28 Days Later have shown that zombie movies could have strong dialogue, character development, and a good plot.<br/><br/>The one bright spot in this movie is that if you want to see a ton of zombies get shot up, than Resident Evil: Apocalypse delivers in spades. The action Apocalypse is non-stop, especially when the Nemesis shows up. Speaking of the Nemesis, I can't help but like the design of Nemesis' costume, and seeing him blow up everything with his rocket launcher and chain gun was pretty darn cool. <br/><br/>The fact is, if you liked the first Resident Evil, than you will definitely like Apocalypse (and I should note that the ending leaves room for another sequel). Personally, I thought that Apocalypse was actually better than the first movie, but frankly that's not saying much. If you want to see a good zombie movie, I suggest you check out 28 Days Later, or Dawn of the Dead (either the 1978 or 2004 version which I have not yet seen, but I hear is quite good), and wait for Resident Evil: Apocalypse to come to DVD and rent it instead.<br/><br/>I give Resident Evil: Apocalypse a 6 out of 10."

","The first film was definitely a lot better than this one...as a film and as PREQUEL to the video games. That film was very good from beginning to end. Despite the simplistic storyline...it was very entertaining and well put together. Even the soundtrack was great. <br/><br/>As for the second film...I will blatantly say that it was dumb...but that doesn't at all make it not ENTERTAINING. But what can we expect without Anderson working entirely on this project and a newbie director at the helm? Aside from the unnecessary opening commentary about what happened in the first film, the movie starts out pretty good. The movie begins to dramatically cheapen after the church sequence, but here's the reasons why:<br/><br/>a) Jill Valentine is a paper-thin character. If you've played the video games, you know who she is, what happened to her prior to the events in the second movie and why she was ""disgraced"" from the STARS unit. In this film, they don't explain ANYTHING. So basically she's just another random character dressed like a slut and carrying a gun. <br/><br/>b) STARS isn't a special unit in the RPD...they ARE the RPD. I think this was a huge discrepancy between the games and the movie and goes along with why they never explained why Jill was disgraced. I think the writers decided to drop STARS involvement with the mansion incident completely to avoid a lot of explanation..though they could have sat down both Jill and Alice in the film and had them discuss things to bring even the audience up to speed. Instead they briefly mention that STARS is highly skilled and one of two targets to test out Nemesis on. <br/><br/>c) The Church sequence. This section starts out just fine with the protagonists, even though this is the only time we see any of the lickers, but then when Milla comes crashing through the window...yeah it was fun...but what does that have to do with anything? How did she know there were human survivors in there? She can detect virus carriers, but the whole city is overrun...why would she come crashing in there blindly?<br/><br/>d) The graveyard was a totally unnecessary sequence. If the town was overrun with the virus...why would completely intact zombies rise from the ground in the first place...or all at the same time? <br/><br/>e) At first I thought going to the movie that the whole plot theme of Milla being genetically altered was stupid since she did just fine in the first film. But as reference to Code Veronica...it's passable. However, setting her up to fight Nemesis was a total eye-rolling experience. I definitely wanted to see her confront Nemesis and remember Matt in the process...but this was totally the wrong way to go about it. <br/><br/>f) The epilogue was totally disappointing. The movie should have ended with just the news reports about the Umbrella cover-up. All the final hospital stuff should have been left for the third film...where it would have been a great opening sequence. It just feels tacked on at the end here.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my breakdown of what was wrong with the film. It's made and we can't change it. So needless to say, it was silly, but no less entertaining. I enjoyed it moreso the second time I watched...since this time I was just watching for the action and any other references I may have missed the first time through. Watch it if you enjoyed the first movie or you like the games...avoid it if you have no idea what's really going on in the video game-to-movie world."

","I just watched this movie and it really got me staring. I liked part 1 (though many people disliked it), and I like part 2 even more. Sure, it's nothing ""special"", nothing big like LotR, but it's excellent at what it actually is: an action movie based on a video-game series. I love the style of the movie, the action scenes, simply everything about it. The actors are good, and I think they did a great job at transferring the story and characters of the games. I think it's cool how they worked the opening of ""Code Veronica"" into the movie (the only of the games I played through myself; really cool opening ;) ), and I got a laugh out of the sentence on the movie posters ... ""I'm Alice, and I can remember everything."" I also liked the comic relief brought into the movie with LJ. There were, like in part 1, several moments where I thought they'd just end the film, but they always push it a little further, and still, the end is as open as was the end of part 1 (which was very cool and fully in the flavor of the games, imho). All in all, this movie shows great action, paired with two beautiful ladies right in the middle of the action, and still brings those little jokes from time to time. Really looking forward to part 3 :)"

","Maybe SPOILERS are here.. I've just looked through the lengthy reviews and comments from others on IMDb. I religiously check out this site before jumping into the theatre to see a movie. To me, RE was just another movie.<br/><br/>Since I have some limited exposure to the game (I have no idea what you actually do in the game except wander around hopelessly looking for clues or whatever) it may effect my judgment of this film.<br/><br/>As I understand the story, there are a few things going on - some, a continuation of things that happened in the first movie, and other developments which are specific to this newer version. This is my breakdown/summary:<br/><br/>1) T-virus uncontained from first film has apparently migrated out of ""the hive"" and is now exposing residents of Raccoon City. Of course, this means that the virus will spread to the inhabitants of Raccoon City. In an attempt to stop contamination, the city (aka Toronto, Canada), is sealed. **I love this type of obvious plot development but if I remember correctly, ""the hive"" mentioned that the T-virus was airborn which was why she locked down the hive in the original movie SO - how would 20 foot walls surrounding dear Toronto. I mean Raccoon City...contain the virus?<br/><br/>2) Nemesis program initiated by Umbrella Corporation. This nemesis is the result of an experiment on one of the first movies survivors. Its only apparent purpose and function is to destroy members of the elite team now trapped in R.C. It seems that there is only one way to stop this Nemesis (sorry Star Trek Fans - it doesn't involve DATA) and that is our Heroine - Alice **Kids - I'm gay. Sorry, but neither Alice nor Jill get any nods up for looks, acting or anything else. As we all know, the true ultimate tough a** female action/horror lead is Sigourney Weaver - who is capable of getting us through some scary situations without the help of partial nudity or short skirts etc. With All that butch attitude from Jill, a gay person might even believe that she and Alice had time to engage in some lesbian action...you know, between jumping motorcycles into churches etc etc.<br/><br/>3)Innocence - Although confined to a wheelchair, the Doctor who created the T-virus has apparently moved into Raccoon City - talk about living close to your job....anyway, his lovely daughter - the template which viewers will remember from the ""hive"" (""you're all going to die down here...) has become trapped in virus plagued R.C. and wants our key players (Alice. Jill et al) to get his daughter in exchange for their freedom from RC. He knows exactly how to get out of the city. ** Innocence is such a nice touch in an action/horror flick I always say. In RE1, this girl was hated by everyone because she was the representation of an inability to escape the situation whereas now, in RE2, we see that she's not evil, and that her father is not evil but the Umbrella Corporation is evil....folks, with products in ""9 out of 10 residential homes"" Umbrella has to be overseen by SOME agency.<br/><br/>4) Alice - Left over from the first film, our traitor Alice (willing to give up the security codes for some environmental group seeking to out umbrellas horrible bio-engineering division ""for a price"") has been experimented with and ""modified"". Apparently umbrella feels that the future of humanity lies in short skirts and people who can run vertically down the sides of tall buildings. Alice is also the lynchpin of the NEXT RE movie. **I say, forget Alice and lets focus on Jill and getting this whole umbrella Corp thing taken care of. Lets remember though, I bet umbrella has some connections - like George Bush which is why no person living in or outside RC even knows what's going on ""Down under"".....What would John Kerry say?<br/><br/>Well folks, that's it. I liked the movie overall and I now have this driving urge to go to Toronto to visit. Fans of the game might be disappointed because it is ""loosely"" based off the game but I enjoyed it nevertheless."
"Bobolopolis","Null","0","1","12 September 2004"," The Master of Disaster strikes again. Spoilers below.
","Paul Anderson is a Hollywood guy, he's cheap, he's expendable (nobody is going to care when this guy finally makes a movie that the kids don't watch) and he's cost effective. No, he didn't direct RE Apoc, but what's worse, he wrote it.<br/><br/>Now, like all PA films(since he helmed and wrote the first film, and was slated to direct this one until AVP came along, I'll call it his) the film isn't totally unbearable, but its not always watchable either. The cinematography is alright, there is enough character continuity and dialogue to know who most of the people are this time around(unlike AvP and RE), there are some okay action moments. The Nemesis first appearance was memorable, some of the licker battle was interesting, but there are to many goofy things in the movie that detract from the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Supposedly Alice was infected with the TVirus which gives her super mutagenic properties that make her more than just the average human, giving her the abilities to lay the smackdown on any creature that oppose her. Now this would have been a decent idea if it was implemented better, but in the RE universe (yes I played the first three games religiously) you have to maintain a certain degree of seriousness. For instance, near the end of the film, Nemesis and Alice go at it, Nemesis takes a swing at alice with a steel rod and all I could think about was that the scene was lifted from FOTR. It looked exactly like an over-sized Urak-hai taking a swing at Aragorn. There are also several other goofy action sequences, the first being the battle with the Lickers. Alice uses a Motorcycle like its a weapon and I couldn't help but feeling a little let down that RE had become intertwined with Charlies Angels.<br/><br/>My other major gripe besides the over the top action scenes was the interference with game continuity. The first RE movie could be looked at as a separate incident from the Racoon city outbreak because it didn't interfere with anything related to the games story. It was just another isolated incident like the mansion in the first game. But then this movie comes along and messes up a lot of s***.<br/><br/>First the infection is spread all wrong. It was originally let loose by a corporate band of thugs stealing the T and G viruses from William Birkin in the game (who were later killed by a very upset and mutated Birkin later on). Then it was spread by rats.<br/><br/>In the movie, it was spread by a group of scientist trying to reopen the hive. So right away it interferes with game continuity.<br/><br/>Then from there, it introduces Jill and Oliveira entirely out of context with the game. They run into each other when they shouldn't, the main baddie of the game, Nicholai is a good guy in the movie, Michhail is replaced with Yuri. Its just crazy. Not to mention that Nemesis buys it an entirely different way in the movie than he does in the game, and we never get to see the over-sized giant use his tentacles in the movie either.<br/><br/>So here's my overall advice, if your a casual movie fan who wants a ""decent"" popcorn flick, go see it. If your a casual RE fan, go see it. If your a fan that is just a stickler for the games, and doesn't want the movie interfering with the game, don't go see it and if your expecting any Oscar worthy material definitely don't go see it.<br/><br/>See at your own risk, its not great but its not terrible. 5.5/10"

","This one was very much anticipated and has way too many problems to feel we had a payoff for the wait. The movie tries so hard to throw everything into it, it does at times seem to provide some surprising moments, but on the whole, leaves much to be desired in terms of plot. The overall choppiness and rapid cut of the action sequences often makes it very difficult to tell what is happening. All you get is a flash of motion and a crunch or two. And the overkill factor was just too much in evidence throughout, but without any meaning to most of it. <br/><br/>The logical flaws in the movie were myriad and, sadly, very, very serious. For instance, the idea that a 20 foot tall wall completely encircling a city to contain a virus and completely isolating everyone inside could be even built, much less done within 13 hours is pretty much impossible. And Raccoon City seems to be a fairly large city. And that's just for starters.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there are so many killings and bashings, that many people may be distracted from adding up all of the ideas and timing problems that make no sense. Indeed, trying to make out who hit who with what weapon or which body part might be sufficiently distracting to have most people forget the attempt to follow the story at all, which would actually reduce the potential for migraine.<br/><br/>For those of us with brains that are not exposed and who have somewhat shorter and less deadly tongues than those seen in this movie, we might say one thing is for sure ""THIS MOVIE HAS THE T-VIRUS THROUGHOUT & T IS FOR TORTUROUS"""

","When I walked out of the theaters after seeing it, someone said ""It followed the game a lot."" I had to laugh to myself, because, that's far from the truth.<br/><br/>I noted only three instances in the movie that it was anything like the original game. 1: The inclusion of Nemesis, Carlos, and Jill. 2: Jill was dressed like the game character, and had the same physical mannerisms (For the most part) 3: The movie has the same corny acting as the game.<br/><br/>For action fans, this is a must see- explosive moments, great gunfight scenes, all the makings of a non-stop action/horror flick. However, unfortunately, the characters are very lacking. Of course, the female leads will probably keep the guys attention on the screen.<br/><br/>As for the rest- continue on at your own risk, for the following section contains spoilers<br/><br/>WARNING: Some spoilers may follow READ AT OWN RISK<br/><br/>One of the most aggravating characters in the entire movie was Nicholai. I loved his character in the game, the mercenary turned bad. In this adaptation, he is not bad, in fact, he is killed. HE RESEMBLES NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL. Granted, Zack Ward did a decent job in the tiny role given, I do enjoy his stuff, but I he just didn't fit the role whatsoever. How can a forty five or so year old white haired man be replaced by a 30 some odd year old red head? Please, God, I'd really like to know.<br/><br/>And the Nemesis turning good at the end? Give me a break, because that's just ridiculous. <br/><br/>The movie went at a good pace, keeping the action in to cover up the lacking story. In the game, there is no Dr. Ashford, there's no daughter, there's no Alice. I liked the game a lot better- it just seemed to flow better, however, I cannot deny it's an amazingly well shot movie, but it does lose itself, because, now a days, just about anyone with the money can make a movie with bullet time moments and huge explosions and well choreographed fight scenes.<br/><br/>We've seen these one million times already. What they need to start doing is focus on the story and make that the main point, not the action. I'm a story fan more than action, to be honest, so it might be a little biased on my part- but come on now, there was very little story to tell in the first place.<br/><br/>It was all right, the comedy was it's only decent part for me- as a movie fan, I'd give it a 7, but as a game fan, I have give it 5 out of ten. It really comes down to it, you'll either love it or hate it."

Also when she starts to remember again. My name is Alice and I remember everything, the she starts to kick everyones' ass. The only problem I could not get pass was they made Nemesis into a good guy. He gives his life to save Alice, like WTF that never happened in the game, he was always evil.

"brennan79","10","0","1","13 September 2004"," For A Video-Game Movie, It Doesn't Get Any Better
","This sequel to the excellent 'Resident Evil' more than lived up to my expectations in every way. As a big fan of the first film and its director, Paul W.S. Anderson (I realize he is an acquired taste), I was initially worried when I learned he was handing the reigns over to newcomer Alexander Witt. I never should have doubted Anderson because this sequel blew me away. It's been two hours since I saw it and I am still trying to catch my breath!<br/><br/>For a video-game movie, you couldn't ask for more: non-stop action, visual flair in almost every shot, an attractive cast (in these movies, nobody cares about acting skills), and an ending that promises more for the future. Sure, there are glaring plot holes, but who cares? You don't go see movies like this for an intricately detailed plot and in-depth character development. You go see movies like this to have a good time. It won't win an Oscar but nobody expects or wants it to.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest difference between the films is Where that the first film had a tight and claustrophobic feel, this installment is an all out, no-holds barred smorgasbord of violence and noise....and it never makes the slightest attempt to apologize for this fact. I thank Mr. Witt profusely for that. Furthermore, he does not try to copy the style of the first film. Instead, he made the decision (a chance-y one) to unleash a whole new bag of tricks. While that could have been a disaster for the franchise, it ended up being the smartest thing for it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you like video-game movies, you can't get any better than 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. If you don't like video-game movies, well, I guess you really don't have any business going to see it in the first place, now do you?"

","This is the action/horror movie of the summer. Spiderman 2 is the only movie that could possibly suprass this thriller. It was obvious that this movie had a much larger budget than the prequel and the plot was a lot more developed. As a fan of the games i enjoyed the minor plot changes from the transition of game to film to keep me guessing and the holes of information that were filled in by the movies that are not explained in the game. Spectacular special effects. The introduction of Jill into the storyline was fantastic and i would look forward to another prequel that explains the introduction of Jill into the Resident Evil saga as the movie doesn't really explain it all that well. The ending was twisted, but left open for a third movie (which is rumored to be loosely based on the game (Code Veronica). An all around great movie and must see for action fans."

","Let me preface by saying I enjoyed the first Resident Evil movie and I also enjoyed the game. They were pure scary zombie fun for me, with cool special effects and make-up. If you did not like the first movie, than please don't see the second because it is much more gratuitous in it's violence and gore. Which is just what I expected! <br/><br/>So I liked this second film. It's made for those with an extreme short attention span, and the action is beyond quick. There is truly nonstop violence and gore - and I'm not complaining. Occasionally I like those kind of films, and this one delivers.The best part for me is Nemesis - he looks cartoonish but he's pure fun to watch. Again the true star is Jovovich and they make her as cool as ever which I also can't help but like. I thought the make-up and and over-the-top explosions were actually an asset to the film as that is exactly what I had wanted when I went to see it.<br/><br/>Want brainless movie fun?

"DissidentEvil","Null","0","1","13 September 2004"," Best Movie of the Year (If you don't count Spider-Man 2)!
","This review is primarily written for someone who has at least played some of the games, and uses that context. It's not very useful for someone just going cold into this film (or with only the first film as a base). I'm a huge Resident Evil fan, and have been since the first game released on PSX, I've kept up with almost all of them. I really enjoyed the first movie, and was actually happy that it diverged from the game because I knew the game's storyline already, and was happy to see what a new character would do. I went into the first movie expecting it to really suck, and was surprised when I liked it. When I saw the full trailer for the second, I got very hyped, and then was afraid it wouldn't live up to my feelings, it did. It too diverges from game storyline (though not to the extent the first one did). I was very taken with Milla and her performance in the first film, it's even better here. For game fans though, Sienna Guillory is a near perfect Jill Valentine. I felt that Oded Fehr was a better Carlos than the Carlos from RE3. There were things I'd change for sure, and I'm in the process of trying to work the events into official RE chronology, and that's going to be a nightmare. There are moves pulled off in the film that put some of the ones in the later ""Matrix"" films to shame (one or two in particular). I like the way Nemesis was handled, sure he should have been bigger, but believe me, he's big enough! I only hope Anderson does RE3 and gives us Leon and Claire (just setting it at the same time as this film, and/or a hybrid with the events from ""Code Veronica""). This certainly makes up for Anderson's mistakes with ""Alien Vs. Predator"" Perhaps Anderson is simply a better writer than a director (he did not direct this film, it was excellently directed by Alexander Witt. The pacing is very good, much improved from the first film. Some scenes look dead on (pun intended) from the games. I won't tell you specifics, I don't want to spoil anything. Suffice to say, if you've played RE 2, RE 3, and/or Code Veronica, you'll see some key moments. There are two or three ""new"" characters besides Alice here, and they were welcome additions. If you've never played the games, and never seen the first film, you'll still be alright, and probably enjoy yourself. If you've seen the first film, you'll find this one much improved. Considering the cliffhanger Anderson and Witt left us on at the end of this film, I can only hope it does well enough to merit a sequel, but I think it will. The problem with ""Alien Vs. Predator"" is that Anderson tried to use the same scare thrills that worked for him in Resident Evil, and they don't fit in that film, but believe me, they work here at 110%! I can remember walking out of the first film thinking ""Wow that was violent and loud, very cool!"" I left this film thinking ""So loud!"" But more from the sheer effects, as opposed to Manson's grinding musical score (from the first film). While I felt that music worked well in the first film, I was pleased that it didn't overpower the more plot-rich sequel, and the loudness came from the actual events. I felt like I had a pleasant little mind-fog over my brain, I was so numb. This film, like the two games it is based on (more the third than the second) ratchet up everything by huge amounts. Is it always believable? No, it's not, just like the games it's based on. Was ""Matrix"" always believable? Nope. That's what we go to see science fiction and horror films for. Take your friends, and have a hell of a ride!"

","I waited for this movie like a child awaiting the next pokeman or spongebob movie. I held my breath, i bit my nails, i even drove over 40 minutes just so i could catch the first midnight showing in New brunswick new jersey. And instead of getting something that could possibly rival its great predecessor, i got something that only kept me awake because its annoying sound effects were so loud and so many. Though the special effects were good, and action was plentiful... the characters were pale shadows of the game's glory, much of the fight scenes were blurred and so fast paced that you would need to be the flash to watch them, and the ending left very much to be desired. I will buy the DVD just to own the series, and i will watch the third installment when (if) it comes out... but there will be no holding of breath."

","I saw Resident Evil: Apocalypse last night with some free screening passes. I must admit, if I had paid full price for this movie, I would be extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is like a bad album with a few good tracks. i've listed a few of the scenes that stood out in my mind below. 1)A police station where cops are attempting to arrest the zombies. Jill Valentine, who Resident Evil fans will recognize from the video games, walks in and caps several of them in the head with her pistol. 2)Scenes of the chaos in Racoon City as the virus seizes hold. 3)A scene involving 12 STARS police holed up in a store, then being attacked by the Nemesis. 4)Umrella Corperation troopers holding a four-way intersection against an advancing tide of zombies.<br/><br/>Apart from these scenes, I found the movie extremely formulaic and derivative. The dialogue is dreadful, with memorable lines such as ""Get in,"" and ""Finish Him."" The whole ""band of survivors attempting to escape"" is done better in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>Resident Evil fans will appreciate RE:A's attention to making the movie as much like the game as possible. I have played a few of the games with a passing interest, so I feel I can comment on this without being a fan boy. There are few plot inconsistencies between the game and the movie that will undoubtedly frustrate some die-hard fans, but there are scenes that strongly remind me of the games. Jill walking through an empty church reminded me of Resident Evil: Survivor, and many of the sequences in the school and the church have the claustrophobic feel of the games down straight.<br/><br/>All in all, if your looking for a movie version of the game, this is your cup of tea. If your a zombie movie fan who loved George Ramaro's Night of the Living Dead series like I am, see Shaun of the Dead instead of RE:A, then, when it comes out on DVD, rent RE:A to see a decent gore fest and 28 Days Later to see what this movie should have been."

","Resident Evil: Apocalypse is the kind of movie that only true fans of the series can appreciate. And they're stupid. <br/><br/>Well, I guess I probably am too. I've played all the games, now seen both of the movies, and have also come to realize that I have probably spent upwards of three hundred dollars collectively on this franchise alone. God I'm pathetic...<br/><br/> From a cinematic standpoint, Apocalypse is so horrendous that the token black guy/comic relief is funnier than all the crap in this movie that you wanna laugh at for being so bad, but can't, because it's TOO bad. And I mean that in a good way. Mike Epps is the saving grace of this film; and I doubt he hardly ever even tried that hard to be good while he was on the set.<br/><br/>Paul WS Anderson, the original's writer/director, wrote this one and then left the chair for a more ambitious filmmaker to take over so that he (Anderson) could direct Alien Vs. Predator. That one wasn't as bad as this one, so if you've seen Alien Vs. Predator, please do the math. What Anderson created for the Resident Evil universe was a story that stayed pretty consistent with the linearity of the games, while at the same time allowing him to do whatever the hell he wanted with the movie, which wasn't much. He then left a sub par script with an amateur for a director. That is what this film is made of.<br/><br/>As for Milla, I've been drooling over her since Dazed & Confused. She's a decent actress, and really fun to watch, and really brings absolutely nothing to the table in this case. She's the star, she's engaged to Anderson, and she's hot, so she gets a paycheck no matter how hard she tries, which isn't much. Not to say that she's not still ten times better than anyone else in these movies, which, really, still, isn't saying much.<br/><br/>But saying anything about this movie isn't saying much. The acting, writing, cinematography, make-up, special effects, editing, directing. All of it is unimpressive, uninspired, and undermines the potential of this series.<br/><br/>And the zombies. They're hardly in the movie. And when they are, they're not that threatening or scary. Just bein' zombies. Zombies aren't scary unless the film MAKES them scary. Nobody on board for this project even tried to.<br/><br/>Seriously, if some really clever geeks had gotten together and decided to make what would eventually become the Resident Evil trilogy, it would have been eons beyond what has been brought to the table.<br/><br/>Columbia should have stuck with George A. Romero for this when they got him.<br/><br/>What they were thinking, getting rid of him, I have no idea. I doubt that he would have let this series get anywhere near as out of hand as Anderson has.<br/><br/> From a critical standpoint: 1/2 of 4.<br/><br/> From a fan of the franchise standpoint: 1 of 4."

","As a fan of the Resident Evil games and the first movie, I couldn't wait for RE:A to come out. To be honest, I did keep my expectations low for this movie because it was using a number of familiar characters, such as Jill and Carlos, and I was not sure if they would get them right at all. Since my I didn't have high expectations, I can say I enjoyed this movie, but if you're looking for a masterpiece, this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>One of the worst things in this movie happens during a number of the action scenes. The camera just flies around a whole lot, making everything kind of blurry. Alice could have been flailing about for all know and that may or may not have been a zombie she was hitting. Another thing is the lack of plot in the beginning of the movie. It picks up towards the middle, but it never gets very heavy. I'd say the first movie did far better in the plot department.<br/><br/>What it lacks in plot though, it makes up for by appealing to the Resident Evil fan in me. Seeing Raccoon City on the big screen just makes a part of me happy. Not only do you see the generic zombies, dogs, and lickers, but you get Nemesis this time around too. The movie has action from start to finish, although some scenes are sub-par, others are just plain kickass. There's a lot of comedic relief in parts of the movie too that had the theater laughing out loud. Also, I became attached to a number of the characters, which is always a good thing in a film or story.<br/><br/>It won't be the movie of the year or probably even the season, but so what? I enjoyed Resident Evil: Apocalypse and I think any fan of the series or just someone looking for a good action film will enjoy it."
"galahad58","7","0","1","11 September 2004"," A Guilty Pleasure
","The first Resident Evil is one of my guilty pleasures. I really enjoyed the movie, even with it's bad acting and simple story. Being a fan of the original game, I felt that the movie captured the feeling of the video game and basically that was my entire expectation going into the theatre.<br/><br/>The video game started in a mansion where you played as a member of S.T.A.R.S. Either you played as Chris or Jill Valentine. The first movie followed the basic concept of a place where the Umbrella Corporation was conducting genetic experiments that went wrong. While the first film added the character Alice, instead of the game's characters, it was decently filmed and I find myself watching it from time to time. Like I had said, one of my guilty pleasures.<br/><br/>The second movie (Apocalypse) basically follows a large portion of the second video game. The second video game you can play as either Chris and Jill again and you have to escape Racoon City while a super creature (nemesis) is tracking you down. The second film takes Alice on this adventure, while adding some interesting supporting members to her group. The second film also brings the original character, Jill Valentine, into the fold. There are quite a few new ideas introduced into the movie that were not in the game storyline, but they are interesting. Apocalypse has decent acting (think popcorn adventure movie, not Oscar), a decent script (except for the last 10 minutes), and a few decent well done horror moments. Apocalypse is better than the original (I know some of you may think that would not take much), and I see it falling under another DVD purchase I find myself watching time and time again. <br/><br/>The only disappointment was in the last moments of the movie. The big bad corporating scene was just -- well, it has been done too many times and did not need to be done again. The end scene with Alice is a typical sequel setup that also did not need to be done. <br/><br/>Milla Jovovich kicks ass, ala Laura Croft, without trying to act. Something Angelina Jolie tries too hard to do and fails at miserably. Milla plays Alice via the way a male action star would play a Rambo or a super cop. Because of the way Milla approaches Alice, it works.<br/><br/>Oded Fahr is the best part of the movie. Fans may remember him from the Mummy series as the Templar Knight. Fahr is a scene stealer and a very pleasant addition to the cast.<br/><br/>Sienna Guillery is just there as Jill Valentine. The kick ass character, from the games, takes a back seat to Alice and never is fully developed. Whenever Fahr or Milla are in the scenes, Guillery gets lost in the mix. Guillery is still hot to look at though (same as she was in Troy as Helen) and I had to laugh at the tight (very non-police) uniform that she struts around within. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this film. While I really liked it, I am not sure what anyone else would think. I enjoy these kind of horror/action films: Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, 28 Days, and the Omega Man. If you are a fan of those types of films, I believe you would enjoy Apocalypse."

","First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But with that said, I honestly thought this movie was fairly pathetic (and I'm a fan of the game).<br/><br/>The first movie was 'ok' at best, and this was certainly a step down. This movie manages to do all of the following: over-the-top action sequences (the church scene was just too much..), sketchy special effects (except for Nemesis; they got him dead on), half-decent acting. And to top it off, they manage to skewer the movie line even further from the the damn games these movies were supposed to be based from. I could say more, but that would just be ranting. Save your 6-9 bucks and catch this one on HBO."

","Save your money. Watch it when they show it on TV. But have the remote handy<br/><br/>I saw a promo screening last night and was very glad that I didn't actually fork over thirteen bucks to see it. <br/><br/>There is little plot, Terrible dialogue, and almost no character development. Now I had hoped that this film would be decent. I had fun watching the first one, not a masterpiece but an enjoyable 2 hrs. I also spent an afternoon watching helicopters flying around outside my apt window last year as they shot the bridge scenes. I went in expecting to be entertained and instead found a predictable action movie with nothing new to offer. <br/><br/>The action scenes were way over the top. often the shots being too dark and too fast paced to follow the action. there would be a blur on the screen. some crunching sounds and when it settled down again Millia Jovovich would be standing over the broken body of whatever it is she crushed that time. <br/><br/>I guess I was hoping for more originality, There were action sequences that were lifted straight out of other movies. The most memorable to me was the garbage chute scene in La Femme Nakita. <br/><br/>There were a few moments that were fun. For a Torontonian it was kind of neat to watch my city get trashed. There were a few fun little moments especially the comic relief of Mike Epps but in all the movie was a disappointment, and certainly not worth my being woken up at 3 in the morning by gunfire form the set."

","Thursday, September 9, 2004<br/><br/>I went to see a preview of this movie last night and I must say it was a bit of a let down. The first movie had a lot of suspense with interesting characters. <br/><br/>APOCALYPSE is your typical Hollywood blockbuster with a big budget and big explosions but that's about it. The characters were quite stale with stale dialogue, especially the quite-anticipated character of Jill Valentine who seemed like a Lara Croft clone. The actress seemed to be an amateur who delivered her lines melodramatically.<br/><br/>There were too many story lines and characters that did not have the opportunity of being flushed out in the span of ninety minutes. This was especially detrimental for the character of Nemesis and his relation to Alice as it pertains to this movie. Unless your a fan of the game or book series you would not have a clue.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of horror/action films but would recommend that you wait for the DVD rental of this one."

","Tonight I saw a preview screening of Resident Evil: Apocalypse and am pleased to say it was everything I had hoped for. While the first film was entertaining, it struck me as little more than a generic action film with Resident Evil trappings tacked on, Apocalypse is unmistakably a Resident Evil movie to its core.<br/><br/>One criticism leveled at the first film was the absence of characters from the games, but Apocalypse is sure to please fans of the video game series in this regard. Not only does it feature iconic characters such as Jill Valentine and Nemesis, but more obscure figures such as Nicholai and Carlos from RE3's Mercenaries bonus game. Angie Ashford is essentially a renamed Sherry Birkin from RE2. Not only are the characters present, they're rendered exceptionally faithfully. Sienna Guillory is a dead ringer for Jill, and Zack Ward is excellent as Nicholai.<br/><br/>Raccoon city is nearly perfect as well. The ruined streets are extremely evocative of the games, right down to the streetcars. The Umbrella ads all over the town add to the atmosphere and great pains have been taken to scout locations reminiscent of memorable scenes from the games.<br/><br/>Of course, all the eye candy in the world won't make a difference if the movie itself is dreck, but Apocalypse is quite enjoyable. Paul Anderson's dialogue is a little cheesy sometimes, but never to the point of annoyance.<br/><br/>Alexander Witt gets solid performances from the cast and the movie never descends into campiness. Fans of the games will be pleased to know that while the plot doesn't follow the plot of the games strictly, it does follow it much more closely than the first movie. Along the way it manages to answer such questions as why Nemesis was so intent on killing Jill in RE3 and manages to incorporate Alice, who was created for the movies, into the greater Resident Evil mythos. Best of all, it manages to portray Umbrella Corporation as the shadowy, creepy entity it is in the games, giving the sense that there is much more going on than just in Raccoon City. To top it all off, like Starship Troopers, Apocalypse gives you the sense that anyone can die any minute... or worse.<br/><br/>Apocalypse isn't perfect. Some of the action sequences are a bit derivative, Nemesis' makeup is cheesy and it's pretty obvious Raccoon City is really Toronto (in one shot the CN Tower is visible, and skyscrapers with the logos of Canadian banks are briefly visible.) Still, Resident Evil: Apocalypse stands as a decent action film on its own, and is sure to be a treat for fans of the games."
