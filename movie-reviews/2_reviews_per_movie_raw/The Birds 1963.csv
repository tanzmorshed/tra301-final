","I don't think anyone was prepared in 1963 for the unexplained horror Hitchcock unleashed here (hell, I wasn't; and I first saw it 25 years later). Now, 50 years later, it's still absolutely unique and remains a stand-alone picture which doesn't cease to amaze me.<br/><br/>The tension Hitchcock slowly builds and the atmosphere of impending doom he creates are mesmerizing. This was probably the first true apocalyptic nightmare ever put on screen; a shocker, and the terror this film inspires is greatly enhanced by the fact that it refuses to give the viewer any answers. Nature just turns on humanity all of a sudden, and although it's just those adorable tiny creatures called ""birds"" that we see go amok, I was left with the impression that this might just be the start of something bigger, much much worse.<br/><br/>This was Hitchcock, the man who - next to Chaplin and Disney - probably had the biggest impact on the evolution of cinema from the twenties to the early sixties, at the peak of his creativity. <br/><br/>A terrifying work of beauty.

"kintopf432","10","91","139","8 May 2003"," A true puzzle without an answer; brilliant
","One of Hitchcock's most enigmatic and fascinating films, a true puzzle without an answer. Hitchcock chucks away all but the barest conceit of DuMaurier's story, and instead constructs an elegant little comedy of manners so dry it'll sting your lips. Tippi Hedren's spoiled rich girl makes a trip to a west-coast fishing town to play a joke on a smartass lawyer who still lives with his mum, and things get complicated. In the movie's first half, the director layers on the sexual tensions and the bitchy wit until you're at the screaming point--and then unleashes a cataclysmic natural horror so unspeakable it could be something out of the Bible. <br/><br/>All technical elements are superb. Hitchcock, so well known for his use of music, shows here how terrifying silence can be, and 'The Birds' remains an intensely quiet picture, even punctuated, as it is, by sudden noisy violence. The set pieces, like the fireplace scene, the playground scene, and the visit with Dan Fawcett, are studies in perfection. The cast is smooth down to the tiniest roles, with the proto-Altman ensemble scene in the diner being one of the most memorable segments in a film chock-full of them.<br/><br/>And it is literally impossible to imagine better-cast actors in the leads. Hedren is perfect as Melanie Daniels, the party girl who, while not nearly as clever as she thinks she is, may just be telling the truth when she says she's looking for something more meaningful in her life. Rod Taylor is charming and somewhat inscrutable as the local-boy-made-good who thinks he knows what he wants. Suzanne Pleschette is smoldering as the cynical (and perhaps sexually ambiguous) schoolteacher who takes Melanie in.<br/><br/>And perhaps most important, Jessica Tandy is a searing, twitchily hypnotic presence as Lydia Brenner, surely one of greatest supporting characters in the Hitchcock pantheon.<br/><br/>As the movie runs on, the director gleefully ignores one loose end after another, leaving the viewer with an epic catalogue of unanswered questions at the climax (the most important of which is articulated by the diner's birdwatching crone: Why?). And if you're the kind of moviegoer who likes having everything neatly explained, you'd best try something else. But if you like ambiguity (and a healthy dose of existential nightmarishness), it doesn't get any better than this. 10 out of 10."
"don_agu","10","252","407","5 February 2005"," Tippi Feathers With Mother
","Seems silly to give a 10 to ""The Birds"" what can I give to ""Notorius"" then? Or ""Rear Window""? A 20? It doesn't matter, a 10 shouldn't mean the best but one of the best. Best as in degrees of enjoyment, best as in time of enjoyment, 10 for the kind of enjoyment. ""The Birds"" is a ten for all of the above. Hitchcock's world varied consistently, it depended very much on his travelling companions. Writers first and foremost then composers. There is no music in ""The Birds"" so most of my questions are directed to the eclectic Evan Hunter who dissected Daphne de Maurier's original story and transformed it into something that not even Hitchcock had attempted before. A lyrically surreal horror soap opera kind of thing. It visits many of Hitchcock's obsession's of course, an icy blond and a castrating mother. Tippi Hedren follows a long line of Hitchcock blonds, from Madeline Carroll and Ingrid Bergman to Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Eva Marie Saint and Doris Day as Jessica Tandy follows Madame Constantin, Jesse Royce Landis and Louise Latham not to mention Mrs. Bates. Evan Hunter was behind films like Richard Brooks's ""Blackboard Jungle"" and a semi forgotten gem Frank Perry's ""Last Summer"" As well as having Akira Kurosawa based his film noir ""The Ransom"" on one of his novels. Here, he follows Hitchcock's needs with religious reverence and at the same time comes out with something quite unique. I love the light weightiness of the heaviness. I've always loved the daringness of the pacing. The car trip to to Bodega Bay or the long shots of Jessica Tandy's truck driving away in horror from the farm. This movie is also a reminder to the filmmakers, depending in special effects, that effects tend to age a movie far too fast. The effects should be at the service of the characters and not the other way round. Rod Taylor, a charming, versatile matinée idol with a brain and the scrumptious Suzanne Pleshette ad to the many pleasures this 10 of a film will keep in store for generations to come."
"Gommy","10","204","331","31 May 1999"," A highly innovative horror
","Imagine Hitchcock trying to sell this idea to the film studios: the lives of a mundane country family are shattered when vicious rooks attack. Why? No particular reason. And what then? They fly away. and then? They come back again and attack. And then go and then . .. It seems like an impossible plot to pull off, but Hitchcock does it, slowly building up the tension which spasmodically swells and subsides. Younger viewers may get irritated with the slow stealth of the opening scenes and may want to thrash the T.V. when the film comes to its beautifully droll conclusion, but form once those birds start attacking, every viewer is riveted. It was fine Hitchcockian innovation that took this very slim, cock-a-mamy story and turned in to a tense thriller. But the greatest innovation is the film score - there isn't any. No director is more closely identified with the music of their films, but in Birds, Hitchcock created a horror that is uniquely  quiet. The great man appreciated something that so few others do - the atmospheric potency of silence, and how, in different settings, silences can differ in character. Yet so many who watch the film seem to forget that the music isn't there. That's the film's greatest attribute."
"The_Void","9","184","313","29 December 2004"," Seaside gulls go mental in Hitchcock's macabre masterpiece!
","Despite spending most of his career within the realms of the thriller genre, Alfred Hitchcock hasn't restricted himself where variation is concerned. Most of his best work represents a different type of thriller, and The Birds is no different. It is often said that Psycho is Hitchcock's first foray into the horror side of the thriller, and it is indeed; but it's not the complete horror film that The Birds is. Often cited as an obvious influence for Night of the Living Dead, The Birds follows Melanie Daniels as she travels to the seaside town of Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds for Mitch Brenner, an eligible bachelor that she met in a pet shop in San Francisco. However, while there the birds of the coastal town begin to attack the residents and so begins a terrifying tale of man's feathered friends waging a war against humanity...<br/><br/>It could be said that the plot of The Birds is ridiculous, and it is. The idea of birds, a type of animal that isn't aggressive, attacking humans despite living with us for millions of years is preposterous and is never likely to happen. However; it is here where the film's horror potency lies. Birds live with us in harmony; we're so used to them that for the most part we don't even realise that they're there, and the idea of something that we don't notice suddenly becoming malicious is truly terrifying. Especially when that something is unstoppable, as the birds are portrayed as being in this film. The fact that the birds' motive is never really explained only serves in making it more terrifying, as it would appear that somewhere along the line they've just decided to attack. Of course, the film could be interpreted as having Melanie's arrival, or the presence of the lovebirds as the cause for it all; but we don't really know. This bounds the film in reality as if there was a reason given, it might be improbable; but there's no true reason given (although there are several theories), so it can't be improbable! <br/><br/>The first forty minutes of the film feature hardly any - if any - horror at all. Hitchcock spends this part of the movie developing the characters and installing their situation in the viewers' minds, so that when the horror does finally come along, it has a definite potency that it would not have had otherwise. In fact, at first the birds themselves come across as a co-star in their own movie as there are brief references towards them, but they never get their full dues. However, once the horror does start, it comes thick and fast. Hitchcock, the master craftsman as always, uses his famous montage effects and never really shows you anything; but because you're being bombarded with so many different shots, you'd never realise it. Many people have tried to copy this technique, but most have failed. Hitchcock, however, has it down to an art and this is maybe the film that shows off that talent the best. There are numerous moments of suspense as well, many of which are truly nail biting. We see the birds amassing and ready to strike - but they don't. And this is much more frightening than showing an attack from the off. Hitchcock knows this. The final thirty minutes of The Birds is perhaps the most thrilling of his entire oeuvre. First, Hitchcock gives us an intriguing situation where numerous inhabitants of the town give their views on the events, and also explains the birds' situation with humans, even giving the audience an angle of expertise from an ornithologist's point of view. He then follows it up with a truly breathtaking sequence of horror that hasn't been matched since for relentless shock value.<br/><br/>Hitchcock has made many great films, and this certainly stands up as one of them. Here, Hitchcock gives a lesson in film directing and creates a truly macabre piece of work in the process. I dread to think what the state of cinema would have been if Hitchcock had never picked up a camera, but luckily for us; he most certainly did."
"jluis1984","9","100","168","28 November 2005"," Perfect Example of why Hitchcock is ""The Master of Suspense""
","This is one of Hitchcock's most well-known movies. Along with Psycho, it's the movie that most people identify with him. Many pages have been written about it and surely there will be more. I know that the superb technical aspects of the movie have been discussed a lot, so I'll try to focus on something I noticed yesterday when I watched it.<br/><br/>It's scarier when there are no birds on screen. The tension, the silence, the uncertainty, the mystery. That's what suspense is about.<br/><br/>I was amazed of how carefully Hitchcock builds the suspense in this movie. You watch the birds standing there, and they do not move, they are just waiting. Even when you think they are dumb something tells you they are thinking. They are analyzing your moves.<br/><br/>This was possible with the aid of a top-notch screenplay, and great performances of the actors. This was probably the most difficult film for Hitchcock, specially for the technical aspects that were involved, but when you watch it, it really was worth the pain.<br/><br/>The main plot is well-known: Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren),a young girl goes to Bodega Bay looking for Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor),a handsome man she met in San Francisco, when suddenly, the birds start attacking humans by no reason. Pretty straight forward, and by this date very outdated, but Hitchcock adds his magic and the script spices this with the very complex relationships between the characters.<br/><br/>The complex relationship between Mitch and his mother Lydia(played by Jessica Tandy), and the conflict that she has with Melanie is very interesting and brings back memories from Psycho. Also, Melanie's relationship with her own mother and the bond that she creates with Lydia and Mitch's 11 years old sister Cathy(Veronica Cartwright) is fascinating.<br/><br/>The scene when the four of them are trapped inside the house with the birds waiting outside is classic; not only is, as I wrote above, a perfect example of the use of suspense, it is an awesome study of the characters and how their relation grows. I think that this particular movie was main inspiration for George A. Romero's claustrophobic climax in his landmark film ""Night of the Living Dead""(1968).<br/><br/>The technical aspects may be the focus of many studies, but the characters deserve to be praised, even the support cast with a few lines develop a personality of their own. The restaurant scene is Hitchcock at his best with witty dialogs that are both humorous and creepy. Very good ensemble.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an awesome movie, many reviewers have said it, I know. But I wanted to point that beyond the technical advances this experimental movie features, it is a perfect example of why Alfred Hitchcock is considered, ""The Master of Suspense"".<br/><br/>9/10. Classic."

","Not as effective as the short story by Daphne De Maurier but otherwise a really good and faithful adaptation. The Special Effects were really good for their time, as was the use of real attacking birds. Goes to show this would be the very worst nightmare if it suddenly happened. The back story is interesting and thankfully never tries to explain the horrific attacks. Both involving and scary."
"nycritic","10","157","277","19 January 2006"," Obsessions Under the Strobelight.
","Some films are so well made that watching them unfold sequence by sequence creates the feeling of surrender to a higher force. Hitchcock, no stranger to spellbinding his audience, was known for bringing a sense of intense masochism into the viewer's eyes. In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH the Albert Hall sequence is a perfect crescendo of images and music in which Jo McKenna sees a man who is the key to her son's safety prepare to commit a crime with deadly slowness. In PSYCHO, Marion Crane takes a fatal shower and gets a vicious visitor. In VERTIGO, Scotty and Judy begin a dizzying affair which itself is as obsessive as narcotic and culminates high above the bell tower, filled with revelations upon revelations.<br/><br/>THE BIRDS is by far one of Hitchcock's most deadly incursions into cinematic masochism. In itself, it's a masterpiece of misdirection. Hitchcock has no wrong man in his story, no chase sequences (or at least, none that involve Cary Grant and some Bad Guys), and no double-crosses. All he presents here is Tippi Hedren's arrival to the small town of Bodega Bay, a series of Meet Cutes between her and Rod Taylor, what could pass as romantic suspense, and the most impressive sweeping of the rug right out from under the audience's feet at precisely halfway through the movie when the plot makes a left turn into uncharted territory. Who else can lay claim to that feat? Hitchcock, in revealing the black petals of his deadly flower revealing themselves, opening up, and swallowing the viewer whole at this precise mark is one of the un-topped achievements in cinema history.<br/><br/>And so begins a sequence of events that proceed at the vertiginous crescendo of domino's falling. We've seen the birds amass and attack in increasing ferocity. We've seen the damage they've done to the little city. Hitchcock, of course, has one better on the viewers during the film's overpowering climax: making their presence oppressive and omniscient through the use of sound imitating their shrieks until it becomes deafening and everyone is twisting and turning in revulsion among the corners of the house in reaction not only to their fury but to what they might imagine as their horrible deaths. Hitchcock never once gives an emotional release, and then he outdoes himself in using the most hackneyed excuse for a plot device: Melanie ascending the stairs because she heard a rustling noise, the quintessential ""Don't go there,"" which is the oldest trick in the book. Because we know what lies on the other side of the door....<br/><br/>The stroboscopic effect of the last attack is petrifying as it is unflinching. Melanie, waving the flashlight in a weak signal for help, being slammed against the door, as Mitch tries to get inside but finds he cannot. As Melanie begins slumping and surrenders to the birds' attack, she has an odd mixture of horror and pleasure. We, of course, can't do anything but watch and watch and watch.<br/><br/>Hitchcock had always been attracted to the theme of rape. Because his (professional) relationship with Tippi Hedren was brittle at best, this sequence, somehow out of place and character, seems more in tune with his love-hate attitude towards blonde women and his need for their total submission. Beginning with the emotional rape Jo McKenna suffers with the disappearance of her son, the psychological stripping of Madeleine's identity in VERTIGO, Marion's violent death at the Bates Motel in PSYCHO in and culminating in the barbaric rape sequence of FRENZY, he possessed a desire to destroy that which he loved or desired the most. <br/><br/>I notice how he makes Rod Taylor's character suddenly incapable of saving Melanie right at the end (which heightens the viewers agony -- they want, they need her to survive the birds' attack). It's almost as if he, the Director as Ringmaster, were pushing the Heroine right to the edge of the abyss for one last moment before bringing her back to the (relative) safety of family. Even then, with the vague ending, Hitchcock seems to sort of wink at the audience and tell them that it's still not over -- and this is the sort of thing only a sadistic imp of a personality would do. THE BIRDS is his obsessions at its most explicit (as they were implicit in VERTIGO) and is the kind of cinematic experience that can always be rediscovered even when its tricks become evident. It's been considered Hitchcock's last masterpiece before returning to almost full form for FRENZY, and in many ways, it is the setup for the more graphic, cruel violence of the latter film."
"fantod101","1","87","148","20 November 2014"," One of the Most Overrated Movies of All Time
","I know this movie is often described as a ""masterpiece"" and for the life of me, I don't understand why.<br/><br/>First of all: the acting is completely wooden from virtually everyone in the movie. It could be that the actors could find no motivation for their characters. <br/><br/>Whatever is supposed to be happening or building between the characters in the first half of the movie seems to lead to absolutely nothing int he movie. It's vague back story for the sake of back story. If Hitchcock was trying to have us care about the characters, he failed miserably. <br/><br/>Second, and perhaps most important: what do the birds have to do with any of this vapid soap opera that is occurring on the ground? Nothing. Nothing at all. And that would be fine, if somehow the bird frenzy created some sort of empathy in the viewer or brought about a change or revelation in the characters. But no, I found myself not caring if the whole town got eked to death. The characters all come across as shallow, self-centered, bitter people.<br/><br/>I know I might get the wrath of many fans of this movie. But, sorry, this movie fails on so many levels."
"MichaelKeith","1","60","107","21 September 2013"," Melodramatic, not scary, bad acting/directing
","I've never seen it before and was expecting it to be amazing and scary. My favorite movie is Rear Window, so I know I like his movies, but this was ridiculous and not at all scary. The beginning was exhausting and too much setup. The acting was melodramatic and we literally laughed at times.<br/><br/>The writing was horrible and forced. The worst was probably when, near the end of the movie, Melanie (Tippi Hedron) was sitting on the couch curling up into a ball because they here the birds trying to get into the house. Just seemed like either bad acting or bad direction by Hitchcock. I'm gonna guess bad direction because Tippi was a fairly good actress through most of the movie. <br/><br/>Oh and the scene where she is attacked in the room! Why would you go in there and then when you're in there getting attacked, why wouldn't you scream? <br/><br/>Ugh! Sorry the whole movie annoyed me! Don't waste your time."
"jonrose","Null","86","159","20 August 1999"," A Masterpiece
","Another film to prove that Hitchcock really was one of the most gifted film makers ever. His films are more 'fresh' today than any of current Hollywood megabuster.<br/><br/>The screeching bird soundtrack in itself was chilling.<br/><br/>The absence of backgound music added a sense of calm before the storm which made the bird attack scenes all the more intense.<br/><br/>The film builds up slowly and that serves to build up the tension and edginess.<br/><br/>The most chilling scene was definitely when Melanie (Tippi Hedren) was waiting outside the school while the singing was going on in the school. At each loop of the song, a few more crows would perch on the climbing frame. The site of them was truly grotesque. This scene is a lesson to all the ""subtle as a sledge hammer"" so called 'thrillers' that are churned out today.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, there is no conclusion, no neat result. It is somewhat uncomfortable watching a film like this and not seeing a conclusion. How will it end? Why did the birds attack?<br/><br/>Why spoil the film with an explanation?"
"ericolsen1953","10","142","273","30 December 2004"," The last movie Senator Gill ever saw
","An old friend, the late State Senator Ted Gill, of Holyoke, Colorado, once told me that The Birds was the last movie he ever saw. He gave up movies after seeing this flick...they were just getting too weird and disturbing for an old rancher like him. It's still pretty terrifying, even if you've seen it again and again. You know what bad, brutal scenes are coming and don't want to see the carnage again, but can't help yourself. It's ominous as the crows flock tighter and tighter, always more and more, on the schoolyard Monkey-Bars and it's also exciting to see the school kids chased down by the crows a few minutes later. Subplots like the pitiful neurosis of Lydia Brenner, Mitch & Annie's lost-love-affair, Mitch's indifference to the needs of others, and the poor-little-rich-girl Melanie, who still just wants her mommie, are all well-written and acted. Loved best by me is Hitchcock's humorous characters who are CHARACTERS! The old drunk at the bar quoting Holy Scripture, the nosy neighbor done wonderfully by Richard Deacon, the dowdily-dressed old intellectual in the cafe buying her cigarettes and evidently a scientific expert for any field. Sir Alfred's macabre touches of comedy are unmatched, even in today's thrillers. I'm repulsed and attracted by such scenes as the one in the farmhouse, where Jessica Tandy discovers an old friend pecked to death, with his eye sockets bloody and empty. I find myself still searching for gory details on the farmer's body because Hitch didn't let the camera dwell on the horrible face too long. But he DID give us two rapid jump-cuts with closer and closer close-ups, and we end up seeing just as much detail as Jessica just did - enough to know that ""We gotta git outta there!"" Overall, a fine time. 119 minutes of revolting fun!"
"MorganleFay1999","1","105","202","25 January 2006"," what the heck was the point of this movie?
","This movie is a complete waste of time! I rented it because I am a big fan of suspense/thriller movies, and thus far I have enjoyed all of Hitchcock's movies I've seen (Vertigo, Pshycho, Spellbound, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder etc.) I was very excited to see this movie, it has received very good reviews so I expected to be wowed like all the other Hitchcock movies.<br/><br/>I was not only not WOWed, I can't even say this movie is mediocre. This movie was just plain awful. There was honestly no plot. The only thing that happened was the birds went nuts and attacked a town. We don't know why, we don't know anything about the characters who got attacked. It wasn't even scary! It was actually somewhat cartoonish, with the liberal use of obviously-fake bright red ""blood"", and the screaming children and towns people were pretty silly.<br/><br/>All in all, I just can't believe this movie was made by the person who made Vertigo. That movie was EXCELLENT, it had a very solid and Suspenseful plot, great and complex characters, and it kept us guessing until the end. There was nothing mysterious about this movie. The only mystery was why did these birds go insane? But we were not even afforded the luxury of receiving an explanation. When the movie ended, I couldn't help myself and said ""That has got to be the crappiest movie I have ever seen."" You know when was the last time I said that? It was after watching Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time! Just because it was made by Hitchcock doesn't mean it's worth it.<br/><br/>Still annoyed ..."
"Gordino","10","94","180","21 June 1999"," I Never Get Tired of Watching ""The Birds""
","I recall watching ""The Birds"" for the first time when I was about 8 years old and afterwards I was afraid of birds for years. (I'd still be freaked if one flew into a room I was in!)<br/><br/>I've probably watched ""The Birds"" over 25 times since I first saw it in the 1970's and it still impresses me.  By what exactly?  Many things.<br/><br/>First, the special effects were amazing for a film from 1963.  How did Hitchcock get the birds to attack (I read that Hitchcock once joked when asked that question: ""They were well paid!)<br/><br/>Secondly, the detailed camera angles that Hitchcock put into the film. You notice this almost immediately in the Bird Shop when the bird is flying around loose. Who would ever think to film ""arms and the ceiling""?  Later in the Phone Booth the scene is filmed as if Melanie is in a ""bird cage"". Other astounding angles include when the birds attack the house,  not to mention the final attack in the bedroom.  So many directors shoot scenes in a boring manner,  but not Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The more times I view ""The Birds"" the more I understand the ending,  but I do agree that at first I was not satisfied with it.  I wanted the birds to either finish the job or to be challenged by something (Mitch did hear on Melanie's car radio that perhaps the military might be called in!) but we never saw anything like that.   I guess that's why we have imaginations!<br/><br/>'Tippi' Hedren was a beautiful cool blonde who played Melanie Daniels as she should have - icy and yet ultimately very vulnerable.   Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner seemed a good reason for her to travel to Bodega Bay.   Jessica Tandy as Lydia was what you'd expect of an older, widowed, small town woman from that time.   Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth, the school teacher, with her dark beauty was quite a contrast to Melanie and I felt awful at her death by the birds.  Veronica Cartwright as Kathy Brenner was a little annoying when she cried but then that IS what young girls do!!<br/><br/>Of course some of the dialogue is dated but that's with most films.<br/><br/>There is really nothing I dislike about ""The Birds"" as you can probably tell.   Others may disagree, and they're entitled to their opinion.  I just think everyone should re-watch ""The Birds"" a little deeper;  perhaps it will change their perspective on it."
"style-2","8","61","113","31 January 2005"," Brilliant and frightening
","This movie scared me to death when I was five. My parents had dumped the four of us at a theatre for the afternoon and two hours later, I was a swollen, puffy mess, still sobbing from the horror I had witnessed. That was 35 years ago, but you'd think it happened yesterday, the way my sister still sadistically laughs at me for being so frightened. I no longer react with fear upon seeing the movie  but it is with a wizened eye that I now look at the scenes that had such impact: and they're still some of the scariest scenes put on film. Done entirely without music, the scenes unreel with alarming suspense. The theme of nature-run-amok has been made into mincemeat in the decades since, but seldom with such a deft touch. Much is made about the outdated special effects, but they are mild compared to the overusage in modern films. Tippi Hedren, whom Hitchcock spotted in a diet drink commercial and became his latest obsession, makes her debut as the cool and soignee Melanie Daniels, socialite-at-large. Hedren, who named her daughter Melanie (Griffith) after her character, subsequently had a less-than-stellar career, starring in such classics as *Teresa's Tattoo* and *Return to Green Acres*. The plot line involving Daniels and her pursuit of attorney Mitch Brenner definitely has problems, but seems necessary to create the atmosphere and set the stage for the real stars of the movie  the birds. There are so many birds in this movie, billing and cooing with an innocence that belies their malevolence, that the nightmare unfolding on the screen must have been rivaled by the nightmare on the set. Tales of tranquilizing the birds and wiring them in place surely would cause distress among animal-rights activists today. Jessica Tandy is chill and formidable as Mitch's mother, Lydia, and Suzanne Pleshette, as schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, is one of the most interesting characters in the movie. And her final scene is most memorable, as she is found facedown in front of her home, pecked to death.<br/><br/>The climactic attack that takes place at Mitch's home is sheer brilliance. As the birds are pecking through the door and gathering in the attack, there is a sense of madness unleashed that is breathtaking. The ambiguity of the ending has been roundly criticized  but it is most successful in leaving behind a sense that the story is not quite over. Of course, it wasn't quite over  it had to be insulted with a sequel, *The Birds II*. The film has acquired a certain campiness over the years that allows the sophisticated viewer to look past the obvious plot devices, and find an arch humor in the classic scenes. From Melanie getting clocked on the forehead by a seagull, to the crotchety ornithologist at the café, to the scene with the guy whose eyes have pecked out, to the amassing of the birds at the schoolhouse, where the children are singing what is surely the longest children's song ever written, the scenes are imprinted indelibly on our memories. So much so, that Tippi has become a popular Halloween costume  just pin a bird in your wig, and you're instantly Melanie Daniels. It's easy to laugh at something that used to be scary, but is there anyone that doesn't think of *The Birds* whenever they see more than a dozen of them get together?"
"acedj","10","3","3","25 August 2019"," Hitchcock's finest.
","There are a lot of celebrated Hitchcock movies, but to me this is his best. The man against nature along with the slow build up are fantastic. This is a love story intermixed with a thriller. A chance encounter at a pet store between Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner causes Melanie to track him from San Francisco to Bodega Bay. It is here that people are mysteriously attacked by birds. It starts out slowly with a single bird attacking one person, to massed, planned attacks. A lot of modern viewers deride this as boring or cheesy, nut they need to look at it through the lens with which it was made in 1963. This is a gritty thriller that reminds us that we are not as superior as we think we are."

The ""I'm an auteur now, as you can see by slooow pacing, the waxy, masklike stares of my blonde, and my deliberately withholding from any character the faculty of reason.""<br/><br/>Main-character Melanie, the Paris Hilton of her day (did she or didn't she skinny dip in a Roman fountain? Oooh, titillating!) has absolutely no affect to her voice--in every line, she channels Lauren Bacall on barbituates. The women all hate each other instantly and are each fixated on ""Mitch,"" a hubba-hubba guy with no chemistry. The cute meet is stupid; the melodrama is boring; there is no suspense because, between deadly attacks, people seem to forget the trauma of the birds--after a harrowing encounter, the mother rambles on about missing her husband and not knowing whether she likes Hubba's new relationship, for example.<br/><br/>In short, this would be excellent, excellent fodder for Mystery Science Theater--just the right level of movie-making competency and retardness to make for gleeful ridicule."

","I've just watched THE BIRDS on Blu-ray for the first time and ended up loving it more than ever. I can now safely say that this is an excellent Hitchcock film, perhaps not one of his very best, but certainly up there among them. It comes second only to JAWS as my favourite animal attack film, and is expertly made. The whole first hour takes time to get to know the characters and feels much like a Doris Day-style romantic comedy (helped by Rod Taylor's presence) before Hitchcock lets rip with the full-blooded horror in the second half.<br/><br/>Some might complain that the first hour is a little slow, but when the direction's this good I didn't mind at all. Still, once the birds DO attack, things really hot up. The shock scenes do just that - the bit with the chimney is an example of a good, solid cinematic moment. The attack on the children's party is another. Characters hole up in a bar, and things remain just fine until the end. Hitchcock choreographs an excellent 'out of control' set-piece as the town is destroyed, full of flames and broken glass and chaos. We get a mini siege scenario at the end, no doubt inspiring the likes of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and all that's come since. The special effects are still pretty good to this day and Hitchcock doesn't skimp on the sadism in the bloody attacks, either. This might well be one of the first of the Hollywood FX blockbusters.<br/><br/>The cast is very good too. Taylor is as perfect as the everyman hero as he was in THE TIME MACHINE. Jessica Tandy is excellent, playing a very irritating character and giving her some warmth and life despite her bad points. Veronica Cartwright is convincingly menaced, just as she was years later in ALIEN and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. I didn't care much for Tippi Hedren's cold character the first couple of times I saw this, but her presence has subsequently grown on me in the intervening years."

","Images of birds stay with you, long after the film has finished. Whether sat, menacing, on the school climbing frame, or flying in screeching monochrome against a pallid sky, those birds make a profound impact. What do they mean?<br/><br/>One cannot help thinking of things 'coming home to roost'. Tippi Hedren (playing Melanie), an ex-wild child who enjoyed the dolce vita in Rome- however true the 'naked in fountain' allegations- confesses to trying to 'find herself' via charity work and studying linguistics! In her first film appearance (Hitchcock discovered her in a diet drink commercial) Tippi produces a wonderfully perplexing performance of tight suppression; her hairstyle alone, so smooth and well-polished, indicates neurotically tight personal packaging: when it starts to come unravelled, so does she!<br/><br/>Robert Boyle- the film's designer- claims that the design of the film was inspired by Munch's painting, 'The Scream'. In a direct and visual sense it is hard to see that. But, in terms of this being a film that is about personal anguish and dislocation, there are definite parallels. All is not well in sunny Bodega Bay! Mitch (played woodenly by Rod Taylor) has a dead father, a mother who never got over that bereavement, and an 'ex' who washed up as the local schoolteacher. Via an off-shot TV set we hear about meaningless violence in the outside world.<br/><br/>The scene in the local cafe is pivotal: when, thanks to the birds, the stone of this little community is turned over, all manner of small crawling things emerge. In the cockpit that the diner becomes people turn on each other and (metaphorically) spit as the anxiety gnaws at them. The film is worth watching for that sequence alone.<br/><br/>Hitchcock shows his usual and effortless mastery of the visual. There is the early humorous touch where two lovebirds in Tippi's car sway from side to side as she drives round the curves of the coast road. There is the heavily symbolic 'pieta' scene at the end where Tippi (who has no idea where her mother is, who is dead to the world after being savaged by the birds) is cradled in the lap of Jessica Tandy- playing Mitch's mother, Lydia- who is finally enabled by this new crisis to start to get over her old one (the loss of her husband): the tableau is enormously moving.<br/><br/>It is worth reflecting whether what makes little sense as a straight account of external events doesn't add up a great deal better as an indicative account of internal events. In the cafe scene Tippi is accused of bringing the birds with her and- in this sense- that would be true: her unresolved and pitiless internal landscape is writ large in the skies above Bodega Bay, where she has to fight, suffer, and ultimately be redeemed. Meanwhile the schoolteacher- holding a torch in self-imposed exile- is finally snuffed out.<br/><br/>Oh, and there is the strange case of the dog that did not bark: this is a Hitchcock film unique in that it has no music! How does that affect what it conveys?<br/><br/>Another wonderful feature of the narrative is the ironic inversion between birds and humans it tells of. The petshop where the action opens is full of caged birds. One escapes and briefly flutters round before being ignominiously caught under Rod Taylor's hat and bundled back in the cage. At the height of the action it is people who are caged up in their houses by the birds- to the extent where they are nailing themselves in! Yet, finally, the birds allow the carload of people to leave showing, in this respect, more liberality than their erstwhile captors. One is reminded of what Tippi says in the petshop (to Rod Taylor) ""now you know how it feels to be on the other end of a gag"""

","This suspenseful shocker deals about a beautiful and rich girl named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), at the beginning she is shopping in a San Francisco pet store when she meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Mitch is looking to buy some birds for his young sister's birthday , he recognizes Melanie but pretends to mistake her for a shopkeeper. After that ,she decides to buy the birds and driving up to the pacific isolated coastal California community called Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends his weekends with his mummy (Jesica Tandy) and sister (Veronica Cartwright) . Shortly after Melanie Daniels is crossing a lake, then she is cruelly nipped by a gull. Gradually, events of bird attacks on people by pecking increases. Kids are attacked at a birthday party (where appears as little girl Morgan Brittany). Meanwhile, children are sent home from school run by teacher (Suzanne Pleshette), townspeople (Charles McGraw, Karl Swenson, Chapman) take refuge in a lunchroom, a gas station is burnt, Melanie is trapped in a phone booth, and, finally, everyone hides in homes tightly closed against repeated attacks by the birds.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's classic about a gorgeous woman who follows a gentleman until a quiet place where suddenly happens mass bird attacks . After frightening spectators of the 60s with ¨Psycho¨ director Hitch took one more successful outing at the terror genre with this excellent movie full of subterranean hints. Exciting scenes when birds attack with death dropping fiercely , its menace magnified similarly to crop-dusting images in ¨North by Northwest¨. Interesting screenplay by Evan Hunter based on Daphne Du Maurier's (Jamica Inn,Rebecca) short story. Al always, Alfred Hitchcock cameo, this time as man walking dogs out of pet shop. Wonderful Tippi Hedren as obstinate Melanie , she's marvelous and brilliantly dressed by Edith Head , but she had a tortuous involvement to Hitch, habitual issue with his leading ladies. Acceptable special effects by Ub Iwerks, Walt Disney's usual, and Albert Whitlock in pictorial designs and the future director John Bud Cardos as bird wrangler. And colorful and evocative cinematography by Robert Burks, also Hitchcock's customary. Rare and strange electronic musical score fitting to bird attacks. This delightful film is stunningly directed by the master Hithcock. Followed by a lousy and cheesy sequel in 1994 titled ¨The birds II : land's end¨ by Rick Rosenthal under ordinary pseudonym as Alan Smithee with Brad Johnson, Megan Gallaher and again Tippi Hedren. Rating : Not for squeamish but well worth seeing because it is an immortal classic movie. This is Hitchcock at his best."
"MovieAddict2016","6","19","32","22 May 2005"," ""The Birds"" has always been one of my lesser favorites from Hitchcock
","I've been watching ""The Birds"" since I was too young to even remember, and when I was moving across countries once I even caught the sequel on television (which is just gruesome and lacking the suspense of this). However ""The Birds"" has always seemed slightly uneven to me, as if the premise itself is so absurd that I have a hard time taking the film entirely seriously.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best Hitchcock films are ""North by Northwest,"" ""The 39 Steps,"" ""The Lady Vanishes,"" ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Rear Window"" and of course my favorite horror film of all-time, ""Psycho."" ""The Birds"" is a good film and very well-made but because its content is so silly in nature you may find yourself having a hard time taking it all as seriously as Hitch expects us to.<br/><br/>So overall, it is a fine movie, but not one of the Master of Suspense's greatest."
"disdained_heart","1","50","96","20 February 2008"," The movie lacks a solid story and an honest resolution.
","Having never seen the movie, I read the script first to prepare myself for the 'visual companion', in other words, for the film. I am a huge fan of Daphne Du Maurier's ""Rebecca"", and although I have never read ""The Birds"" novel, I figured it would be an interesting story as well. <br/><br/>By the end of script page 161 I had not really learned anything worthwhile from any of the characters. Since the script called for ""insert information here from Dr. X for a possible reason to why birds may violently attack"", I decided to watch the movie in hopes that I might find a reasonable explanation and maybe have a better understanding of the characters. I also decided to watch the movie thinking maybe it was a story that needed to be 'seen' in order to capture the eeriness and essence of the birds' wrath. I must say, that was not the case.<br/><br/>Melanie (Tippi Hedren) is a spoiled rich girl that is used to being childish and foolish and uses her Daddy's newspaper to bid her ways. Mitch (Rod Taylor) is the sophisticated lawyer strangely attracted to Melanie's beauty despite her 'reckless' behavior. Lydia (Jessica Tandy) is Mitch's widowed mother who is (unsuccessfully) coping with the loss of her husband and clinging to her son tooth and nail. Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) is Mitch's ex-girlfriend who still remains friends with him but continues to love him. Add to this soap like melodrama the sudden attack of birds for no inexplicable reason and you have yourself a movie titled ""The Birds"". <br/><br/>The reason why it failed to even remotely interest me was not because it wasn't ""scary enough"" or because the ""special effects weren't good enough"" those are poor excuses  but because I could not see a personal growth from almost all of the characters. The romance between the two lead characters seemed abrupt, there is a scene in the script that actually displays them getting close and ultimately displaying their affections for one another, but in the movie it just seems rushed and out of nowhere. Annie's love for Mitch is not resolved in a tasteful manner  her character meets a terrible faith and she is simply taken out of the equation. Lydia is about the only person that comes to some sort of resolution and resignation in this inexplicable catastrophe of events. The brief 10 minutes of monologue she has on screen serve to explain the struggles she finds herself in as she attempts to overcome the fear she has been plagued with. <br/><br/>Still, the connection and emotional value just lack from my part and do not allow me to engage with a plausible contempt for the story."
"mattp0805","1","21","36","19 February 2012"," Didn't end.
","I believe that 'The Birds' is the worst film that I have ever seen. It had such a promising start but I'm not sure that I can fully say that the film 'ended'. The main idea being that Melanie Daniels is being attacked by birds, and then it seems to spread to the whole area and people keep getting hurt. One man is viscously murdered, which I expected to become more prominent in the film but it was just left untouched. The school children are attacked, but this is once again untouched afterwards, and the Brenner's house is attacked and that is it. No explanation, but a lot of mystery. There was not a cliff hanger to get you thinking, it ended with them driving away after being attacked. Why were the birds attacking? This is the whole plot of the film but is never explained. It had got to be Hitchcock's worst, and I am a real Hitchcock fan. Even if you love his work, this is not recommended by me at all."
"Coventry","8","22","38","30 August 2009"," Birds don't just go around attacking people, do they?
","I still have quite a few of Hitchcock classics to see, but I can already rest assured that ""The Birds"" will remain my all-time favorite effort by this legendary director. Being primarily a horror movie junkie, I consider this milestone to be the pioneer in the delicious 'nature revolts' sub genre. For reasons that remain unexplained throughout the entire movie, birds spontaneously launch virulent and aggressive attacks against the inhabitants of Bodega Bay; a little seaside town 90 miles away from San Francisco. Still several years after the release of this film, clever and ingenious independent horror film directors borrowed this formula and used it as an excuse to manifest practically every species of the animal kingdom as vicious killing machines, usually because of the ongoing pollution by mankind. But ""The Birds"" remains the original classic even though the story develops itself very slowly and the script refuses to give any type of explanation whatsoever. For nearly a full hour, the film simply focuses on the bizarre love-story between the spoiled daughter of newspaper owner and an arrogant crime attorney. She drives out to his parental house in Bodega Bay, where he spends all of his weekends, to play out a practical joke. ""The Birds"" then subsequently unfolds itself as a strangely compelling romance between the two aforementioned characters, but also the embittered local school teacher and the attorney's frigid mother. The interactions between these four unusual characters are often downright eerie and there isn't even a bird in sight at that moment! Meanwhile, however, the menace of our 'feathered friends' is continuously present and noticeable. The attacks gradually increase in number and intensity, like the birds are putting up some sort of strategy even though there's no obvious motive. After the virulent attack during a child's birthday party, the thriller definitely shifts into high gear, with many sequences that are righteously considered as classic by now (the schoolyard, the phone booth, the exploding gas station). Hitch's nickname 'The Master of Suspense' is justified through many individual moments here in this film, like when the entire community seeks shelter inside the café and accuses the girl of bringing this mayhem upon them. The film's brilliant anti-climax, with thousands of birds just sitting and suspiciously waiting outside the Brenner house is legendary and imitated copious of times. ""The Birds"" is a perplexing Hitchcock landmark, with a couple of surprisingly shocking make-up effects and a truly ominous atmosphere that still manages to send cold shivers of fright down your spine."
"Don-102","Null","68","135","21 March 1999"," Hitchcock goes out on a limb and scares with THE BIRDS...
","Hitchcock topped himself in 1960, basically inspiring all modern horror pictures with PSYCHO, a new kind of fright flick never seen before.  3 years later, he made a foray into the supernatural with THE BIRDS.  If you have not seen the film and do not think a bunch of gulls and sparrows can hold you in suspense, think again.  The great thing about a Hitchcock movie is that you always know you are about to enter a world where all is not right. This 'world' usually involves an innocent man wrongly accused, eventually on the run.  The world of THE BIRDS has none of this.  Nature has run amok and the characters, paper-thin as they are, will go through a truly terrifying ordeal.<br/><br/>One of the most innovative aspects here is a lack of any musical score of any kind.  Hitch's long-time partner Bernard Herrman is listed as ""sound consultant"" and I'm sure he had something to do with the ominous sounds of the various birds, as their building wrath is indicated by their squawks. The attack scenes are a bit dated, but considering the technology of the day was pre-historic compared to the computer generated effects of today, they come across chillingly.  Some birds were props, others hand-drawn, even others real.  The film surprisingly benefits from a lack of music, heightening the suspense.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is the icy blonde and a standard of Hitch's movies, the jealous or overbearing mother, is played by Jessica Tandy (in an awkwardly distant role).  Performances aside, Hitch does something he wished not to do in PSYCHO.  The bloody attacks are in bright technicolor, and one scene depicting a victim of the birds is quite shocking.  Hitch was afraid of showing the bloody carnage of the 'shower scene' in color, leaving it to the viewer's imagination.  It works here, showing the blood-red evil happening in this everyday small town.<br/><br/>If you are claustrophobic, I would avoid THE BIRDS.  Like Janet Leigh in the PSYCHO shower scene, Tippi Hedren is caught in a phone booth in one of many tight situations, shot from overhead.  Otherwise, let Sir Alfred play you like a piano, like he so often has before !"
"jhaggardjr","9","52","103","17 June 2000"," ""They're coming! They're coming!""
","""They're coming! They're coming!"" were the words said by Tippi Hedren at the end of the coming attractions trailer for Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film ""The Birds"". And boy did they come when the movie opened. This is a terrifying story about what could happen if our fine feathered friends turned on man. ""The Birds"", like the Master of Suspense's 1960 masterpiece ""Psycho"", has the ability to give people the chills. I found ""The Birds"" to be just a tad below ""Psycho"" (it starts a little slow), but it's still a pretty scary movie. It features good acting by Tippi Hedren (in her most famous role), Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy (26 years before ""Driving Miss Daisy""), Suzanne Pleshette, and Veronica Cartwright (16 years before ""Alien""). Plus it has impressive special visual effects, and probably the scariest sound effects that I've ever heard. The sound effects alone give me the creeps. And it has its share of humorous moments throughout. ""The Birds"" is classic Hitchcock. If you like horror movies that are well made with a well told story, then you'll like this one.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"
"poetcomic1","9","6","8","27 June 2017"," One of Fellini's Ten Favorite films
","As Francois Truffaut said, cinema was invented so that we could be shown things like the bird attacks in The Birds. The savage, meaningless idea of it is profoundly existential in a way that even Antonioni himself deeply appreciated. Antonioni admired many things about Hitchcock and Hitchcock was himself inspired by Blow-Up. Fellini, himself, called The Birds one of the most BEAUTIFUL movies ever made (?!) and listed it among his top ten favorite films of all time. Having seen this many times I have come to appreciate the small Hitchcock touches - even in the 'notoriously slow' first hour of the film.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was a master of sound and all of his films had a separate and carefully orchestrated sound-script which he closely supervised. This included even incidental sounds, doors opening, etc. It is worth your while to re-watch The Birds with the sole idea of listening to every incidental sound on the track.<br/><br/>Even Ingmar Bergman was a Hitchcock fan and lifted a scene from The Paradine Case and reworked it into Cries and Whispers! The relationships of The Birds have a 'Bergmanesque' quality as well and the Bodega Bay setting could as well have been Ingmar's Faro island. The film The Passion of Anna, deftly counterpoints the personal relationship with an unknown outside 'monster' who is killing and mutilating animals. Very much like 'The Birds' in spirit.<br/><br/>The great directors have been far kinder to this film than many critics."
"GTeixeira","2","40","79","19 August 2013"," Hitchcock makes a masterpiece Ed Wood must have been proud of
","A rich woman goes to a small coast town after a man she saw on a pet shop. Her arrival, however, coincides with strange happenings in the city as the birds gradually start attacking everyone.<br/><br/>I was attracted by it because of its status as a 'classical horror', appearing in many listings as one of the best horror films, and the fact it's made by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>I can't understand all the hype. Ed Wood made better films.<br/><br/>This film is so bad, most of the 'scary' scenes actually had me laughing. No just the 'that is too silly' laugh, but the 'I almost fell out of my chair laughing' laugh; nothing short of Monty Python or Chaplin have ever made me laugh this much. <br/><br/>I showed this film to some of my family; the adults were mostly shaking their heads and questioning how Hitchcock could have success with something like this, while the younger ones (10-14 years old) were laughing and later said it was the best comedy they ever watched.<br/><br/>The acting is beyond amateurish, with characters mostly making faces to the camera and shrieking to convey their shock being something straight out of a bad parody. It also shocks me that Hitchcock, who always cast beautiful women like Ingrid Bergman, Vera Miles or Grace Kelly to star in his films, would cast the rather ugly Tippi Hedren. Was there no beautiful/cute blondes available? The characters are not far behind with their terrible development, being pretty much caricatures of human beings; Hedren's character being the worst offender, with her motivations or actions. They also act inexplicably dumb at times: Hedren's reaction to the birds in the school being the best example, but also the information given by the radio news. <br/><br/>The special effects are terrible. Not just the usual background scenes, but the birds and their attacks are laughably badly done. Suspension of disbelief can only work so far; in here, the birds looked like bad puppets with the way they moved. I fell laughing at most 'attack' scenes, with the gas station one being my favorite. The fact this was Oscar-nominated is nothing short of a joke, you could find better effects in the silent era four decades before this.<br/><br/>But the very worst of all is the story itself. Hitchcock always managed to make his stories have a degree of sense, even his most fantastic tales like 'North by Northwest'. That doesn't happen here. There is no explanation at hand, not even a hint for us to go by. Even horrors like George Romero's zombies or crap like 'The Mist' leave a hint for us to work on, to base ourselves. Hitchcock offers nothing at all. He explained that, by giving a reason, the movie would turn into science-fiction; clearly, he must either be an idiot or not understand horror at all.<br/><br/>This is a terrible, nonsensical film that should be on par with the likes of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Battlefield Earth'. It is as if Ed Wood himself wrote/directed/produced."
"pasany","1","27","51","14 October 2009"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen
","When I started to watch this, I thought ""It's Hitchcock, it can't be bad then!"" Later on, as nothing seemed to make any sense, I thought there must be a bang at the end, but no, even that failed to happen, the ending is just as flat as the rest. I'm totally disappointed.<br/><br/>In this film nothing happens for a reason, nothing is explained, everything contradicts common sense (even if we accept that every bird gets mad and attacks people), and there isn't even a solution at the end - nor the opposite, a doom instead of a solution, nor any conclusion, it's essentially an ""immedias res ending"" (the protagonists abandon an undefendable house, and that's it, the film ends as they drive away). The special effects are extremely weak too, but it's forgivable because it's a very old movie. However even the best effects wouldn't save this!<br/><br/>*SPOILER* The 1st part of the movie is not only flat and boring, but pretty stupid: the female protagonist meets the male protagonist in a bird shop, and what happens between them is opposed to all reason: he PRETENDS to mistake her for the shopkeeper, and asks her help to find lovebirds. She, instead of telling that she is just a customer too, also pretends to be the shopkeeper and of course makes every mistake possible. When the truth is out, he offends her by telling she should be in prison, FOR Driving INTO A SHOP WINDOW (!!!) (later he turns out to be a lawyer - a fine lawyer, isn't he?). Being offended, she inspects him by his license number and finds his name and address. Now guess what she does: buys the lovebirds for that hated person and brings to his address!!!! And when he turns out to be (about 60 miles) away for weekend, she, instead of waiting until Monday, drives to his house in the country with the birds. (And now I guess it's clear that they'll become lovers...)<br/><br/>My comment on this part: I thought Hitchcock is a better writer than this! How couldn't he make the way the protagonists meet and get into a backwater town at least a little less lame?! It' the lamest plot I've ever seen!<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is about the attacks of the birds, which gets more and more organized. They attack for no explained reason, and it seems that only that one particular town gets raided. They also don't care about the heavy casualties every single attack costs, and are eager to attack well defended houses (how the hell they know at all if there is anyone inside?!!), even if there is only one person inside to kill, instead of attacking only in the open, where they have much better chances!<br/><br/>An ornithologist says in the film, that there are billions of birds in the USA only, so if they manage to attack the people organized, they are doomed – this is also bullshit, because birds can't take supplies with them as humans do, they need to gather their food day by day, so even a well organized bird society wouldn't capable of anything more than occasional raids – maybe if they would eat the bodies, but they don't eat their victims in this story!<br/><br/>All in all, as I told in the introduction, this film is utterly stupid, and the actors performance wasn't too good either. If I say it's as bad as an average Uve Boll film, I don't exaggerate at all! Don't watch it!<br/><br/>Ps.: By the way, to get a hint about the intelligence of the protagonists: they can't distinguish a raven from a blackbird!!!"

","This movie has no plot, no story, no point.

That's it, no further development.<br/><br/>This plot is so stupid that neither Hitchcock nor the writers bothered to come up with any reason or explanation as to why/how the birds' sudden super-intelligence and organized hatred of humans. Why not be creative and argue that, let's say a virus causes the birds to crave human flesh?<br/><br/>All we're given is a drawn out series of pointless, unexplained, meaningless bird attacks on characters that we know nothing about and don't care about. Instead of plot development, we get cool camera angles and scare tactics, -which, by the way fall flat because without a score even the potentially frightening scenes are simply blasé. How could Hitchcock not use music for effect after the success of Psycho's shower scene? <br/><br/>On top of all this, Hitchcock used paintings and blue screens throughout the entire movie because he hated shooting on location. It shows. The Birds, in my opinion is -dare I say like its director- a fake."

The attacks escalate and soon Mitch, Melanie and their friends are fighting against birds who attack and kill for no reason...<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue is awkward and it goes on way too long but this is one of Hitchcock's most frightening films. It's beautifully shot and everything looks perfect. The only real debits are the length and Hedren's lousy acting (she was beautiful--but no actress). Taylor gives out a good performance and Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are excellent in strong supporting roles. Still, I have trouble watching this movie.<br/><br/>I love horror films and pride myself on being able to sit through anything but I get horrified watching this film. Children are attacked twice--I seriously draw the line at films that have children being hurt. The sequences at the birthday party and (especially) the school (with the infamous jungle gym bit) are just harrowing. Seeing screaming children running in terror as birds peck at them them is not fun. But then it isn't supposed to be. Also Hedren being attacked is even worse. The poor actress had a bunch of birds tied to her by nylon rope--when the birds tried to fly away they couldn't and, naturally, attacked Hedren. They shot that for THREE DAYS until Hedren had a complete nervous breakdown. Knowing this makes the scene even harder to watch. And the discovery of Pleshette's body is hard too. Some people have complained that no reason was given for the birds attacking but seriously--what reason COULD they give?<br/><br/>A strong, frightening film but one of Hitch's best horror films.

There is a stupid exchange with the cop when he interrupts Taylor with ""how old is she (Taylor's sister)?"". Why is the sheriff skeptical? Were the birds attacking Taylor & co of all people? Why didn't the sparrows attack when they got in through the chimney; because they're smaller they're less violent?! Come on... Why did Hedren decide to get the children out of the school when the birds gathered outside? Shouldn't it be the most basic of all reasoning to stay inside where it's safer?! There was no previous indication that Hedren's character has an I.Q. lower than 4 - which would be the only sort of intelligence which would explain that daft decision. And why did she react so slowly to the gradual gathering of the birds in the school park?? After all, she'd been attacked two times before that! The gov't is unsure whether to send an army?! Not only that: nothing and no one gets sent to the town in spite of knowledge of bird attacks!! This movie hasn't been thought through at all; the illogic is everywhere. If some unknown director had done this crap, it would never have received nearly as many good reviews as it otherwise did. But just because it's Hitchcock, it doesn't get justly regarded as a dumb horror film about birds. I liked the parrots acting peculiarly in the car, but that's about it.<br/><br/>If you want a truly silly analysis about the ""deeper"" meanings behind this turd of a film, check out Slavoj Zizek's rants in his documentary ""A Pervert's Guide To Cinema""."

The whole premise of the movie is not a bad idea, I don't think. But it's ruined by the terrible acting, and the complete and utter lack of any suspense or scares whatsoever. This movie is so bad that it's actually funny. Plus, it has some of the dumbest and most annoying characters in the history of motion pictures. This movie is an atrocious monstrosity, one of the most overrated movies ever, and it should never be seen again by anyone for the rest of eternity! bye."

","The story that unfolds before we have any ornithological incidents is a fun meet cute feisty flirtation that establishes what our protagonists are all about.
The horror is subtle and understated without any fanfare. It's strange that modern horror tries too hard to jump scare us into oblivion when the blueprint is still here for all to learn from. Give me this over your Nuns or Annabelles any day of the week!"

","Normally I adore Hitchcock, but this film...  Maybe it was scary when it was released, but today the only thing to notice are the horrible special effects and ridiculous story line.  This Apocalyptic film was not in the least suspenseful, just hard to stay awake through.  And the ending? Whatever feeling it was supposed to leave me with, I'm sure it wasn't supposed to be disgust.  The movie's theme and the character's interaction was slightly thought provoking, but not enough to make it well done. Interesting idea, but I'd have to say it's one of Hitchcock's most obvious failures.  Especially when viewed in modern context.  The only thing worse is that they made a Birds II !"

","Although not his final film, this was Hitchcock's final masterpiece, full of fascinating cinematic ideas, some realised better than others, but considering the difficulties he set himself in this movie, well before our time's all-pervasive CGI, most of the hundreds of trick shots work out amazingly well.<br/><br/>The brittle female lead was given to a strangely brittle first-timer, who acquits herself well - certainly a great deal better than she did in her (and Hitch's) next picture, MARNIE, in which the title character's complexities eluded her grasp. Melanie Daniels in THE BIRDS is much less of an acting challenge, although the role proved to be an endurance test, especially in the infamous, dazzlingly edited final bird attack.<br/><br/>The rest of cast do sterling work, with a substantial contribution from Jessica Tandy and a noteworthy one from Doreen Lang.<br/><br/>The element of the film that still feels wonderfully experimental is the soundscape of bird screeches, wing flaps and tweets. Way, way ahead of its time."

","I have an unwritten list of movies I've always wanted to see, just not bad enough to put any effort into watching. They'll usually pop up on television some night when I've got nothing better to do and I'll finally sit and watch. Sometimes this turns out well, like FIGHT CLUB, when I kick myself for not seeing the movie sooner. And sometimes it doesn't work out well at all for anyone involved.<br/><br/>Turner Classic Movies was doing a Hitchcock thing yesterday, and I'm the sort of person for whom Hitchcock films can go either way. I love PSYCHO, I had no strong feelings either way on REAR WINDOW, and I honestly don't even remember 99% if NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Anyway, I'd never seen THE BIRDS, so I sat down and watched it last night.<br/><br/>THE BIRDS has officially joined THE VILLAGE and WEST SIDE STORY as one of the most monumentally STUPID movies I've ever had the 'joy' of sitting the entire way through.<br/><br/>Film blasphemy? Maybe. But what's Hitchcock gonna do about it? Come back from the dead to give me a slight backhand slap in the face? Maybe. I'll keep you posted.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am of the opinion that there is a fine line between building suspense and boring the living crap out of me. Sometimes a movie can be boring but still entertain with cinematography, like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. I waited that entire movie for some sort of story or plot line that never happened, but at least it was pretty to look at.<br/><br/>I spent so much of THE BIRDS waiting for something to actually happen that when it did, and by 'it' I'm referring to the guy standing in the puddle of gas who dropped his match and burst into flames, I honestly laughed out loud. It's just, 85% of this movie was just filler drudge I didn't need to see. Like people driving, parking, getting out of the car and walking to the next scene. Was there an editor shortage in 1963? That's not suspense, that's tedium.<br/><br/>And you know, I'm fine with the fact that there's never an explanation offered for why the birds go nuts, that was okay. What I can't buy is how dang dumb every single character had to be about it. Hey look, a flock of birds is going to attack us. What should we do? Oh, I know, let's go outside and run around. Come on. I mean, come on. They're BIRDS. Just swat 'em down and step on 'em. They've got hollow bones and weigh less than a pound.<br/><br/>And when the main character thinks she hears birds in the house, after everything that's just happened, and goes off on her own to investigate, and then finds a room that sounds like there's birds in it, so she manages to shut herself inside and then get attacked by birds... Frankly, she deserved to die. Though I really don't buy that you can be pecked to death instantly by birds.<br/><br/>And how do we make our harrowing escape? Uh, the birds that just tried pretty darn hard to kill everyone are gonna just sit and watch while the movie's hero spends twenty minutes pulling the car up and walking everyone out the front door in slow motion, and then we'll just drive away. The end.<br/><br/>Wait, what? <br/><br/>I will say one thing for THE BIRDS, it has the absolutely most GIGANTIC telephones I've ever seen on film. And they paid for the phones, so darn it, they were gonna use 'em. This movie would've been shortened by 35-40 minutes if you eliminated the pointless phone conversations. It would've been over an hour shorter if touch-tone phones had replaced rotary dials by then.<br/><br/>So anyway, yeah, THE BIRDS. Incredibly retarded movie."
"mdonath","6","7","11","2 July 2001"," Two bad scenes ruin the credibility
","I like this film, especially the clever beginning.  However, two unbelievable scenes stretch credulity a bit too far.  The first is when Suzanne Pleshette is found dead in front of her house after pushing a completely unhurt little girl into the house.  One would think that if she could get the little girl inside the house without a scratch then she could also manage to get herself inside.<br/><br/>Along the same vein is the infamous attic scene, which supposedly took four days for Hitchcock to shoot.  He certainly didn't spend those four days trying to make the scene believable!  Tippi Hedren blunders into an attic full of attacking birds.  She gropes interminably for the doorknob but can only manage to collapse in front of the door.  Come on!  These are seagulls and crows!  Turn the knob and go out the way you came in girl.<br/><br/>The ending scene and closing shot are great.  The birds are most ominous when they are not attacking."
"cmdev86","1","16","31","14 February 2012"," You should watch this movie whether you think it's a great thriller or not.
","Tippi arrives in Bodega Bay in a fur and an expensive sports car with only a nightie in a paper bag for luggage. She spends the rest of the film in the same outfit for what must be more than a few days. That's just the tip of the iceberg folks for probability. Fine acting by some classical greats. Suzanne Pleshette and Jessica Tandy are so young you won't recognize them. And Charles McGraw in a very small role. Curiously, all the small roles in this Northern California coastal town have New England accents. This film is great if you believe that humans are the baddies and the cause of all the ecological disasters and that someday birds of all different kinds of feather will unite and wreak revenge on humankind. If you don't feel this way you may still really enjoy it for a lot of giggles. Did you ever see birds peck their way through a solid wood door? Well get ready. I hope this doesn't disqualify my review for spoiler or spiteful remarks. You may truly enjoy it as a classic Hitch thriller. Or, if you are like me, you may say to you self, ""What was he thinking?""... and enjoy it giggling yourself silly."

","I just COMMENT on what happens , WITHOUT ACTUALLY DESCRIBING IT. Safe if you want to see what ""TYPE"" of ending the movie has.<br/><br/>The movie's ending is very important to me for judging it. It should give a meaning to the rest of it. Unfortunately, in ""The Birds"" there is no such ending. That makes the story unsatisfying as a plot, no matter how rich and climactic it is. Sometimes the end leaves you wonder about several explanations or outcomes of the story. Some other times you expect something but you get something even better. In this movie the ending just leaves you wondering ""Why did I spend the last couple of hours watching this, waiting for something to happen?"". If you like movie endings, you will be disappointed.

"LovecraftLass","10","2","2","19 December 2019"," It seems cliche to give it a ten but it is that good
","The Birds is one of those movies that I've always heard of, know of, read of but never watched it. I finally got it to watch it and I was really surprised. I really haven't seen too many of Hitchcock' movies except Psycho and Rebecca. The Birds is based on the short story by Daphne Du Maurier. I have never read it so I don't really know what might have been added or not. I will be reading it, however, to find out.<br/><br/>It is a very slow starter. Whether you'll find the characters interesting enough to make it worth the wait is up to you. I thought they were interesting and a lot of the dialogue had so much subtext that I was constantly intrigued. I thought the character of Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) was very interesting. My thoughts about her evolved throughout the movie and quite naturally. It didn't feel like the movie was forcing her sad, sad story down my throat to make me like her. Mitch felt very generic handsome male and the little girl, Cathy, felt off. She looked about thirteen but acted like she was supposed to be six. I just kind of wrote that off a the child acting of the time. I love the character of Annie (Suzanne Pleschette) and loved every interaction she had with Melanie.<br/><br/>The shots were absolutely awesome. I honestly wasn't expecting much from the Birds themselves. They were done very well and some of the shots with them were genuinely creepy. For instance, Melanie is waiting outside of the school, having a cigarette, while waiting for Annie (oh how times have changed). The shot cuts between her and the playground behind her. First there's one bird. Cut to Melanie. There's more birds. And more. And it's in absolute silence which just seems so unnatural for birds that it enhances the creepiness of it.<br/><br/>Another shot that I really loved was near the end of the movie. We learn about how Melanie's mother left her and her father. There is also some very believable tension between Mitch's mother and Melanie. At the end (no spoilers, don't worry) Mitch's mother is holding Melanie close to her and the look Melanie gives her is so sweet. It doesn't feel disingenuous, it doesn't feel forced or overdone, it's just a very sweet moment.<br/><br/>I would recommend it if you don't mind a slow burn. But, really, with Hitchcock are you expecting a fast-paced gore-fest?"

","Hitchcock directed many suspense films.  In fairness to his impressive body of film work, only a handful is consistently cited as all 'round classics, and qualify as emblematic cinema 'templates' upon which modern filmmakers can draw much of the basics when it comes to putting together a practical thriller (of almost any movie genre, to be completely honest).  His earlier works are sometimes mentioned in conjunction with his more popular ones.<br/><br/>The Birds marked a fixed alternate attitude towards B movies in general (until '63, they were not quite the marketable successes they are today), horror movies and even the more mainstream 'noir thrillers of the 1940s (such as those starring the likes of Jimmy Stewart, Ray Milland and Cary Grant; all of these actors starred in at least one Hitchcock film). Modern directors (like De Palma and Spielberg) owe a bit of gratitude to the late `Master of Suspense.'<br/><br/>'Birds' marked a definitive breakthrough in movies that dealt with the `Nature Gone Amok' thriller themes many genre fans have become all too familiar with in the past quarter-century.  Without this one, films like `Frogs' (a camp personal favorite of mine, which works on a few notable levels), `Jaws,' and the more recent `Bats' would have been only inferior products of entertainment, had it not been for the various filmmaking talents of those involved with the 1963 picture.<br/><br/>The plot of Birds centers on a flighty, somewhat daredevil socialite Melanie Daniels and Mitch Brenner (an initial 'mama's boy') whom she becomes romantically involved with.  Together, this unlikely pair (she's beautiful and he's handsome, but there is no obvious chemistry to link them as an item) do their darned best to shoo away an awesome flock of dangerous birds (crows, seagulls and finches) that have chosen to repeatedly convene and descend upon Mitch's Pacific coast hometown of Bodega Bay.<br/><br/>Overall the film is good. However, I would like someone to religiously do a remake and (in this rare case) benefit from the far better CGI FX we are more familiar with today.  The FX in the '63 film deserves a few refinements, and although they were breakthrough achievements for its time, they can do with a welcome improvement here and there.  Birds features a few interesting set-pieces, and any director willing to take the 'remake' challenge had better stick to them, if a modern version is to experience a grain of the original's success.<br/><br/>The supporting, Secondary Plot (The Mitch-Melanie Romance; however incidental and inferior this plot may initially seem) should not be tampered with in any way.  It serves as a sort-of bizarre counterpoint to the truly unprovoked, concerted bird attacks which befall them and the Bodegan citizens.<br/><br/>See Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" and analyze it thoroughly (Don't bother watching the belated and pointless made-for-cable sequel, ""Lands End: The Birds II"").  Film critics have not said quite the right things about this one... Maybe these professionals don't take kindly to having their 'feathers rustled.'"
"Pearsey","8","18","37","17 October 1999"," A film that stays interesting through repeated viewings
","It's interesting how many of the previous user comments have discerned different aspects of this film.   Besides the horror elements of the movie, the relationships between Mitch and his mother (who he calls ""Darling""), Annie Hayworth and Melanie Daniels and Melanie and Mrs. Brenner are plenty to keep the viewer interested.  <br/><br/>Although the movie did not have a musical score, there was one song in the film if you noticed.  When Tippi Hedren plays the piano in the Brenner home, the strains of a song familiar as the closing theme of the PBS ""Stargazer"" show are heard.   <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed Suzanne Pleshette's performance as Annie Hayworth and the entire diner scene with the various viewpoints of the townfolk on the ""bird"" situation.  The overhead scene of the gulls swooping down on the burning gas station is incredible to me.  The two deaths due to bird attacks are done in a way to produce maximum shock.  <br/><br/>These are some of the reasons why this movie doesn't wear out after repeated viewings."
"tedg","Null","12","23","21 October 2000"," Reality Flies Off
","I am not an appreciator of Hitchcock, at least not recently as I wade though reviewings of his work.<br/><br/>But this film is different. Many of his films dance on the edge of the surreal, and deal with a person or people swept up in events beyond their control. But here he tips well into another world and does it so artfully that we don't notice. I recall the film being touted as a horror film when first released, but it is not so. Horror depends on reality -- the more likely, the more threatening. Terror is another thing.<br/><br/>What is so skillful here is that no one behaves as people normally would, not even close. Yet no one remarks on that fact. Such a notice would be automatic in today's infatuation with irony and self-reference. So what makes this film so intriguing is that it is entirely without irony, non-modern even in the sense common in the 60's. This effect is amplified by the `studio' style of camera-work: stationary cameras and flat sets. Essentially all dialog is indoors.<br/><br/>Further: huge mysteries remain at the end of the film, about the cause of the supernatural, about the Oedipal characters, and of course about what happens next. World, people, story are all left open. How intelligent.<br/><br/>A side remark: once again in a Hitchcock film, minor actors outshine the main characters. But no matter. The effects, as with the sets, are cheesy, but rather than detracting, this adds to the unsettling unreality of the work. <br/><br/>This film is pretty disturbing all around."
"HSauer","8","12","23","6 October 1999"," A fable, a parable, an allegory...
","Hitchcock bragged that The Birds was pure fantasy, with no connection to real life (as we know it).  I've seen this movie a few times and I still wonder what it ""means,"" if it has a specific meaning.  It might just be a horror film about preternatural killer birds, but I humbly suggest that it might, in a sense, be an allegory about the Nuclear Paranoia of the era. Not an exact allegory like ""Pilgrim's Progress,"" but perhaps a parable, or a fable if you like, with the birds standing in for all those forces ready to kill innocent people for no good reason.  ""The Birds"" is so richly suggestive that there's an Oedipal theme as well, and some hints that Mitch isn't a very admirable guy, and so on... very Kubrickian, but predating ""2001"" by 4 or 5 years.  It's a film that can simply entertain, or frighten, or hold one's interest, without begging for interpretation.  But it's fun to wonder what the writer and director were thinking, and how much the actors/actresses knew of the artistic intent of the filmmakers.  It's interesting too that after ""Psycho,"" with its classic musical score, Hitchcock made ""The Birds"" a 2-hour film with no music - except the squawks, clucks and cries of The Birds.  Wonderful picture."

","What I love about this film is that it`s so understated . There is absolutely no attempt whatsoever to explain why the birds are turning against humanity , indeed there`s a scene in the cafe where a character points out that bird species joining together to wage war against the human race would be impossible , and the concept is totally ridiculous but Hitchcock and screenwriter Evan Hunter ( Using the basic premise of Du Maurier`s short story - the screenplay is almost totally original ) manage to leave the unsettling thought that this might just happen one day.<br/><br/>The film is slightly dated in some ways , most notably the FX which are sometimes obvious back projection , but this was made in 1963 don`t forget . And THE BIRDS does contain some classic scenes like the discussions in the diner , the downbeat ending and the bit where the woman walks into the farmhouse and finds .... no I won`t spoil it for you .

","The Birds is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screenplay by Evan Hunter from the story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. It stars Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Cartwright and Ethel Griffies. Cinematography is by Robert Burks and editing by George Tomasini.<br/><br/>Mother's love? Better to be ditched or loved?<br/><br/>When animals attack! The only outright horror movie that Alfred Hitchcock ever directed, The Birds sees the great man get the utmost terror from something so amiable in our lives - Birds! Modern day critics can hark on about it being dated all they like, it still doesn't detract from what a frenzied experience ""The Birds"" can still be - let alone what it did for cinema goers in 1963! Admittedly upon small screen ventures too much is missed or under enhanced, which is a crying shame.<br/><br/>But it isn't dark Annie! It's a full moon.<br/><br/>Plotting is simple in trajectory terms. Hip socialite Melanie Daniels (Hedren) has a friendly vocal joust in a pet shop with handsome Mitch Brenner (Taylor), the result of which sees Melanie, on a mischievous whim, buy a couple of lovebirds and set off for Mitch's weekend retreat out in Bodega Bay to deliver them as a show of devilish womanhood. Upon arrival in Bodega Bay, though, Melanie seems to be the spark for the birds in the area to start attacking humans, and pretty soon the attacks escalate and intensify...<br/><br/>Hitchcock and Hunter offer up no reasons or answers for what occurs in Bodega Bay (to keep it murky we learn late on via radio that other towns become affected), and famously the ending is open ended as well, forcing the audience to unravel ideas themselves. There's no musical score in the film, thus Hitchcock gets the terror and tension out of editing, bird effects and unholy sounds. The pacing is also a key area, it's a good hour before things go decidedly nasty, the wait keeps the viewer on edge, we seriously get to know the principal characters (the actors worked well by Hitch) and then the terror is unleashed. Perfect.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's skill at staging a memorable scene is well evident here. The climbing frame that sees one crow arrive, cutaway as Melanie smokes on a bench, back to the frame and now it's four crows, cutaway, back, and five crows - eight - then a ""murder of crows"". The birds first attack at the birthday party, the telephone kiosk, gas station mayhem, the birds swooping into view above the school roof and the POV viewpoint as we join a bird hovering above a town under siege, all great scenes, as is the crowning glory that is the eerie silence that accompanies the edge of your seat finale.<br/><br/>Motifs are plentiful, from Mothers to sexuality, from broken crockery - to glass - to abandonment fears, Hitch has fun, especially with the human interactions, or lack of in certain scenes. It's a film that cries out for analysis, such is the director's want, in turn it's a riveting horror picture and a crafty enigma. It sounded daft as a basic idea for a film, and some must have thought Hitchcock had missed the boat of the creature feature boom of the 50s. Yet ""The Birds"" stands tall and proud as a damn fine piece of film from a true maestro of his craft, one of his last true classics and still today, over 50 years after its release, the film provokes theory discussion and visual terror in equal measure. 9/10"

","Melanie Daniels meets Mitch Brenner at a pet shop where he has come to buy some birds for his young sister.  They have a conflict of words but he sparks her interest and she travels up to his small town to see him again. Daniels stays in the town for the weekend despite the tension between her and Brenner's mother.  However this is not the only source of worry as the locals begin to notice that the birds are acting out of character and showing signs of aggression.<br/><br/>I came to this film because my mother mentioned she was scared of birds as a result of seeing this when she was young.  So I went for it with highs hopes that were not disappointed on the whole.  The basic plot is just that  basic.  But it allows plenty of disturbing scenes of bird attack as well as a nice slow build.  The effects have dated and it doesn't look as impressive now, but it still has an impact.  More importantly the film has a rich side-plot about themes that carry over from Psycho about mother's and sons. Not quite as far out as that film, this still has plenty of meat for anyone looking to analyse it further.<br/><br/>Hedren is OK in the lead but I found her to be just giving the same performance as every `dangerous blonde' does in Hitchcock films.  But she is the predator of the film and she does it pretty well.  Taylor is a good stock B movie actor type but looking at him I couldn't help picturing Cary Grant doing the role and it took away from Taylor.  Tandy looked old even then, but she does really well with a complex role of the mother.  Pleshette is a little annoying but still ok<br/><br/>Most people see this as a horror film, but it is much more than that.  The ending is quite low key but it worked well with the overall feeling of menace in the birds, but it's worth remembering that this is not the ending Hitchcock wanted.  His first choice, the Golden Gate bridge covered in birds, couldn't be done due to a tight budget.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great bit of Hitchcock that works on several levels.  The horror will have you sweating when walking through groups of pigeons in city centres and the subtext will keep you in the pub for several hours."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Sure, I have seen this film many times over the years, but just couldn't miss the chance to see it on the big screen courtesy of Fathom Events and Cinemark. Many critics consider this to be Alfred Hitchcock's last great film, and still others dismiss it as a lark. Hitchcock is known for his sterling career of suspense films, though this one is really categorized as horror.<br/><br/>The writing pedigree is beyond reproach as it's based on a story by Daphne du Maurier with a screenplay from Evan Hunter. Dame du Maurier is considered one of the best writers of the twentieth century, and you might recognize Mr. Hunter's pen name - Ed McBain. He was quite famous for his detective stories (including the foundation for TV's ""Hill Street Blues"").<br/><br/>There are really two parts to the film. The set-up involves some playful grown-up flirting between lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren). The scene in the pet store is a treat to watch thanks to the banter between two attractive, intelligent, confident people. The tie-in with the love birds for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright) is simple, yet brilliant. The extreme playfulness takes Hedren to Bodega Bay, California via her sleek Astin Martin.<br/><br/>Hitchcock includes his common elements of feminine mystique as Mitch Brenner's world revolves around his omnipresent mother (Jessica Tandy), his younger sister (Cartwright), his ex-lover (Suzanne Pleschette) and now a new love interest in Hedren. There are some terrific scenes between Tandy (26 years prior to Driving Miss Daisy) and Hedren, but my favorites are those with Hedren and Pleschette. Pleschette was an underrated actress and is best known for her role in TV's ""The Bob Newhart Show"". Watching her face as Hedren talks on the phone to Taylor is classic frustration from an ex-lover.<br/><br/>The second half of the film involves the terror of the bird attacks. Of course, the infamous scene of the kids running down the street being pecked by birds will make your skin crawl, and the scene where Hedren gets attacked in the bedroom is horrific and sends her into a breakdown. I really enjoy the scenes with the townspeople in the café. Some wonderful interchanges as they each tell bird stories. My favorite bird sequence in the film involves the empty playground equipment slowly taken over by birds as Hedren sits on the bench. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the film is the cast. Ms. Hedren (mother of Melanie Griffith) is still acting today (in her 80's), though I have never considered her anywhere near the level of actress of other Hitchcock blondes: Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Doris Day, etc. Rod Taylor is also in his 80's now and was last seen on screen as Winston Churchill in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds. Jessica Tandy had a long career and is best known for Driving Miss Daisy, and Veronica Cartwright went on to star in such films as Alien and The Right Stuff). The supporting cast is filled with familiar faces including a very young Morgan Brittany (""Dallas""), Malcolm Atterbury (as the Deputy), Ruth McDevitt (as the pet store owner) and one of my favorite actor names, Doodles Weaver (Sigourney's uncle).<br/><br/>As you watch the film, you will notice that there is no traditional score. Instead, we are treated to an assortment of bird effects which cue us in to the level of danger. Hitchcock was always a master of guiding the viewer right along the path he wanted. This film has some unusual pacing and a few wide shots that are quite rare for his films. To me, it proves that he was always experimenting, yet with an innate ability to know how the audience would react. A true craftsmen. (www.moviereviewsfromthedark.wordpress.com)"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","14","30","6 December 2006"," The Good & Bad Of 'The Birds'
","This is one of the landmark films where if you saw it in the theater when it was released, you never forgot the experience. What I'll never forget - and this is true, so help me - is that moments after I left the theater, a couple birds swooped over my head. I thought I'd have a heart attack at the age of 18!! I never forgot that. It still creeps me out.<br/><br/>Since then, I've seen the film at least a half dozen times, both on TV, on VHS and on DVD and always found it fascinating....even 40-some years later. Sure, it doesn't pack the wallop it did when it came out, but it's still scary enough with unique, memorable scenes.<br/><br/>THE GOOD - Those scenes with the birds becoming larger and larger in numbers while sitting on the jungle gym bars, or the telephone wires are some of the most memorable in movie history. Who can forget them, especially if one first saw this film at a young and impressionable age? The suspense and the terror that director Alfred Hitchcock mounted with these scenes are almost unparalleled in film history, so kudos to him for that. Also, even though the special-effects are dated, they were still good enough to be effective today. The birds attacking the kids can still look plenty real. The ending also was very suspenseful and a very good one. This movie is certainly one of the most unique ever made.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, I'm sorry Tippi Hedren never made it in the business with that classically-beautiful face and pleasant demeanor. Her acting seemed okay to me, so I don't know what the deal was with her career....or lack of one. Rod Taylor, meanwhile, was fine and Suzanne Pleshette was good in a low-key role. Viewing this in '90s, it was interesting to see such a young Veronica Cartwright, someone, of course, I was unfamiliar with back in the 1960s. <br/><br/>THE BAD - A lot of these pertain to my personal beliefs, not to the film-making. For instance, I can't stand shrill, hysterical women so Jessica Tandy's role in here as the crabby old protective mother of star Rod Taylor is extremely irritating to me and takes away from the enjoyment of the movie. I have no problem with the rest of the major players, as I mentioned above.<br/><br/>I did not appreciate the usual cheap shot at Christians, which was becoming more and more frequent in the 1960s. The only ""religious"" person in the movie was some wild-eyed doomsday predictor - and drunk - at a restaurant. I'm not surprised Hitchcock, a biased pagan himself, included that in the film. It wasn't untypical of him, and it wasn't there by accident. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes were too talky and melodramatic, mostly those with Hedren and either Taylor or Tandy but then, too much action would have spoiled the suspense, so I just put up with some of those annoying-dialog scenes and wait for the birds to re-appear!<br/><br/>ONE LAST NOTE: When are they going to produce a good DVD of this film? The disc I owned was almost identical to the VHS, a very poor transfer. I got rid of it, but would be happy to reacquire this film with a sharp DVD transfer. It certainly deserves one."

","Classic Hitchcock that starts out as an interesting flirtation between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren in her first credited role. She really looked much more experience in this film that won her a Golden Globe.<br/><br/>The film itself got an Oscar nomination for effects.<br/><br/>Along with Taylor and Hedren, the film featured a fine Jessica Tandy, and Suzanne Pleshette, who was nominated for a Golden Globe the previous year for Most Promising Newcomer, even though she had been acting for six years and had almost 30 roles under her belt. Of course, she would go on to fame in ""The Bob Newhart Show."" And, of course, there was little Veronica Cartwright (Alien, ""The X-Files""), who played the daughter.<br/><br/>Things got scary quickly and the special effects were amazing."

","It's hard to know what director Alfred Hitchcock, or authors Daphne du Maurier and Evan Hunter, were up to with The Birds. I've read a variety of explanations of the film and story, none of which quite makes sense. Not that a movie has to, but one would like to know what the director and author had on their minds when making it. The story itself concerns an unexplained series of attacks by birds on a small California coastal community. There is a romance, a subplot or two, but that's about it. A number of people get pecked to death, a gas station blows up, but the focal point of the movie, once it gets moving, is the birds themselves, and when or whether they will attack again. The acting by Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette and Jessica Tandy, is good if hardly outstanding, though to be fair, they don't have that much to work with. By today's standards the special effects are fairly primitive, and one has to suspend disbelief now and again when some of the obviously unreal birds fly into view.<br/><br/>If it belongs to any genre, I would say that The Birds falls under the general rubric of what, for want of a better term, I would call the Anglo-Saxon Anxiety Film, which is to say a movie that features mostly WASP characters under attack from foreigners or outside forces in general, pulling together, often in some isolated outpost, where they make one last stand against the ""invaders"". The Anglo Anxiety film goes back to the earliest days of the movies, and includes many if not most westerns, especially those that feature white settlers and/or cavalry under attack from Indians. There are AAF elements in many horror movies, some gangster films (look what those awful foreigners are doing to our cities!), and World War II movies, especially those concerning the Japanese. A good deal of fifties sci-fi can be viewed in this light, especially The Thing and its various spaceman successors. By the sixties, the anxiety became more intense, and also more diffuse, often turning into black comedy (Dr. Strangelove, Rosemary's Baby). The Birds is Hitchcock's take on this Last Stand At the Alamo genre, and he makes the most of the improbable situation, even including an incongruously English woman ornithologist, who uncannily resembles Hitch in drag, to explain that birds are really are friends, and wish harm on no one. Could this be the director poking fun at Americans? We'll never know, of course, though it's worth pointing out that the great man remained a British subject, was knighted in his twilight years, and died in England."

","the birds by Alfred Hitchcock is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. to start of the movie is not realistic because the setting follows the story of two people and when the girl basically stalks him. when he invites her to his little sisters birthday party they get attacked by birds. i know even though this movie is old the graphics are so bad. you will say to yourself yep thats a green screen and it takes away from the horror. the actors themselves do a terrible job acting they don't even make the performance convincing. out of all the movie was so bad and i don't recommend anyone go see this movie. in the end i wish i could have ended up like the farmer in the beginning of the movie with no eyes at the mercy of the birds"

","An unusual picture this, one of the earliest examples of animal horror, and the only Alfred Hitchcock film with supernatural elements. Still, atypical as its subject matter is, the business of building up tension and thrilling the audience was by now simply a case of going through the motions for Master of Suspense Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The line between horror and thriller was always vague in Hitch's work, since while most of his pictures are generally categorised as the latter, they always work upon scaring and unsettling the viewer. It is unsurprising then that despite the mysterious nature of the bird attacks the director still uses many of the same techniques as he would to build up suspense over a murderer on the prowl. There's usually a period of silence, or at least without dialogue in the build-up to each attack – this is in contrast to the extended scenes of discussion after the tension of a bird attack has been diffused. There's one scene where Veronica Cartwright is distraught after an attack, but she remains silent while there is still danger around, beginning to talk only once they are safe in the car. This switching between normal human chatter and eerie silence or bird noises is really effective in the pacing of the movie. There's also a great use of space, for example in the famous scene with the crows outside the school. There's a shot of Tippi Hedren with the jungle gym, as yet empty, behind her. The empty space is conspicuously against normal cinematic convention and we expect something to fill it. Later on we start to become nervous and suspicious of every empty spot as a potential source of attack.<br/><br/>An honourable mention should also go to the amazing process shots devised by Ub Iwerks, the original and unsung genius of the Disney studios. His trickery with the layers of birds effect is more or less seamless in credibility, unlike the rather clunky-looking bluescreen shots that Hitchcock seriously overuses here.<br/><br/>Evan Hunter's screenplay structures the bird war phenomenon around a story of love and jealousy, and if this is to work as a proper counterpoint then there need to be some decent acting performances amongst all the special effects and suspenseful technique. Although his is not often referenced, I feel the best performance here is that of Rod Taylor. He seems to react most plausibly the birds, giving a portrayal of a man who acts best under pressure. Suzanne Pleshette is very good too, subtly showing the audience her hidden thoughts on the situation between Taylor and Hedren. Jessica Tandy does a fine job as well, although unfortunately in her best scene (where she tells Hedren about her late husband) she is shot from a rather aloof angle and she isn't really shown to her advantage – perhaps because Hitch didn't want to unbalance the bird war theme by getting too maudlin at this point.<br/><br/>And to be honest, the human side of the story could have done with some more work. The way Taylor and Hedren are initially set up does not make them especially likable, and in many ways seems a little far-fetched, in basically what amounts to stalking, with friendly locals all willing to give away someone's details to a complete stranger. And while the build-up to individual bird attacks is masterful, the bird war as a whole peaks too early, and there are some disappointments later in the picture. The Birds has a great idea at its heart and some fabulous individual moments, but this isn't enough. All in all, it's a technical picture, not a good piece of storytelling."

","This film is mainly a drawn-out drama. It deals with two main protagonists who meet by chance but then swiftly become the love interests.<br/><br/>Exactly why there is a developing bird onslaught is really second to the physical events themselves, and how the main characters deal with the attack, (in their own unquestioning fashion). Sure, there are some crackpot theorists in the diner, (as well as an unconvincable ornithologist, who in my view should have been the FIRST to notice any unusual bird behavior, not the last), but nobody really helps the viewer out.<br/><br/>There are some good moments too. The first hints of unusual avian behavior are curious and quite unexpected. Also, the feeling of seclusion and isolation in Bodego Bay are sufficient and quite appropriate, even if standard film-making techniques.<br/><br/>You get the feeling that this story is a complete dramatic cul-de-sac. Any meaning or grand scheme behind the ""climax"" of the film would only invalidate almost everything else that happened previously. I for one cannot think of any explanation(s) that would not make me regret the two-hour sitting. Can you?"

","With so many Alfred Hitchcock classics to choose from The Birds is one of the great master's films you can safely skip. There's nothing in this film to really grab you. There are some nice bits sprinkled throughout but it never really all adds up to much of anything. In the end, it's a frustrating and, almost unbelievably coming from Hitchcock, a downright dull film.<br/><br/>The plot, such at it is, in this film centers on a series of unexplained bird attacks in a seemingly ordinary California town. There's a little romantic intrigue, or at least there's meant to be, but that angle doesn't add much to the proceedings. Basically the movie is a lot of talk, very little action. And when the ""action"" arrives it ultimately disappoints. To the modern eye, the special effects used in The Birds appear outrageously amateurish. Many of the bird attack sequences, meant to be fearsomely frightening, instead come off as being rather silly, almost comical. Certainly not the effect Hitchcock was looking for. Meant to shock and terrorize, The Birds does no such thing. The whole enterprise falls flat.<br/><br/>There are some decent moments here and there and the cast does the best they can with what little they have to work with. So much of the dialogue seems forced and unnatural. And boy is there ever a lot of dialogue as we sit around and wait for those infernal birds to show up. In the key role of young socialite Melanie Daniels, who sets what little plot there is in motion, Tippi Hedren gives a pretty good performance. Perhaps not up to the standards of some previous Hitchcock blondes (Grace Kelly anyone?) but OK. Playing off Hedren, Rod Taylor gives a somewhat wooden performance as the object of her desire but that probably has more to do with the failings of the script than his own abilities. The rest of the cast does the best they can trying to convince us we should be terrified but it just doesn't work. In the end, when it finally appears the film might be building towards something, there is only disappointment. The Birds is a film which ultimately is going nowhere. And it takes its sweet time getting there. Hitchcock certainly had his share of triumphs. This is not one of them."

","Bodega Bay is a peaceful community in Northern California. Melanie Daniels has come to this small town trying to outsmart Mitch Brenner, the man who she had met previously at a San Francisco pet shop. Little does Melanie know what she is in for! The first indication everything is not right happens as Melanie, who is returning to the town in a small motor boat, is hit by a flying gull. Mitch, who has followed her, comes to her rescue. Melanie is invited to have dinner that night with Mitch and his family in the house across the bay. Right after dinner, they get a surprise visit through the chimney, when hundreds of birds descend on the Brenner's living room to create panic among them.<br/><br/>Melanie, who has met the young teacher, Annie Hayworth, before going to the Brenners, asks her to put her up for the night, since there are no other accommodations in town and she has been invited to attend a party for Cathy, Mitch's young sister. During the celebration, more gulls and even black crows, decide to pay them a visit that upsets the festivity. Right after that, everything turns loose in the small town. The birds are relentless in their attack; it's clear they intend to get their revenge.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" is one of the scariest films by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. For the time it was filmed, it proved to be a ground breaking movie of this genre. After more than forty years since its release, the film still delivers because Hitchcock knew how to scare his audience even with the innocent gulls and crows that turn into evil creatures bent on destruction of everything in their wake. In a way, it's ironic, as Mrs. Bundy, a woman who knew her birds explains to the people in the local restaurant, only birds of a specie flock together, never mixing with another type. Also, the vengeful birds are seen in contrast with the tamed love birds Melanie has brought, as a present, for Mitch.<br/><br/>The film works because of the genius of Hitchcock. Tippi Hedren is a perfect Hitchcock's ""blonde"". Rod Taylor is also effective as Mitch. Jessica Tandy, though, has the best moments to show her range. She goes from the stern Lydia at the beginning to one of an infinite kind when she realizes Melanie loves her son. Suzanne Pleshette is also good as Annie Hayworth. Ethel Griffies makes a wonderful Mrs. Bundy, a no-nonsense woman who can't believe sea gulls could be hurting people, at all.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" is an entertaining film that will be cherished by many Hitchcock's fans because of all the elements that went into it."

","Okay, Hitchcock does know how to build up suspense. Long before the birds first started to attack I sat anxious waiting for it to come. It didn't...until later. This kept me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>But: Characters are dull, uninteresting and simple. The love story between Melanie and Mitch couldn't interest me less. As so with the characters of Lydia, Cathy and Annie. Secondly; That birds should do something like that is just stupid, and I didn't find it scary at all. What was so very frightful about Hitchcocks earlier film, Psycho, was that that was REAL. Someone could end up like Norman Bates, actually people HAVE done so, and that scared me quite significantly. But, birds aren't psychos. It's just plain meaningless.<br/><br/>Hitchcock made, as always, a thrilling movie. The main plot with the birds, though weird, was interesting to follow. But characters were boring, ending was pointless, and it just wasn't scary at all. Horror movie? If you get freaked out by impossible happenings, be my guest, but The Birds fails for me. 4/10"

","I must confess I always wanted to watch this movie because I saw other classics of Sir Alfred Hitchcock, until I actually saw it. Really, the movie shows what a movie shouldn't ever have: extremely poor special effects and VERY sappy dialogs and situations. The plot seems to make ABSOLUTELY no sense at all: no-one knows why birds attack, if they finish attacking somehow (even at least because they're bored and/or tired). They join, they attack and they just go away no-one knowing REALLY why. Some things are good, however: the camera is quite well used in almost all scenes, and the soundtrack is really good sometimes, but both the script and the production have got a lot of flaws and lacks, something that Sir Alfred Hitchcock should not allow."
"marcin_kukuczka","10","5","9","23 November 2014"," Beyond Categories; Outstanding Impact
","Having seen THE BIRDS, you might take a stroll and accidentally notice crows flying nearby. Nobody around seems to pay attention and you feel a bit at odds with the situation. ""Are they going to attack me...?"" you think. And it is not merely Hitchcock's intention but the truly outstanding impact of great piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Based on Daphne Du Maurier's story (the author of REBECCA), the film is probably most associated with the Master of Suspense thanks to his splendid rapport with the screenwriter Evan Hunter who adapted the story to the screen. The movie's major strength lies in its flawless storytelling, buildup of tension and study of characters. That makes any viewer emotionally and intellectually involved since everything occurs to be perfectly measured and, yet, surprising. The movie does not display the mainstay themes; there is no McGuffin, there are no explanations, climaxes, explicit references. Nevertheless, it deserves to be called ""Hitchcock's last unflawed film"" (David Thomson) where, in Hitchcock's very intention to ""scare the hell out of people,"" it still haunts as ""a threat of unspeakable horror"" (Bosley Crowther, NYTimes). However, what makes it a movie beyond categories is the fact that it does not aspire to thriller but goes far beyond.<br/><br/>If it were not for the credits and the lack of music score (replaced by the sounds of birds that powerfully aid the mood), we would actually assume that we are watching some story that, on the one hand, presents to us captivating characters and, on the other hand, some theme for psychoanalysis. Mitch and Melanie meet in a rather unexpected circumstances at a birds' shop in San Francisco. Just to note that Mr Hitchcock makes his cameo performance quite soon so that we can direct our curiosity towards something else. The action moves to Bodega Bay that supplies the atmosphere with a rather English flair. There, Melanie gets to know people seemingly living together but innerly being quite closed within their angst. Mind you what brings her there to Mitch's house. A gift for his young sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) - two love birds. Crowther nicely defines them as ""one of nature's most innocent creatures and one of man's most melodious friends."" The hidden meaning of this gift, however, works as a 'contrast' for events to come. And the plot would rather develop in a natural human way where love takes over if it were not for the prophets of doom and messengers of terror, the title birds whose noises shade the chirping of the love birds.<br/><br/>Indeed, much has been said about such effective depiction of the birds' attacks. Those images are simply 'carved' in your memory and appear to create unforgettable emotions. The incredibly lasting effect predominates thanks to no explanation of why they attack. Xan Brooks in The Guardian accurately points out that the movie ""provides no answers and no escape."" We actually do not know how it all ends. There is no Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco, no trip of the escaper as it was initially planned, no additional thrills; there is as little as and as much as an image, horrifying, gloomy, and pessimistic where the aggressive intruders from the air take sovereign control over the land, over the world, conclusively. However, the horror depicted in those images, including the victims of the attacks, is merely a miniature of what the film really offers to more cautious viewers, cautious to details and analysis. For if the thrill may become dated as more decades pass, this aspect predominates as essentially timeless.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: The rather uncomplicated nature of the plot goes with a truly sophisticated, complex study of the characters. The movie's triumph are the narrative elements which Crowther labeled as ""clear"" and ""naturalistic"" because that provides extraordinary insight into the personalities portrayed. Melanie is, on the one hand, a typical Hitchcock blonde - beautiful, sophisticated, a woman of appeal you might easily be taken with and, on the other hand, a character of naiveness and freshness; an outsider for others not feeling totally at ease in Bodega Bay. That odd feeling is intensified when she meets the teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette) and discovers that she used to be Mitch's girlfriend. Mitch delivers certain features of a mama's boy (Hitchcock's fertile theme) but appears to be sympathetic. What emerges as embodiment of angst and fear of loneliness is his mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy), a character of constant 'presence' and permanent 'distance.' But for any viewer fond of social significance, one scene is a masterwork.<br/><br/>The TIDES RESTAURANT scene alone is the sufficient reason for seeing the film. A display of various characters at the face of a problem. The true problem, however, lies in the fact that they either refuse to admit a problem or exaggerate it. There is hardly anyone who would offer us something objective, realistic. There is Mrs Bundy (Ethel Griffies), an ornithologist who embodies skepticism of a scientist and pride of human mind ready to give the answer to anything. She builds all her theses on reason. Although she becomes intellectually involved in the possible assumptions, she does not in the possible solutions. On the totally opposite point, there is a religious devout, a distortion of religion's essence whose prophetic affiliations lead him to one condensed utterance: ""This is the end of the world."" Both of them contribute very little to the situation. In between, amidst the gore of talks, comes a more 'humane' personality of a mother afraid for her kids and a man who finds so simple a solution...In all, some of them resort merely to words, others to deeds and media...highly measured and condensed informing. What occurs, however, is the fact that nature stands above human reasoning. Furthermore, it may indeed scare the hell out of us...<br/><br/>And that thought should, perhaps, accompany us while watching THE BIRDS - an outstanding movie of visual, intellectual, emotional impact beyond categories evocative of something uncommon, scary, memorable."
"jackosurfing14","9","5","9","17 August 2012"," Hitchcock defines a genre......twice!
","If you look at the range of movies Hitchcock has completed, there is no denying that his favorite films revolved around the concepts of the thriller, with the occupation of a murder at the center of his stories. With this continuation of love for the perfect murder, it seemed only matter of time before Hitchcock delved into the genre of horror. Previous to the birds there was Psycho, a film that defined and influenced the concepts of modern horror and created the 'slasher' sub genre that is still presently popular. With the birds Hitchcock once again created another horror sub genre. Through the birds, Hitchcock displays his familiar aesthetics, particularly his ability to deceive the audience and his ability at establishing suspense. Being purely subjective, the birds display why Hitchcock gain the classification of 'the master of suspense'.<br/><br/>We meet the protagonist Melanie and Mitch through a pet shop, surrounded by caged birds. They both engage in a conversation that displays they share a interest in each other. This introduction highlights Hitchcock brilliance in deceiving the audience. I remember when i first watched this and asked myself ""Isn't this a horror movie"", as the conversation between the two characters evokes a sense of romance. Initially, the introduction sets the film up to be a romantic-comedy, the birds are caged, the humans are happy and the audience are comfortable...for now.<br/><br/>After Melanie and Mitch depart, Melanie feels reluctant to meet Mitch again, she uses Mitch sister as the motivation to meet him again as his sister wanted birds for her birthday, eventually Melanie drives to Mitch's house. The drive consist of some beautiful photography, as Hitchcock uses the landscape to evoke a sense beauty,romance and happiness,like wise 'to catch a thief', the landscape represents the mood of a romance. Furthermore Hitchcock adds some devilish humor, as Melanie drives around the bends, the birds in the car for Mitch begins to slowly shift right to left, the birds are given life hilariously...Wait is this a horror film?.<br/><br/>Eventually Melanie meets Mitch again. At this point, and as i previously noted the film has no traces or elements that consist in a horror film, it's basically become a romance between the two leads. However once we feel comfortable Hitchcock gives us little hints that remind us that this is indeed a horror film, such as when the 'gull' 'accidently' hits Melanie and the bird that hits Annie door. Hitchcock is slowly building the tension.<br/><br/>Through this next sequences, Hitchcock unleashes the horror. The scene of Mitch's sister, Cathy, birthday party. In this scene Mitch and Melanie relationship reaches an emotional climax and at this moment the birds attack, signifying the end of the romance and the beginning of the horror, and my god what horror it is, no one is safe not even the children.<br/><br/>As the violence begins, Hitchcock begins to display his genius in creating tension, as each sequence consist a minimal build to a sensational, horrific climax. For instance the sequence that consist of Mitch mother visiting the farmer. She arrives and everything is silent as she descends through the house, slowly she notices that cups are destroyed and the house is a mess. Once she gets to the room Hitchcock displays her view through a rotation of pov shots. The violence increases through each pov shot until it reaches it's climax, a man with his eyes missing and covered in blood. Furthermore the sequence when Melanie goes to pick up Cathy from school. Hitchcock once stated ""The audience is longing to warn the characters on the screen: ""You shouldn't be talking about such trivial matters. There is a bomb beneath you and it is about to explode!"" this was his definition of suspense, which is on full display in this sequence. As Melanie is waiting a bird descends onto some playground equipment, as Melanie continues to wait more birds descend upon the same position, without her knowing. Once she turns around the playground equipment is engrossed in black from hundreds of birds, and as you would suspect they once again create havoc.<br/><br/>After the birds are well established as a public threat, the common people in the diner all suggest theories of why the birds are attacking humans. This scene brilliantly highlights the horrific essence of Hitchcock 'the birds', as these common people are attempting to explain the attack. They don't realize that the answer to their question has no answers. The birds have no goals or motives, they just attack because they can.<br/><br/>Eventually the character have to create their own fortress in their house for protection. Through this passage, Hitchcock creates another brilliant editing sequence that mirrors psycho shower sequence. The sequence consist of Melanie being attacked by the birds while trapped in a room. The editing creates brilliantly a bombardment of horrific images that provides no room to breathe. As an audience we are trapped with her. Eventually Melanie escapes and the family leave the house. Through this end sequence Melanie clings to Mitch mother for her comfort. This is an embedded theme running throughout the birds, the fragility of women and their dependence on men. The ending shot displays a natural landscape that mirrors a apocalyptic future. The shift in tone from the romance to a apocalyptic future is astonishing.<br/><br/>The birds is undeniably a Hitchcock classic that consist of his familiar traits. But the brilliance in the birds is that Hitchcock creates a figure of nature that is considered subordinate to humans, but eventually becomes a dominate figure, and through this process he outlines the fragility of humans and just subordinate we really are."

Make a great movie about what would happen if one of the most benign and least threatening aspects of nature, suddenly, inexplicably, and fatally turned against humanity.<br/><br/>While Shymalan tried to horrify us with the wind and plant pollen, Hitchcock decides to remind us of how many more birds there are than humans, and how sharp beaks are just as capable of plucking out eyes and stabbing flesh as they are at pecking seeds. If you scoff at the idea of birds being deadly...well, imagine yourself in any of the various terrifying and menacing situations that these characters face throughout The Birds. The last 15 minutes are as tense as almost anything I've ever seen in movie<br/><br/>The ordinary and frivolous opening of the story is a perfect segue into the unexpected horror that descends on the small coastal town of Bodega Bay. There's a slow, menacing buildup to the action, and it definitely serves to lull you into an easy calm that shatters all the harder once the feathers start flying. And we never know why.

He had the keen acumen and sharpened intellect to get to the bottom of the suspense creating story and always left some baffling unanswered questions for the audience to cobble with.<br/><br/>""The BIRDS"" is much better movie than others of its genre, namely, Exorcist, Evil Dead and The Mummy Returns.

Coupled by interesting story and nice direction, movies directed by this suspense guru would always remain a toast for the viewers to watch.<br/><br/>The sheer scale and number of threatening sea gulls at the end of the movie is amazing.

Then the rescue of the hostage inmates from the birds encircled resort was all revealing and satisfying."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","5","9","9 June 2008"," An exercise in slow-burning terror, iconic imagery and inexplicable dread
","Cinema isn't about reality. Hitchcock understood this fact; purposely creating worlds that were there to be controlled and manipulated. Think back to the theatrical nature of the high class apartment building in his earlier film Rope (1948) and how the director managed to skilfully manipulate the physical space so as to literally close in on the characters as their crimes were eventually discovered. Elsewhere, we have the use of obvious forced perspectives in Rear Window (1954) and how the flat, artificial presentation of the world within the film becomes not only a comment on the nature of cinema itself but a veritable dissertation on the relationship between the audience and the characters, and indeed, between the audience and the film. Likewise, the use of colour in Vertigo (1958) was also an abstraction; moving as far away from actuality as you can possibly get in order to underpin the yearnings of fear and desire so central to that writhing, fragmented plot.<br/><br/>If you attempt to convey ""realism"" on screen you limit yourself both emotionally and creatively. Hitchcock knew this, and The Birds (1963) perhaps illustrates the fact clearer than anything else that he directed. When sitting down to view the film, the trick is to approach it with an open mind; open to the time and the context of the age when it was released and indeed, within the context of the world that Hitchcock is attempting to create. It is important to remember that Hitchcock's background was in silent film. He trained at the UFA film studios in Germany at the height of the expressionist movement and took the various processes and techniques acquired there and applied them to functioning narratives with identifiable characters. The world created in Hitchcock's work is artificial, but self-consciously so. The colours, perspectives, movements, actions, etc are all deliberate; leading the audience constantly towards those iconic set pieces and manipulating both the film and the viewers into engaging with the story on an entirely visceral and immediate level.<br/><br/>Like the previous Psycho (1960), the first thing that strikes us about The Birds is its sheer iconic worth. Whether you're familiar with the film or not, you will have experienced these images referenced, spoofed, regurgitated and ripped-off a number of times in both film and television. Think about that first seagull attack on the lake, or the birds slowly gathering on the playground jungle gym as the children sing obliviously inside. These images have passed into the public consciousness; with Hitchcock taking weighty and important themes and motifs and simplifying them into one single, iconic image. This is where the power of Hitchcock's work really is, with the director taking simple stories and installing them with an element of human interest, an air of subversive humour, a gleeful disregard for convention and the ability to interpret difficult and complicated scenes in such a way as to be comprehendible for any audience, regardless of cultural background.<br/><br/>Another reason why The Birds is still considered an important film is down to the enigmatic, mysterious and all the more frightening nature of the attacks and the complete lack of explanation for why they are taking place. Hitchcock felt that any attempt to give context to the violence of the film would tip the drama into the realms of science fiction. By refusing the audience an explanation the film becomes more terrifying; plunging the characters and the audience into the unknown and creating this abstract, surrealist presentation of man vs. nature that is open to a variety of wider interpretations. You can also view it on a symbolic level, with the whole thing being seen as an nonfigurative romantic comedy, in which the bird attacks central to the plot come to represent the friction in the relationship between these two central characters; forcing them together and then forcing them to remain together when the natural instinct is to simply leave.<br/><br/>In this respect, the film becomes an almost Buñuelian comment on relationships, further complimented by the opening scenes wherein Hitchcock seem to be setting up a frothy, romantic screwball comedy. Again, if you're open to the film and the context of the filmmaker's style of working, the ideas presented by a film can be more interesting than the film itself. By going against convention and leaving the horror of the film unspoken and unexplained the film becomes more motivating. Sadly, many younger audiences demand that a film explain everything lest it be thought a failure. This is backward logic for me. By leaving a sense of mystery to the film, Hitchcock creates something that is more terrifying, as well as being more lingering and vague. Once something is explained it becomes comfortable; it loses its edge because as an audience we're then able to rationalise the horror. With The Birds, Hitchcock creates this sense of escalating dread which builds and builds in way that leads to complete anarchy and then ends on an apocalyptic sense of devastation without ever revealing why.<br/><br/>If you forgive some of the more dated production effects (which, if you truly love cinema, you'll already be accustomed to anyway) then The Birds, as a thriller, is still an interesting and completely entertaining work; establishing a number of themes and characteristics that are still seen in many contemporary films, from the emphasis on a flawed, all-American family, to the small town sense of isolation further developed in films like Jaws (1975) and Arachnophobia (1991), to the idea of a love affair developing amidst the carnage and destruction. However, unlike many other contemporary films, The Birds offers a sense of mystery and the lingering sense of unexplainable dread that is really quite fascinating. It might not be Hitchcock's greatest film, but the sheer iconic weight of the images, the depth of the characters and the performances of the cast mark it out as a real classic of slow-building tension, terror and a surreal depiction of the ultimate ecological nightmare."

","In San Francisco, the spoiled daughter of the owner of a newspaper Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) meets the lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in the Davidson's Pet Shop. Mitch recognizes Melanie but pretends that she is a seller and asks two love birds for his sister's birthday as a joke. However, Melanie buys a pair of love birds and discovers his address in Bodega Bay where he spends the weekends with his mother and his sister. Then she drives to the coastal town and plays a practical joke, leaving the birds inside Mitch's house with an envelope for his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). While returning by boat to her car, Melanie is surprisingly attacked by a gull. The birds mysteriously attack people in Cathy's birthday party; the children at school; and the skeptical locals in the town, in the beginning of a series of deadly attacks. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" is a trash and silly idea of deadly attacks of gulls, ravens and other birds to humans that only a genius like Alfred Hitchcock could transform in a classic of the horror genre. It is interesting to see the debut of the blonde Tippi Hedren with a character that has the name of her daughter Melanie Griffith. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is leaving the Davidson's Pet Shop with two white dogs in the very beginning. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Os Pássaros"" (""The Birds"")"

","I love many old movies. Rear window, vertigo, Pyscho, etc. the birds is not one of them.
This movie simply does not hold up and I regretted watching about an hour and 10 minutes in when nothing about evil birds had happened yet and the only plot line was about a woman returning a pet parrot to a man she had a crush on.
In fact, it takes the movie 45 minutes to tell you the following:
Woman has crush on man.
Woman goes to his town.
It's not like I even need a lot of action or a lot of stuff constantly happening to enjoy movies. (I enjoyed six seasons of Mad Men!!) it's just that I need a plot line more interesting than a woman having a crush on some guy.

"Lechuguilla","10","6","12","2 November 2014"," Terrific Visuals And Special Effects
","Gripping and unnerving, Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" is one of the great films of all time. In more recent movies, special effects are the sole reason to see the film; there is no real story. What makes ""The Birds"" so eloquent is that the special effects enhance an already masterful story.<br/><br/>One could reasonably argue that Hitchcock's classic was one of the first, if not the first, films to explore an environmental apocalypse. As such, it has great thematic depth. The story shows how we take for granted simple features of our everyday world, and how unsettling it would be not to have control over these mundane environmental features. <br/><br/>Characters are multidimensional; we care about them; they clearly display their humanity. And the dialogue is excellent. My favorite character is the amusingly intellectual ornithologist. Mrs. Bundy, so sure of herself in the Café scene: ""I hardly think that either species (of birds) would have sufficient intelligence to launch a mass attack; their brain pans are not big enough"".<br/><br/>Plot structure is fine, although it's not unreasonable to state that the story is a bit slow to develop; perhaps a few scenes in the first twenty minutes could have been deleted or shortened. The film's ending is sufficiently clear without being explicit.<br/><br/>There are so many good visuals it's hard to know where to begin. A favorite of mine is the scene where Melanie sits in front of a jungle-gym smoking a cigarette; birds casually and innocently gather behind her. After a time when she has finished her cigarette, the camera reverts back to the jungle-gym; this time it has been overrun by an ominous army of birds; the scene is rendered even more effective by having no dialogue.<br/><br/>Another factor that makes this film good is the absence of background music; the story doesn't need it. Ambient sounds alone enhance suspense and realism. The sounds of flapping and squawking birds are eerie and effective. Casting is almost ideal. Tippi Hedren may be a bit prim and proper but she does a good job with her role. I don't recall a weak performance anywhere.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" is probably my favorite Hitchcock film. Aside from possibly a slow start, it's a well-made film, using technically difficult visual effects. It is not only entertaining but also thought-provoking in its underlying environmental theme."
"Incalculacable","10","6","12","28 June 2006"," Hitchcock's Masterpiece: The Birds
","I write this as I look out the window onto the bird bath. Now that I have watched The Birds (1963), I have a completely different perspective of them. I have a slight, small fear that they will gather (there's quite a few out there), and somehow attack me with force. But I guess that's what an amazing movie does to you  it affects your thoughts and feelings long after you have finished watching.<br/><br/>The Birds is about a notorious socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) who goes out of her way to deliver two lovebirds for a prank on a man she just met (although he recognized her!). She ends up staying the weekend in Bogeda Bay, strange things start to happen: a seagull attacks her when she delivers the lovebirds, and this is the start of the attacks which increase in terror over the movie. Hitchcock is extremely clever with this, and manages to build up both suspense and tension.<br/><br/>Out of all the Hitchock's I've seen so far, I believe that this is my favourite. I loved the air of suspense and tension that was created, I loved the acting, I loved the story, I loved the special effects (I would much prefer the simplistic special effects than today's  if this was made today, everything would be over the top and I believe it could take away from the movie itself), everything. Hitchcock truly excelled at this genre  no wonder why it is his trademark. A timeless classic  chilling and suspenseful."
"zetes","10","6","12","21 November 2000"," Fascinating; Freudian analysis of The Birds
","One would think, not having seen this film, that it is just a normal horror film where a mass of animals attacks people who run from them and scream. Well, this film is different, in that it was directed by the single greatest director of all times, Alfred Hitchcock. The Birds was made during his peak. It follows on the heels of such films as Rear Window, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho. It is as well directed as those films. In fact, it is even more daring than those. Several classical Hollywood elements are missing from this film. For one thing, and perhaps the most effective choice made by Hitchcock for this film, there is no musical score. Even in his best films, Psycho and Vertigo, for instance, the films are swept along by the score. They are great scores, by maybe the best score composer who ever worked in the movies, Bernard Herrmann, but to see a Hitchcock film without a score is just fantastic. Even the best musical scores are meant to manipulate your emotions, so here we get a chance to see just how effective a film can be without one. Also, the end of this film is perhaps the most unconventional you're ever going to see (although Vertigo also has a very unconventional ending). It is possibly the most startling image I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Even if it just had Hitchcock's amazing direction going for it, The Birds also benefits from an absolutely masterful script. It is never as if the story is just that birds attack people. It is much, much more complex than that. And herein lies my Freudian Analysis. Of course, coming right after Psycho, Hitch was probably jumping to keep the whole Oedipus theme alive here. Annie, the school teacher, expresses this literally. But I would like to interpret the birds as more of a symbol than actual matter. Think back to the film Forbidden Planet. Remember the Monster of the Id, the invisible and immaterial beast who destroyed every person who attempted to take Dr. Morbius and his daughter off the planet, basically whoever threatened to steal his daughter from him? I think the birds in The Birds serve the same function for Lydia. When Melanie Daniels, a supposed sexual predator, enters the small, peaceful town of Bodega Bay, she does so to prey on Mitch Brenner. We find out, just as much by her actions as by Annie's speech, that Lydia is very jealous of her son's women. Melanie is also introducing her carnality onto the town as a whole. She brings the love birds for Cathy. Mitch had at first asked that the love birds not be too willing to display their love, and the first thing that Cathy asks is, ""How can I tell which one is male and which one is female?"" Notice also that the mother in the restaurant attacks her for being responsible. This ought to seem ridiculous, but it seems perfectly logical in the text of this film. The woman says, ""I think you're responsible. Who are you? WHAT are you?"" At the end of the film, Lydia does seem to accept Melanie. The birds are still there, but they do not harm them as they leave. <br/><br/>Too often this film gets shoved into the horror genre and left there. I believe it was Hitchcock's most successful film, and for some reason, I think that more people could identify it and identify it as a Hitchcock film than any of his other films except for maybe Psycho. The Birds, and Psycho, too, which is also often classified as a horror film (which it is not in any way) are far too complex to be labeled with such a small label. They are both masterpieces. Psycho has always been regarded as one. The Birds is sometimes, but not as often. It is certainly one of Hitchcock's best. This man was a god. The Birds is a godly film. 10/10"

","My daughter informed me that the movie, The Birds, was based on a short story--only 33 pages long, in fact. I only found this out recently, but I am not the least bit surprised, as I found the movie to be way too shallow to deserve the positive acclaim it has received. I think what had happened was that by the mid-1960s, Hitchcock had established quite a reputation for himself so people just assumed this was yet another great film. I don't think so. To me, it seems that the brilliance of Vertigo and North By Northwest just isn't evident in this shallow movie. Okay, here's the plot: In a small town, the birds go nuts and start attacking people. A man meets a woman in the midst of the carnage, so, of course, they must fall in love (or something) rather than just LEAVE THE STINKING TOWN. Yes, I know that they were ""trapped"" in the town--no one ever heard of using a car? Yeah, the gas station blew up, but that STILL doesn't explain this. If you want to see a movie about a town in terror, watch Village of the Damned--this one SHOULD have been the Hitchcock movie!"

","An incredibly engrossing Alfred Hitchcock thriller.<br/><br/>Very original plot. Hitchcock probably created the creature-horror movie with this film, yet it is so much more than that. It has romance, human drama and survival.<br/><br/>In typical Hitchcock fashion, the tension builds slowly. The background story is interesting in itself. Without the birds, the movie could easily have been turned into a romantic-drama (it probably would have needed a different name though...). Little by little, Hitchcock introduces the protagonists. <br/><br/>Also typically Hitchcockian, there is no sound effects to artificially dial up the tension. It is all visual. Some scenes are particularly chilling. The birds behind Tippi Hendren at the school is a good example.<br/><br/>Good performances by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hendren in the lead roles.

","Many have pointed out what they see as shortcomings of this film. No explanations for the avian assaults, an ambiguous ending, heck it doesn't even have a soundtrack.<br/><br/>But these omissions are its unique strengths. The total lack of explanation leaves you uneasy. The non-ending leaves a disturbing and uneasy situation unresolved. The missing soundtrack leaves you with pure, unadulterated atmosphere.<br/><br/>In fact, in adapting Du Maurier's short story, Hitchcock deliberately stripped-out the elements that made sense of it.<br/><br/>Possibly, the only borrowed element is the pacing, which follows the slow, brooding menace punctuated with action and terror of John Huston's Moby Dick.<br/><br/>Even the most formulaic and conventional scene - the siege on the Tides restaurant, is staged uniquely and brilliantly.<br/><br/>In a sense, The Birds is a highly experimental, avant-garde anti-movie, and to that end it succeeds brilliantly.

The lack of a proper musical score also makes audience forget we are watching a movie. <br/><br/>The film never really climaxes so much as it just stops, but that was the perfect way to end the film. By not having any closing credits, Hitchcock didn't give the audience any time to linger at the end and ask ""What happened? Do they get to the hospital, or anywhere else safe? Do the birds ever attack again, there or anywhere else?"" until after we left the theatre. If we had been asking that as the closing credits run, its effect would have been lost.

"CarusProductions","Null","4","7","20 August 2011"," One of the Best in Horror
","It's difficult to believe that a film about a major birds attack could even be remotely scary. Anyone else who would have directed this film could have made it unbelievably cliché. Oh, wait, Alfred Hitchcock is the director, so it has to be great! And it is.<br/><br/>For those of you with a short attention span, don't watch 'The Birds'. The story may seem slow-paced, but it only increases the anticipation. If you appreciate proper storytelling, this is for you.<br/><br/>Tippi Hendren gives a wonderful performance as the leading role. She is mainly calm throughout, though she does exactly what Hitchcock expected; Be a character people relate to. The whole point of horror is to begin in a perfect setting similar to the Garden of Eden, which gives a false sense of security. There is barely any music, which only increases discomfort during the calm before the storm of birds.<br/><br/>The sound effects are to perfection. The story knows the right timing to frighten its audience. The only scenes more horrific than birds attacking humans, are when the birds are simply perched, waiting. The meaning of the film is to show how we mistreat animals. Yes, revenge. Buying lovebirds toward the beginning shows us how they feel imprisoned. Animals were free once upon a time. To have all animals attack, and not only birds, would have been too obvious.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the ending. It is somewhat similar to the original 'Night of the Living Dead' with a twist. Although zombies are not half as threatening as birds.<br/><br/>Expect the unexpected from any Hitchcock film."
"Chase_Witherspoon","8","4","7","29 April 2011"," Alfred Hitchcock's seagull
","Bodega bay sees the arrival of sophisticated socialite (Hedren), cautiously optimistic of a budding relationship with local boy (Taylor) over whom all the local girls swoon – none more so than school teacher (Pleshette). But jealousy and social acceptance become minor distractions to the relaxed seaside lifestyle, when the community's bird population suddenly get into a flap and begin terrorizing bystanders.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's rather austere treatment of what is, ostensibly, a strained love triangle played against a backdrop of marauding flocks of seagulls, contains one strong characterization (that of Annie, the jilted school teacher as played with aplomb by gravel-voiced Pleshette) and some glorious location cinematography. Other than that, it's a labour intensive allegory, a loose machination for examining gender tensions, based around a colloquial term for women (Birds). Chauvinistic widow Mitch Brenner dalliances with unsuspecting quarry, admired by his mostly senile neighbours, encouraged to end his therapeutic (read womanizing) ways and find a replacement wife and mother to his school-aged daughter, i.e. Annie. But his pathological weakness for blondes – in direct contrast to Annie's raven-haired vixen – introduces a superior contender that must fend off the unwanted attentions of all comers (some feathered) to claim her trophy and rightful place as the family's next matriarch.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's macabre self indulgence is evident in his treatment of Hedren, whose encounter with the feathered contestants is a harrowing experience, and a somewhat confronting action sequence for its vintage (Hedren later stated she narrowly avoided being blinded by a stray beak). As usual the complexities in the characterizations bleed into the fabric over an extended period of time, the almost arbitrary appearance of the birds gradually becomes pervasive coinciding with the characters' darkest revelations. And while the construction is interesting, the lack of momentum occasionally drifts into soap opera.<br/><br/>Narrative challenges aside, it still remains a stylish approach, with memorable scenes including some graphic attacks, and the best performance of a woman scorned you're ever likely to see on the screen. It's just a shame that it takes 2 hours to convey."
"screenman","9","4","7","3 May 2008"," Still Scary After All These Years
","This movie is rather an odd-man-out amongst Hitchcock's genre. For the most part, his movies feature horrors of a human nature. The two that come first to my mind are 'Psycho' and 'Rebecca.' 'The Birds' has a more Steven King style of story-telling, in which something otherwise innocuous quite unexpectedly goes berserk. As he himself once explained; 'the familiar fabric of life can come unravelled with shocking suddenness'.<br/><br/>During the first part of the movie, we are treated to a comedy of manners amongst sophisticated individuals. Tippi Hedren plays 'society girl' Melanie Daniels, out to score flirty points off an upstart lawyer, acted rather oleaginously by Robert Taylor.<br/><br/>She pays a clandestine visit to his mother's country house out in the coastal boondocks called Bodega Bay. And it's here that Mr King appears to take over the script. Beginning with a few isolated attacks, 'The Birds' descends into a truly horrific idea. They have all become organised and cooperative. And they want us dead. The attack scenes quite beggar belief. These aren't special-effects or CGI; these are real birds. Big, dangerous ones like crows and gulls. And although they were trained to their task, it didn't stop one of the girls (I believe it was Ms Hedren) being pecked so badly that she was actually scarred.<br/><br/>The caws and shrieks are loud and aggressively modulated to highlight their new-found ferocity. Even today some of the scenes of bloodied victims struggling under multiple attack are shocking. Hedren's character shelters in a telephone box whilst rabid birds hurl themselves at the windows, shattering them in death. A man staggers up, his face a ripped, red mask, unable to think under the onslaught let alone see.<br/><br/>Then the raid abates, and the dazed community try to make sense of the impossible thing that just happened.<br/><br/>All of the characters are extremely plausible and accurately represent the social and sexual politics of the day (1963). Modern feminists might find the strident hysteria and sal-volatile weepiness of their gender portrayal a little hard to stomach today; well - I'm sorry girls - but that's more or less what we blokes had to put up with back then. In a crisis, men not only did everything; they were bleeding expected to do everything. You don't know how grateful we are for Ellen Ripley.<br/><br/>As other commentators have mentioned; if you like explanations and nice neat denouements, this movie isn't for you. The subjects just go quietly into the night, leaving the theatre to the birds. You don't even know if they make it or not. They disappear into the distance with the harsh braying of crows sounding almost like victory jeers.<br/><br/>Modern horror movies like 'Aliens' and 'Species' have raised the shock threshold way beyond this now, but for those of us who saw this frightener during the 60's, our feathered friends have never seemed quite the same. And they are right here, with us. 'Aliens' are just a remote fantasy. Remember that, next time you're out in the countryside, away from any protection, and a big mob of crows begins quietly looking you over..."

Then suddenly, very late in the proceedings, everyone starts getting their eyes pecked out! To an extent the joke's on us, because the first half is annoying and the second not consistently scary.

","The first 45 or so minutes of ""The Birds"" (which is 2 hours long) is spent setting up an unusual plot about a woman named Melanie Daniels (played by Tippi Hedren) stalking a man she met in a pet shop named Mitch Brenner (played by Rod Taylor), supposedly out of playful romantic interest. She goes through a LOT of trouble to get in touch with this guy, whom she didn't really seem to get along with in the pet shop. How she suddenly fell in love with this guy or why she goes through so much trouble to do what she does is never explained.<br/><br/>But, then we get to see dive-bombing birds! <br/><br/>I don't necessarily mind a red herring plot, mind you. ""Psycho"" starts off as a story about an embezzler running away, but it takes a dramatic turn into uncharted territory as soon as our protagonist stops for the night at the Bates Motel. However, unlike in ""Psycho,"" the red herring plot doesn't disappear in ""The Birds"" once the main plot begins. We see long discussions between Melanie and her newly found roommate (played by Suzanne Pleshette) about Mitch. We see heart-to-heart conversations between Mitch and Melanie. And, the relationship between Mitch and his mother has clear elements of the jealous, controlling relationship that Mrs. Bates has with her son Norman. Why all of this continues to happen throughout the movie, I have no idea. It's all interesting stuff, but it starts to feel like filler material after a while.<br/><br/>All of this, of course, occurs in between scenes of DIVE-BOMBING BIRDS!<br/><br/>Speaking of such birds, I did enjoy seeing them and the attack scenes. This is a movie that would look great and be pretty scary in 3-D. The one thing I loved the most about any of the attack scenes was the sound effects of the bird calls. The cacophony of bird calls, while seemingly innocent in real life, manages to make these birds seem ever more menacing in this film.<br/><br/>At the same time, though, I couldn't help but wonder what on earth possessed the birds to suddenly attack and in such massive numbers. Why did they keep on attacking? Why did their attacks seem way more intelligent than we know birds to be? Are they supernatural birds? Do they have some disease? Have they gone psycho? Are they under the control of Norman Bates' mother? In the beginning, there's something mentioned about dead chickens and bad birdseed. Does that have anything to do with the birds' behavior? None of this is ever answered.<br/><br/>I'm willing to put up with lack of explanation, as well, since I'm sure no explanation would probably satisfy me, given the behavior of the birds. But, then, the film never really finishes the story either. Right as the we're getting into the thick of the plot, the film is over. No resolution, no explanation, no real sense of ""falling action"" either. We reach the climax of the story and then we're done right away.<br/><br/>Now, I don't mind ambiguous endings. Sometimes, the best way to end the film is on an ambiguous note. But, with a red herring plot that continues throughout the film even after it is revealed to be a red herring, no explanation for the odd behavior of the birds, and no resolution to the main plot, I walked away from ""The Birds"" thinking that I had seen a script that had a good premise but had no idea where it wanted to go with it.<br/><br/>But, still, DIVE-BOMBING BIRDS! :)"

","The Birds is one of the films that is considered to be a classic, its technique and direction in creating tension, menace and horror are often studied and mimicked. It tells a story of a town that was attacked and besieged by birds that turned, for uncertain reason, deranged and vicious. It exploited the idea of something that ordinarily appears harmless but which suddenly became violent and deadly.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the director had used his considerable talent to create an eerie atmosphere, and applied various technique to create the suspense and terror that makes the viewers fearful and tense. However, there is nothing much beyond that. When examined critically, looking at the why and how, the film falls apart. Why do the birds attacked? Can they really be so powerful, even threatening to peck through doors? How come the people are doing so little to counter the menace? Are the people there really so clueless as to how to kill birds, even if there are lots of them? <br/><br/>A moment that illustrates the absurdity of this film is when the Melanie went to the loft and suddenly found herself faced with hundreds of birds that attacked her. Anyone with any sense would not even go into the room when they see a big hole in the roof, or would just turn and run out of the room, but no, she went in and then just stood here, waving her hands around and fumbling for the door knobs behind her (doesn't she know how to turn around? It's easier to see the door knob and stop the birds from attacking your face that way you know!). The way it was done was purely for creating the horror, damn any sense of logic of how any normal person would have behaved in such situation.<br/><br/>It is a lazy piece plot wise, showing a director more interested in creating tension and suspense, jettisoning completely any sense of coherence and logic, or indeed any interest in the outcome of the film. It perhaps has too much of an influence on other films, as we have now seen so many films of the horror genre that are purely interested in the creating fear, terror and suspense, with people behaving not like any real person would and getting into stupid and terrifying situations. The technique for creating fear is everything, and in the process, the people in the story are completely lost, no longer individuals who thinks and acts, just puppets that don't think but merely react, and in an absurd fashion."

Aided and abetted by her beau Mitch, his mother Lydia and his sister Cathy, the motley crew endeavour to survive these ever increasing and inexplicable attacks, attacks which it becomes apparent are for the purpose of killing humans.<br/><br/>The very first thing which struck me about this picture was I'd been convinced it was a black and white movie, and of course it is not. This gave the film a vibrant life not unlike Vertigo yet radically of its own ilk. <br/><br/>However, like all Hitchcock flicks, the direction and cinematography are out of this world. The man's genius for breathtaking scenes and stunning colour combinations continues to amaze even today, and the multiple scenes with practically thousands of birds was on a scale I doubt has been repeated. It amazed me.<br/><br/>Another of the qualities Birds has is that it is absolute enchanting. Undoubtedly helped by the richness of each scene, it is completely gripping all of the way and your attention never weans.<br/><br/>The acting is also pretty good, if not quite as remarkable as Rear Window, Vertigo et al. It still oozes class, however.<br/><br/>But the direction really is the main character in this, much like it is for so many of Hitchcock's other movies. The life which breathes from the celluloid never lets up, and while the ending isn't exactly conclusive, you shouldn't find yourself particularly worried or feeling hard done by. Instead feel enriched by yet another fantastic of cinematic genius at its finest.<br/><br/>Truly absorbing."
"gwithers","Null","4","7","29 January 2003"," I can't believe these nasty birds have bitten holes in my Edith Head suit!
","I love this movie and I watch it about once every couple of months.  The genius of Alfred Hitchcock is undisputed and has been well-documented so I'm not going discuss that.  If a viewer doesn't understand the subtleties and layers of meaning in this film, then it really wasn't for them.  These are the same people who like in-your-face scares, and can't understand a movie that doesn't beat you over the head with violence and bloodshed.<br/><br/>There are enough things to be read into the characters and scenes in this movie, that it would take endless reviews to cover them.  Many of them have been touched upon in the reviews here, but I would like to add a few more comments about Melanie Daniel's character:<br/><br/>Did you notice the coy simper on her face just before the seagull attacked her in the boat?  She's posing for Mitch, her head is cocked to one side and she has this annoying, fake look on her face and the bird swoops down and ruins it.  I wonder what her first words to Mitch would have been if the bird had not attacked her?<br/><br/>I didn't feel sympathy for her when she was at Cathy's birthday party talking to Mitch about her mother and how she had abandoned her when she was a child.  Her voice gets this phony catch when she says, `I don't know where she is.'  She is so obviously trying to be the poor little rich girl and elicit Mitch's sympathy.  Why would she sound near tears talking about a mother who had to have been out of her life for at least the last 15 years? [Tippi Hedren's voice really got on my nerves too.]<br/><br/>Melanie seems a little too smug and self assured in her attractiveness and she expects all men to find her enchanting.  The only reason she goes after Mitch is because he didn't seem to be impressed with her.  She is like a child who sees something she can't have and immediately sets out to try and get it any way she can.  She seemed like a selfish, relentless sort; buying the love birds, driving 60 miles to Mitch's home town to find him ostensibly to deliver the birds to Cathy in time for her birthday.<br/><br/>
And then, we have the famous scene where she goes upstairs by herself. Who in their right mind would decide that `Gee, everybody is asleep and even though this isn't my house, I think I'll just nip upstairs with this flashlight and see if the birds are gone.'  Wouldn't it have made more sense to wake up Mitch and ask him to go with her?  Why did she even care?  I think she got exactly what was coming to her.  No more did bad things happen to other people, here was the golden girl herself being assaulted like any other fool who blundered into a nasty situation that they couldn't control. I think the shock of the birds actually daring to attack her, shocked her so much that she couldn't move.  She couldn't believe it was really happening. Otherwise, why not swat a few of them off with that big flashlight and open the door and get the hell out of there?<br/><br/>I think the ending was inevitable.  Melanie Daniels thought that she could do whatever she wanted in life because she was rich and attractive and felt that she didn't have to suffer the consequences of her actions.   She thought life would always be like this but her experience in Bodega Bay proved her wrong.<br/><br/>I'd like to discuss Annie Heyworth too, but I'll leave it for another time."
"Boyo-2","10","4","7","19 October 1999"," Blame the lovebirds
","When I was a kid watching this movie, I assumed the lovebirds that Melanie brought to Cathy caused all the problems.  I was angry that at the hysterical woman in the diner who blamed Melanie for the attacks, and I was scared by the ""other world"" feeling you get from the movie.<br/><br/>
Upon recent viewing, I'm not sure I was right, but this is still a fantastic movie and I love the uncertainy at the end.  I have read that Hitchcock wanted more of an mysterious ending, but the studio would not allow it. There is a lot going on in this movie and is worthy of repeated viewings."
"JRGBUCS","1","16","42","10 November 2001"," Lame.
","Like most other horror flicks, this movie was lame. You sit around for quite a while at the beginning wondering when things are gonna pick up, or if they're gonna pick up. Then when it does pick-up it's kinda interesting but the bad acting and bad dialog just make it look pretty stupid. I was almost laughing at this movie. There was no tension at all. Well, I guess since Alfred Hitchcock made it, it gets a high rating on the IMDB for some reason."
"rupie","4","7","15","19 June 2000"," sorry, but this one is (you guessed it) for the birds
","I'll have to be the turd in the punchbowl here and insert a contrary opinion among the critical encomia. I finally managed to see this one from beginning to end in American Movie Classics's Hitchcock retrospective in early summer 2000. I had had my doubts about the flick from the bits and pieces I had seen earlier, and seeing it entire did nothing to change my opinion, despite the fact that Camille Paglia thinks this is one of cinema's great masterpieces. I found nothing remotely frightening here; the whole thesis of the movie is laughable, and the sudden stop ending is unsatisfying and anticlimactic. And wordy??? Talk, talk, talk, and more pointless talk. Tippi Hedren ? I think Hitch's erotic fascination with her overcame an objective assessment of her acting abilities (her post-Hitch career includes such gems as ""Teresa's Tattoo"" and ""Return to Green Acres""). One curious fact about this film, and one which I have neither read nor seen any comment on, is the glaring omission of a musical score; there is nary a note of background music. I would love to know Hitch's rationale for this choice; in any case Bernie Herrmann might have been able to pump some suspense into this dog, er, bird."
"roddekker","5","5","10","23 May 2015"," Birds Of A Feather?
","OK. Here's the sound of the birds in The Birds... Caw! Caw! Caw!... Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!... Cackle! Cackle! Cackle!... Chirp! Chirp! Chirp! (Ad nauseum) <br/><br/>Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, The Birds was the film that followed next after Psycho. And, when it came to the element of horror, I think this film was clearly a giant step down the ladder.<br/><br/>This film's preposterous story about common birds, like crows, seagulls and finches, flocking together and deliberately attacking the residents in the town of Bodega Bay (with the intent to kill them) made no sense at all.<br/><br/>And the focus on the hot/cold relationship that got underway between Mitch and Melanie only served to turn the whole story into a sappy, 2nd-rate soap opera."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","5","10","6 February 2014"," For me, it just don't fly . . .
","If you follow the timeline of Alfred Hitchcock's films, you can see that he did his best work in the 40s and 50s after he came to America. That's an argument that you could probably debate for weeks, but I have a feeling that it would end up owing the general consensus. Just look at the 20 year span between 1940 when he made Rebecca, his first film for an American studio and his only film to win Best Picture at the Oscars and 1960 when he made Psycho, his most popular film. In that span of time he made Notorious, Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, Suspicion, Saboteur, Rope, The Trouble With Harry, The Man Who Knew Too Much, North By Northwest and Vertigo. These are not little-known pictures and any director would be proud to have such a resume. Yet, something strange happened to Hitchcock's work once he got into the 1960s, with the exception of Psycho, his work lost its edge. This was the decade in which the great director moved to television and, with that his film work seemed to suffer. In this decade he only made two films that anyone really remembers – Psycho in 1960 and then The Birds three years later.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's best films are always exciting to break apart. There are buried levels to the characters and to the stories that are fun to unearth, yet when it comes to The Birds, I always seem to come up a little frustrated. Here is one of his most popular films, yet revisiting the film again recently – thanks to TCM's one-night-only performance in movie theaters – I find the movie somewhat empty.<br/><br/>Given account of everything that happens in this movie, if you stand back and view it as a whole, you find that it isn't much more than a simple monster movie. It is well-crafted but it is not exactly deep. It is possible to delve into this story and unearth a deep psychological analysis, but it requires most of the heavy lifting on the viewer's part.<br/><br/>The problem, I think, begins with the lead character. Hitchcock loved women and his most accomplished characters were his female leads. He was never willing to simply head his films with an empty-headed ninny. The women in his films always seemed to have some sense of depth and complexity and were more effective the more we delved into their damaged past.<br/><br/>That's why Melanie Daniels is such a baffling case. There's nothing really wrong with her, and that's the problem. She's beautiful, inquisitive and loves birds, but there's something about her that the movie isn't telling us and that makes her motivations a little bit muddy. What's going on in her mind? Where did she come from? Who is this woman? Is she responsible for the plague of killer birds? These are questions that the movie never really answers. In the pantheon of Hitchcock's favorite blondes, Melanie is not exactly complex. Her motivations are unclear and when we get to the bird attacks, there doesn't seem to be any connection other than the fact that she is in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>The story you already know. Wealthy socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) drives from San Francisco to the seaside village of Bodega Bay to deliver two lovebirds to a man named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) whom she met in a pet shop. Arriving there, she finds herself mixed up in a bizarre phenomenon when flocks of birds begin attacking the town's populace for reasons that the movie never explains.<br/><br/>The pieces are all there. There is a development of Melanie in relation to the people (mostly women) that she meets in Bodega Bay. The two key supporting players are at odds with Melanie over her possible intentions with Mitch – his former lover Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) and his clinging mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy). Yet, there is something halting in these relationships and they never seem to come to any real conclusion.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie always has me a little stumped. All of the main players – Melanie, Mitch, Lydia and his daughter Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) - are holed up in Lydia's house after Mitch has boarded up the windows and doors. After some attacks, in which Mitch has to come to the rescue, the others fall asleep. Melanie hears something upstairs and goes to check it out. Alone, she goes upstairs and finds that the birds have chewed a hole in the ceiling and are perched on the daybed. There they are, waiting for her and she is attacked.<br/><br/>Story-wise the movie may be a little empty, but on a technical level, it is a masterwork. What Hitchcock achieves in this film is mood and atmosphere. This is a film in which sound is the most effective tool. The movie contains no musical score so we are left to the sounds provided by nature. The only thing close to music is an effectively eerie song heard from a children's choir at the school. The scene is chilling as Melanie walks outside for a cigarette and the bird gather on the monkey bars just behind her.<br/><br/>The sounds of the birds themselves have an unreal quality about them; there is a sort-of squelching sound that sounds closer to pigs then to birds. The special effects are inevitably dated but that crudeness gives the birds a chilling presence.<br/><br/>Perhaps Hitchcock was so busy with the technical side that the story fell by the wayside. Perhaps he was too preoccupied with his television work. You are welcome to dig under the psychology of the film all you want in an effort to read between the lines but, for me, the story just doesn't fly.<br/><br/>**1/2 (of four)"
"billy-168","3","5","10","7 November 2008"," A pretty large disappointment
","I watched this film for the first time in over 32 years - I'm 43 now. I expected to see Hitchcock at his best. Yes there was horror, and great special effects, that for many years must have looked mega-impressive. They look very good today. But the story is pants. The romance is so flat and charmless; the viewer wouldn't be too bothered if the birds killed most of the main cast members - so unengaging they were. Tippi is a reasonable actress maybe, but her character is not a likable or charming girl in the slightest. She's boring and uninteresting, and the viewer wouldn't miss her if the worst thing possible happened to her. Rod Taylor is a little better, but just. Few redeeming features unless you like an ego who knows best actually. Cue a mother who looks and judges anybody with an aloofness and cold heart, wins no friends or sympathy in this role.<br/><br/>The best character in the movie was the teacher, who is left on the stairs, after wasting her life for a man who just doesn't have any love for her...What a waste of a bright and attractive young thing.<br/><br/>The worst part to whinge about is the plot. The lack of explanation for us to think about was poor fayre by Hitchcock. He's now lower in my estimation. No theories explored at all by the writers for the birds behaviour. The story that anyone who witnesses and is injured first hand by a massive attack of seagulls and crows, wouldn't high-tail it out of that little place the same hour just defies any belief.<br/><br/>Hitchcock just doesn't succeed in getting us to link emotionally with most of the adults. This must have been mentioned to him, surely? Yet he oked it.<br/><br/>So for me, the awful plot and lack of thought provoking possible answers to the dull plot, poor treatment of an even gentle romance, and crummy characters make this movie a big let-down.<br/><br/>And finally some questionable side issues - such as a woman driving 60 miles and easily finding a guy in an unknown place becomes far less of a whinge in the company of other far worse cinamatographic failings."

","The Birds is one of the greatest horror movies ever to be made, it's not just a great. it's a masterpieces. This movie has some of incredible scenes I have ever see in any horror movies! Outstanding performance from Mitch (Rob Taylor), Lydia Brenner (Jessica Tandy), Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) Cathy Brenner (Veronica Cartwright) and every one else involved! The Summary Beautiful young Melanie Daniels, a wealthy socialite whose father is the proprietor of a large newspaper, visits a San Francisco pet shop to pick up a myna bird she has ordered for her aunt. There, Melanie meets Mitch Brenner, a lawyer who is looking for a pair of lovebirds to give to his young sister.<br/><br/>Intrigued by him, she buys the lovebirds and finds the address for Mitch's home in bodega bay a small coastal village up the Pacific coast. Melanie drives to Bodega Bay and delivers the birds by sneaking across the small harbour in a motor boat to the Brenner residence. Melanie walks right into the house and leaves the birds on a table with a note. As Melanie is headed back across the bay, Mitch circles around in his car to meet her. Just as she is about to pull up to the dock, a seagull swoops down and gashes her head.<br/><br/>Over the next few days the avian attacks continue, as Melanie develops relationships with Mitch, his clingy mother, Lydia, his teenage sister, Cathy, and Cathy's teacher (and Mitch's former lover), Annie. One of my favourites scenes in any horror movies is when the Grows gather outside the school waiting to attack the kids when they come out! And When Grows attacks Kids so very well done, really scary at the same time and Suspense in that scenes was magnificent, This movie holds Suspense until the last second of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock did a superb job on directing and after 44 Years after movie first came out this is now a classic. I said it before and I say it again This movie is a masterpieces there is no other word for it!"
"bkoganbing","7","5","10","11 January 2007"," Our Avian Friends Attack
","The Birds is one of the very few Alfred Hitchcock films that owes more to special effects than to any great story line or acting performances. It's those birds turning on mankind in Bodega Bay that you come to see this film and that's what you get.<br/><br/>Those of the lesser species that mankind hasn't killed off live either in harmony with man or in an undeclared truce. What if a species all of a sudden, previously docile, decides to turn on man? Birds are something we may like or dislike but we do take their passivity in most cases for granted.<br/><br/>It's not hunting or preying birds like the eagle and hawk that do the turning in Bodega Bay, it's scavenger birds like gulls and crows. And they're working together with a kind of unseen intelligence guiding them. That's what's most scary.<br/><br/>The human players Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy and the rest are really of little importance. Everyone does their part well, but their little stories fade to insignificance. The Birds starts as almost a Doris Day/Rock Hudson type comedy as Rod Taylor comes into a pet shop and mistakes Tippi for a salesperson. They have their Rock and Doris like banter and she gets his license number and follows him down to Bodega Bay, a sleepy little California coast village.<br/><br/>The way Hitchcock made Santa Rosa a part of Shadow of a Doubt, he does the same here with Bodega Bay. Unlike in Shadow of a Doubt though the town as well as The Birds dwarf the plot of the film.<br/><br/>As Rod and Tippi do their Rock/Doris thing The Birds start their attacks and turn the place into panic city. As it probably would in any situation. What's really spooky about the whole thing is that Hitchcock leaves it totally unresolved. We don't know what the town will do about these aggressive avians. Or for that matter what mankind itself will do."

","First, When I finished watching the birds, I thought this movie gives us fear very much. For example, this is no music. When I saw Psycho, I noticed the importance of music because I felt fear very much by music. However, There are no music in this film. I thought this technique was novelty.<br/><br/>Second, I think Hitchcock's techniques is great. When Madeline was attacked by birds, I believed Madeline was attacked by birds actually, but this was not true. However, We believe this movie's story and go into our heart and soul. <br/><br/>Third, I expect this movie appeal the importance to treasure animals equally. Many people think humans are not equal to animal. As a result, some people crucify animals. However, humans are equal to animals actually. Then I thought this movie appealed the importance to treasure animal equally.<br/><br/>Finally, I felt frightened since I finished watching The birds. I felt Hitchcock is great again."
"brchthethird","8","3","5","12 August 2015"," Ahead of its time in more than one way
","Leave it up to Hitchcock to find the horror in something ordinary, but he did just that with THE BIRDS. This also happens to be the first Hitchcock film I ever saw. From what I can remember I thought it was fine, but nothing really spectacular. Now having seen it for the second time, with a lot more film-watching under my belt, I feel like I appreciate it more for what it is, what it meant to cinema going forward, and as a part of Hitchcock's oeuvre. Like all of Hitchcock's films, it takes a simple premise, in this case a socialite who follows a potential boyfriend to his family's small hometown, and while there birds start attacking. On the surface, and for most of the people in the audience, this is probably enough and Hitchcock would probably have agreed. However, there is more to the film than the innovative score and still-impressive visual effects. THE BIRDS also works as a metaphor for the (apparently) rising violence in modern society. Along the way, a few themes are recycled from previous efforts such as SABOTEUR and PSYCHO, but the film I feel is the closest kin would be SHADOW OF A DOUBT. In that film, you have menace coming to a small town in the form of a person, and everything turns out alright in the end. Here, we see menace come to a small town again, but something even more innocent on the surface and more pervasive; and, in a rather pessimistic turn, the ending is left ambiguous. I'm not sure if Hitchcock intended the film to be read this way, but in a world where people are afraid of getting shot when out at the theater or, in a more abstract sense, being the victims of terror attacks, THE BIRDS couldn't be more thematically relevant today, perhaps even more so than when it first came out. And really, that's the beauty of Hitchcock. He was able to tap into the human psyche and fear in a way that few others can (or could). From a technical perspective, the film perhaps doesn't hold up as well, but you can hardly hold that against it. Sure, the visual effects aren't as believable as some modern CGI, but they're still rather effective. Yes, Hitchcock's reliance on rear projection can be distracting at times, but that's a feature of his work I've begrudgingly come to accept. What isn't so forgivable is the downgrade in acting talent from his previous pictures. Tippi Hedren is serviceable as Melanie Daniels, and does get a nice character arc, but she's no Grace Kelly or Kim Novak. Rod Taylor (Mitch) is a handsome face, and not a whole lot more; and hopefully I never have to see the child actress who plays his sister Cathy in anything else. By contrast, Jessica Tandy did well in her supporting role as Mitch's mother. What was most impressive to me was the experimental score (supervised by Bernard Herrmann) that was used in lieu of traditional orchestration. Often, some of my favorite moments in other Hitchcock films have been ones with little to no music, and the effect here of having a mixture of simulated and real bird sounds was chilling at times. There was also more ominous moments, like the well-known sequence that shows a children's jungle gym completely overtaken by a murder of crows and, of course, a literal bird's eye view of an explosion that shows the birds moving in for the kill. Overall, I can comfortably say that I liked this film a lot more on second viewing and it definitely ranks up with Hitchcock's best."

","The Birds (1963): Dir: Alfred Hitchcock / Cast: Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, Veronica Cartwright: Tremendous followup to the success of Psycho. Director Alfred Hitchcock addresses our means of taking things for granted. Birds are harmless and beautiful but Hitchcock reverses their peaceful nature for one of terrifying menace. A small town is suddenly attacked at random by birds of various species. Tippi Hedren ventures to Bodega Bay in pursuit of a lawyer, played by Rod Taylor but her romantic endeavours are interrupted with sudden bird attacks. Hedren and Taylor have terrific chemistry playing individuals of different backgrounds. She had a wild reputation while he used his profession to create an introduction that would lead to her venture to the Bay. Jessica Tandy plays Taylor's widowed mother who is afraid of losing her son to this mysterious new woman. It is interesting how the bold dispositions shift after the birds launch a climatic attack in the attic. Suzanne Pleshette is superb as a school teacher who was once involved with Taylor. She is not the jealous rival but rather an accepting bystander whose fate is under watch by crows. Veronica Cartwright plays Taylor's much younger sister who is celebrating a birthday. The plot problem is not solved and the reason for the bird attacks is never clear but the suspense is maddening. Score: 8 / 10"
"barryrd","8","3","5","1 December 2014"," Tangled Relationships in a Suspense Thriller
","The Birds presents a story of a young woman named Melanie Daniels, played by Tippi Hedren, who pursues a handsome stranger played by Rod Taylor, as Mitch Brenner, to an outlying fishing village north of San Francisco, where she encounters an unusual phenomenon of birds attacking people. <br/><br/>Aside from the main story, we find some interesting characters in the village: a young school teacher named Annie Hayworth, played by Suzanne Pleshette, who left San Francisco to be with Mitch and never returned and Jessica Tandy, as Mitch's mother Lydia Brenner, who delivers the cold shoulder to any woman who is interested in her son. So Melanie Daniels, the daughter of a wealthy newspaper baron, finds herself at odds with Annie and the mother Lydia. Both Melanie and Annie are in conflict with Lydia, a common foe and this brings the two women to form an awkward friendship. The three main female characters have roles defined by their connection to Mitch. For me, the characters of the female performers are a memorable part of the movie. <br/><br/>Melanie's strong streak of independence attracts Mitch but doesn't work too well with his mother, who seems bent on keeping her son a bachelor who can help fill the gap that followed the death of her husband four years before Melanie arrives on the scene. Melanie is a prankster and someone who is used to getting her way but she shines in a crisis that puts her to the test. Melanie is tough but she can also show her soft side with Mitch's younger sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) and the two form a strong bond.<br/><br/>The movie comes to a climax with the massive bird assaults which unfold very slowly with some small incidents and to add to the suspense, cutaways to birds crowding together on phone poles and play structures. The suspense was very effective with the muted sound track followed by the sudden burst of birds. With the birds becoming a threat to the village, we can feel the tension building before key scenes. I did find the attacks too over the top but Hitchcock was never one to shy from trying something new. The birds become Melanie's main opponent and require her to draw on untested sources of strength and determination. Mitch too performed heroically in the test against the forces of nature. Both Mitch and Melanie showed their mettle through their sheer endurance, a great partnership in adversity. The ending is enigmatic but allows the viewer lots of scope to speculate."

","**SPOILERS*** The film ""The Birds"" starts out like a 1930's screwball comedy with handsome and available criminal lawyer Mitch Brenner, Rod Taylor, getting under rich socialite as well as jet setting Melanie Daniels, Tippi Hedren, skin about how spoiled she is. That's when Mitch spots her at a local San Francisco pet store where he's looking to buy a pair of love birds for his 11 year old sister Cathy's, Veronica Cartwright, birthday. Annoyed and at the same time impressed by the handsome stranger Melanie find out where he lives and plans to buy him the birds herself as a present and at the same time give him a piece of her mind in the bargain. That's when the light comedy ends and the sheer horror begins in the movie.<br/><br/>Traveling all the way up to Badoga Bay, to present him the love birds, where Mitch is spending the weekend with his mom Lydia, Jessica Tandy,and sister Cathy things start to happen in the little fishing town that there's no logical explanation for. The birds in the area, finches blackbirds ravens and seagulls, start to go on a rampage against the people living there! At first it's just one bird at a time being aggressive but as the days ware on they mass in the hundreds and thousands and attack anything in sight. Melinia getting a room from local teacher Annie Hayworth, Suzanne Pleshette, finds out that not only is she Cathy's teacher but had an affair with Mitch. There's also a side story in the film in that Annie's affair was broken up by Mitch's widowed mom Lydia in fearing that she's take him away from her and that also effects Mitch relations with Melanie as well. That all soon disappears when the birds come on the scene,by the tens of thousands,and start both terrorizing as well as killing the citizens in Badoga Bay!<br/><br/>One of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest hits,it grossed well over 11 million dollars in the box office, with things in it that he's not really known for: The eye popping special effects scenes of the birds on the attack in the air as well as on the ground in the movie. There's that famous scene with Melanie sitting near a monkey bar outside the school where at first one black bird lands on it and then within minutes it swamped with hundreds more as an unsuspecting Melanie with her back turned is just enjoying the view! Not for once realizing that she's, and those in the school, are about to be viciously attacked by them! There's later in the movie the scene when Malanie is trapped in the attic of the Brenner house and attacked and almost pecked to death by hundreds of attacking birds that's even more terrifying and bloody, being shot in color, then the famous shower scene in ""Psycho"". In fact actress Tippi Hedren was so traumatized by it that she actually suffered a nervous breakdown and was sidelined for a week after living or acting through it!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** With all the great scenes in the film it's the final one that really stuck with me. That's when the birds by now in the hundreds of thousands overrunning Bodaga Bay and now completely in control allow the few remaining residents to leave unharmed in a show, if you can call it that, of compassion. In what seems like the birds knowing that after what happened to them that they'll never come back there again and go tell those living outside of Bagoda Bay what to expect if they ever did!"
"Spondonman","7","3","5","10 June 2012"," Memorable flight of fancy
","Sadly this was the last good film from Alfred Hitchcock, it was downhill all the way from this – sadly because I always felt the last 5 he directed were all wasted opportunities and not inherently bad films. Although Frenzy was cheap and nasty and Family Plot was dull and flat. Hitch was still at the top of his game here, completely indifferent to the content of du Maurier's short story and telling us as he done so often in the past a cinema story instead with wonderful panache.<br/><br/>Ice cool blonde Hedren falls for chunky lawyer Taylor, visits him at his house by the sea bringing with her 2 love birds and also apparently bringing down all the local birds united anger. The birds sporadically violently attack the humans, no one knows why or how to stop them – but how could they when they didn't even know the difference between ravens and blackbirds. Plenty of iconic old fashioned shocks: the farmer in his pyjamas lying dead; the crows silently flocking on the climbing frame behind the awkwardly smoking Hedren; the chaos when the petrol station was attacked; Hedren being stabbed in the shower, sorry, bedroom by the waiting birds; so many others. The necessary Disney cartoonery and special effects were almost immediately dated, and also much corn and clunky melodrama are displayed, all of which will always be overlooked when a story is told so masterfully as this is. Hitch always wrapped his cleverness up with a sheen of simplicity and seemingly effortlessly played with his viewers' emotions. Nearly two hours go by and then comes (the end)<br/><br/>Hitch would've enjoyed utilising the standard cgi cartoonery and camera technology available today (not to mention today's wonderful freedom to portray deviancy and bestiality as normal); thankfully what we have is a classic film, with faults, but watchable over and over again."

","In his films I have found that the plot always will remain unpredictable. You will find yourself guessing , thinking and feeling excited all the time. It is so nice to see films of those years when now there are a few entertaining ones. The director definitely is a master of horrors and suspense. The way the birds were shown as the enemy was enthralling. It is for sure that if you will see a movie like this now you can cry for the special effects, But considering 1963 it was very good. The plot in the starting in no way showed what possibly the film could have been. I thought it would have been some kind of romantic film. But they included the discussion of birds from the starting and that should have been the clue. Than the part which I liked the most was that the story builds slowly with the attacks being lesser in damage and the number of birds to a massacre in the end. The film takes a U-turn after the half time. Gone is the time of romance between the two main characters and get yourself seated for a blood spilled action. Though I did not like the ending which could have been more elaborate. And the film makes us puzzled in the end. ""Alfred Hitchcock is the master of thrillers."" ""A must watch for all fans of thrill and suspense."""

","A wealthy San Francisco socialite (Tippi Hedren) pursues a potential boyfriend (Rod Taylor) to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people there in increasing numbers and with increasing viciousness.<br/><br/>I have to say, right off the bat, that the birds were pretty cheesy. It was more than obvious that they were not actually in the same room or area as the people, at least most of the time. And their squawks were like records being played backwards. They were not particularly terrifying.<br/><br/>That aside, it was a good movie. Great characters (though the sister is a bit irritating) and some underlying issues that never fully come to a head. Dominant mother? Absent father? A former lover? We have the makings of a good bit of tension here... enough to have a plot outside of the bird attacks."

","I've been a big fan of Hitch over the years I especially admired his master suspense work in ""Psycho"". And finally after many years I viewed ""The Birds"" for the first time and I must say that for it's day the film was a visual and mechanical masterpiece a well done work. As many of the scenes just all of a sudden start you with fear that's unexpected like the flock full of birds on the school playground and the quickness of the birds flying from the sky to peck a victim! Set in San Francisco a wealthy and attractive single lady Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren a beautiful screen lady for her day)decides to follow the path of a prospective lover a powerful man attorney Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor)to his northern California home on the island of Bodega Bay. Upon arriving to his home on the other side of the sea past a little schoolhouse with two love birds and her meeting of his daughter and mother, Melanie plans to stay right up.<br/><br/>Slowly and one by one when the residents look up they notice the sky above is different as Melanie can remember from her San Francisco days a flock that looked familiar, it's like these birds flew north for her venture! The scenes of the bird attacks and gatherings are master works for Hitch as his camera use put the audience in terror. The mechanical birds worked to a perfect fit to bring terror and blood to the humans of Bodega Bay! Overall not Hitchcock's best, but effective as it made us think to take cover the next time we saw a bird no matter if it was up high in the sky or down low on the ground!"
"KnightsofNi11","8","3","5","3 June 2011"," Endless thrills are masterfully constructed by Mr. Hitchcock
","There is a reason Alfred Hitchcock is nicknamed The Master of Suspense. The Birds is a film that proves this title oh so well. It was released back in 1963, yet 48 years later it is still terrifying. It's the story of Melanie Daniels as she pursues a handsome San Fransico man named Mitch to his hometown of Bodega Bay. Upon her arrival the birds of the town start to act strangely. They begin to randomly attack people very sporadically. The attacks grow increasingly vicious and what started as an attack by one bird here and there becomes massive attacks from gigantic flocks of birds. You could never predict a movie about killer birds to be so terrifying, yet The Birds will prove you wrong as you will never look at a crow the same way again.<br/><br/>This is a movie that you really have to give a chance despite a few kinks in the beginning. Well, I honestly wouldn't call them kinks, just necessary ground that must be covered. The film starts off pretty slow, with a lot of mundane activity. The movie starts out very average and very normal and its easy to get a little bogged down. But after an hour of set-up and creeping suspense building everything pays off. When the film finally kicks in to full gear you realize the necessity of the somewhat dull first half of the film and it is completely worth it.<br/><br/>In a lot of older horror/thriller films I'm able to pick up what is supposed to be scary, but due to my desensitized nature I'm not actually scared by it. The Birds is a completely different story, however. This film is truly terrifying. The technical prowess of this film is astounding and it all works towards a goal of honestly scaring the living hell out of you. Hitchcock directs with such thrilling brilliance that you can't take your eyes off the screen during the harrowing bird attacks. He also employs a sort of blue screen effect to fill the screen with angry birds swirling around in a raging mass. Then of course he adds fake birds for the actors to interact with and, allegedly, real birds.<br/><br/>But where the real thrill comes from is the sound. The spine tingling sounds of angry birds squawking and screeching adds uncanny amounts of thrilling effect to the film. The sound is edited together to achieve maximum chills, and it definitely achieved its goal. The bird attack scenes are just so powerful and so disturbing that you feel like you are in the midst of it all. The film boasts some masterful editing and ingenious direction that creates some of the most suspenseful, as well as strikingly terrifying, moments imaginable.<br/><br/>While the first half of this film is dull yet necessary, the second half does everything possible to make up for a slow start and The Birds ends as a powerful thriller that is incredibly memorable. Alfred Hitchcock is nothing less than a filmmaking genius, and the thrills provided by The Birds during the film's second half proves that all too well. This is a film that sends chills down your spine and will thrill you to the end, especially with one of the most haunting final shots in cinema history."
"sddavis63","7","3","5","2 June 2011"," One Of My Favourite Hitchcock Movies
","""The Birds"" stands - in spite of a handful of problems - as one of the more frightening horror movies you're ever going to come across. It's frightening precisely because it's so inexplicable. There are no monsters, no mutants, no aliens, no diseases - none of those things that are usually used to create ""horror."" Instead, there are birds. Gentle birds that we see around us everyday who are usually so frightened of us that they back away if we even get close. Except in the small California coastal town of Bodega Bay, where the local avian population suddenly runs amok, and birds of all species gather together (for no particular reason that's mentioned) and begin a series of escalating and deadly attacks on the local human population. It's the very fact that the attackers are so common around us every day and that this is so unexplained and seems so impossible that gives this movie its greatest power.<br/><br/>The first hour or so is a bit long. Hitchcock gives us an extremely lengthy introduction to the various characters that probably could have been done more quickly, although it's in the midst of this introduction that seemingly unimportant things begin to happen - such as Melanie (Tippi Hedren) being inexplicably attacked by just a single bird - at the time more of a curiosity to the townsfolk than anything else. Hitchcock builds the suspense around the bird attacks and also builds their intensity quite well. Some of the effects used in portraying the bird attacks are quite frightening and unsettling, especially the scene in which a huge flock attacks a group of young schoolchildren. I felt a bit of deja vu during that scene as I remembered an incident as a child when I was surrounded by a group of sea gulls who were after my french fries. They weren't attacking of course, but they were all around me and I remember how unnerving and even frightening that was for a young child. The movie leads to no particular conclusion - except for an escape by the main characters as the giant flock of birds look on, apparently having quite effectively taken over the town and driven the humans away, which is exactly as the movie should have been left. To offer a logical, rational, scientific explanation would have weakened the power of the story.<br/><br/>The performances were good. Hedren and Rod Taylor as her romantic interest Mitch Brenner were quite effective, and I thought Veronica Cartwright entirely believable as Mitch's younger sister, who becomes gradually more terrified as time goes on. The final scenes, with Melanie and the Brenners seemingly trapped in the house while this huge flock of birds tries to force its way in is quite creepy. Well done by all involved. (7/10)"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","3","5","23 June 2010"," Perhaps the only real horror movie Hitchcock ever did.
","Thing with Hitchcock is that he basically never changed his style of film-making. He always kept using this certain '30's and '40's style of film-making, with long set-ups, lots of slow moments and old fashioned type of characters as well. This works for a lot of his movies, though not always too well for some of his later ones. This movie is one of his later ones and perhaps his only truly last great one.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was of course the master of suspense but he earned this title with the making of many great thrillers. He's movies often had an horror like atmosphere and build-up in it but they actually were never truly full-blood horror movies. The only movie that comes close to the horror genre as well was the much acclaimed movie ""Psycho"", which he made prior to this film. But even that movie is more of a thriller really, even though it heavily influenced the horror genre later on. With ""The Birds"" Hitchcock perhaps delivers his only truly real horror movie.<br/><br/>One of the things you also have to know about an Hitchcock movie is the less you know about it, the better the movie will probably be to you. Hithcock movies often start to head into one direction but then suddenly turn to a complete other. Just imaging going in watching this movie without knowing what will ever happen. The story and the suspense will work out far more suspenseful and surprising.<br/><br/>The movie has a bit of a simple story and concept to it. As often mentioned, the beginning is quite slow and the movie often takes its time to build the story, characters and its tensions. It's not slow in a boring in annoying way though, though I could imaging that it's not exactly just everyone's cup of tea.<br/><br/>Things start to happen pretty early on already, though it certainly is not until the movie its second halve that things really start to take off. The movie is suspenseful and mysterious but it's not until its second halve that the movie also starts to become tense in an horror type of way.<br/><br/>This movie is a real accomplishment with its special effects, in which it really seems like the birds are attacking people. Sure, some of the effects look outdated but you still have to give the movie lots of credit for being creative and some of the sequences are sill amazing and realistic looking. It's being a real original horror movie, not only with its creativity but concept as well.<br/><br/>Also quite fun to see Veronica Cartwright as a child in this. I had forgotten she was ever in this. It's a quite big early role for her, though it would still take years for her to finally definitively break through as an actress. Rod Taylor is a good classic hero and Tippi Hedren is the usual great looking Hitchcock blond.<br/><br/>A great original, creative and highly effective Hitchcock horror movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Once again a true masterpiece by Hitchcock, it starts of very simple and easy and becomes non-stopping chills and thrills towards the end. Seriously you'll never see another film were something as simple as birds will be so scary.<br/><br/>It's not much to say about why the birds attack, they simply do. And a small fishing town has to pay for it. I liked how birds were always in the picture, but they gradually became more and more violent, until the end were the horizon is literally covered with them. To a very, very minor degree it reminded me of the classic Living Dead films, except they're trapped by birds not zombies. but believe me, it's still very scary. Well maybe more chilling by todays standard, but it will keep you locked in your chairs to the end.<br/><br/>The main cast is great, including Tippie Hedren in her first movie role. Also i was surprised to see a very young Veronica Cartwright also known for Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. i bet this is the film who set her on the horror movie ""map"", even though Birds is technically a thriller.<br/><br/>What can I say, Hitchcock does it again. it almost stands up to Psycho. I never thought birds in general could the ""villain"" of a film, but Hitchcock did it. I give this movie a 9/10."
"TheHande","8","3","5","19 August 2009"," A strange tale
","The Birds is an early example of great special-effects work combined with a good story. Hitchcock's suspenseful cinematography adds to the mix and the ambiguous ending is the cherry on top.<br/><br/>Like many Hitchcock films the characters are played naturalistic which makes them interesting to the viewer. While there's quite a bit of dialogue most of it is well written and keeps the viewer invested in the film during its more quiet parts. The characters and their motivations are interesting as well.<br/><br/>However, where the film stands out are its special-effects. With relatively simple technology Hitchcock brings the bird attacks to reality in a compelling way. The silent crows waiting for the school children is a creepy image that stays in your head. The sparrows coming down the chimney is an impressive effect and the seagulls wrecking havoc on the town are menacing in their chaos.<br/><br/>Over-all the film's only weakness is that the pacing doesn't work quite well and the lack of dramatic music also takes away a little bit of the excitement. None the less, The Birds is still an effective picture."
"Samiam3","8","3","5","5 August 2009"," When terror takes flight with Hitchcock, you can't go wrong
","Every movie fan knows that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the top ten (or even five) geniuses in the history of the movies. I think The Birds is his scariest and most unique picture. Instead of a murder mystery or a psychological thriller, The Birds at its core is essentially a creature feature, and probably one of the most innovative.<br/><br/>The premise is sort of a fantasy. It is a completely hypothetical 'What if' story. A small coastal city in sunny California becomes a hellhole when all the local birds suddenly develop a taste for human flesh. Crows, Gulls, sparrows and even fowl all become predators! The story is told from the point of view of a small family and their guest (Tippy Hedron) she has a crush on ... and decides to surprise him by driving into town and giving his sister a present for her birthday.<br/><br/>I'll give you a perfect example of just how clever The Birds is. Picture if you will, one bird landing and perching very casually on the monkey bars in a playground, then another lands ten seconds later, then another then another. It resembles something out of Sesame Street (I am count Dracula! lets a-count a-birds!) The next thing you know, there are up to fifty birds just casually sitting on the playground. If you saw that in real life, it would amuse you no doubt. But given the context of the film, you'll either be turned away from the screen or biting your nails off. <br/><br/>The visual effects by modern standards would hardly be eye-popping but, considering this was almost fifty years ago, it is a fairly impressive job. There are hand puppets, birds on strings, projector silhouettes, and best of all, the movie features at least a couple hundred real birds. There is an old Hollywood saying, never work with children or animals. Crows and blackbirds are smart fairly easy to train, but seagulls I'm not so sure about, especially for something like the climax. You really need patience to direct a film like this.<br/><br/>After three decades in the movie business, Hitchcock has all the skills required to make The Birds come to life. Like all his films, this one has, and will probably continue stand the test of time."
"fearfulofspiders","9","3","5","3 September 2008"," Great...
","I saw this when I was 11-years-old and it wasn't frightening at all, though I must say, as a story (and possibly to younger viewers) there's plenty of enjoyment to be had.<br/><br/>The suspense is what works, not the birds particularly (at least not for me). The visual effects tricks used for the birds is actually quite unique, and made the film have a more twilight zone-y feel, instead of B-movie flair.<br/><br/>The acting is all well done.<br/><br/>The writing and directing are sharp, though the ending isn't quite what I expected, yet great nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall, this probably won't be received as well as it was back in the ""day"" because of the horror element, and how they will pull it off in the remake is going to be a disappointment (probably over-exaggeration on gore and blood) though I'm open to the possibilities. Definitely watch this film."
"classicsoncall","8","3","5","19 July 2008"," ""I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.""
","Before and since ""The Birds"", you've had all manner of creatures to make their impact in horror films. The brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock is that he doesn't go for the obvious - the great white shark, the rampaging gorilla, or the Jurassic dinosaur. What could be more welcome than a few songbirds to brighten up and add some cheer to an otherwise ordinary day? As the crows congregated in the schoolyard it seemed like they exuded evil in a strange way, foreshadowing an event outside the normal scheme of things. With all the slash and gore spectacle prevalent in horror films today, one has a keen sense as a viewer that nothing presented on screen is real. But take one look at the plucked out eyes of farmer Dan Fawcett slumped against the wall of his home, and you begin to wonder, wow! could something like that ever really happen?<br/><br/>Offsetting the grim spectacle of the bird attacks, I thought Hitchcock did a nicely nuanced job with some offbeat humor that might not seem obvious at first. Would a pair of caged lovebirds really respond to inertia the way the ones in Melanie's car did taking those curves on the road to Bodega Bay? I thought that was a neat touch. And how about shortly after the sparrow attack at the Daniels home, when the diner waitress orders baked potato with the fried chicken? Hitchcock's little way of a preemptive strike on the feathered set before things really get going.<br/><br/>One thing seemed kind of odd though. Recalling that sparrow attack down the chimney into the Daniels parlor, wasn't it strange that no one screamed? Not even a sound out of any of the people in the room, including little Cathy Brenner (Veronica Cartwright). That certainly wasn't played very realistically; I pictured myself in that room shouting out a few well chosen four letter words besides 'bird', I can tell you that.<br/><br/>As for the players, Tippi Hedren did a commendable job in virtually her very first screen role. There was something mysterious to her persona that might have been construed as to contributing to the bird attacks. That idea was voiced later in the story by the panicked mother who wanted to leave town as quickly as possible with her daughter. I couldn't really warm up to the idea of Veronica Cartwright and Rod Taylor portraying a brother and sister with the apparent age disparity, but that wound up working out OK.<br/><br/>The inconclusive finale left me feeling a little baffled since there was no real resolution to the problem with the birds back in Bodega Bay. It felt a little like the ending to the original ""War Of The Worlds"" (1953) where everything kind of worked out for the best, but with no sense of closure or comfort to it.<br/><br/>Before closing I have to throw out this bit of ornithological trivia, and I'm curious why Hitchcok didn't use it in the film. There was in fact a reference to a flock of crows in the picture, but the more accurate description would have been a 'murder of crows'. Seriously, you could look it up, the term came about because a group of crows is known to kill an already dying animal in order to feed. A whole bunch of them looks kind of spooky too!"
"Chance2000esl","9","3","5","23 December 2007"," This is Filmaking Art! One of Hitchcock's Best!
","This movie is wonderfully shot, so beautifully composed. It is so Hitchcock. This is auteur film making. Hitchcock blesses the audience with his deep concern for their enjoyment and his respect for the viewer's intelligence. There are so many scenes and shots that reflect this. A book could be written about the camera work alone; I'm sure it has.<br/><br/>Everything has already been written about this film. But for those viewing for the first time (or for me, about only the fifth time) what really stands out are:<br/><br/>1) the use of silence not only to tell the story (Melanie's surprise birthday visit to the Brenner house), but to heighten the suspense and tension (Melanie on the bench smoking in front of the Jungle Jim, or her flashlight walk up the stairs to open the door, or the whole sequence before and during the second attack in the house, or Lydia's visit to her neighbor's farm -- the list goes on and on.) Most of the time it is real silence, since there's no music sound track in 99% of the picture to distract from the intensity of the moment created by absolute silence.<br/><br/>2) The beautifully framed composition of so many of the shots, for example, in all of the various one-sided telephone conversations in Bodega Bay; the last scene of Mitch and Melanie in The Tides Restaurant facing the customers; the famous final 'door' opening sequence from shadow to light. Watching the film this time I just had to stare open mouthed at the artistry displayed before me.<br/><br/>3) Hitchcock's respect for the audience. He doesn't slam us with a noisy soundtrack to punctuate the action, he makes such a thing unnecessary. He gets the same effects with silence. He doesn't slam us with dripping gore and bloody corpses to create horror, he tells us that is unnecessary. He gets the same effects with quick cutting, and seeing things from the character's eyes.<br/><br/>4) Those famous Hitchcock touches, where every day objects become omens of danger or horror, as when Lydia, after having picked up her own china from a bird attack in her house, sees broken china cups hanging in her neighbor's kitchen. You know by seeing the broken china that something horrible is going to happen, and it does. He knows how to build the suspense: we watch Melanie sit on a bench smoking for what seems like forever. We know something's going to happen, and it does, with a shock: while we've been watching her smoking, the crows have completely taken over the play yard!<br/><br/>You can't help but be impressed that this is real film making art. I give this movie a 9. <br/><br/>One final note: I grew up in Petaluma during the fifties and early sixties. We often had 'Foremost' milk, chocolate milk and buttermilk. When Melanie fixes tea for Lydia, there on the kitchen counter is the familiar brown and orange carton of 'Foremost' milk. Now that's really going for location accuracy!"
"moonspinner55","7","3","5","24 December 2006"," The plot is infuriatingly vague, but Hitchcock's got the goods of a semi-classic...
","Any viewer might be forgiven for having mixed feelings at the conclusion of ""The Birds"". Evan Hunter's obtuse screenplay about a mass of violent bird attacks off the coast near San Francisco offers a situation with no explanation, no cause and no solution. This Alfred Hitchcock film is smoothly directed, but passive and a bit tentative. Tippi Hedren (Hitchcock's discovery, whom he hoped to groom into the next Grace Kelly) is an immaculate, impenetrable blonde Ice Queen who may be the one responsible for stirring up the birds, but this is never justified. Hedren's haughty manner is just as mysterious and implacable as the bird attacks (watch her in the elevator: her expression never wavers--she's like a mannequin). In fact, most of the women seem to be hiding some mysterious thought; Hitchcock holds close-ups of the female characters for so long, we wait for hidden subtext to be revealed and--despite a few telling lines of dialogue--it isn't. Rod Taylor is forthright and muscular as the lawyer who takes a fancy to Hedren, Suzanne Pleshette is a strangely contemplative, husky-voiced teacher, Jessica Tandy is Taylor's mother and Veronica Cartwright is Rod's sister (niece would've seemed more likely, or was Cartwright adopted?). Those are the only main characters, and even with so few the script can't iron out their stories. For instance, Tandy happens upon a man pecked to death by birds, she stumbles out of the house and passes a stable-hand but can't tell him what she saw; after she arrives home where Taylor and Hedren are, she butts them out of her way and takes to her bed! When Hedren phones from a diner and tells her father about a bird attack on the school, she completely forgets to mention a sparrow attack in Taylor's house the night before (she might've also mentioned the man pecked to death in his own bedroom!). ""The Birds"" is a very confusing picture from the viewer's side because we are kept at arm's length from these people. As for the birds, it doesn't help to hear everyone asking, ""why are they doing this?"" when we in the audience have absolutely no idea either. Still, it is one of Hitchcock's most stylish productions and there are several sequences that, while not without peer, are impeccably mounted and delivered. *** from ****"

","Suggesting that ""The Birds"" is far superior to ""Psycho"" seems to be considered something of a crime by most Hitchcock fans, but I have to commit that ""crime"". I believe it's superior because it holds up better after repeated viewings. ""Psycho"" loses much of its impact if you're familiar with the final twist; in ""The Birds"" only the shock elements lose some of their power, but that gives you more time to appreciate Hitchcock's complete mastery of his film techniques. His direction is masterful, his pacing is methodical and there are several astonishing, ingenious sequences (the scene where the birds are gathering up behind Hedren is probably one of the greatest in his career). <br/><br/>Taylor and Hedren have a warm, believable chemistry as a pair. The job that has been done in the editing and sound-effects department is superb. And the ending has a wonderful apocalyptic quality. This is first-rate filmmaking.

Even as a fan of slowburn horror, often relishing in the age-old ideas of buildup and surprise to accompany the shock and awe that horror brings audiences, I found myself exhausted and almost indifferent to the titular subjects of the film and whether or not they were ever going to show up or not. For about fifty-three minutes, we are given an uncompromising amount of development and methodical plotting centered around a series of bland and wealthy archetypes to finally get to the point where the birds invade that the entire film almost becomes a study to see how long the audience will sit still to see what they came to see.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a young, pretty socialite named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who meets a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in her bird-shop in San Francisco one day. He buys a pair of lovebirds for his sister's birthday, but because the shop is fresh out of stock, Melanie will have to deliver them the next day. Upon arriving at his mother's home the next day, Mitch spots Melanie and invites her to dinner. While there, Melanie meets Mitch's mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy), his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright), and a school teacher named Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). The five meet and dine inside a small beachhouse off of Bodega Bay when they see a plethora of birds, particularly seagulls, beginning to attack them and their home. When this unexpected, and certainly unexplainable, event occurs, the family decides to combat it the best they can by retaliating with whatever is in immediate reach.<br/><br/>The Birds has become a quintessential American horror film, largely because of the reactions its director's name inspires. Hitchcock had a wonderful way with his films that made them transcend horror films into elegant, decorated melodramas that frequently made you jump. His films always ooze class in the way they are filmed and colored, showcasing details and making every inch of the screen count, as a result. Hitchcock could almost sleepwalk and make a film like The Birds look as good as it does, though for me, nothing beats the true amount of meticulous detail in actors and events occurring at once than in Rear Window.<br/><br/>The issue is The Birds feels like a generic 1930s serial overstuffed to reach surpass a two-hour runtime. The amount of filler and fluff we have to sit through before getting to what we came for is unruly, especially considering most of it is staggeringly slow and numb conversation by actors that feel like even they, themselves, are bored and disinterested in the lines they're reciting. By the time they titular villains actually take the stage, the kind of conservative narrative practices Hitchcock employed are abandoned in favor of a great deal of shock and awe, having countless crows swarm the screen at once, never seeming to really pose any harm to the characters, as if they're on a whole other layer of film that has been placed over another layer that has the actors and the set decorations.<br/><br/>The peculiar and cheap-looking mise-en-scene and the dreary pacing are somewhat disguised by Melanie and Mitch's retaliation efforts towards the end of the film. This is the point when Hitchcock trades the traditionalist elegance of a melodrama and the slow conversation for something more exciting and energetic. The intensity of the film suddenly shifts when we realize that the main characters aren't even safe from the birds in doors, as the winged creatures can come through the fireplace and easily swarm the home. The final twenty-five minutes of The Birds is satisfying and suspenseful, precisely what this film should've been all along.<br/><br/>However, the price we have to pay - about an hour of dreary buildup and hit and miss effects - to gets about twenty to twenty-five minutes of great entertainment is almost not worth it. The classic status of The Birds, something few horror films really get to relish in when compared to other genres, is undeniable; the worthiness is questionable.<br/><br/>Starring: Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, and Veronica Cartwright. Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock."
"MattyGibbs","10","4","8","23 February 2015"," Memorable suspense. One of Hitchcock's best.
","The Birds is one of my favourite Hitchcock films and one of his creepiest. A small town begins to suffer attacks by a growing number of birds. On paper it sounds a bit silly but in the hands of a top director this turns into an enjoyable horror. <br/><br/>This is a horror film that relies mainly on foreboding suspense rather than copious amounts of gore. And this is delivers in spades. The ominous bird scenes are handled magnificently as are the bird attacks themselves which still hit home today even over 50 years later. <br/><br/>The characters are believable if not entirely likable especially the lead Tippi Hendren. Although strangely enough this somehow only adds to the film. The ending is superbly ambiguous leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusion. <br/><br/>The Birds is a great film by a great director."
"victoryismineblast","9","4","8","29 November 2013"," Why I love The Birds
","The movie starts out with the chance meeting of Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor. Hedren immediately takes a liking to Taylor and a cat and mouse romance courtship begins, with Hedren going out of her way to deliver some birds to Taylor's niece, all in the guise of wanting to see him again. The two take turns alternately flirting with each other and spurning each other's advances. I'm not a fan of romance, but this is played out so enchantingly, and charmingly that it's almost hypnotic to watch. To top it all off, Hedren is so stunningly gorgeous that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of her. <br/><br/>After the two meet again on the island, the real story begins. We all know what happens next, and it is played out with such horror and suspense that we are left literally sitting on the edge of our seats in anticipation of what is going to happen next. The bird attacks are very realistic and scary, and the home invasion scene is powerful. There are just enough pauses in the action where the tension dies down enough so that when it amps up again, we are left breathless. <br/><br/>As far as suspense/horror goes, this is a classic example of how it can be done perfectly. Kudos to Hitchcock. 9.5/10"
"CinemaClown","Null","4","8","7 October 2013"," How Clueless We Are Against the Forces of Nature.
","An absolutely terrifying tale of suspense & horror, an extraordinary achievement in technical filmmaking and a perfect demonstration of how clueless & unprepared we are against the forces of nature, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds remains one of the most under-appreciated works in cinema history & is amongst my top 3 favourite films from this genius filmmaker.<br/><br/>Beginning on a relaxed note which only serves as a deep breath before the plunge, The Birds concerns a wealthy San Francisco socialite who pursues her romantic interest to his small Northern California town where things soon take a turn for the bizarre as its entire community is suddenly & viciously attacked by birds of all kinds for no specified reasons.<br/><br/>Ingeniously directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the first half is pretty much a romantic tale that nicely introduces & sets up its characters while also slowly but steadily building up its foreshadowing events which ultimately take over the screen like an invading horde and completely changes the mood & atmosphere into a downright terrorizing one.<br/><br/>The screenplay is loosely based on the 1952 story of the same name & although the dialogues don't carry that much weight, the events are penned down brilliantly as almost every scene featuring the birds is a tense one. Camera-work is exquisitely carried out, editing never lets the boredom sets in & although it doesn't feature any score, the sound mixing aspect is a revelation of its time.<br/><br/>The film marks the screen debut of Tippi Hedren plus also stars Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy & a young Veronica Cartwright. And although everyone chips along finely, the real star of the film is the manner in which Hitchcock really builds up its suspense or handles the mystery element by keeping the entire story highly unpredictable from start to finish.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Birds is perhaps the final masterpiece to come out from Alfred Hitchcock's cannon and is one of the finest works in the genres of horror & mystery that still hasn't aged a day. It is a remarkable testament to Hitchcock's reputation as 'The Undisputed Master of Suspense' for he effortlessly manages to transform something as beautiful & innocent as birds into one of cinema's most terrifying villains.<br/><br/>Worthy of all the praise it has garnered over the years, certainly in need of an even wider audience & deserving to be ranked amongst Hitchcock's finest films, The Birds is an amazingly well directed, smartly scripted, nicely performed & precisely crafted cinema far ahead of its time that not only promises & delivers a thrilling cinematic experience but, with its ambiguous ending, remains an unsolved mystery even today. Highly recommended."
"Wuchakk","9","4","8","31 January 2011"," Reacquaint with ""The Birds""
","Hitchcock's 1963 drama/horror/thriller ""The Birds"" details the story of a city woman (Tippi Hedren) going to the rural coastal town Bodega Bay to play a coquettish prank on a lawyer whom she met in San Francisco (Rod Taylor). As she starts to get to know the town the birds mysteriously attack in force. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" might well be the first official nature-runs-amok flick, which were made hugely popular a dozen years later with the release of ""Jaws,"" the film that opened the Pandora's box to creatures-on-the-loose flicks. <br/><br/>I believe ""The Birds"" should be enjoyed at face value as a simple story of birds mysteriously attacking a coastal hamlet, but a more allegorical interpretation is that Melanie (Hedren) represents modern ideas that attempt to infect the rural communities where people live and think in a simpler, more conservative way. The village is not ready to accept and incorporate these ""new"" concepts and so nature itself attempts to vomit out the infection, irregardless of hometown damage and casualties. Yet this interpretation seems to be rejected by the film itself in the restaurant scene where the mother with two kids hysterically rebukes Melanie for supposedly causing the bird attacks; when Melanie slaps the mother, this irrational notion is 'slapped' out of the viewer as well, as if to say, ""That's stupid. Melanie is not the cause of this, literally or figuratively."" <br/><br/>WHAT DOESN'T WORK (supposedly): <br/><br/><ul><li>For the better part of an hour the story plays out as a slow drama, which will likely turn off those with ADHD. Personally, I find this approach refreshing in light of the frenetic editing and absurd action sequences of modern ""blockbusters."" Films like ""The Birds"" seem almost daring by comparison; in fact, it's startling. Besides, the beautiful Bodega Bay photography provides some nice backdrop eye-candy to help maintain one's attention with the soap operatics.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One obvious plot hole is: Why do Melanie, the schoolmarm and the kids flee the schoolhouse? Wouldn't it be wiser to simply blockade themselves in an inner room with no windows? Or maybe there isn't such an interior room big enough to fit all the kids; after all, it appears to be a fairly small schoolhouse.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Complaints about Melanie's supposedly lame prank on Mitch (Taylor) are nitpicking at best; and criticisms of Melanie foolishly searching for the source of a mysterious sound -- even though she must know what it is -- can easily be chalked up to curiosity killing the cat (for instance, while stopping by Point Pleasant, WV, on vacation in 2005 I went into an old abandoned building that used to be a home for troubled kids back in the day; my wife refused to go any where near the creepy domicile but I HAD to go in and look around; even the satanic graffiti and shocked birds flying out the windows didn't deter me!).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After recently seeing films like the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", I can hardly find ""The Birds"" horrifying, although I certainly find it very entertaining. Really, the creepiest aspect of the movie is Mitch's hovering, suspicious mother, played by Jessica Tandy -- whoa, is she scary.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The age difference of Mitch and his sister seems off. Taylor (Mitch) was 33 years-old during filming, although he looks to be more like 40 or older, but his sister in the story (Veronica Cartwright) was only 13. That's a twenty-year difference. I could see her being his daughter, but his sister? Also, if Veronica is 13 that means his creepy mother had sex a mere 13 years before -- and that's a really scary thought! </li></ul><br/><br/>WHAT WORKS: <br/><br/><ul><li>As noted above, the slow dialogue-driven drama of the first hour is actually appealing in light of the modern glut of moronic cgi-laden, frenetically-edited drivel, not to mention the awesome coastal Northern California cinematography.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Viewing the film is like going back in time to the early 60s. It's entertaining to see the clothing and decor styles, as well as social interactions, etc.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions. I know this is an odd comment, but she does have that Paul Stanley pouty lips rockstar expression down pat.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Suzanne Pleshette's in the cast -- now SHE's sexy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are numerous memorable and thrilling sequences -- the various bird attacks, the guy with no eye balls, the phone booth scene, etc. I also enjoyed the interesting discussion on birds in the diner sequence.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>!!END SPOILER!! I love the mysterious way the film ends with no explanation or dialogue. The sea of birds seem to permit their departure, even though the fowls could easily stop them if they wanted. </li></ul><br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours. <br/><br/>GRADE: A-"
"monsterflick","10","4","8","19 February 2008"," Hitchcock's Greatest Masterpiece
","Considered a major disappointment when it was first released, The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's most ambitious, most audacious, and most astonishing achievement. Some biographers have said that Hitchcock was jealous of the new European directors who were dazzling all the critics, and this movie was his bid for bigger ""artistic"" recognition. Unfortunately, audiences dismissed it as a slow-moving horror movie with few thrills, fewer explanations, and no real ending. (It was one of the first movies to end without the words ""The End."") Even to this day, critics have failed to comprehend its complexities, preferring to hail the more simplistic, easier-to-analyze Vertigo as Hitchcock's masterpiece. Francois Truffaut, however, appreciated the craftsmanship of The Birds in his book of interviews with Hitchcock. Robin Wood also attempted to dissect the movie, but ultimately wrote it off as an exploration of the irrational, emphasizing the precarious nature of life. Finally, thank god, literary commando/critic Camille Paglia gave this underrated classic the kind of rigorous, insightful treatment it so richly deserves in her BFI Film Classics guide, The Birds. I recommend it to all Hitchcock fans and movie lovers. Hopefully, it will inspire closer inspection and further commentary. Here are my two cents<br/><br/>The Birds is a true visionary epic, right up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey, 8 1/2, The Seventh Seal, Nashville, Taxi Driver, and Magnolia. Like those thought-provoking masterpieces, it requires repeat viewings to appreciate all the levels of meaning, the philosophical richness, the psychological nuances, and the bold cinematic originality. There's more than meets the eye here (or pecks the eye, to be precise). It's a romantic comedy that mutates into an all-out horror movie, a raging battle of the sexes waged in a symbolic war between nature and civilization. It's the revenge of female power, the breakdown of male logic, the apocalypse of the subconscious. It's a bedroom farce with beaks and feathers and claws, a gleefully sadistic attack on mother and child, Madonna and whore, hunters and gathers, hearth and home. And it's so much fun to watch!<br/><br/>Here are just a few ways to ""read"" The Birds: <br/><br/>* The attacks are literally nature's revenge. A local fisherman describes the bird's strange behavior and offers logical explanations. Mrs. MacGruder, the ""bird lady"" in the diner, paints a grim picture of what would happen if birds decide to wage war against humans. You can read the movie literally as an ecological disaster movie. But that's just a ""McGuffin,"" (what Hitchcock would describe as a meaningless plot device.)<br/><br/>* The attacks are metaphorically nature's revenge. On a deeper level, The Birds graphically illustrates a complete inversion of predatory-prey relationships, thrown disastrously out of balance by the women's pursuit of the man. The hunter is now the hunted, which, according to social norms, is not ""the natural order"" of things. By inverting nature's laws, all of civilization is at risk: traditional families, innocent children, and all of society. When Melanie is finally reduced to the level of a passive child in a mother's armssubjugated to the back seat of her sports car while the man takes his ""rightful place"" at the wheelthe bird attacks stop.<br/><br/>* The birds are symbols of female power. The attacks (via beautiful ""harmless"" creatures) are physical manifestations of the all-too-human ""harpies"" in Mitch's life: the sexual predator Melanie, the cold possessive mother Lydia, the clinging little sister who forces him to be a father figure, and Annie, the spurned lover who won't go away. They literally swarm around Mitch, surreptitiously pecking at each other, sublimating their desires, jealousies, and rage. These buried emotions don't just go away, of course; they find expression in the bird attacks. And no one is safenot the children, not the ""hen-pecked"" farmer next door, not the representative citizens trapped in a family restaurant. In the final scene, when the survivors are about to drive away, Mitch's little sister asks, ""Can I bring my lovebirds? They haven't hurt anybody."" But she's wrong. In The Birds, love destroys all. Love, and the female subconsciousuncaged at last.<br/><br/>* It's the end of the world. For some inexplicable reason, nature and fate have turned against us. Reason and rationality have failed us. Our survival, in the end, depends upon our ability to navigate a hostile world swarming with unforeseen dangersin this case, drive a sports car through an endless ""sea"" of harmless-looking birds. Birds that, at any moment, might swoop down and destroy us. (You can bet that that flimsy convertible roof of Melanie's car won't save them from the apocalypse.) Still, a ray of light shines through the stormy clouds in the distance. A ray of hope? It's hard to say.<br/><br/>You can also interpret the film as a Biblical prophesy, a Freudian nightmare, a battle of Jungian archetypes, or an old-fashioned monster movie without a traditional monster. However you slice it, The Birds is an endlessly fascinating, immensely entertaining, and intellectually challenging epic of the imagination. <br/><br/>I know I'm in the minority here, but I think it's Hitchcock's Best. Movie. Ever.<br/><br/>(And I haven't even mentioned the terrific acting, visual effects, costumes, editing, or Bernard Herman's brilliant sound design.)"
"Horror-yo","5","6","14","21 September 2016"," Overrated, ambiguously structured, easy Hitchcock
","This is a great opportunity to state that Hitchcock was really more of a great/legendary businessman than he was a great director. He never wrote any of the films he worked on, but knew how to spot and exploit a story with cinematic potential. There isn't so much an artistic style to his films as there is a know-how stamp or signature.<br/><br/>This here is yet another Hitchcock film, one more down the conveyor belt of prolific industrial mainstream production.<br/><br/>We're given a long narrative in the first part between basically one man and a woman, with the typical bit of mystery that always starts off the Hitchcock films. This would all turn out to be quite vain when we understand what the film really is about: exactly what the title suggests. It seems wasteful to have spent that much time developing so much story and intrigue in human relationship so far-removed from what this film ultimately becomes, and is as a horror concept.<br/><br/>There isn't an interesting thought or a subtle reason behind the strange happenings and every scene is more linear development in the bird catastrophe and never does the movie attempt to create a symbol or hidden/double meaning out of this. This is just cheap 60's horror, with strawman characters and moments that are today absolute clichés of the genre - and whether it was impressive visually for its time is absolutely irrelevant today, and additionally there's a terrible lack of attention to detail: all the scenes where they're outside where the birds are, forget to close doors despite the wind of chaos, etc etc...<br/><br/>The fact there isn't music in key moments was nice, but terribly thin as an excuse to call this a cinematic masterpiece. This is another by-the-numbers lazy Hitchcock marketing/business idea, and once again he'd achieved undeserved recognition for a highly, highly overrated piece. A very lucky, right man in the right place character, Alfred Hitchcock, with an eye and a mind to seize the opportunity, and juice it."
"Howlin Wolf","5","5","11","4 January 2005"," It MIGHT be 'terrifying' if I could buy it - but I can't...
","... and not just because of the effects. The characters are about as 'substantial' as birdseed, too; leading me to begin cheering for our 'feathered friends', instead! There's a term we use today for the 'singleminded' nature of the actions of Hedren's character Melanie Daniels - it's called 'stalking'!! Still, given that there just 'happens' to be someone else on the island who was drawn there by the weird and unexplained 'magnetism' of Taylor's character; it seems ALL of the inhabitants have been struck down by some form of 'bird flu' before our little tweeters even START to get 'nasty'! What we are led to believe is that he has some sort of 'coterie' going on down there - it's laughable.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was too 'classy' to fall prey to the modern directorial syndrome of someone itching to get onto the next big 'setpiece', but here this usually masterful 'restraint' only became part of my problem: There was just nothing sufficiently 'interesting' or even likable about these characters to warrant my investment in the seemingly piffling problems of their lives; and when they DID start coming under 'siege', I can honestly say I was GLAD, more than anything! Save the absurd notion that this is somehow 'classic Hitch', or even a classic of its kind - that sort of 'kneejerk overreaction' to already inherently silly material is... well, 'for the birds', really! 5/10."

","When it comes to horror movies, I love the genre and I don't usually get scared of horror movies, but MY GOD this was a TERRIFYING experience as a kid! Alfred Hitchcock, the master and the one and only master of suspense and horror has brought us many films and his most memorable and iconic films are Psycho and this film. The Birds is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and I think some reasons for that are that Alfred Hitchcock takes the suspense in this movie very dark if he needs to in certain scenes. There was also no composed score or music in this film which actually made the film feel a little realistic and it STILL terrifies me today! The acting in this film is top notch and the story is pretty solid and I thought some of the characters such as Melanie played by Tippi Hedren and Mitch Brenner played by Rod Taylor were really fleshed out throughout the majority of the film. But for me, the scariest thing about this film is that you don't know why these birds are attacking people. It's just the sense of horror that you feel in these birds when you see them hurting and killing people and it is absolutely TERRIFYING! The mystery behind this film on why these birds are going insane for no reason is absolutely frightening to watch and this has to be one of the greatest horror movies I've seen in a while and it's definitely one of the scariest movies, especially if it's made by a true legend of the genre. I love The Birds. The atmosphere of the film is disturbing and creepy and the movie itself is very scary and it's one of my all time favorite horror classics and i'm gonna give The Birds a 10/10."

","I cant say much about The Birds (1963) because everyone knows why its so good, everyone knows why its so effective, well written and well directed. Its just a classic horror film that manages to be scary and creepy despite its absurd premise.<br/><br/>I believe this is one the movies that inspired all those killer animals films, but this one is one of the better ones in that genre. Probably because most of those other films lack the kind of writing that this one has, they don't develop their characters well enough so by the time something happens to them you really don't care, in The Birds you do care and you root for these people even if they aren't the most likable people on earth. Also, the bird attacks in the film are really well directed, another aspect those movies lacked."

Everyone definitely knew what they were doing with this film. Also, this movie has some pretty intense scenes that will keep you right on the edge of your seat! The script is very well put together, and really delves into each individual character, not that I expected anything less from Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. I enjoyed listening to the dialouge between the characters. I also liked the actiony edge of your seat intense scenes that Hitchcock sprinkled into the movie. Very well made likable movie! 9/10"
"Red-Barracuda","9","2","3","11 April 2011"," Innovative and enigmatic horror film from Hitchcock
","Along with Psycho, The Birds was the other film in Alfred Hitchcock's double horror attack of the early 60's. While it isn't as good as the former, this is still a superlative chiller from the Master of Suspense. For those who don't know, it tells the tale of a young woman who travels to a remote fishing village with a couple of caged lovebirds; immediately thereafter the town is assaulted by the bird population in a bizarre collective attack.<br/><br/>One of the chief strong points of The Birds is its sense of mystery. Hitchcock cleverly realized that what makes the film scary is the unknowable motivation of the title creatures. He plays upon the slight strangeness of birds, the way that we can never fully relate to them in the first place. Their subsequent assault is therefore made all the more frightening, as well as seeming plausible. Added to this is the idea that Tippi Hedren's character is somehow a catalyst for the bird attacks. She brings a couple of caged birds to the village and from this point all hell breaks loose. It's really left to the viewer's own judgement if they decide to read anything into this theory, but it is certainly a nice additional angle, and it even is addressed by characters in the film when the towns folk round on Hedren and accuse her of bringing this curse upon the town.<br/><br/>Technically the film is full of trick shots. Some are showing their age but you really have to recognize that this is a movie from the early 60's and it clearly was cutting edge and ambitious. I'm not entirely sure, however, about Hitchcock's insistence in shooting characters in a studio to get the right light and then superimposing them in front of the background for external shots. He does this in many occasions here and it is sometimes distractingly false looking. Still, this is a minor complaint.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is maybe my favourite cool blonde actress that Hitchcock used. For such an inexperienced thespian she really is excellent. Very beautiful and aloof; just what the character requires. Much like Marion Crane from Psycho she has a dark side to her, and she follows a similar path to Crane into the film whereby the story trajectory is such that it looks like it will develop in an entirely different way to the manner it eventually does. The ominous bird behaviour is slowly added into the film until it becomes the film. The attacks themselves are very convincing, while Hitch incorporates the birds themselves into some of his more traditional suspenseful sequences, like where all of a sudden we see the creatures massed on the children's climbing frame, which a few moments previously had been empty. Ever the experimenter Hitchcock also effectively has no soundtrack here. A very unusual thing to do. Instead he got Bernard Herrmann to create a soundscape made up of bird noises. A fairly avant-garde approach, but it works.<br/><br/>The Birds is one of the best horror films from the 60's. It's also a great film from Alfred Hitchcock. Either of these aspects should be enough for most people."
"bts1984","10","2","3","21 November 2010"," As groundbreaking and terrifying as 'Jaws', 12 years sooner than 'Jaws'
","Like most Hitchcock's films, 'The Birds' is as original as it is dramatic, bizarre, dark and macabre although not as weird as such Hitchcock's films as 'Psycho', for example.<br/><br/>The effects are almost unbelievable for the standards of 1963, so much that it wouldn't be far from the truth to claim that even now these effects would be a surprise. Plus, the Bodega Bay scenario is so beautiful that it brings visual appeal and charm to the film.<br/><br/>This movie deals with unusual bird attacks against humankind. It's as if the birds had declared war against us. They develop strange and aggressive behavior. Even the innocent love birds act funny (although they don't actually harm anyone). The attacks start off as minor, but eventually increase with increasing viciousness and violence. Innovative, ground-breaking, unique, surprising, shocking, chaotic and great are some of the words that perfectly describe this motion picture. As far as I know, there's nothing quite like it. Think of ""The Birds"" as the ""Jaws"" of its day.<br/><br/>It kind of makes me wonder if this movie made many people look at birds differently, particularly those who had the chance to watch it in 1963. The birds responsible for the attacks are seagulls, crows and perhaps even ravens, birds known for their bad temper. Gulls are such beautiful, elegant, graceful and noble-looking and confident-looking birds that fly beautifully – even though their foul temper is another one of their trademarks.<br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes. In fact, all of the birds's attacks are memorable scenes. Even the birds's sounds when they make noise, peck and flap their wings are awesome. This film makes a great combination of terror and suspense in an old-fashioned way with its old-fashioned charm. It is also rich in light humor. <br/><br/>The cast is clever and quite interesting. <br/><br/>Rod Taylor is terrific and great fun as the smug but cool and charming lawyer Mitch Brenner. His chemistry with Melanie Daniels (well portrayed by Tippi Hedren) is perfect in a most unusual and, most of all, hilarious way. I love it how they keep telling lies to each other and the way they are clearly enjoying that, which results in many memorable moments of comedy. Equally hilarious is how two men kept saying that the little Brenner girl's name was either Alice or Lois when her name has nothing to do with those: Cathy.<br/><br/>Veronica Cartwright's performance as Cathy Brenner is extremely good and her enormous eyes are very expressive. Jessica Tandy is an interesting choice as Lydia Brenner, the overprotective mother of Mitch and Cathy. While her acting is very good, what really rings a bell on me is the fact that she looks almost exactly the same as Tippi Hedren. She looks as if she was a much older version of Tippi Hedren.<br/><br/>The Brenners are an unusual family. Mitch is so much older and bigger than Cathy that he looks much more as if he is her father than her brother. Lydia is elderly enough to look like Mitch's mother, but looks much more as if she is Cathy's grandmother than her mother. What a strange family...<br/><br/>Suzanne Pleshette is pretty natural as the teacher Annie Hayworth. Plus, she oozed sophistication and grace and had a sexy husky voice. Ethel Griffies is a very interesting choice as Mrs. Bundy, the English ornithologist, who happens to be a very interesting character with nothing more than a minor role in the movie. I don't know the name of the actor who portrayed the character who kept saying that the war of the birds against humans was the Apocalypse, but whoever he was his acting was absolutely impeccable. Even the other adults and children with minor roles are all very well chosen and do quite well in their roles. <br/><br/>Overall, a triumphant movie experience from the iconic Master of Suspense.<br/><br/>Title in Portugal: 'Os Pássaros'."

In this motion picture, the birds turn against humans. Apparently, this movie made many people fear the birds after watching it. I don't believe this could happen in real life. I mean, I know that birds can attack when they are messed up with or when they feel threatened but I don't believe they'd attack with no reason, much less entire crowds of birds.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is what could happen if birds declared war against humankind in real life. The movie is triumphant on this. What it lacks is an explanation. The movie is nearly 2 hours long and it just ends without explaining why did the birds attack people. Was it revenge? Some kind of mental disease or virus? We don't know.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't exactly get ""bird phobia"" because of this film, it somewhat makes one look at birds differently. I even remember once coming near some construction near the sea and I realized there were a cup of gulls standing on its roof and it was a bit creepy - it made me think of this film, particularly the scene when Melanie is on the school yard sitting on the fence near the playground, smoking a cigarette and we see behind her a bird flying to a jungle gym and then more and more birds show up until the whole playground is full of them.<br/><br/>The birds of the film are mostly seagulls, crows and ravens (they're the ones that viciously attack) but there also parakeets (hilariously called ""lovebirds"" in the film). The parakeets never do any harm, but they get crazy in some scenes. <br/><br/>The film takes place in Bodega Bay, California - which is almost like the apocalypse with all those birds attacks. Many of these birds attacks are impressing, including those which children are attacked at school. Besides, the loud sounds of the birds are brilliant and accent the atmosphere: both the sounds of them ""yelling"" (they are well know for being noisy birds) and the crazy sounds of them flapping their winds.<br/><br/>As for the cast, the best ones are Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels, Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner, Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner and a very attractive Suzanne Pleshette as the teacher Annie Hayworth.<br/><br/>This should definitely be on Top 250."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","2","3","27 February 2010"," Hitchcock proved to us in ""Psycho"" that even a low-budget horror film can be art. The same applies for his deservedly famous creature feature ""The Birds.""
","Alfred Hitchcock was the master of the thriller genre. He invented techniques that to this day are used by other filmmakers (though not to the same level) to stimulate excitement and dread in the hearts of the audience. And Hitchcock was willing to try anything new. By 1963, Hitchcock had made just about every kind of thriller he could. He'd made his sheer suspense thriller ""Rear Window."" He'd made his nonstop, lighthearted thriller ""North by Northwest,"" his psychological thriller and ultimate masterpiece ""Vertigo,"" and of course, need I say it, ""Psycho."" What else was there for him to try in the genre but a creature feature? The film he made was called ""The Birds,"" and it is a richly complex thriller that, despite its flaws, reaches the level, I say, of being a masterpiece on the same tier as the films I just mentioned.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" starts out not with an attack by a creature, but setting up the human story, a bold and efficacious move of storytelling. Tippi Hedren stars as Melanie Daniels, a San Francisco playgirl who travels to a small coastal town in northern California in order to pay a mischievous visit on the lawyer (Rod Taylor) who humiliated her. After she arrives in the town, strange incidents involving birds of all species begin to take place and before long, Melanie as well as the whole town begin to realize that birds have started an attack on humankind. And the most horrifying thing is, nobody can find out why.<br/><br/>Now in plot ""The Birds"" sounds corny and unbelievable. But like I've told people many times, plot is just an attention-getter. It's the story that matters and ""The Birds"" works on that level. Hitchcock was always a director to break conventions and he does that here. Instead of opening up with a clichéd scene like a bird attack, he opens up with our human story and works that well into the first hour of the picture before the attacks really start coming furiously. And this human story, most notably the relationship between Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor and their mutual friendship with a somewhat unhappy school teacher wonderfully played by the late Suzanne Pleschette really gets you involved, much more than you would expect to be in a movie of this genre. What else is daring? Try the fact that there is no music score. Bernard Herrmann is credited, but only as a sound consultant. And of course, there is the fact that not once throughout the whole picture is it explained directly to us why birds have all of a sudden started a war on humankind. That's a bold and surprisingly effective move than if Hitchcock had opted to go with a tired old scientific speech to further the fowl plot and extend running time. Tippi Hedren and the cast are very good in their roles and help translate the dialogue into the personalities of three-dimensional human beings. I believed and liked these characters, most notably the one played by Suzanne Pleschette, and that really got me involved when their lives were threatened.<br/><br/>As a thriller, ""The Birds,"" of course, scores with excellence. Hitchcock at first just introduces little shocking moments to get us stimulated and then, when we know that there's a danger, he again goes with his suspense theory, where the buildup is long and drawn-out and the actual moment of the threat is run through quickly and there are some genuinely scary moments in this motion picture. Only a director of Hitchcock's status could make seagulls and finches and crows into some of the most frightening cinema villains, who scare me a lot more than say the modern-day slasher villains that try to become Norman Bates. ""The Birds"" utilizes some very good graphic effects to insert birds and human actors into the same shot and the composition is very good. There is a flaw in one scene, where a colony of birds flood into a house through a chimney and we can see palm-sized pheasants fluttering about in the shots, clearly a lot smaller than they would be, but that's a minor detractor. Hitchcock also keeps the level of horror under control by not pouring out fountains of blood, but using just enough of it to get a reaction from the audience.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and that's why Alfred Hitchcock is still one of the most popular directors of all time. He made great, original movies, but he made them for the audience and he wanted them to have fun. And ""The Birds"" is a lot of fun. Now if you've had problems with the way Hitchcock chose to end his movies in the past, you'll have your biggest fit with this one, but I implore you to try not to and enjoy the movie. This is Hitchcock's creature feature and one of the best I have seen."

","After initially viewing this movie I thought to myself, how could have anyone pulled this off? Alfred Hitchcock truly is a legend that will live on in the history of cinema. He managed to grip and hold the audience as they shook in their seats much like how the birds managed to grip and hold Jessica Tandy and she shook herself to deter the birds.<br/><br/>This epic film literally made me look out the window daring never to step outside my balcony to see if any birds were around hovering in packs ready to steer themselves into my homes.<br/><br/>It is quite enthralling and truly spectacular to be able to capture suspense in the manner Alfred Hitchcock did in this film and actually shake the vary foundations one feels in their house, one should feel safe and secure, but after viewing this movie one will not hesitate to lock twice.<br/><br/>Many credits should be given to anyone who participated in the making of this masterpiece and one will certainly love the beautiful Technicolor of the 1960's.<br/><br/>The acting was magnificent and many applauds to all actors and actresses. I found the acting of Rod Taylor truly magnificent as he played the role of a man looking for love but powerfully dominated mentally by his mother while all the time having to deal with a bird infestation problem. Of course one cannot doubt the beauty of Jessica Tandy and her acting in Birds, particularly the final scene where she enters the very much realistic trance after her final attack by the birds! Overall wonderful film, and very surprised, provides a bit of many worlds which includes romance, thriller, and suspense.<br/><br/>Thank you Hitch! (The Master of Suspense) 9/10"

","When Melanie Daniels (Hedren) visits a mysterious man in Bodega Bay, she and the townsfolk are struck by the vicious nature of the local birds.<br/><br/>3 years had passed since Alfred Hitchcock had sat in the director's chair for a horror film and in that time there was outstanding reviews for Psycho, the horror of a lifetime. That 1960 release was widely publicised and so there was a lot to live up to in 1963 when The Birds was released, and as usual for the British director, he knocked us over once more.<br/><br/>Psycho was a shocking wake up to the realisation of human madness and Hitchcock again gains access to a concept of realization in this horror by depicting what many would assume as normal well mannered and beautiful creatures, and adds a horrifying viciousness to the birds to give a sharp and tantalizing story that will grip and shock you right till the claustrophobic and nerve jangling finale.<br/><br/>The film begins, as usual for the legendary director, with a wonderful montage title sequence. We see a flock of birds acting unusually as the credits roll. It is a complete beautiful blur of wings and fighting with the screeches unmistakable and the juxtaposition of sound and motion gears viewers up for the horrific adventure to come.<br/><br/>After another wonderfully cheeky cameo by Hitchcock we are introduced to central character Melanie who, after a flirtatious debate with a strange good looking man, uses her influences to track him down. As the stunning Tippi Hedren makes her way to Bodega Bay with a surprise install for Taylor's Mitch Brenner, Hitchcock delivers a wonderful car driving montage again. If not as springy as those in Vertigo but the feeling of anticipation is nailed down. If you haven't seen the Birds yet and have read reviews, you will feel the same wonderful excitement I felt to, and it is definitely worth it.<br/><br/>Hitchcock after all is known as the master of suspense and one of the main reasons why this film works so gloriously is the fact the tension and surprise is built up in such a constructed free and significantly realistic way. What starts out as a minor attack on a boat turns into a town spread panic that generates tension and horror of the utmost brilliance, the suspense and anticipation is brilliantly priceless.<br/><br/>Of all of Hitchcock's films, The Birds is surely one of the best filmed. To create the shots of the animals sitting on the climbing frames at the school, to have them all swooping down the chimney, it is simply breathtaking film-making and as a viewer, you feel rewarded and treated to this suspense and appreciation of horror and the unnatural.<br/><br/>Once the birds attack there is never any let up in suspense as the characters try to find solutions and look for any way to survive and as in true Hitchcock fashion, he delivers a smart horror that generates realism with a swooping and smart depiction of the nature of the winged creatures that will shock and scare right till the end. Excellence."
"varundelpiero","8","2","3","23 October 2008"," Hitchcock at his finest...
","Alfred Hitchcock is considered by many to be a master of suspense, and this becomes evident upon viewing THE BIRDS. While the film itself may not be considered one of the greatest, it is a classic example of Hitchcock's mastery of the art of suspense thrillers.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film is its strong point; it is slow and deliberate, and allows the viewer to get a better understanding or 'feel' of the lead characters. One may argue that the buildup is somewhat boring, but it is with this pacing that Hitchcock garners his accolades.<br/><br/>Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy perform competently well in a motion picture that drew many snickers form the 'elite' movie-going public. In fact, many dismissed the entire concept of the movie as ridiculous. For this film, Hitchcock takes a relatively unpopular premise and turns it into a classic, and that to me is the genius of the man.<br/><br/>The special effects at that time (1962/3) were ground-breaking, and even watching them today, the viewer can't help but get the feeling that the effects take on a rather hauntingly genuine quality, one that adds to the overall feeling of tension that pervades the majority of the second half of the film.<br/><br/>The film itself is one that will encourage viewers to use their own intellects to try to determine what really happened, and as a result many different theories and perspectives are formed. As such, it is regarded as one of the more thought-provoking of Hitchcock's classics. On that note, Hitchcock himself has never (allegedly) provided any concrete explanation for the events that transpire in this film, merely stating that if he does so the film then becomes a work of science fiction, and not a work of suspense.<br/><br/>3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should warrant a place on my Honourable Mentions list. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the genre."

","Birds are not different from human beings.There are as keen on wrecking irreparable damage on people whom they despise as human beings have always made a point to damage minds and souls of other human beings.This is the fundamental concept of ""The Birds"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock.This idea might not appear to be rational to all those who think that birds are innocent souls flying high in mighty sky.If they are really innocent as human beings make them to appear, why is it that not even a single bird other than a parrot is capable of emoting human sentiments.The Birds has been hailed as a horror film as it creates a painful feeling in the minds of people.It is amazing that the feeling of horror is conveyed using real birds.This demonstrates how Mr.Hitchcock was ahead of his times in a world devoid of useless technology.It is such a wonder that ordinary looking birds have fooled devilish human beings who have always felt that birds are nothing but prosaic living organisms who never meant much to human beings.A word about Tippi Hedren.She is a joy to watch as she has been deftly directed by Alfred Hitchcock who has helped her to get over her ""maimed lamb"" persona which was created when she appeared in their previous joint venture ""Marnie""."

","After briefly flirting with a young man in a bird store, Melanie Daniels, decides to see him again. Her search brings her to a quiet coastal town of Bodega Bay. Inexplicably birds of all types start to pester people and it isn't long before they begin to outright attack in swarms and no one can figure out why...<br/><br/>Not many effects and shock based films age well as the audiences definition of shock changes over time. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' from 1930 was the most graphically realistic war film of its time, yet it is seems like a remarkably lightweight next to 'Saving Private Ryan.' Hitchcock, however is often an exception to this unofficial rule. His films are never re-made, just mimicked and even those outright mimic often produce good films - DePalma's 'Dressed to Kill' with it's grisly elevator murder is a clear copy of 'Psycho' but is still a great on screen murder. So Hitchcock doesn't age, he is just continuously appreciated and Brian DePalma borrowing heavily from him has become a fine thriller director is his own right.<br/><br/>'The Birds' is a clear example of Hitchcock's unsurpassed ability to get audiences biting their nails. He just lets things happen and sets about showing them in the best way possible. The birds of the title literally just appear and begin to cause hell and the film just shows it almost as if it were happening and you were there amidst the swarm. The film also has groundbreaking sound and visual effect design as virtually all the birds were faked - aurally composed by Bernard Hermann and visually superimposed from many other shots. Today's seamless computer effects show that Hitchcock has plenty of apparent limitations, but he still did a remarkable job. He must have known his limitations since he sets up shots to make them relatively unapparent. He works with what he has and that results in a landmark of the suspense genre. Other films in the same vein, such as 'The Swarm' from the 70s can't lay a feather to 'The Birds.' Also, there is a subtle (actually, in your face!) reference to James Whale's classic monster movie 'Frankenstein' - can you find it?<br/><br/>The only thing that is left to be desired is that some of the characterizations seem a outdated by today's standards. But, then again, this isn't a classic because it's new! --- 10/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for terror/violence"

","A Hitchcock masterpiece from beginning to end. The escalating suspense to the bleakest ending. Every single second in these Hithcock films remains faithful to the entire concept. He was obsessed with birds and here we have them take over Bodega bay, their revenge on mankind. And they succeed. I love how his films start in one direction, like with Psycho, and then at some point take this tangent into an unimaginable direction for the leading characters in our film. The closer one examines this film the more one realizes how frighteningly excellent it is. The birds is an all time classic I could watch again and again. It must have taken a hell of a lot of patience to make such a film back then when there was no computer to aid special effects. And yet now today that we do have all the equipment, I can't think of who has the capacity to come up with a film of such a high calabre of genius. I would not be in the least bit surprised if they make the remake of this sooner or later. They have already done Psycho again unnecessarily."

","""Psycho"" may have been the scariest Hitchcock film, but there is no film by the master of suspense more unsettling than ""The Birds."" This enigmatic revenge-of-nature fable makes no effort to explain away its mysteries, and that's the most unsettling thing about it. What is nature seeking revenge for? Why is the birds' uprising timed to begin with the appearance in a sleepy little coastal town of an icy blonde from the city? Why is everyone so antagonistic toward said blonde? Is it only because she appears to have designs on the resident golden boy stud, or is there more to it? <br/><br/>Ultimately, these questions end up not mattering much. Three-fourths of the film concern itself with the tensions (sexual and otherwise) between Tippi Hedren's Melanie and the townspeople; then all hell breaks loose in the last quarter and these tensions are completely forgotten. The genius of the film lies in its ability to make horror out of the mundane. At the apocalyptic end, as the rag-tag group of survivors drive off into the distance, watched by a bird army that covers the ground as far as the eye can see, the effect on the viewer is as powerful as if the survivors had awakened the morning after a nuclear holocaust.<br/><br/>And perhaps most unsettling of all is Hitchcock's refusal to use any kind of incidental scoring in his film. You don't realize how much we rely on film music to tell us how we should feel until it's no longer there to do so.<br/><br/>With Rod Taylor as the stud, who keeps that famous hairy chest under wraps (sorry ladies); Suzanne Pleshette, as the butch and sexually repressed school marm; Jessica Tandy, in the film's best performance as a mother who relies a little too much on her son; and Veronica Cartwright, whose presence in any film is like nails on a chalkboard.<br/><br/>A strange masterpiece, and Hitchcock's last great film.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","The Birds is certainly another highlight in Hitchcock's diary of directing movies after Psycho. He portrays an unusual but terrifying journey where our feathered friends do anything and everything they can to makes lives hell.<br/><br/>Many thrillers use extremely ominous background music to heighten the amount of tension and fear, but the lack of it in The Birds is actually more chilling than I would have first thought. The opening titles featured no music either; instead it includes an immense flapping of wings, and was an intriguing and wonderful concept which works extremely well.<br/><br/>A credible performance from Tippi Hedren in her film debut, and she certainly proved herself a worthy actress in the lines of Janet Leigh and Vera Miles. Melanie Daniels is a glamorous and easily likable character.<br/><br/>The Birds is a masterpiece in suspense and horror, and I have watched it a hundred times. The 32 different shots for the chilling final scene simply showcased Hitchcock's directing ability, but this final cut doesn't answer the question as to why the birds attack. We still have no idea why, and this unanswered question along with many others makes The Birds into an all-time classic.

Is it man's wake up call to treat nature with more respect? Is this all a manifestation of Mitch's sexual frustration and annoyance at his clinging mother who can't let go? Who knows but too wallow and psychoanalyse in this is largely missing the point. The true strength of this picture is in its visual power and assembly of shots. Hitchcock employs so much trickery and gimmickry that you are left feeling that you have just watched a lesson in montage and composition. Static shots are interrupted by movement and the process is repeated. Its like watching an eerie photograph punctuated by forward zooms and then back to the freeze frame.

"budmassey","10","2","3","18 September 2006"," Nature's Delicate Balance Disturbed.
","The Birds is one of Alfred Hitchcocks best known, if not best loved, films. It tells the tale of a small northern California town inexplicably besieged by birds. Or does it? To say so is like saying that The Maltese Falcon is about a statue of a bird.<br/><br/>Any literary connection between this film and the Daphne DuMaurier short story is purely accidental. Hitch kept nothing more than the title, and the rest is Evan Hunter's creation. Hunter, part of Hitch's machine, created what became a perfect vehicle for Hitch's vocabulary that had, by this time, become almost cliché.<br/><br/>There is the domineering mother, the dutiful son, the salacious blonde, and the slow, gentle descent into terror that only Hitch could weave from these threads. But as with any great story, which this is, one must look deeper to see the true meaning.<br/><br/>Consider this. Only when Melanie Daniels arrives in Bodega Bay do the birds begin their attacks, which is to say that her arrival somehow spoils the balance in Bodega Bay. In what way, you might ask. Well, one can't help but notice that Mitch Brenner sees Melanie as someone he might be interested in, even to the point of neglecting his clinging and needy mother. Surely Melanie disturbs the stalemate between Mitch and his former lover, the long-suffering school teacher Annie Hayworth. And, with her big city ways, she is in general a disquieting influence on the town.<br/><br/>Nature too maintains a delicate balance that can easily be thrown off balance, just as Bodega Bay is thrown off balance when Melanie breezes in with her convertible, her mink coat, and that pathetic little Edith Head green suit that she wears day after day as the movie progresses. In fact, the first bird attack is on Melanie herself, and for a time the attacks center around her.<br/><br/>Once unleashed, however, the force of nature spreads throughout the town. Hitch himself said the central theme of The Birds is Man's unworthiness to have dominion over Nature. As the movie progresses, he reverses that condition, giving Nature dominion over Man. In fact, the small birdcage of lovebirds foreshadows a later scene in which the Brenner home has become a sort of cage with the birds imprisoning the Brenners inside.<br/><br/>Having made this point, Hitch seemed to have nowhere to go. The original ending had Mitch, Melanie and crew eventually speeding away in her sexy convertible. The ending Hitch filmed instead was far more memorable, because it is another stalemate, leaving the viewer to wonder what might ultimately happen.<br/><br/>This film has aged remarkably well. Having not relied on special effects, which date films so badly, it loses nothing over time. The true genius of The Birds is its slow and almost inevitable slide into a terror that doesn't seem far fetched at all, unlike the preposterous premises for most modern suspense films. Of course, another delight is the powerful cast. Jessica Tandy, Susanne Pleshette, and Rod Taylor are flawless, as is Hitch's masterful touch.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

"Putzberger","Null","2","3","17 May 2006"," Blonde Power!
","What makes ""The Birds"" so damn compelling? Of course it skillfully manipulates our fears: its graphic depiction of innocent people getting pecked to death is disturbing, but be honest . . . do humans have a deep-rooted fear of seagulls? I don't think so. Maybe it's because the bird attacks are such an effective dramatization of Melanie Daniels' emotional fragility. But there are any number of symbols -- shattered perfume bottles, broken music boxes, ad infinitum -- that could have testified to Melanie's exquisiteness and delicacy. Why choose screeching winged creatures? Or maybe it's the apocalyptic undertone to the film -- perhaps the brainy old lady in the coffee shop is the equivalent of a mad prophet of doom for our secular age. But why frame the end of the world with a troubled, probably hopeless romance? I think the ultimate message of ""The Birds,"" Hitch's most personal film, is about the destructive power inherent in . . . blonde women.<br/><br/>Think about it. A sexy blonde lady comes to a small California town and all hell breaks loose. Wispy, wimpy, towheaded Tippi Hedren represents a threat to Mother that sober, sensible, brunette Suzanne Pleshette could never approach. There is a central clash of symbols in ""The Birds:"" the two lovebirds in a cage, i.e. eroticism contained by domesticity, vs. a flock of violent birds destroying the town, i.e. eroticism unleashed. So even though Melanie Daniels is coming to town to deliver the lovebirds, bringing with her the fragile hope of monogamous bliss, she unwillingly provokes a dangerous and violent response because of who she is. (If you don't get it, just wait until the scene after the birds attack the gas station and the homely housewife screams at poor Tippi: ""you brought them here! YOU! YOU! YOU!"") Blonde women must exist as some sort of archetype in our collective, Jungian unconscious, because time and again they prove to be a menace to the existing order: Marilyn enthralls the Kennedy brothers and could have brought down their administration if she'd opened her pretty mouth; beautiful Diana almost destroys the monarchy and endangers Britain's ossified class system by exposing the shallowness of upper-class English life; Martha must suffer for all of our sins because her blonde superiority makes her the symbol for corporate malfeasance. ""The Birds"" is merely a fictional retelling of the elemental myth of the Blonde femme fatale. I don't know if the word ""bird"" became slang for ""girl"" before or after this movie, but I hardly think it's a coincidence. ""Birds,"" indeed."

It's amazing they were able to do this sort of movie way before computers were in use for filming.<br/><br/>I recommend it to the Hitchcock fans or people that like alternate/usual realities."

","The narrative here is quite brilliant...the first half is spent building a world through the central metaphor of 'caged lovebirds'. Then it spends the second half turning that on its head by restructuring the perception of the cage.<br/><br/>The master, Hitchcock, uses gradual 'tilts' before flipping us...the tilting gag birds in the sports car, the tilted restaurant door's window, the tilted 'God looking down' perspective...small details indicative of the whole, and at the end, we find ourselves completely captivated. I imagine the original critics were just as clueless as the besieged townsfolk. Hitchcock, winking at us all along, exaggerates them as much as he can to make his point.<br/><br/>Along the way there is NO soundtrack, and NO gratuitous screaming, heightening the creeping sense of terror (NOT 'horror', a completely different beast...)<br/><br/>See this on a dark night for a truly squirm inducing, visceral thrill."

","I've been trying to enjoy this movie for years. The performances for the most part are good, the costumes, sets and certainly the director are all great, but deep down, this movie seems very sterile and cold to me. Maybe the lack of an intriguing musical score is what I miss. Sure, the scene where the children are signing (part of the ""musical"" score), and Melanie sits down for a smoke is a classic in movie making, and shouldn't be missed. But I get distracted by Tippi. She's good in one scene, not so good in the next, and the rear projections are jarring and so fake looking. I don't know why Alfred didn't keep up with technology and try a different technique. He used rear screen projection in every movie he made, and you can pick them out each time-just think of the motorboat scene in this movie! I've heard all the metaphors before, what this scene signifies, what this phrase really means, etc., but it doesn't necessarily make a good, interesting movie."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","3","27 March 2004"," Incredible Hitchcock film... more scary than most other horror films
","Hitchcock has a unique film style; no one can do exactly what he does when directing horror films. His talent is especially obvious in this film; all the nice little touches, the old typical Hitchcock details(controlling mother, minor romance between male and female main characters, strong-willed, powerful female main character, etc.) are beautifully and discreetly put into the film, without in any way distracting from the main plot or disturbing the natural cycle of the film. I like how Hitchcock, as with several other of his big films(Psycho immediately comes to mind) starts with one story, that has nothing in particular to do with the source of the terror. The movie starts with a certain story, that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film, and ends with that story still present, instead of just flat-out starting the film with a story about birds attacking people. There are hints and a lot of foreshadowing from the very minute that the movie starts, but it's not the main theme of the film until the last fourth part. The plot is pretty good, interesting and developing consistently throughout the movie. The actors all perform very well, with no exceptions. The characters are believable, and their actions are mostly entirely understandable. In fact, I found it far more psychologically realistic, in how it portrays the different characters emotional reactions to the situations. The special effects are amazing; the film is more than forty years old and the effects look very dated today, but it still scared me more than I could have possibly imagined. I don't think I'll look at a bird the same way ever again. Another masterpiece from the master of suspense. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind watching a film that isn't entirely new, and who are looking for a good scare. I have a hard time imagining anyone not being scared by this film. 8/10"
"slokes","9","2","3","4 December 2003"," A victory lap for Hitch
","Alfred Hitchcock was on the run of his life by the early 1960s. His last three films, `Vertigo,' `North By Northwest,' and `Psycho,' were not uniformly successful in their day, but all would eventually become recognized as among an elite grouping of truly great films. In December, 2003, IMDB's own ranking system has all three in its Top 30, pretty incredible anyway you slice it. But what was really incredible was how Hitchcock came off that creative peak. Other directors might have made a vanity picture, or an overblown epic of some kind. Hitchcock made `The Birds,' an entirely different kind of film from anything he or anyone else had made before, one that would carve out its own genre for decades to come. And a pretty fine movie to boot.<br/><br/>There was never a movie as utterly out-of-the-blue as `The Birds.' Even `Psycho' had some precedent going for it. Before `Psycho,' people had killed other people for no better reason than it seemed like something worth doing at the time. But concerted offensives directed from the animal kingdom? A film that starts off as a romantic comedy i.e. `When Harry Met Sally' and ends up like `Jurassic Park' with feathers in place of scales? What people must have thought in 1963!<br/><br/>Tippi Hendren stars as Melanie Daniels, a sort of Paris Hilton character who lives the life of a carefree trust-fund princess until a chance encounter with disapproving lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) sends her on a whimsical trip to his family home in Bodega Bay, and into the hands, or claws, of destiny. Hendren plays her very well, charming and a trifle too easygoing. Taylor offers an interesting parallel, as a smug, scarf-wearing playboy you somehow find yourself liking for (or despite) his assured charm. Whether the two will find each other or not is the principal source of interest through the first half of the film. After, of course, it's whether they get turned into bird chow.<br/><br/>Whatever sets the birds of Bodega Bay off is a mystery. Maybe it is the presence of Melanie Daniels, as one resident blurts out, though there is evidence the attack is much wider-spread. Maybe it is the environmental damage being done to the planet by humankind, just gaining expression during this period in works like `Silent Spring.' Maybe it's one too many Thanksgivings. The wherefores aren't as important as the hows, how the birds start their attacks, with slow-gathering momentum that gains in ferocity until the town of Bodega Bay is literally aflame.<br/><br/>`The Birds' doesn't get the same kind of respect as does so-called classic Hitchcock of previous decades, which is just stupid snobbery. His powers as the proclaimed `Master of Suspense' were never as much on view; not since his British period before World War II, anyway. `Vertigo' and `Suspicion' and others are good in their way, but they don't reward repeat viewings the same way `The Birds' does. Every person Melanie meets in Bodega Bay has his or her own involving personality that welcomes interest at the same time she or her serves to speed the plot along. The lunch crowd at the Tides Restaurant alone would be worth an hour of anyone else's movie. And then there's Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette, as two characters who make quite a tandem as they seem to resent Melanie's attentions on Mitch. Is their jealousy somehow at the cause of all this?<br/><br/>Editing is a chief virtue of `The Birds.' It papers over the defects in the special effects exposed by advancing technology and galvanizes attention to where Hitchcock wants it. Watch the scene where Jessica Tandy checks on the farmer with the grain problem. The three successive close-up shots of the farmer crumpled on the floor get deserved attention, but what about the way Hitchcock lets Tandy's Mrs. Brenner out of the house, with a series of basic shots, all filmed at angles to suggest how tilted her world has become, with no words or music to accompany her?<br/><br/>There's much psychology and characterization driving `The Birds,' but ultimately what makes the film worth watching are the bird attacks. Hitchcock makes you wait, but when they come, they come fast and hard, without warning or expected respite. You really gotta love the chimney scene, and the way a children's song heightens the suspense during the famous schoolyard sequence.<br/><br/>Just wish they had let the film go on an hour longer. So many more species still to hear from! How about a nice penguin assault, or an ostrich attack? Hitchcock could have put an entirely new construction to the term `duck hunt!'"

","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>After slating The Birds fifteen months ago on the IMDb I have to concede that I was talking complete nonsense. The Birds is perhaps a film that has to be watched more than once to be fully appreciated, a factor which does it few favours with a casual audience.<br/><br/>Maybe it comes from years of being told the Hitchcock films are suspenseful thrillers. An accurate description, but one that fails to take into account their camp, knowing humour. As a result the twenty and thirty somethings that didn't get to see them firsthand may be disappointed.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is a little wooden, as were the majority of Hitchcock's girls, and is caked in soft focus. The initial storyline sees her following Rod Taylor all the way from San Francisco to Bodega Bay. She goes to a lot of trouble just to get into a bloke's pants, doesn't she? The eerie mood is actually enhanced by the obvious filmed backdrops Hedren has to drive/sail in front of. It's not until the twenty-five minute point that Hedren's head is pecked by a gull.<br/><br/>The direction in terms of shots is magnificent, and the film's potency can be directly paralleled with the trailer which Hitchcock himself performed. A five-minute monologue, which tends to go on a bit, then culminates in a genuinely unsettling scene where his caged bird draws blood. It's the meandering pace of the trailer and the film that makes the eventual shocks all the more disturbing. And making you care about the characters as three-dimensional people (the first attack proper is over fifty minutes in) is a masterstroke.<br/><br/>Some of the effects to achieve the attacks may now be a little obvious, but in combining them together it works wonders. In fact, the iconography of this film is arguably more imitated than any other Hitchcock movie, including Psycho. Unusually gory for the director, its total absence of incidental music, save for a mosaic of birdcall, is also startling. The clever avoidance of any kind of explanation is the key to its real success, carefully avoiding science fiction territory. When told there's no reason for the attacks, Taylor replies ""it's happening  isn't that a reason?""<br/><br/>Some genius scenes  the light innocence of child song juxtaposed with the massing crows; the unexpected horror of the gouged eyes; a beautiful, silent aerial shot of the garage, gradually filled with squawking gulls  are vital to the film's worth. The understated conclusion, meanwhile, is probably one of the ten best climaxes cinema has to offer. It gives not even the comfort of an ""end"" caption, leaving the effects of the film to continue unresolved in the mind of the audience..."
"vostf","8","2","3","11 February 2001"," That's strictly very good ! (a strictly McGuffin movie)
","In 1960 Hitchcock topped himself off. That's exactly the point. He directed three masterpieces in three different genres. A visual investigation: Vertigo. A reference for every action movie (esp. 007 movies): North by Northwest. An horror tale, Psycho, where he reaches the top of what he always tried to do: enthrall audiences.<br/><br/>Imagine you reached the top. Then can you go further and not downhill? Fortunately Hitchcock is far from using the same recipes. But what story to shoot now it's over with all that wrong man's stuff? He wants to prove he can play with our emotions once more. The fact it is difficult to show more efficiency than in Psycho is of the utmost importance. He can't. What he can do is experimenting new ways of telling a story. That's why The Birds might look arid as some experimental movies.<br/><br/>At the summit of his art, Hitchcock knows he has nothing to account for to the critics. Some of those might have written some time 'That's strictly for the birds'. Easy to say as any critical commonplace. Now look, I'll direct no star and lay the emphasis on the technical aspect. No music but a work on sound effects (today the soundtrack is the very first by-product). For the camera work, the importance is not in the filming of the climax scenes. It's the 'resolutive' shots that follow. What I call resolutive shots is the fact you don't just get in the action and then breath. The follow up impression is much more important.<br/><br/>'There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.' That was Hitch's definition of suspense. Now he wants us breathless after the bang too. Psycho already did that, sure (remember Hermann's score after the stabbing violins). Just trying a visual experimentation (perhaps Hitch was kinda jealous of Hermann's contribution to the atmosphere of Psycho and he asked him just to make birds sing). You have two examples of resolutive shots in the overwhelming shot of Bodega Bay after the birds attack and when Mitch' mother comes back after she discovered the dead body of a neighbor.<br/><br/>The McGuffin is a great one. Why are those birds attacking us gentle human beings? Hitchcock doesn't dare inventing an other story than just filming a McGuffin. He just experiments that one; something of a sadistic attitude to his audience with no packaging. Spielberg did the same thing in Jaws: why is the shark so bad? We don't care but there's a non-sadistic ending. On the contrary Hitch shoots as if he loves us and then he fools us. No happy ending.<br/><br/>So I think this film is for Hitch fans. Strictly. Others would feel disappointed as they are not sure to understand why they've been fooled. And people usually don't want to understand as long as they feel fooled."

","Scary and classic  Hitchcock (Vertigo) movie ""The  Birds"" is a movie that I watched years ago and forgot everything except for those mean birds. I just watched it again and found it just as scary,  but also realized that there was no reasonable explanation for the bird's reaction, except that nature is just unpredictable.  I thought that the acting was great. I like Suzanne Pleshette (Rome Adventure) as Annie Hayworth and ""Mitch Brenner"" Rod Taylor (Hong -Kong), and I had not realized until now that Veronica Cartwright (The Witches of Eastwick) was the girl who played ""Cathy Brenner"" in this movie.   Also Melanie Daniels as ""Tippi Hedren"" was Marnie in that movie also by Hitchcock. I thought it was interesting to see ""Jessica Tandy"" (Driving Miss Daisy) playing a cold person such as Lydia Brenner.  Bodega Bay is a quaint little town and a great location, because Bodega Bay was so quiet until the birds started showing up one by one. My favorite quotes: Melanie Daniels ""How did you know my name."" Mitch : ""A little birdie told me.""  Favorite Scenes: Hitchcock's cameo walking dogs. Just sweet!

","""THE BIRDS"",Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic,is my second favorite film by the Master of Suspense (""Psycho"" being the best,of course). Spoiled rich girl Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren,looking as beautiful as the radiant Janet Leigh did in ""Psycho"") follows potential boyfriend Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) to Bodega Bay,California,a small fishing village near San Francisco,where our feathered friends begin to viciously attack the town's denizens. The supporting cast is excellent: Jessica Tandy as Mitch's clinging mother Lydia,Suzanne Pleshette as local schoolteacher Annie Hayworth,and a very young Veronica Cartwright as Mitch's kid sister Cathy (Hitch's screenwriting collaborators always created rich characterizations). The special effects,for the time,were very impressive,and Hitch's direction of the bird attacks is superb. An interesting note: upon viewing the movie again recently (I try to watch it once a year),I noticed that there is no musical score...the sound effects are strictly confined to the birds! The film's only flaw...why did Tippi Hedren have to wear that green dress for most of the film?! Otherwise,a classic! **** A+ (10/10)"

THE BIRDS is by far the best of the bunch I have seen (I've yet to see TOPAZ or FAMILY PLOT), but for all its brilliant thriller set-pieces and occasions of striking horror imagery, it always leaves me cold. I just don't care about the characters, who tend to strike me as annoying or underdeveloped compared to Hitchcock's classics.

","The first half hour feels like the opening of one of those Doris Day romantic comedies so popualar in the early sixties. The cute meeting of the stars in the pet store, and Melanie's flirtatious attempt to play an elaborate practical joke on the attractive guy almost make us forget we are watching a movie directed by the man who terrified us a couple of years before with PSYCHO. Then, first with one peck from a gull on Melanie's forehead, then with the discovery of a neighbor's multi-pecked corpse, we begin to realize what we're in for. Even if he had not made PSYCHO, this movie would have made his reputation. Has any director ever delivered such a ""one-two punch"" of great films in succession? It seems time to applaud the performance Tippi Heston gives here in what was her first movie role. She makes her character's slow transition from shallow socialite to traumatized heroine completely believable. And speaking of ""one/two punches,"" she jabbed two of her own with her follow-up movie, MARNIE, in which she totally carries the entire film without any help from exciting bird attacks - again for Hitchcock. We now know the director's deep obsession with this actress caused her to endure some frightening real life ordeals while working for him. It is interesting to wonder to what degree her personal anxiety contributed to her powerful performances in these two films. She is truly a woman who endured much for her art, and perhaps reluctantly helped her ""master"" achieve new heights."
"david_rudy_lee","9","1","1","12 April 2019"," Tension Driven Animal Attack Film
","My history with this film was that at least one of my parents introduced it to me. I know for a fact when it came out, it terrified my father. This film definitely shows how well director Alfred Hitchcock is at creating tension. To get into this, the official synopsis is a wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people.<br/><br/>As the synopsis states, we start with a woman going into a pet shop. She is Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren). She is a strong, independant woman and we see that with how she speaks to the woman working there. Her order isn't ready yet and she is definitely going to get her way. We then meet Mitch Brenner (Rody Taylor). He knows her as she pulled a prank on someone that caused damage and had to go to court. He pranks her and she is intrigued by the man. She decides to go to his mother's home, where he goes every weekend in Bodega Bay.<br/><br/>She ends up staying to have dinner with him. The film doesn't waste too much time as she is attacked by a seagull before she can get off the boat she rented. The attacks become more and more frequent and the number of birds continues to grow.<br/><br/>This film is scary for the fact that there are so many birds not just around us every day, but in the world. If they decided to do what this film has them doing, we would be in a lot of trouble. They outnumber us and when they attack by force, the bigger birds could do some damage. Another thing that is scary, we do not ever get why they are doing it, why they don't continually attack or anything, they just do and not knowing why is scarier. Even the other people in the film don't know and begin to blame Melanie because it started when she got there. I could buy this as it is becoming hysterical.<br/><br/>The love story in this film I wanted to touch on briefly. From the beginning, we see that Melanie and Mitch have a connection. I really think that Hitchcock did a good job at developing their relationship. They don't fall for each other immediately. They actually seem to bump heads. It seems natural to build. Something I really noticed in this last viewing as well is the development of the characters; we get scenes where the birds are in the background. Characters may or may not notice them, but we as viewers can. It is another way that Hitchcock builds tension and makes him a master of it.<br/><br/>There is an interesting feeling to how the film is edited though. I have stated that Hitchcock is great at building tension. When you see characters walking outside and there are birds accumulating, but you don't know what will set them off or when they are attacking and you don't know if they will get in or not. Both of these got my anxiety up and I've seen this film a few times. An issue I have though is that we lose some of the tension in a few scenes. An example is when Melanie brings Mitch's mother tea, Lydia (Jessica Tandy). We are given insight in her character, but I don't think it is needed. It just drags the film out. I will say though overall, the tension does build and we get an amazing final shot.<br/><br/>The acting is well done as well. Taylor is a great hero. Hedren is beautiful and becomes a great damsel in distress. My problem though is that she is built up to be the main character. During the climax she goes catatonic and we see Taylor taking over. I didn't care for this shift. Tandy is solid as the mother. I just don't know if we needed to flesh her out as much as we got. It doesn't add a lot to the story in my opinion. Mitch's sister Cathy is played by a young Veronica Cartwright. It is crazy to see her so young and she was fine in this film. There is also his former flame, she is the local school teacher Annie Hayworth. She is played by Suzanne Pleshette, she doesn't have a lot of time in this film, but what she does is good. The rest of the cast round the film out for what they needed.<br/><br/>As to the effects of the film, I thought they were pretty well done for the time period. They didn't have a lot to work with and it isn't perfect what they did. They used superimposing images on top of each other, which does work fairly well. There is a scene in the house where it doesn't. It doesn't look great, but it is still effective. I do give them credit for getting as many birds as they do. The film also was shot amazing. It looks great.<br/><br/>What I was really impressed by was the score of the film. The music itself doesn't stand out aside from the scene where Melanie is waiting for Annie while she is teaching the class. We get this somewhat cheery song the children are singing, but you hear the birds making noise as they gather in the playground. The rest of the soundtrack was pretty subtle. What really creeped me out was the sounds of the birds when you can't see them. It is so loud and you know there are a ton of them.<br/><br/>This is a solid horror film about when animals attack. This one isn't about something scary like a large animal, but something common we see everyday and something that severely outnumbers us. It is scary to think that if these common animals decided to start a war against us. The story actually isn't overly complex, but I love that we don't know why these birds or doing this. The hysteria it causes helps the tension. The acting was really good, as was the score of the film. It is shot very well, but there are some issues with the editing. It does build tension still and it is effective for the most part. The effects were good for the era and I didn't have major issues with it. I would highly recommend this one as it is a classic. It is a good film in my opinion."

","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is another strong film in a filmography that is nothing but strong films. This 1963 horror thriller is Hitchcock's second horror film after the chilling 1960's Psycho. This movie is the weaker of the two, but that is nothing to scoff at. This film's imagery of the birds swooping down and attacking the folks of Bodega Bay is iconic. Hitchcock enjoyed bird-watching as a child and he was fascinated what would happen if birds were to turn evil. I do not believe that Hitchcock added any messages or allegories in the film, but some people suggest the attacking birds are actually Greek Furies attacking those people who dwell in evil. The movie may not be as good as other Hitchcock movies like Rear Window, but the movie has this eerie tone that works, the acting is solid thanks to newcomer Tippi Hedren's soaring performance, and the visual effects are especially great. I could do with less of the oddly tedious love story and the change of tone (screwball comedy to suspense/horror) jarred me just a tad bit. <br/><br/>The movie starts in the city of San Francisco where criminal lawyer Mitch Brennan (Rod Taylor) means the attractive socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) at a pet shop. He plays a prank on her trying to have her act as a store clerk to purchase lovebirds, despite him knowing exactly who she is. She decides to return the favor by traveling to Bodega Bay, his hometown after she purchased the lovebirds. He lives with his overbearing mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his school-age sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). He also remains close to his ex-lover, the schoolteacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). When she arrives, she is attacked by a seagull. Also, on the day of her arrival, the citizens of Bodega Bay are also attacked by these birds. <br/><br/>The performances in the film are great. Tippi Hedren does very well in her debut on screen and she fits the model of a Hitchcock woman-an icy blonde. I would even go as far to say that she has a likeness towards Grace Kelly. Rod Taylor is the central male figure of the story, and he feeds off the women in his life. I always loved Jessica Tandy as an actress because she plays the strict, overbearing type of woman so well. It is pleasing to see that women are important in the film here as they all have major roles. They may come across as unlikable at times, but that is the point of these characters. <br/><br/>The one thing that distracted me from the movie was the love story between Mitch and Melanie. It had some good moments, but some parts were too cheesy. For instance, Lyndia does not like any of his female companions because she feels as if they will love him more than the love she brings him as a mother. That is quite....odd. Also, I was very curious about the relationship between the ex-lover, Annie and Melanie. Annie does not seem to mind Melanie pursuing the man she used to love. Interesting!<br/><br/>The build up to the birds attacking was well-made. I understand the reasoning behind the shift of the film's tone, but I felt it to be jarring. In the long run, it does work. The birds attacking the town is not only iconic, but legitimately scary. The birds going around killing people had me thinking strangely about birds for weeks after viewing the movie. Who would think a grown man would be so afraid of a pigeon? Kudos to the visual effects team making these birds so realistic. Not only the visual imagery works on a high level, but so does the unique sound. Hitchcock decided to forgo the traditional score in order to focus more on sound effects. Basically, the sounds birds make is the score. That added to the consistent eerie feel of the movie. <br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a must-watch, especially if you like horror films. It may not rank as the auteur's best, but it might be one of his most iconic films. Hitchcock left the door open to viewers about what these birds may mean as there is plenty of speculation out there. I just believe these birds are just the subjects of a horror film and the director did a fine job turning these innocent works of nature into fearsome creatures of prey. After watching the movie, you may not look at birds in the same way again. <br/><br/>My Grade: A-"

","I watched this on TV as a child and, although I forgot all the details a long time ago, it remained carved in my memory as terrifying. Of course, this memory was greatly influenced by its reputation as one of the most famous horrors of all time. I just watched it for the first time as an adult in its entirety and I must say - wtf?! The story is linear, simple and does not require even the slightest use of the brain. It starts as a typical romantic comedy of its time (and it would be better if it stayed that way to the end), and then turns into something that is supposed to be a horror, but it is at best a mediocre drama. There is no mystery and tension that we expect from Hitchcock, there are no interesting dialogues, and performances of the actors are at a rather low level. From today's perspective, the effects are tragicomic, and I believe they were not anywhere near top-notch even for their time, which leads to the question how the hell was this film nominated for an Oscar in that category. Occasionally, the effects were so ridiculous that I had the impression that someone deliberately mocked with bird attacks. This is a film from 1963, not from 1923. The events in the movie remain completely unexplained, but that didn't bother me much because I couldn't care less about the reasons for bird attacks. The only good thing about this movie is the premise itself, because it is relatively realistic. Considering the number of birds on the planet in relation to the number of people, the very idea that birds can turn against us and attack us all at once is horrifying, because, despite their primitiveness in relation to human technology, I believe that in this war mankind would have no chance to win. Ever since I can remember I felt moderate repulsion and disgust towards birds, and after this movie, however unconvincing it may be, I could easily develop a phobia. If this movie was of a more recent date, I would rate it even lower, but, considering technical capabilities of the sixties, I have to give it a slack, so I'll rate it<br/><br/>5/10"

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This film may not be what many are anticipating mainly because of how Hitch leaves story lines completely opened ended and to the viewer's interpretation. Once the credits began to roll, I went to a film forum to read other viewer's thoughts. The story follows Melanie, a city socialite, who follows a lawyer Mitch to a small boating village of Bodega Bay. Her excuse for her trip is to bring, what else, two love birds for his much younger daughter. Upon her arrival local sea gulls and crows begin to increasingly attack the locals. Why is the million dollar question. This film is pure Hitch. A crescendo of tension, peculiar happenings and great cinematography. Not to mention it was devoid of any music. All sounds, aside from dialog, were birds. Bird wings fluttering and birds chirping. Silence aided tension of the tense moments. This film will leave you thinking, thinking and thinking."

","The colour palette and slice of 1960's northern California life are phenomenal, but both the lead actress and the director were too preoccupied with her looking flatly beautiful in every shot. When she's supposed to be terrified, it reads as a comical gasp. This is a great one for any fans of the decade and truly showcases the entire Hitchcock vibe. 7/10, definitely worth a watch."
"DeuceWild_77","10","1","1","27 August 2018"," ""It's the end of the world !!"" - yelled the drunken Doomsayer at the diner. An interspecies birds launch an attack on humans in the small coastal town of Bodega Bay.
","Coming from a last night screening of ""The Birds"" in a drive-in theater, i decided to write the review here of one of Hitchcock's most critically misunderstood films, even if it's one of his most cherished & well known towards the general public.<br/><br/>Firstly, it's undeniable how much ""The Birds"" influenced the postmodernist horror & suspense cinema, from George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws""; John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"", ""Halloween"" and particularly, ""The Fog"" or more recently Frank Darabont's ""The Mist"", the sense of dread provided by a menace surrounding a group of individuals in a small coastal town became the pinnacle of a genre that still attracts millions of viewers.<br/><br/>Secondly, Hitchcock's use of silence (no orchestration was used), except for the sound effects to create the birdcalls and noises, was a genious and inovative decision from the Master (Hitchcock had already used this gimmick in ""Lifeboat""), it created the perfect eerie tone for the film.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the special effects and animatronics were outstanding for the early 60's standards, and it still holds well and way more realistic (the attacking birds and their interaction with the actors) than the nowadays' use of the overexposed C.G.I.
The way that scenes were staged and photographed by Hitchcock's usual cinematographer, Robert Burks (the visual craftsman behind Hitch's most celebrated films such as ""Dial M For Murder"", ""Rear Window"", ""Vertigo"" or ""North by Northwest"") were unique and inovative (it even amazed the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa who included ""The Birds"" in his top 100 films ever made, using a technical and artistic criteria).<br/><br/>Fourthly, the plot was loosely based on the 1952 short-story of the same name by the British Novelist, Dame Daphne du Maurier (who also penned ""Rebecca"" & ""Jamaica Inn"", two previous Hitchcock's film adaptations), but the screenplay by Evan Hunter was expanded to include new characters and sub-plots for the full length movie to work, hence the entire first act developing the relationship between the two main characters and ""the third wheel"" who lives in the coastal town of Bodega Bay, where the main action takes place.<br/><br/>The reason why the interspecies of birds attacked people during that fateful weekend was indeed left unexplained, maybe due to the imperfections of the human race (every character in the movie was written as having major flaws) and we're a condemned species after all and nature and the animals, the worthy and the pure ones who will inherit Earth, will come and take their toll.<br/><br/>Last, but not the least, the cast. Nathalie Kay ""Tippi"" Hedren (which is, with Peter Griffith, the parents of the Academy Award Nominee, Melanie Griffith), a former fashion model who was discovered by the Master when he saw her in a TV commercial, he put her under his wing and gave her an education in filmmaking, which is way evident in her screen debut in ""The Birds"". She's total confident in the role of Melanie Daniels and made the camera her own, following the footsteps of Hitch's other famous blondes such as Grace Kelly or Kim Novak.<br/><br/>'Tippi', and now the tastes may differ, is probably the most beautiful of all the Hitchcock's leading actresses, she had a some kind of innocence, but at the same time a mysterious nuance throughout her on-screen personna and debuting at 32 years old on cinema she had much more class and self-confidence as a woman than Grace Kelly in her 20's trying to stole the focus in ""Rear Window"" or ""Dial M for Murder"".
Her performance here as Melanie Daniels and as the title character in the Hitch's follow-up work, ""Marnie"", where she delivered even a greater performance, are absolutely fascinating.<br/><br/>Rod Taylor was cast as the male lead when Hitch opted for a cheaper actor (Connery wasn't avaiable because he was shooting his second entry in the Bond universe: ""From Russia with Love"", but he was later used as 'Tippi' Hedren's charming co-lead in ""Marnie"") than his usual lead stars of Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant. He wanted to make a film about the unexplained bird attacks, not about Hollywood's established hearthtrobs and stardom, so he keeped it low profile. 
The surly rugged, but wooden actor, who looked at least 10 years older than his actual age and could have matched better with his on-screen mother (played here by an over-the-top, but future Oscar winner Jessica Tandy) than 'Tippi', was not the perfect choice for the ""Mitch"" Brenner character, but in his defense he didn't ruined it and, in a matter of fact, he fared better doing his beefcake action routine during the birds attacks scenes, than in the more intimate and sensitive moments with Hedren.<br/><br/>To contrast his ladies, brunette Suzanne Pleshette was specifically hired by Hitch to play Rod Taylor's former fiancee, the school teacher Annie Hayworth, and she was jealous throughout principal photography of 'Tippi' having all the director's attention and being the lead star in the film, and maybe that bitterness enhanced her supporting performance. 
She's very good, especially during the initial confrontation with 'Tippi'.<br/><br/>Former child star and future adult actress, Veronica Cartwright, better known as Lambert in Ridley Scott's sci-fi / horror classic ""Alien"", is appropriate as Rod Taylor's much younger sister. Again he looked more his father than his older brother.<br/><br/>To summarize, ""The Birds"" isn't Hitchcock's american masterpiece film, that honor belongs undoubtedly to ""Vertigo"", but it's one of his most daring and technically accomplished works. The birds as characters may not be as memorable as Anthony Perkins' rendition of Norman Bates in ""Psycho"", but they're still quite effective and the movie deserves to be re-praised as one of the greatest entries in the filmography of 'The Master of Suspense'."
"theterminator-92378","7","1","1","15 June 2018"," Classic Hitchcock
","One of Hitchcocks best came from the birds and when they say that he is the master of suspense the birds proved it well obviously other movies from him like Psycho north by north west and Vertigo they are by far the most iconic of his work and by far The Birds is one unique movie and i just love the building tension that is classic for all his movies 
The Birds follows a socialite from San Fransisco who follows a man who she is eyeing up a potential boyfriend and follows him to a rural town where birds begin to attack and slowly begins to attack the humans. The cast is Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner,Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner,Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels,Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth, Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner,Ethel Griffies as Mrs. Bundy, Charles McGraw as Sebastian Sholes,Ruth McDevitt as Mrs. MacGruder and Lonny Chapman as Deke Carter. The leading cast is amazing and the acting is amazing and it makes the story much much better.
I think that The Birds is a fun Hithcock movie that captures the essence of his style of movies and they make every part of the story he is trying to tell and the directing and cinematography is perfect and it was just another one of his moves that captured his magic that he can bring to his movies and the cast was well choosen and it's a movie that if your a huge movie fan or not you will still just love this movie and it is defently a must watch if you haven't seen it."

"hirotohirotogackt","Null","1","1","18 June 2017"," Unusual days!
","I have two birds and they are so cute, but I found that a group of birds was a scary in this film. Why did the birds attack people? I think human beings control birds and they are the lower class in our daily life. For example, they are basically in the cages. Their real symbol is freedom. Though they want to fly freely, they cannot do that because they are in their cages. It means that human beings violate their rights. Wild birds can, as a matter of course, fly like they want to. However, crows are poor existences because they are said ""the Messenger of the Dead"". There are a lot of people that hate the crows (But I adore them). However, if the birds became a band, they could control us, people. But it is impossible that the birds attack the people badly like that in reality. This impractical occurrence was interesting and fascinated me. Symbol of freedom is birds. Human beings dominate some birds. However, the birds revenge and dominate us in this film. The paradox is also very interesting for me. I like this movie because I love strange, horror and psycho thriller stories. Moreover old works' qualities of graphics are not clear rather than current that. It still felt me creep."
"pcrev","9","1","1","7 August 2006"," The Birds and me.
","I have nothing but admiration for this movie. While not afraid of it like I was when I first saw it when I was twelve, back then I saw the movie as somewhat prophetic, a ""could be scenario' of the future. Maybe a reaction to the time of my life I was about to enter in to. Nature turning on its cruel masters scenario!! I even thought, with that teenage sense of smug superiority, that we deserved it!!<br/><br/>I, of course think differently about it now. Hitchcock is such a master at portraying the futility of human relationships in light of such actions of finality. Mundane everyday things that we think are so important that are swallowed up by some acts of desperateness, ruthlessness or anything else we really have no control over. What does it take to shake us out of our complacency? In this movie, the signs are evident throughout, yet, it is almost too late and the end leaves you thinking, ""Are we still too late? I always wonder, whenever I watch this movie, how we would react? Would we kill all the birds we could, not taking any mind as to the huge environmental disaster that such an action would bring about. Hopefully we would not, but the old nature dies hard when survival is at stake.<br/><br/>So in my mind, The Birds is a a modern day morality play. It still has the power to move and still speaks to us. In any disaster, we will react. My question is and always will be, ""How?"""

","The Birds/1963/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: 'Tippi' Hedren<br/><br/>Suzanne Pleshette Rod Taylor Jessica Tandy<br/><br/>Not only was this a classic but a fake classic with fake birds on strings or drawn birds that were somehow put into the screen but also some were real. Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" was one of his goriest films. I'd say the tamest one was ""North by Northwest"" which was even better than ""The Birds"" because it was more intriguing, suspenseful (not that ""The Birds"" wasn't though) and had a very good storyline to it. I'd give it four stars out of four stars. ""The Birds"" was ""good"" (not any worse, not any better). The main star, Melanie Daniels ('Tippi' Hedren), is a lady that gets involved with the ""birds"" thing just because she wanted to know who this mysterious person named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) was at a bird shop. She decides to give his daughter Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) a gift. The gift was two lovebirds in a cage. She delivered it to the house by boat because Mitch lives near water (a lake). Melanie interrogates an old man, who happened to be a cashier, when she wanted to know where the Brenners' lived and he told her where they lived and that there were two ways to get to the house: by road or boat. She decided to take the boat option and bring the lovebirds to Mitch's house. She then got to the house and decided to invite herself in without knocking and put the cage right in the living room along with two cards. Then they meet and while she's going to return the boat to where she got it (the dock), a bird (fake) swoops down on her and cuts her. She then goes in to a restaurant to get some help and that's when she meets the strict mother of Mitch's (Jessica Tandy). In this movie there are about four bird attacks. One is at a schoolhouse, at a party, at a restaurant/telephone booth, and inside Mitch's house. There are a few other minor attacks also. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should so you can see how good and fake it is at the same time. Movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock."
"carlacryptic","10","1","1","1 November 2005"," Dreamlike clarity makes The Birds work on the unconscious as well as visually
","I saw The Birds when it first came out, in a theater. I was visiting my home town of Philadelphia after being away for a couple of years and one of my older cousins was given the job of entertaining me by taking me to a movie. I was totally taken with The Birds but I'm not sure my cousin liked it at all. Since then, I've seen the movie dozens of times and I've enjoyed it on many different levels every time I've seen it, depending on what age I was, what experiences I'd had to date, and where my consciousness was. If I'm flipping channels and see any scene from The Birds, I tend to get riveted to the spot and have to finish watching through to the end. There are scenes in this film which, like great music, carry you along with them to places you wouldn't otherwise go but, once there, won't willingly leave.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's films are all crafted with extreme care and the stories of his obsessions and perfectionism are legendary. For me, those things pale beside the work itself, this film being one of my personal favorites. Tippi Hedren, whom I identified with very strongly in this film and even more so as Marnie, epitomized a certain 50's ideal turned on its head - a strong-willed woman who was visually very together but, underneath it all, perhaps a bit fragile psychologically. I like the fact that Hitchcock chose to make her rich in this film because that' makes sense to me as someone who grew up in that era. I say 50's because, although the film was made in the early 60's, it is built on the imagery and assumptions of the 50's as firmly as early 70's films were built on those of the 60's. It takes a while for the societal norms and cultural views of one decade to make it into the movies, especially the movies which make sense of, or epitomize, them.<br/><br/>Every camera angle and small exchange between people, or between people and birds, or between the birds themselves, is exquisitely pertinent to the story. Every detail of each set, every action, every snippet of dialogue, every gesture all fit together seamlessly to create a world that feels as real and comfortable as an old sweater... the better to take you places you would never dream of going psychologically. Comfort and safety, order, well-understood expectations all create a firm foundation for you to surrender your emotions and allow the story to work on your subconscious as well as your conscious mind. <br/><br/>It does this brilliantly and that is why generations of film students know the beats of the movement, the pauses and silences, the framing and the pacing as well as I do. Many people prefer to study Psycho for these nuances but I think that which film strikes one's own personal chord most resonantly speaks more to our own internal landscapes than to which film of Hitchcock's is 'better'.<br/><br/>I have never taped or purchased a copy of The Birds. I think it's because I would rather remember it, like memories from my own life, within the context of the time I saw it. I also like to stumble across it on TV or cable and rediscover it all over again in whatever frame of mind I am in at the time. If you've never seen it, please do. It's one of the real masterpieces of cinematic art."
"perfectbond","9","1","1","23 November 2003"," Open to interpretation
","I agree with ""cordedpoodle"" in that The Birds is a metaphor for nature and chaos conflicting with human society. I enjoyed the open-ended story such as it is and found the characters to be very convincingly portrayed by the actors. The chemistry between Hedren and Taylor was terrific and their relationship developed in a very satisfying manor. The periphery characters of Mitch's 'clinging' mother and in his still jealous previous love interest were also first-rate characterizations. The only character I thought was somewhat extraneous was Mitch's daughter. The direction and pure craftsmanship of the film were also of the first order. I think Hitchcock said that he used 371 trick shots or so in the film. The Hitchcock Collection DVD I watched had excellent supplementary materials and the picture and sound were very sharp. Another feather in the cap of The Master. 9/10."
"schappe1","Null","1","1","10 September 2003"," Why, indeed?
","Why indeed? That's what everyone wants to know. Why did the birds suddenly decide to attack these people? Is there some connection to the middling soap opera we see played out over the first hour of the film and their attacks, (maybe they don't like middling soap operas?). Is it because they are fed up with all the pollution and people shooting at them all the time?  Or is it just because they can?<br/><br/>Maybe Hitchcock just wanted to make a scary movie. He might ask you to imagine yourself in the restaurant and suddenly a bloodied man staggers in and says `The birds are attacking and we don't know why!' Now picture yourself in the same restaurant and suddenly a bloodied man staggers in and says,'The birds are attacking and we know exactly why!' Which is scarier?<br/><br/>Perhaps a better question is why Hitch spent so much time, (more than usual in his films and more than you'll see in any other horror film), exploring the characters and their relationships, delving into motivations, attractions and resentments. Why does it matter that Jessica Tandy misses her husband because he is so strong and is now so dependent on her son that she doesn't want to share him? Why do we have to know that Suzanne Pleshette's schoolteacher is in love with Mitch and sees Melanie, (Tippi Hedren) as a rival? Why is Melanie's escapade in Rome or her raising funds for orphans so important? Why should we care about this? Do the birds care about these things?<br/><br/>I think it's hopeless to try to make some connection between the `plot' and the events in the story. Hitchcock loved to experiment with the cinema and there is little sentiment and only superficial romance in most of this films. This story never gets to the point of being sentimental or romantic anyway. The film is surely not about ecology. Nobody says anything about the birds being angry about the environment or anything else.<br/><br/>I think Hitch just liked the idea of a movie starting out to be about one thing and then turning out to be about something else entirely. That's what he did with PSYCHO, which starts out to be a crime melodrama about Janet Leigh trying to get away with some illicit funds and very suddenly becomes the ultimate `slasher' flick about Anthony Perkins and his crazy mother. Here we see a romantic comedy turn gradually into a soap opera and then gradually into a monster movie, with the birds being the monsters. The major difference is the gradual nature of the transition. The attic scene is this film's equivalent of the shower scene in PSYCHO but it doesn't have the same impact because the attacks have already begun, (and Tippi survives). The gradual pace of change is obviously intended to produce a sense of dread, rather than surprise. <br/><br/>Looking at Tippi Hedren's performance it's hard to see why she didn't become a major star. She's gorgeous, (much better looking than her daughter, ironically named Melanie, thanks to a softer jaw line), has a strong voice, an expressive face and shows real acting ability. She should have won some kind of award for her perseverance in the attic scene, which took four days with live birds to shoot. That she came out of this an animal lover is amazing.<br/><br/>What does it all mean? It means you got your money's worth when you bought your ticket."
"MF210","9","1","1","25 August 2003"," Not Hitchcock's best but still Very Good and a personal favorite of mine
","Hitchcock has made many memorable and suspenseful movies. The Birds is among them. It has chilling and very memorable scenes. <br/><br/>The acting in The Birds is good but definitely not as good as in say Notorious or some other of Hitchcock's movies. Tippi Hedren is good in one of her first roles but she is a little bit stiff in areas. Rod Taylor is good in his role. Veronica Cartwright is much more impressive here than she would be in Alien, she plays Cathy quite well. Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette give good, credible performances.<br/><br/>The premise of the Birds is interesting. Its Man vs. Nature, though its not the first time its been done. Its a conflict that ends in a surprising way, that during the time the movie was made, only Hitchcock would have ended it like this. It has a powerful ending. <br/><br/>The Birds is not a flawless film. The dialogue was not award material then and certainly not now, but for the movie the dialogue works well. However, the scenes are whats important in The Birds. The scenes are well put together and well shot by Hitchcock. One scene that is unforgettable in The Birds is when Melanie(Tippi Hedren) sees The Birds perched on the Playground equipment and the power wires and she slowly walks into the school. This is an absolutely chilling scene, the way its crafted. <br/><br/>Some may think The Birds has dated because of its special effects. I will admit The Birds special effects have not aged as well as say 2001's have but I think The Birds special effects are still exceptional. But maybe one may have to really like the movie to see that.<br/><br/>One thing that recently jumped out to me about The Birds is the main character, Melanie. Is she bad luck? The script shows us that the attacks didnt start happening until Melanie came to the little Calfornia town. But also her mother left her when she was young and in the end out of her and Mitch's (Rod Taylor) family, she is the only one that gets hurt. Also Annie dies when Melanie had been staying with her. <br/><br/>Overall, The Birds is definitely not Hitchcock's best film but it is very good and a personal favorite of mine. 9 out of 10."
"swank_k","Null","1","1","22 April 2003"," mother and son theme
","The theme that is immediately recognized within the film is the mother and son relationship.  The mother in the film, Lydia Brenner is extremely overbearing and needy of her son, Mitch.  Lydia continually points to the fact that she needs Mitch in order to survive.  Lydia becomes especially angered as Melanie shows for dinner and Mitch show a true liking for her. In the scene after Lydia finds her friend's eyes poked out and dead from the birds attack Melanie comes in with tea.  During this scene Lydia makes it a point to explain to Melanie why she does not like her and it is strictly because Lydia does not want her son ever to leave her because she will be alone.  Lydia views Melanie as a threat, which is completely ridiculous! The theme is apparent again when Melanie encounters Annie Hayworth.  Annie is obviously still upset by her and Mitch's berak-up and reveals to Melanie the evil tendecies Lydia has. As Annie explains to Melanie that Lydia does not like anyone that is with Mitch, Melanie and the viewers get a cold and frightening feeling about Lydia and what her motives may be.  Overall, the birds attacking can connect to this overbearing mother Mrs.Brenner and her obsessive attachment to her son. The birds do begin attacking when Melanie arrives and the first person attacked is Melanie. As attacks continue Melanie is always present besides for one occasion. The attacks can be seen as an attack on anything that attacks Mitch. I think the attacks maybe a symbol of lose of control. Lydia maybe losing control of her relationship with her son Mitch because Melanie has entered his life. Therefore, it can be possible that the birds began attacking as Melanie arrived because she is the reason behind this idea of lose of control. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in the film. I thought the mother and son relationship was pretty interesting to watch and evaluate,but the film was extremely slow and lengthy. There was not enough suspense built up for the birds attacks and too much unnecessary dialogue. The special effects were pretty decent considering the time. The movie was too drawn out and did not have enough suspense and build up to hold interest for two hours!"
"jandesimpson","10","1","1","28 June 2002"," The one indisputable Hitchcock masterpiece
","I have delayed commenting on a Hitchcock film for two reasons; first, so much has been written about them that I seriously wonder if there is anything more that can usefully be said and second, I am probably rare among movie buffs in not placing him at the top among the greatest of directors. That he is a marvellous entertainer and craftsman I would not deny;  indeed there are few other directors whose work I can return to again and again with such pleasure, but his films are all, with two exceptions, surface divertissements and some pretty wondrous at that -""Vertigo"" and Psycho"" for instance.  The ones I take really seriously are ""The Wrong Man"", an intense study, almost documentary in style, of the ghastly consequences of mistaken identity and ""The Birds"" which is so much more profound than anything else in the canon that I wonder if Hitchcock really was aware of the great gap between this and anything else he undertook.  As I feel so passionately about this work it is probably the one to write about.  Any serious discussion of ""The Birds"" cannot commence without clearing away the problem of its widely misinterpreted genre.  Although I can appreciate that there are many with a bird phobia who can hardly bare to watch the film, I would insist that it is not a horror movie.  While every attempt is made to explain the behaviour of Norman Bates in Psycho ( a genuine horror film), the malevolent attacks by the birds on human beings remain a mystery to the end, creating an ambivalence that is more the stuff of the metaphysical than the horrific.  I see ""The Birds as an allegory on the way human beings prey on each other, demanding possession and affection often when it cannot be reciprocated, with the birds themselves surfacing every so often as a sort of Greek Chorus to externalise the inner clawing and tearing apart that humans often do to each other.  As the film has been analysed so many times I won't go into lengthy details, but simply record that it is the only Hitchcock film I would put in the top hundred of all time.  It says something profound about the human condition and was made by a craftsman, who, post ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", had reached the very apex of his career."
"gbrumburgh-1","9","1","1","26 October 2001"," Superior mankind vs. nature horror, with a consummate Hitchcock at the flight controls.
","Quoth the raven, `Nevermore!'  Not as `Poe-etic' maybe but just as grim and fateful in its intent was 1963's hotly anticipated `The Birds,' loosely based on the1952 Daphne Du Maurier Gothic-styled novella (originally set on a post-WWII English coast).  Alfred Hitchcock had faithful fans scurrying to the theater houses in droves for his first feature in three years following his macabre masterpiece `Psycho.'  In between, Hitch launched his celebrated TV anthology series, winning a whole new generation of admirers.<br/><br/>By altering the image of our fair, feathered friends from symbols of peace, freedom and paradise into terrifying tools of terror, Hitch once again assaulted our eyes and ears in a fresh, cleverly laid out manner.  Flocks of birds of varying species descend upon a small California coastal town and attack without provocation, turning into Armageddon-like messengers of doom and annihilation.  It was an ingenious comeback idea and Hitch did not disappoint.  I can't recall an earlier movie that so rerouted a creature as sweet and innocent as a sparrow.<br/><br/>Since `Psycho' put the `H' in (modern) Horror, what could we expect from `The Birds' on its initial release?  Would this heroine too meet an early, similar fate ála Janet Leigh?  Would she be beaked to death before the end of the first reel?  What would the gore factor be now that `Psycho' had opened Hollywood's bloody doors?  Unmercifully playful as always and a master of pre-show suspense, Hitch released his birds with tremendous fanfare and, of course, made quite an impact.  The movie became the prototype for a stream of `nature's revenge' movies involving unlikely human predators  ants, frogs, rabbits, and the like.<br/><br/>The characters in `Psycho' and `The Birds' are similar in their presentation.  They are chilly, not easily embraced, hardly flesh-and-blood characters.  They appear to be mere instruments to present, not distract from, the ultimate horrific elements, and yet they becoming more fascinating with each repeated viewing.<br/><br/>Over the years Hitch had a penchant for taking beautiful, sometimes limited, well-coiffed blonde actresses and turning them into exquisite mysteries. Kim Novak of `Vertigo' comes foremost to mind.  Here, Tippi Hedren provides one of the most vexing, deceptively intriguing characters yet.  A coy, superficial, self-indulgent socialite whose reckless, news-making escapades has been front-page tabloid material, Melanie Daniels, one day at a pet shop, happens to meet and fix upon Mitch Brenner, an assertive, strapping, hirsutely handsome nice guy' attorney (Rod Taylor), totally out of her league, yet a down-home charmer just the same.  A casual but obvious flirtation filters out between the two.  The capricious lady proceeds to drive all the way to the isolated little town of Bodega Bay to sneak a pair of lovebirds, into Mitch's mother's home for his much, much younger sister's (Veronica Cartwright, by at least 20 years!) birthday.  Hedren is a cool but captivating young heroine who gets to thaw out a little as the film progresses.  The other roles are handled just as professionally.<br/><br/>Rod Taylor (`The Time Machine') is a definitive man's man and an ingratiating ladies' man to boot.  Doling out steadfast, unflinching heroes most his career, he has that fine reputation as a protector extraordinaire, and though he remained in the second ranks for the long duration, his wry charm, stocky masculinity and sexy banter has always been first rate with me.  His Mitch Brenner may still be caught up in his mother's apron strings a bit, but on him it looks honorable, not emasculating.<br/><br/>
The always wonderful Jessica Tandy returned to the cinematic fold after a decade of stage and TV work as Mrs. Brenner.  A wan, high-strung, overly possessive widow incapacitated over the years by fear and anxiety, her desperate attachment to her son was sure to discourage any female competitor.  Tandy's performance bears close attention.  She draws out a subtle flurry of emotions in what at first might appear to be a one-note performance, drawing sympathy in spite of her limitations.<br/><br/>
Lovely Suzanne Pleshette, in a rare, dressed-down support role, gives one of the more curious performances of the film.  As the insular, cynical school teacher Annie Hayworth, she inspires genuine empathy as a young woman mysteriously bitter and broken in spirit for such a young age.  Once in love with Mitch until Mrs. Brenner's interference, she strangely hangs around as a friend, yearning maybe for a reconciliation.  Despite her obvious beauty and intelligence, she has consigned herself to living a small-town life of boredom, broken dreams, and ultimate loneliness.  Ironically, it is she, the self-appointed spinster, who makes the ultimate mother's sacrifice  protecting her `children' at all costs.<br/><br/>A number of familiar faces, if not names, flutter about as well:  Ethel Griffies as an ornithological expert, Lonny Chapman as a restaurant operator, comedian Doodles Weaver (uncle of Sigourney) as a boatman, Ruth McDevitt, flighty as always, as a pet shop owner, Richard (`The Dick Van Dyke Show') Deacon as Mitch's dour city neighbor, and, with a keen eye, little Morgan Brittany can be glimpsed as one of the terrified schoolgirls. Of course, there is a bit of fun to be had trying to spot Hitch himself, whose trademark cameo appearance comes early in the film.<br/><br/>As in all of Hitch's films, the successful buildup of suspense is done in a myriad of ways.  Nobody works a camera like the master.  Slightly distorted angles accentuate the character's imbalance and gathering paranoia.  Even something as unvarnished as Hedren's little boat trek across the lake offers a moving camera that taunts with eery tension.  The absence of a screechy Bernard Herrman score, using this time only the intermittent chirping and cawing of his foul fowl, enhances the feelings of isolation and vulnerability.  Classic terror' scenes here include Hedren's school bench sequence in which clusters of crows furtively take over a school playground; Tandy's slow discovery of a neighbor's grisly attack; and Hedren's claustrophobic telephone booth assault -- all indelible visions long after the finale.<br/><br/>Metaphorically speaking , the outcome is purposely left `up in the air'  which, I suppose, is relatively germane to the world-threatening conflicts of today.  Hitch's film projects may be designed for escape but he has a knack for making them seem awfully real.  First shower-taking, now bird-watching.  He has a devilish habit of taking the fun out of life's little pleasures, doesn't he?."

","Following up an undisputed horror masterpiece like PSYCHO would have been a very hard bargain for almost every other director, but Alfred Hitchcock was not like ""every other director.""  THE BIRDS was the result; and while its special effects aren't up to snuff when compared to the CGIs we've got today, one should keep in mind that THE BIRDS is an early 1960s product.<br/><br/>Although sometimes labeled as science fiction, THE BIRDS offers no explanation, scientific or otherwise, for why Bodega Bay, California and its residents and visitors should be besieged by half the avian kingdom.  The performances, particularly by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren, sometimes seem very distant--which is not to say they're bad, quite the contrary.  But it does produce an emotional and psychological chill that hadn't been seen in the horror genre before.<br/><br/>It is also clear that, despite its age, THE BIRDS has worn rather well as a movie and continues to be hugely influential.  The nighttime sieges at Taylor's house seemed to have influenced that aspect of George Romero's 1968 cult film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  And certainly this film's influence is clearly felt by Steven Spielberg, whose great suspense thrillers DUEL and JAWS pay homage to the Hitchcock aesthetic.<br/><br/>Thus, it should come as no surprise that I rate THE BIRDS a clear 10."

"ellkew","6","1","1","24 June 2001"," Sound effects genius behind the film
","I have read quite a few comments mentioning the lack of music in the film so I feel I should make this point. The unsung hero of the film is a German composer called Oskar Sala who worked to compose the electronic score for the film.(see The Dark Side of Genius by Donald Spoto) Hitchcock did not want any music but if you actually listen to the birds themselves their sound is electronic. Sala is now an elderly man of about 90 but is still working occasionally. I was greatly honoured when he composed the score to my short film 'The Box' this year. He is a musical pioneer who developed an instrument called the trautonium. He has worked mostly out of the limelight and the mainstream most of his life but is an inspiration to a lot of musicians. I think the film is extremely powerful because of the lack of music but the birdsound is equally disturbing. It is a simple story that could be handled very loosely in the wrong hands. With some great set pieces and a sense of foreboding, in the hands of Hitchcock it is unforgettable."

","Hitchcock does it again...he takes the seemingly ordinary and mundane in life like a simple act of taking a shower in Psycho, the familial relationship of Niece and Uncle in Shadow of a Doubt, and, in this picture, the natural, friendly relationship of commonplace birds with mankind - and turns them into nightmarish scenes.  In the Birds, Hitchcock displays his gargantuan talent for creating and sustaining suspense.  On the Californian coast, for some inexplicable reason, birds begin attacking people.  Hitchcok uses this backdrop to showcase the story of a family and a visitor, Tippie Hedren, in the midst of this unnatural phenomenon,  This film is a pleasure to watch because it is so well-done.  Hitchcock's direction is superb.  The work with the birds themselves is amazing as thousands of real ones were used with mechanical ones.  Quite impressive.  The acting is first-rate with Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, and Jessica Tandy in attendance.  Easily my favourite scene is the one when the townfolk are in the diner....talking about the rumours of the birds...and an elderly woman begins to expound on the genial nature of our feathered friends...only to have her words simplicity shattered in moments.

It takes a while for the whole story to get going, but once it does, the camera angles capture the birds in a unique way.<br/><br/> This film was not so much scary, more creepy.

","The Birds has the usual Hitchcock touches.  A chase, guilt, interesting camera technique and birds.  The story starts out innocently enough, with birds acting weird.  They soon start attacking people and gradually their attacks escalate in ferocity.   What I liked about the movie was the way Hitchcock built up the tension leading to the attacks.  He didn't unleash his villians until about half way through the film.  In that time we get to know the characters in the peaceful town of Bodega Bay.  Once all the introductions are in place, the birds start their rampage.  I enjoyed the way the birds lighted upon the playground equipment as Tippi Hedren sat on the bench.  The choice of no score was interesting.  The soundtrack is filled with the screeching of birds gone mad, and for a nearly forty year old film, it still holds up well.  I would like to see The Birds done as a special edition DVD, see if they can boost the sound up to what Hithcock would have wanted."

"Poseidon-3","Null","1","1","26 April 2002"," ""Why are they doing this?...the birds...Why are they trying to kill people?""
","Opinions vary somewhat on the virtues of this late-career Hitchcock suspense film. Some find it to be a symbol-laden masterpiece, others a dull drama with occasional flashes of shock and still others a mixed bag of thrills, lessened by a stiff leading lady. This is a mesmerizing, layered gem of a film with all sorts of great dialogue, set pieces and special effects. Though Hedren was not a seasoned actress in this, her debut, she is a sleek, chic, attractive performer. Her voice is a sophisticated purr, her posture and grace are magnificent and her hair is a testament to the wonders of Aqua Net. Despite her inexperience as an actress, she is a compelling and witty personality. She is not Grace Kelly, but who she is is fine as well. Taylor is a charming, delightful counterpoint to her cool beauty. There is so much going on in this film it can be watched over and over and OVER again. Watch as Tippi (in a theme Hitchcock used throughout his career, but which was fully realized here more than ever) begins with all the accoutrements of a glamorous lady and is gradually stripped of all her trappings and accessories until finally she is nearly unrecognizable. Notice how Taylor is ""hen-pecked"" by the women around him. He is fighting off real birds as well grappling with the ""birds"" (British for girl) in his life and in his home. Hedren starts off in a pet store surrounded by birds in cages, but before the film is over, she has been caged more than once herself (complete with the torturesome pecking--a reversal of humans sticking their fingers and other objects into birdcages all the time.) The only birds that don't rebel are the lovebirds...an unabashedly romantic touch. There are some odd bits of dialogue between several of the characters that aren't easily understood (i.e.--Pleshette and Hedren's discussion of Tandy, Tandy's bedridden chat with Hedren), but most of the film has fascinating exchanges, never more so than in the extended diner sequence. As patrons wait for their fried chicken, an array of people (including the terrific Griffies) debate the possibility of a bird assault, only to see firsthand how powerless humans can be when confronted by nature at full force. Some of the imagery is unforgettable, such as Tandy's exit from Dan Faucett's farm, the jungle gym at the school, Lang's confrontation with Hedren and the fireplace invasion to name a few... There is a deliberate quality to the pacing and story which puts some people off. Indeed in this channel-surfing era, it is sometimes hard for some to wait for things or to let a film's mood sweep over them. When things start to break loose, it is well worth the wait. Occasionally, some of the effects shots look dated, but in many cases it is still unsettling. One might never glance at a flock of crows quite the same way after seeing this movie!"

","To think The Birds is considered a classic, a masterpiece or any superlative of that kind... Some should seriously think about taking off their blinkers to judge this movie, and more generally all Hitchcock's filmography, with a minimum of objectivity.<br/><br/>We wind up with a movie that gathers a lot of elements characterizing quite a few of the English's directions: a totally unbelievable burgeoning love story, a far-fetched main storyline or an abrupt failed ending. And apart from the excellent and promising opening scene in the pet shop, there is nothing positive to draw from this endless film. Even the bird attacks are counter-productive and become really annoying with those headache-inducing cries.<br/><br/>Besides, after 2h of enduring this uninteresting plot, the viewer is left abandoned with no answer as to the behaviour of these animals..."

","I think The Birds is a good example of a movie that doesn't hold up as well today. Sure it still manages to provide an interesting narrative about killer birds, but manages to make it feel quite underwhelming. There's a scene in the movie where a bunch of birds fly into a chimney into a house, I'm talking hundreds of these animals. However, instead of attacking the people inside the house, they just kind of fly around, being a bother.<br/><br/>I also found the main character, Melanie, to be extremely unlikable. She spends a lot of the first half of the film lying for no reason. She still manages to get the guy though somehow, despite the fact they only spend about three days together in this movie. As that's how love works.<br/><br/>The ending is quite underwhelming too. I'm not asking for an explanation on why the birds are evil or anything, I just want a bit more than a ""they drive off into the distance towards an unknown future"" ending, I don't really feel like that fit the movie. <br/><br/>The Birds isn't a total waste of time to watch, and it still manages to be a fun movie. It feels more like a B-picture than an actual horror movie, and who doesn't like a good B-movie every now and then?"

","Emerging from ""The Birds'"" initial theatrical release in 1963, the consensus of opinion all around (in the audience I saw it with) was, ""Well, it's no 'Psycho.'"" ""I wish the effects had been better,"" was another oft-heard opinion. Despite being supposedly ""state of the art,"" the effects are all too obvious -- from the green-screen lines around the birds massing in the sky over the birthday party to those same annoying lines around 'Tippi' Hedren being attacked in the phone booth to obviously animated drawings of birds added in process shots to stuffed birds as ""extras"" in the crowded bird scenes to the quick cutaway while the man in the gas station is replaced by a dummy just before the explosion.<br/><br/>And whose bad idea was it to use three jump-cuts during two separate ""shock"" sequences? The discovery of the farmer with his eyes plucked out and 'Tippi' Hedren's reaction from inside the restaurant as she follows the flow of gasoline to the man lighting the cigarette. Maybe those jump-cuts sounded good in theory. But the human eye doesn't work that way, and their artificiality only calls attention to the technique -- dissipating the ""shock"" value and tension. Better, for instance, a quick zoom into the farmer's face -- the way the human eye works. A standard technique that's simple but always effective if used selectively: see the moment in Hammer Films' ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" when Christopher Lee rips the bandages from his (The Monster's) face. It's still jolting! The triple jump-cuts of 'Tippi' Hedren looking out of the restaurant window in ""horror"" serve only to highlight her utterly incompetent ""acting."" Even in still shots, in other words, she looks amateurish.<br/><br/>The only ""effect"" in ""The Birds"" that works is the sound. Magnificent.<br/><br/>Of course, the DESIGN of the set pieces, like the birds massing on the jungle gym behind 'Tippi' Hedren, and the bird attacks, are brilliantly conceived. It's their execution that falls short of believability and distances the audience because the ""techniques"" are so visible and artificial.<br/><br/>A pity that Hitchcock apparently was obsessed with making 'Tippi' Hedren a star because she simply cannot act. Her high, slightly whiny and nasal voice is no help either. In ""Marnie"" she's just laughable in her attempts at high drama. No doubt the filming of her attack in the attic was ""horrible"" for her to film on the set. On screen, however, and partially because of those damned quick cuts again, she still comes across as phony as a three-dollar bill.<br/><br/>Hedren's career, as we know, went absolutely nowhere once she and Hitchcock had a falling out (on ""Marnie""). Happily, she found fulfillment rescuing wild animals from circuses and zoos.<br/><br/>Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are the only real actors in ""The Birds."" Everybody else, from Veronica Cartwright's overwrought performance as Cathy to everybody in that infernal diner overacts like they're in a second rate bus-and-truck touring company.<br/><br/>An ambitious film, populated with widely-touted but so-so special effects (more does not equal better) and ""starring"" a newcomer who can't act.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" isn't remotely on the creative level of ""Psycho."" None of its many facets, from script to cinematography to acting to effects to directing approaches the power of ""Psycho."" <br/><br/>""The Birds"" isn't even on the same level as ""Saboteur"" (1942), generally considered one of Hitchcock's ""lesser"" efforts. The tension, action, and effects in ""Saboteur"" (the Statue of Liberty sequence) far surpass anything in ""The Birds."" <br/><br/>""The Birds,"" in fact, marks the beginning of Hitchcock's slow decline after ""Psycho"" through his final film, ""Family Plot."" <br/><br/>Hitchcock never made a ""bad"" film. And he had more than his share of masterpieces, beginning with ""Rebecca,"" his first American film. ""Notorious,"" ""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""North By Northwest,"" ""The Trouble With Harry,"" ""Rear Window,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Strangers on a Train,"" ""Stage Fright,"" ""Shadow of a Doubt.""<br/><br/>He made, perhaps, more truly timeless masterpieces than any director before or since (with the possible exception of Fellini).<br/><br/>""The Birds"" tries hard.

See this movie, just because it is so famous, but don't expect much more than some fairly good visuals.  There is no suspense, because everyone in the world knows exactly what is going to happen the minute they look at the video box cover."

","I am a young man, in my 20's, and I have to say, ""The Birds"" is a brilliant film! I state my age because most of the people I know who are young like myself, think the old films are boring or slow, but I appreciate films for what they are and you have to take into consideration, that this film was released in 1963. They didn't have the special effects and the budgets that the films have today, so you can't compare them. <br/><br/>""The Birds"", in my opinion, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films! The film is typically 60's, which was an iconic decade. You have the pearl necklaces, the cigarette filters and people driving around in Cadillac's, however, the film also includes directing styles, that to me, are unusual and actually puts the film into a league of it's own and ahead of it's time.<br/><br/>The film doesn't include a soundtrack at all, which most horror films now rely on to create an atmosphere, however, Alfred Hitchcock manages to create an eerie atmosphere without it. The wealthy upper class snobbery that is given off by the main characters in the film misleads you at first, giving the impression that the film is all talking and sniping, however, the film takes a very dark turn towards the end, changing the characters attitude and priorities when they are faced with a problem that none of them understand and you realize that taking money out of the picture, they are all just people. The special effects used in the film are dated, however, the special effects in this film is sometimes better that the special effects used in films now and ""The Birds"" is 54 years ago! Also, the film will be forever a mystery as the main cause of the bird problem, is never actually solved or explained, making the film a timeless classic. <br/><br/>I would encourage people to watch this film and appreciate it for what it is. Don't watch it to just nit-pick and find fault in it. Watch it with an open mind and be fair to it when you judge it because like I said before, you can't compare it to the films of today. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" is unique and different and it will always be one of my favorite films."
"HashedOnions","6","3","6","12 January 2017"," A Powerful Punch of Suspense, a Light Tap of Everything Else
","Alfred Hitchcock is arguably one of the most genre-defining directors of cinema history. With such classics like ""Psycho,"" ""Rear Window,"" ""Vertigo,"" etc., there's a clear, undeniable reason he is considered Hollywood's ""Master of Suspense.""<br/><br/>I will agree with the common thought that he is one of the top directors of our time; however, his 1963 film, ""The Birds,"" is not something I would personally accept as being one of his better productions.<br/><br/>I do have a rather negative opinion of this movie, though truthfully, I've seen MUCH worse. There's simply a lot I don't like about the plot, the characters, and the film's approach to the conflict at-hand. Without going into too much detail (or major spoilers), I truly believed this movie could've been done a lot better. <br/><br/>Okay, so the suspense aspect was TERRIFIC; that's the one and only thing I'll give this movie and A+ for, as the whole ""bird"" concept was (mostly) executed with perfection. To today's standards, the special effects were cheesy (keeping in mind this film is nearing 60 years old), but I couldn't help myself but feeling terrified going into the final act of the movie. Basically, the last thirty minutes of this two- hour film was fantastic. I was on-edge, scared, and downright frightened by the way the conflict influenced character development.<br/><br/>That said, that was the only thing I liked about the movie.<br/><br/>I felt like the first act of the movie was weak, boring, and almost pointless. The purpose of the first hour was to introduce the characters, develop the conflict, and try to create chemistry between each member of the cast. None of these things, however, were ever fulfilled enough for me. The movie spent so much time on the characters that I ending up barely caring about the bird conflict when it became prevalent. I don't mind slow movies at all - in fact, the slowness in a movie is supposed to make thrillers more suspenseful - but the amount of time focused on the protagonist and her motives became ridiculously overbearing. The worst thing is, NONE of this wrapped up in the end. All of the time spend on Melanie's love affairs never amounted to anything, and barely made sense when romanticizing (in its brevity) actually occurred. Simply put, character chemistry was barely sub-par.<br/><br/>But characters aren't always the most important thing, right? In a Hitchcock film, it's all about the ending and the suspenseful events that led up to it. Sure, I'll agree with that, but I can't help but notice the numerous plot holes the movie had, the unanswered questions the film created, and the brutally disappointing ending - completely left up to the viewer's interpretation. Why were the birds there? What made them so aggressive? What was the point of the love birds? Did they ever make it out of their driveway? Honestly, things just didn't make sense with this one. The film gives us ideas to think about and toy with, but not enough direction throughout the production to make a reasonable inference."

","This movie seems to be so misunderstood by so many. Many don't understand it. Many that praise it need to also watch it again to have more to praise than suspense and special effects.<br/><br/>Begin with the characters.<br/><br/>Mitch Brenner is a unmarried successful San Francisco lawyer. I will cue you in here... today he would be able to legally marry his male partner. His double life is spent during the week in SF and weekends being a good son in Bodega Bay.<br/><br/>Lydia Brenner is Mitch's mother. Seemingly insecure since her husband died and left her with 2 children. Seemingly insecure, but really the domineering and overprotective mother shielding her boy from women like Melanie Daniels and Anne Heyward. Going as far as criticizing him for not being as smart and in control of it all, as his father. Chopping him down to a little boy, because his father would have known how to protect the family.<br/><br/>Anne Heyward the school teacher. Deep voiced and sexy. Ex-lover of Mitch that moved to Bodega Bay just to be near Mitch She reveals their relationship never got off the ground because of his mother as well as other reasons. One line of dialogue to Melanie was, ""I don't think there has ever been anything between Mitch and any woman"". She indicates that when she was no longer a threat to Lydia and her control over Mitch, Lydia and she became close friend and Mitch and her became like brother and sister.<br/><br/>Melanie Daniels. Wealthy, beautiful, chic, educated, fun party girl, world traveler, well groomed to 1962 perfection. Well guess who really never has a truly romantic moment with this cool, sophisticated, wealthy, party girl, blonde beauty? In the pet store scene one would expect any hunk of a healthy red blooded heterosexual male to be at least flirting with her, not intentionally making a fool out of her. I think his overall lack of interest in doing anything other than playing this unfriendly game reeks of a sarcastic distrust of woman... but he probably trusts his mother. <br/><br/>Miss Grundy. A local Bodega Bay ornithologist that is the only one that thinks all the incidents of bird attacks are ridiculous exaggeration. Grundy wears man tailored clothing. Her hairstyle, outfit, and demeanor is more of a masculine dignified Englishman than a Northern Californian elderly woman. She even smokes a pipe with butch gestures. <br/><br/>HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS EVERYONE... HERE COME THE BIRDS!!!! Explanation of the Birds... Mitch has now a second beautiful woman following and showing heavy interest in being with him. How many will he reject? How long can he hide, showing ambivalent feelings towards women as they arrive one after the other. Rivaling each other in attractiveness. How long before the towns people start calling him, Lydia's weird son that never married? The birds represent Mitch's homosexuality. They attack women and children mostly. First Melanie. Then the gull smashes Anne's door where those two women are just relaxing. Anne says, Poor thing must have got confused and flew into the light"". The children's birthday party. In the house after dinner through the fire place. Only one single male farmer was attacked in a detailed scene. He could be someone one else that may have known about Mitch. The school children. The decent on the whole town. Anne's death. Melanie, Lydia, and Anne certainly had more than a real good hint about Mitch. You can't hide it anymore Mitch. It's come home to roost! So Melanie hears some rustling upstairs while the others sleep. Melanie should know what that means. She has to have figured out by now where Mitch is concerned, something is wrong in the bedroom. Obviously his bedroom has not seen much action with women. She opens the door and is attacked and nearly killed by the birds... they peck at her and make shrieking, and scowling noises. Rescued by Mitch and Lydia she is in a state of shock. One gets the feeling as they drive away that they may never return to Bodega Bay. Lydia holds Melanie in the back seat of the car reminiscent of the Blessed Mother cradling Jesus in Michael Amgelo's statue, The Pieta. Could you ever imagine Mitch and Melanie ever being in a relationship ever again? Seems like Mitch has turned another woman into a sister."

","I was looking for a movie to watch and this one caught my eye because of Alfred Hitchcock. It's a long movie, about 2 hours and it really takes you for a wonderful ride. I wasn't bored at any part. The movie starts off as a sort of quirky romantic comedy, perfectly played by Tippi Hedren. Nobody else could have done a better job and that's why I scoff at any remake of this movie. Every scene was perfectly done and you'll probably spend a lot of time smiling (especially at the beginning).<br/><br/>Part way through the movie turns into a drama, which I usually don't like - but I love this film in every way. Finally the movie turns into a heart pounding thriller as the birds begin to cause havoc on the beautiful town of Bodega Bay (which is a real place by the way).

","I may be in the minority, but I feel that ""The Birds"" was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. <br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. <br/><br/>One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in ""The Birds,"" when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, ""Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!"" <br/><br/>There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall ""The Birds"" is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors."

It's never explained why, and an explanation isn't necessary. In some ways, it was the zombie movie before Romero. It isn't so much about what is attacking or why, it's about how the people involved react.<br/><br/>The first few bird attacks are subtle... it's not until halfway through the movie the things goes off on the crazy train. And when they do, look out, a real sense of menace ensues.<br/><br/>The special effects, done without computers, still hold up. More importantly, the characters still hold up.

","It's easily a TOP 3 Hitchcock film for me! PSYCHO is easily my favorite. With NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE BIRDS duking it out for 2nd place. Everyone raves about VERTIGO (way overrated) and REAR WINDOW (good but not great) but it's THE BIRDS which is easily the most underrated film of the Master of Suspense! Forget VERTIGO. THE BIRDS is a true masterpiece! What's really amazing about the film is that we're never told why the birds attack. They just do. And they do it in stages. No one knows why. Is it Tippi Hedren's arrival in Bodega Bay? Is it just some strange coincidence? Is it Mother Nature? Nothing is more terrifying than that which we do not understand. This film really delivers! Who can forget that scene where Tippi sits smoking on a bench as the birds slowly gather on the jungle-gym behind her? When she finally looks back she's terrified to see the jungle-gym completely covered in a black cloud of birds!! <br/><br/>But just think about the sheer guts that Hitch must have had to undertake such a daunting task as this film! I mean how do you film a movie with a swarm of killer birds pecking folks to death? And all without CGI! Using live birds!! Sheesh... if I were a director I would have said ""no thanks"" without even giving it a second thought. How do you do a movie where the villain is a bird? Not one bird. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them.<br/><br/>Sure you have a good deal of rear-projection shots. But you also have shots of real birds tied to the actual kids who are running for their lives. Each shot has to be carefully scrutinized. You have a combination of real birds & fake birds, rear-projection, various camera tricks and cuts, an exhausted Tippi Hedren who wound up in the hospital from all this, etc. The whole undertaking really does make your jaw drop! And it's not just merely a novelty item (just some ground-breaking special effects movie) it really has that genuine terror and suspense that Hitch's best films possess. Only PSYCHO is superior to this one in terms of terror/suspense! <br/><br/>It's not something like AVATAR where it's all just a commercial to show off the latest in Hollywood SFX. It's a genuine horror film!!"

","Daphne Du Maurier's work largely falls into he category of 'gothic romance' - not the kind that has glutted supermarkets since the '50s, her best known books really hark back to the genre's roots in the 19th century. Her short story, ""The Birds,"" is something of an anomaly in her work - on the surface its a sci-fi/disaster story that ends grimly (the farmer's family is pretty much doomed); but it is also clearly an expressive allegory for what it must have felt like for many British during the Battle of Britain - the description of an army of seagulls appearing on the horizon could easily be that of a fleet of German bombers. The giveaway line comes from the farmer's wife when she remarks that ""surely the Americans will do something."" Of course they did, and they and the British went on to defeat the Germans, which makes the post-war publication of the story a little out of date.<br/><br/>Hitchccock had gotten one of his most successful films from Du Maurier's work - Rebecca - as well as one of his least successful, Under Capricorn. Deciding to take one of her most popular but least typical short stories as source for The Birds may have involved some risk - especially considering what he added to the original material. Obviously there was no longer any purpose served in evoking the Battle of Britain, so the location of the film is moved to America. The birds of the film then take on an entirely different quality - they become what can be called 'an open metaphor' meaning that they can be interpreted in any number of ways. To one asking ""why are they attacking humans en masse?"" the proper response is ""what is it you most fear? that's what they will represent to you."" Hitchcock does provide us with a key to his own interpretation, by adding a clinging mother to the family unit. Hitchcock, for better or worse, is the most overtly Freudian of directors - as the birds gather in the background preparing their assault, the central players quietly dance around the problem of the lead female's sexual attraction to a man whom his mother has effectively neutered. Only the sudden onslaught of the birds allows him the moment to reclaim his status as head of the family, and by that time his would-be lover has been severely damaged. Anyone who knows Hitchcock's body of work will recognize how this resonates with themes of sexuality and fear in his other films.<br/><br/>But, again the birds are an open metaphor - Hitchcock is clever enough not to bind their threat too tightly to his own paranoias here. We are free to interpret them as we please, and to read the domestic drama as mere back-story to their unpredictable attacks. The film's suspense thus hinges, not on our concern for the family's problems, but on our own fears of inexplicable and sudden catastrophe. I think the effort to achieve that is entirely successful, and this is one of Hitchcock's most unsettling, and most memorable, accomplishments."

","Spoiler Alert! The best movie of Hitcock? Why not! I've never seen such a thrilling film like this in my entire life! The plot is really simple, but complicated in its very own way. This breathtaking film makes us breathless whenever the birds come. But when there is no birds, it's even more chilling. We know that there are birds outside, and we're not sure what will happen next. I must say that the film is very unpredictable. Especially the ending. It came as a shock to me at that time. Oh, man, I couldn't breath. Hitcock is an genius, he just knew where and when to shock you, keep you at the edge of your seat. In short, this is the best horror film I've ever since. I'm still thinking about its spectacular (and chilling) scenes when I'm typing this. Great movie."

","I am ashamed to say this, but The Birds is my first Hitchcock film. Yes, it is true, so I was not familiar with the style that he was going to use, but dang, this film was spectacular! The writing and directing really captures your full attention. What I love was that the first 40 minutes or so there was nothing about it that was in any way horror, but instead gave all the characters perfect development and mystery. The dialogue was brilliant and clever, and the characters fleshed out strongly to make us care for them. When the horror started, it completely amazed me how Hitchcock could make the transition from such a light, and fairly romantic film to a terror and suspenseful film, but that is exactly what he does. The cinematography is brilliant, as are the performances. Suzanne Pleshette was the stand-out to me, creating a very mysterious and somewhat likable, yet at the same time very hidden and obscured, character. I am fairly certain that I will seek out more of Hitchcock's film after this!"
"Eumenides_0","10","3","6","17 February 2010"," The Coming of the Birds
","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is one of the most elegant exercises in the creation of suspense, tension and terror. The story is deceptively simple: a wealthy young lady pursues a love interest to a remote little town. And when she arrives strange, unexplainable bird attacks start happening.<br/><br/>Using a story by Daphne Du Maurier, Hitchcock creates terror from the most unlikely source: common birds, these peaceful creatures that flee from us and avoid us; in this movie they become, by their sheer number, a dangerous force of evil that attacks people randomly and without purpose.<br/><br/>The movie's story is very similar to the work of a forgotten but amazing fantasy writer, Arthur Machen, who wrote a novel during WWI about the animal kingdom declaring war on Mankind. What distinguishes both works is that Hitchcock never suggests a reason for this change in the natural order.<br/><br/>The movie is constructed with the typical Hitchcockian fare: immediately likable characters, comic relief, and an understanding that what he's doing is complete fiction and not a realistic representation of anything. Hitchcock made movies to entertain, and this movie is very entertaining.<br/><br/>Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are very good in their respective roles, but I'd argue that this movie is not about human relationships but how people function in situations of tension and terror, and with the unexpected and the implausible.<br/><br/>The cinematography here sometimes reaches unimaginable heights of creepiness: one need only look at the shots of the birds peacefully standing on phone wires or roofs, looking at the viewer demurely, without giving any indication if they're going to attack or not. So much of the dread of this movie comes from the anticipation, from waiting something bad to happen because we're constantly waiting for it. There was no one like Hitchcock to manipulate the viewer's emotions.<br/><br/>47 years later, The Birds remains a very good thriller, with excellent special effects, and with a never-ending sense of dread and doom that will leave the viewer thinking for days how such a small change in the order of things could disrupt human life so entirely."

","My Take: Brilliant, subtle and surprisingly sophisticated. <br/><br/>Although age has certainly taken advantage on Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 thriller THE BIRDS, it's still one of the few of these ""nature goes wild"" thrillers that manage to keep its momentum and some of its effectiveness. Although the plot of nature turning against mankind seemed dated and became the subject of B-grade drive -in flicks and William Girdler's camping trip horrors, THE BIRDS does keep its credibility as a thriller, and a clever and subtle one at that. The silence and subtleness of the film, featuring the fact that it doesn't have an original score, presents The Master of Suspense's clever ways of obtaining suspense. There are a lot of scenes here that provide some tingle and chills, rather than violence and gore, which is somehow more effective. And, surprisingly, Hitch doesn't spare providing some bits of old-fashioned humor and romance. Hitchcock may be one of the few talents in Hollywood that can successfully fuse low-key comedy and offbeat romance with fear and panic.<br/><br/>The first few half of the film (The first attack doesn't occur until later on) was more of a comedy and a mismatched relationship between characters. Mainly, it is about the human characters first, including spoiled city girl Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren's Debut), who flirts with lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Hitchcock continues on with the humorous tone when Melanie does follow Mitch in his summer house in Bodega Bay, with a present of lovebirds intended for Mitch's sister (Veronica Cartwright). Serious thing picks up when poor Melanie gets attacked by a gull, which is later followed by a series of bizarre attacks from the birds on Bodega Bay residence. What caused them to turn against mankind? Is Melanie involved? Is she EVIL? Not even Hitch or the climax will leave you the answer to that.<br/><br/>This, I think, is a very underrated work from The Master of Suspense, with much of the complaints coming from the film ending short of what was expected. But I may be only the few ones who actually understand what Hitch is trying to do here. I think the ending may not explain the endless ""whats?"" and ""hows"", but satisfaction has nothing to do with it. Hitchcock is not the kind of director who would wanted the film to end with a bang. Hitch wanted to give as the film that would give us the creeps, and successfully gives us one that we'd think about even after it's over.<br/><br/>Yes, I give it *****. Although it isn't usually compared with Hitch's other efforts like PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO, THE BIRDS, without the comparisons, is still a great thriller that manages to create a very competent material in a premise that hardly anyone would believe in. Alongside the said classics, THE BIRDS still remains one of the master's best and most interesting efforts, and still remains one of my favorite Hitchcock movies. <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Considering ""The Birds"" is one of the most famous movies from Albert Hitchcock, I didn't think twice before recording it from my cable.

Tippi Hedren plays an audacious woman who travels to other city in order to follow a man she knew for a few minutes. For some moments, me and my dad both thought she looked a lot like Paris Hilton. The only thing to appreciate in this picture is the professional acting, which deserves some recognition. Other than that, as the birds started to attack, my dad and I had some theories about why they were doing that, or what would've happen to the citizens; we both went wrong. In fact, filmmakers never explain what is wrong with those birds, which really disappointed me. I mean, so much for nothing?

There is no resolution at the end of this film. It simply ends in a way that is senseless. The opening half of the film has a somewhat intriguing plot, but that plot is completely divorced from the rest of the movie. Essentially, birds begin attacking folks. That's it.

But Melanie, obviously smitten, wants more of Mitch. She purchases a pair of love birds and journeys to Mitch's home in Bodega Bay.<br/><br/>Melanie is typical of Hitchcock's female leads. She's svelte, statuesque, always perfectly poised and always perfectly dressed. But though he outwardly fetishized women, Hitchcock also loved to delve into their inner worlds. His film's title hints at this preoccupation; ""birds"" has long been a British slang term for ""girls"" or ""women"", perhaps owing to confusion with the Middle English word ""burde"", which also meant ""young woman"".<br/><br/>Regardless, ""Birds'"" first act watches as the perfectly coiffed Melanie slips into her perfectly polished Aston Martin and drives to the positively picaresque town of Bodega Bay (an obvious influence upon Steven Spielberg's Amity Island). Along the way Hitchcock treats us to immaculate compositions, masterful camera work, and a careful blend of comedy, sexiness, wit and foreboding. Most impressive, though, are the film's lethargic qualities. Much of ""Birds'"" first act simply watches as Melanie drives across Californian coastlines or wordlessly wanders about Bodega Bay. The film's unhurriedness, and Hitchcock's willingness to slow every set piece right down, points to a type of gracefulness and directorial confidence increasingly rare in cinema.<br/><br/>At Bodega Bay, Melanie becomes increasingly infatuated with Mitch. This infatuation ruffles the feathers of almost ever other woman in Bodega Bay, all of whom seem to nurse secret desires to be with Mitch. These women include Lydia (Mitch's widowed mother) and Annie (Mitch's ex girlfriend). Both are threatened by, and jealous of, Melanie's intrusion into their nest. If they can't have Mitch, nobody can.<br/><br/>And so the birds arrive. Expressing the unconscious desires of Bodega's women, and Mitch's mother in particular, these birds descend upon Bodega Bay. They sit upon rooftops, fences and occasionally dive-bomb Melanie. They're testing the waters. Sizing up the situation. Doing pre-invasion recon.<br/><br/>Lydia and Annie do the same. Across several beautifully staged sequences, the duo ask probing questions and do their best to disguise their true intentions, thoughts and feelings. But Melanie sees through such reconnaissance. She senses veiled threats hidden beneath urbane posturing, especially when around Lydia. Significantly, a large portrait of Mitch's father occupies the heart of Mitch's family home. With Daddy gone, Mommy has become the guardian of all Desire. Mitch - a broad-shouldered, caricature of 1950s masculinity - is thus locked in an Oedipal drama without even knowing it. Hoping to claim all Satisfaction for herself, Mommy refuses to let her Perfect Little Son go.<br/><br/>And so the attacks begin. Thousands of birds flock into Mitch's home and proceed to throw a hissy fit. Better sequences occur later, when a local man's eyes are gouged out and when a mass of birds slowly descend upon a schoolyard climbing frame. Hitchcock films these sequences with a mixture of gentlemanly, up-market sophistication, and tawdry, low-brow sensationalism. Release this film today and it would feature giant ostriches with machine guns. Hitchcock, though, draws from a more refined toolbox; voyeuristic long-shots, curious camera crawls and slow boiling suspense. His film also contains no music, only Bernard Herrmann's orchestration of electronically enhanced bird sounds.<br/><br/>Midway in ""Birds"", our heroes seek shelter in a local diner. Here various characters pontificate as to the motivations of the birds. Is this the end of the world? The apocalypse? Have the birds gone mad? The sequence ends with a hallway full of local women staring at Melanie like a coven of witches. ""She brought them here!"" they yell.<br/><br/>In Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"", an ""effeminate"" man barricades himself in a house and attempts to hold off a home invasion. For better or for worse, the film reflected the anxieties of the 1960s, in which ""sexually emancipated"" women and ""intellectual males"" tried to navigate and shake off various gender stereotypes. ""Birds'"" climax presents a kind of sexual inversion of ""Straw Dogs'"". It finds our heroes locked in a house whilst thousands of birds attempt to force their way in. Here Lydia becomes emblematic of ""traditional"" womanhood; a maternal, asexual, docile homemaker. Melanie's the modern interloper; a high flying, independent, big city sexpot who ""hates her own mother"" and ""dances topless in fountains"". The film then ends with Melanie being beaten, humiliated and tamed. She's reduced to a childlike state, now no longer threatening and now in explicit need of Lydia's motherly nurturing. Only then does Lydia finally accept Melanie. Only then do the birds withdraw.<br/><br/>Controlling mothers are everywhere in Hitchcock's filmography. They feature most prominently, though, in Hitchcock's ""Mommy Trilogy"", which consists of three successive, very Freudian films: ""Psycho"" (1960), ""Birds"" (1963) and ""Marnie"" (1964). In ""Psycho"", a son jealously kills the controlling, puritanical mother who conditioned him to feel guilty about his own sexual desires. In ""Marnie"", meanwhile, the daughter of a once promiscuous now puritanical mother learns to stop fearing both men and sexual desire. In these two films, traumatic childhood memories, as well as ""represssive"" attitudes toward sex, lead to neuroses and psychoses in the grown up son or daughter. And in both films, when something induces the momentary retrieval of a repressed memory, a neurotic or psychotic episode is triggered.<br/><br/>Melanie's trajectory in ""Birds"" presents an inversion of her trajectory in ""Marnie"" (also starring Tippi Hedren). She's a modern, confident, ""sexually liberated"" woman who is beaten into submission and essentially turned into Psycho's Norman Bates. The result is a supremely strange film: a FX heavy, crowd-pleasing, expressionistic, psychodrama-slasher-sex-comedy, directed like High Art and featuring killer birds.<br/><br/>8.9/10 – See ""Black Narcissus"", ""The Beguiled"" and ""Three Women""."

","The Birds. Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a mystery around a love story and some family drama. It has all ingredients required for a taut thriller but the level of satisfaction at the end might is questionable.<br/><br/>The story starts as a typical love story where heroine chases down her hero to far distance in order to win him but gets stuck in his town when mysteriously birds start attacking people. Like a pure hitchcockian experience, there are consistently impressive performances by all actors, beautiful locations, mysterious conversations and delicious screenplay. The scenes of birds gathering before attacking and attacking from unlikely places are haunting enough to give you goose bumps.<br/><br/>But The Birds feels like a betrayal at the end. With so much suspense built up in 2 hrs, you feel cheated when at the end no questions are answered and movie ends abruptly.<br/><br/>I am going with good 7 out of 10 for The Birds. It is good in every sense but the unquestionable thirst for answers might irritate you at the end."
"estebangonzalez10","7","2","4","15 August 2014"," The Birds Attack!
","""Have you ever seen so many gulls? What do you suppose it is?""<br/><br/>After having surprised and shocked audiences with Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock followed it up with another horror film, The Birds, which is more straightforward and generic than the rest of his films, but he still did experiment quite a bit with some elements here. There are no surprises or unexpected twists in The Birds and it pretty much plays out as a standard thriller slowly building the suspense by introducing us to the characters so we can identify with them. He didn't use psychological suspense either like he did in so many of his films, he just let the narrative unfold gradually. This may sound like a standard horror film, but what Hitchcock experiments with here is the lack of a musical score to accompany the film. Most thrillers rely on eerie scores to help set the mood, and we know Hitchcock included them often such as in films like Vertigo and Psycho, but here rather than introducing music he uses the sound of birds to scare audiences. Many people complain that the effects are outdated, but it didn't bother me at all, I thought they were really well done and I felt the tension during some of these scenes that have become classic by now (such as the scene where Tippi Hedren's character is trapped inside a phone booth as the birds are attacking the town, and the climatic scene where the birds are surrounding Rod Taylor's home). Those were memorable scenes full of tension, but I did have some issues with the pacing of the story. <br/><br/>Hitchcock made sure we cared for the characters and during the first hour of the film he spends time building a possible romantic relationship between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren. This is where I wished the main characters were played by more charismatic actors such as James Stewart and Kim Novak where the chemistry between them would seem stronger, and that would have engaged me more with a story I kind of felt was silly otherwise. The premise is kind of out there since I really never believed the threat of the birds nor felt their presence haunting, but Hitchcock still managed to build in a few scares despite it all. The bay near San Francisco where this film mostly takes place was a perfect setting and I actually enjoyed the fact that it took place in an enclosed space like this. It sort of made the audience believe these characters were enclosed and surrounded by the birds. Hitchcock can build suspense out of nearly anything and despite my disbelief of the birds being a real threat there were times I did feel that tension. The way in which he exchanges shots from one scene to the next like he did in the phone booth with exterior shots exchanged with interior ones really helps build the suspense and create a tense atmosphere. The Birds may not have much psychological depth, but it plays out quite well as a generic disaster film and slowly builds its way up to a rather interesting climatic scene (I mean switch the birds for zombies and you realize where George A. Romero may have got his ideas for Night of the Living Dead). The Birds isn't amongst my favorite Hitchcock films, but I still had a fun time with it."
"Rainey-Dawn","8","2","4","25 June 2014"," A Very Good Horror Thriller
","A very good suspenseful thriller from the master of mystery, murder, mayhem and horror Alfred Hitchcock. The plot of the movie is just as you would guess: birds attaching people and the people will do anything to stop the terror. Yet as simple as the plot sounds, the movie is so much better than it sounds like it would be - it's the characters themselves that take the film to a A+ movie level rather than a simple b-rated horror movie.<br/><br/>Yes I have experienced birds attacking me in the past. And fairly recently, some birds were attacking my cats because they were trying to protect their babies in a nest - so that in itself give me a basic idea of how truly terrifying it would be if all birds started attacking people as depicted in the film ""The Birds"".<br/><br/>This is a must see for those that love horror and thrillers! 8.5/10"

","This is one of the old classic movies that I actually enjoy watching. Everything just seems to work well together. It is one of those things that I cannot pinpoint as to what I like about it. The cast are engaging, the location is eerie, the script is great and it just seems to work.<br/><br/>I love the fact that something so simple like a bird can generate an idea for a great suspense thriller. Alfred Hitchcock really was an incredible director. Even if he didn't have the best technology he used what he had to create a movie that might make you think the next time you come into contact with a little birdie. Even more interesting was his personal relationship with Tippi Hedren. Sometimes real life can be more interesting than the movies."

","The first and only time I've watched this movie was with my mom when I was a little kid. Back at that time, the movie frightened me to new levels, as it was horrifying to see flocks of birds attacking people mercilessly.<br/><br/>I don't remember the actual plot of the story, which consists of a San Francisco socialite following a boyfriend to a small town, where all sorts of birds suddenly begin to attack people. I just remembered the birds viciously attacking the town's residents, people trapping themselves in buildings and gas stations blowing up, indirectly caused by the birds.<br/><br/>Unlike conventional horror movies, where you would normally see ghosts, goblins, vampires and zombies, ""The Birds"" is a film that gives you a normal everyday creature suddenly attacking people in huge numbers, something you don't expect to witness. This, as a result, is a very interesting concept for a horror movie and definitely send chills to your spines.<br/><br/>All the scenes of mayhem, chaos and people running for their lives are disturbing, yet suspenseful.

"pixrox1","8","2","4","4 September 2013"," Many of Stephen King's so-called ""trademarks"" . . .
",". . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken ""doomsayer""--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS."

","There was a great quote I once read about this film "" Enough to make you kick the next pigeon you meet"". Actually that seems a trifle unfair, because the aggressors are mainly blackbirds and gulls, with nary a rat with wings in sight. Of course, if the bacteria-spreading vermin DID put together an army intent on conquering mankind, we wouldn't stand a snowball in hell's chance, as there seem to be more of the little buggers than wasps at Alton Towers during the summer. So it's best to not give them any ideas...<br/><br/>Some of Hitchcock's films I think are slightly overrated, but not this one... The scenes of the amassing avian menaces are as creepy as you like, and once the initial attack on poor old Tippi it's suspense and excitement all the way. What make it even better is we're never given a concrete reason as to why these beaked terrors are targeting us. Maybe we're not throwing down as much bread as we used to? Or perhaps it's a protest measure against us keeping vicious cats? (Guilty as charged) Whatever, the fact there isn't a simple solution makes the events evermore scary and nerve wracking.<br/><br/>Also, I should mention that I LOVE the slow dramatic build-up each scene has, this is definitely the most believable Hitch I've seen in terms of human interaction. When two people have a conversation, they don't just advance the story... we hear asides, anecdotes and irrelevances. Some people may get bored of this chatter and want to skip to the next sky dive bombing. I, being of slightly more sophisticated stock ;) appreciated the nuances of a very good film that didn't just rely on shock tactics to keep the viewer interested.<br/><br/>So overall then, a film for the ages. Hang on, what's this white stuff on my shoulder... DAMN!!! Now, where did I put that air rifle... 8/10"
"nEoFILM","10","2","4","12 March 2012"," Hitchcock at his best
","1960 saw the release of Psycho, Hitchcock's signature work, but Psycho is not the only film that people think of when talking about his work. The Birds, made three years later, has a warm place in film fans hearts and a much larger fan base than people seem to think.<br/><br/>I know more people who dislike Psycho compared to those who like The Birds and I feel that this is most defiantly Alfred Hitchcock at his best. Rear Window and Vertigo are also up there but this film offers the right blend of shocks and a disturbing sense of dread, that makes it accessible by many, whilst still being fun to watch.<br/><br/>The birds have turned. Nature is taking her wrath upon man for a brief moment, but the sheer scale of the idea that nature could turn on us is a primally frightening concept. I do feel that this was the vain in which M. Night Shyamalan's dismal The Happening was attempting to tap into decades later, but Hitchcock got this right first time, for all time.<br/><br/>The effects are dated but their impact is still strong, as the ideas are so pronounced that there's little need to show anything. The acting is decent and the direction, though not as perfect as many would argue for Hitch, still doing the job well. This is a timeless and more accessible Hitchcock classic than Psycho, yet often dismissed and I wonder why?<br/><br/>Both films are clear genre pieces and are still being drawn from today. This is a textbook thriller with a natural twist and a dire tone. But the image of the crow massing on telegraph poles is a simple as it it frighting, just because it happens every day"
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","4","8 February 2012"," No time for 'Why?' and no time for 'How?' ... only for 'Wow!' ...
","Probably Hitchcock's last film to be so deeply rooted in the cultural unconscious, ""The Birds"" is as traumatically heart-pounding as it was five decades ago, and I even defy the CGI-nourished eyes of the current generation not to be thrilled by this masterpiece of horror.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" is one of my favorite films from Hitch for one simple reason; it's straight-forwardly horrific. It's one of the rare occurrences where the Master decides not to embarrass himself with subtleties and innuendos and go directly to the core, which is about a peaceful little town in a California bay, victim of incessant attacks from seagulls, crows, sparrows. Of course, these attacks started with a pivotal event, a newcomer, Melanie Daniels, incarnated by the beautiful Tippi Hedren, coming from San Francisco to meet a potential boyfriend, the hunky Mitch, played by Rod Taylor. During a boat ride, she's savagely attacked by a gull, a sudden event that foreshadows the beginning of a nightmarish journey where the attacks will increase, getting more and more cruel, and coming from all kinds of birds. As a true nightmare, there is no proper answer to all the ""why's"" and ""how's"", just a level of nasty viciousness getting more and more disturbing and depriving the film from the sensuality we expect from a Hitch film.<br/><br/>Speaking of sensuality, I'm perfectly aware that the aficionados of the Hitchockian oeuvre would spend hours to identify and analyze all the sexual or sensual aspects of the film, its predominance of women and the significant part they play, from Suzan Pleshette to Jessica Tandy who plays Mitch's skeptical mother, but I have the intimate conviction that Hitchcock wanted to make, though ""The Birds"" a film that would make people jump off their seat, and the cardiac rhythm to increase rather than the brainy mechanisms to work. This is not an intellectual film, and the romance only works as a starter and never does it serve the film, mostly driven by a heart-pounding urgency. It's a sensational masterpiece of terror in the purest tradition of the genre, with an undeniable entertaining value, illustrating Hitchcock's quote: ""The length of a film should be directly related to the endurance of the human bladder."" ""The Birds"" is popular now because it was 'popular' back then.<br/><br/>What makes me so sure that it wasn't intended to be deeper than that? Well, consider all the movies made about attacks from group of evil creatures, or monsters. There are three categories of villains: those who come from a reason and are defeated at the end, like the shark from ""Jaws"", those who comes from nowhere but are eventually defeated at the end, like the zombies from ""The Night of the Living Dead"" and those who come from a reason and are not necessarily defeated at the end, leaving a cloud of ambiguity. In the case of ""Birds"", not only do the attacks seem purely arbitrary, yet the movie ends with one unforgettable interrogation mark, keeping a great mystery for the reasons of their attacks and the way to defeat them. Many essays traced an interesting parallel between the attacks of the girls and the relationship that involves the male character with the women of his life, applying a sort of sexual innuendo in the bird's attack. As much as I was fascinated by these readings, I must admit that it's nothing compared to the film as a visual experience.Hitchcock said it himself: ""If it's a good movie, the sound could go off and the audience would still have a perfectly clear idea of what was going on."" From that basis, ""The Birds"" is his greatest film because the level of horror is transcended by outstanding visual effects and quite groundbreaking for their time.<br/><br/>Who can't be left with a sheer terror when witnessing the scene where the birds ruins a little girl's birthday or attack a group of running and screaming children, when we discover a store owner with plucked eyes, a gutsy shot that probably had the same effect than the decapitated head in ""Jaws"". Indeed, birds as ruthless and democratic in their targets as the shark from ""Jaws"", they attack children, women, old people as to sustain the idea of a truly apocalyptic universe where everyone's life is threatened, and the feeling is even scarier because since we don't know where this comes from, we don't know how to end it. If the special effects were mature for their ages, how about the fact that Hitchcock didn't let the birds be defeated. It's such a pervert yet delightful move that couldn't have been more powerful,in the iconic last shot where a literally sea of birds occupy the house and we feel that at any moments, the protagonists would 'get it', nothing happens but we still endure one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema's history.<br/><br/>The attacks where about horror, and terror, but the last scene is all about suspense, because you just don't know if the bomb will explode or not and if it does when, and you can only breath when 'The End' appears, but we're still not sure about the character's fate. Anyone who wants to make a horror thriller should watch ""The Birds"" because it's landmark for the genre that elevates violence to a level never reached before the 'New Hollywood' wave. Proof that Hitchcock was never an old-school director and remained one of the most influential, and one of the few privileged one, along with Fellini and Bergman, who inspired an adjective.<br/><br/>""The Birds"" is a Hitchcockian masterpiece."

","Alfred Hitchcock was simply a master, and arguments can be had until Kingdom come as to which of his classics was the best, but at the end of the day it can only ever be subjective. I am aware that there is an argument for both ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Vertigo"" as his best, but as much as I love theme, ""The Birds"" is my favourite.<br/><br/>I actually think the film itself sags a little in the front half, and I'm not a huge fan of Tippi Hedren, but that all falls away when you look at how brilliantly executed this film is. Technically, Hitchcock was light years ahead of his time, using a record number of trick-shots, and for such a dated film, the effects still look amazing, to the point where I wonder, ""How did he manage that?"" Exciting filmmaking from a man who, if alive today, would still be showing the rest of them how it is done."

","I've seen this movie many times and I think I finally got it (with apologies to any posts already saying this, that I have not read). Incidentally, it's a nearly perfect film, I'm not a Hitchcock fanatic by any means, and the only real flaw is the sequence of three stills of Melanie in the diner window. <br/><br/>Never mind. It's Mom behind the 'bird war'. It's Jessica Tandy. We know of only one attack prior to Melanie's arrival - the gulls and the fishing boat - and it may be that was a little bit of Lydia Brenner premonition. Just watch all the scenes in the Brenner house; every time Cathy expresses affection for Melanie, Tandy is stressed. Same with Mitch. Then come the birds. Most telling is the climactic attack later on, when they're all sitting and waiting in the boarded home. Cathy feels sick and turns to Melanie, not her mother. Two minutes later...Then, before the schoolhouse attack, Lydia asks Melanie three times if Cathy will be safe there. She knows, somehow. And don't forget that, the birds aside, the pivotal tension in the storyline is Lydia's neurotic dread of being abandoned.<br/><br/>What is very cool is that Lydia is unaware of what she is creating through her distress."

But it is still a good movie, just not GREAT like I hoped.<br/><br/>Tippi's character is a little too stalkish in the beginning, following Taylor to his hometown. Who would do this? Especially nowadays. And I guess I have never been a big Rod Taylor fan - he always seems a little neaderthal-ish Okay, enough of the negatives. I think the real beauty of the movie is that it takes something you never think of as a threat, i.e. birds, and suddenly has you thinking... ""It could happen?!..."" So it succeeds in inspiring fear. I wonder if had the same effect on people back then, that Jaws had on my generation? <br/><br/>But the ending fell flat for me. I see it was meant to leave you asking ""So what happens...?"".

","I finally bought a copy of Alfred Hitchcock's undeniably outstanding killer animal fright film masterpiece on DVD and rewatched it. Although I've viewed it many times, ""The Birds"" still managed to creep me out and make my hair stand on end as I saw it yet again. I think this alone serves a sterling testament to just what a remarkably strong and scary movie ""The Birds"" truly is. Hitchcock's extremely meticulous and thus thoroughly believable evocation of a pedestrian everyday mundane world populated by ordinary, yet engaging and interesting true-to-life characters going about their usual business that's violently disrupted by the savage, shocking and inexplicable hostile attacks by every kind of bird qualifies as his major artistic triumph here. There's a conviction and plausibility evident in this film which makes it quite powerful and frightening in comparable measure. Moreover, the performances by the top-rate cast are uniformly outstanding (Tippi Hedren in her delightful film debut, the ever-rugged and appealing Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy and a very young Veronica Cartwright are all splendid), the inspired use of natural sound and conspicuous absence of a standard score is brilliantly effective, the bird attack sequences are stunningly harrowing and horrifying (the climactic night long siege on the house is an absolute tour-de-force of nerve-wracking terror and tension), and the amazingly convincing special effects remain impressive to this very day (Albert Whitlock's extraordinary matte paintings are simply spectacular). Fantastic chillingly ambiguous ending, too. If you haven't seen this one in some time I strongly advise that you watch it again. I'm absolutely certain it will still get under your skin as well."

It's still a good horror film but Tippi looks unrealistically perfect, even after being attacked by violent birds. There's no outside help. No one comes to kill the birds or rescue the people in this small town, even though they're near San Francisco. Was Hitchcock blaming Tippi, the outsider who had romantic designs on Rod Taylor, for the bird attack? Was she too sexy for her own good? I think that's the ""moral"" of this story but I'm not completely sure! And yes, Jessica Tandy looks and sounds exactly like an older version of Tippi, although this is never mentioned in the movie. It's a good film although outdated, and the bird attacks are still gruesome. What I didn't like was seeing children being attacked by birds. That was in bad taste."

The feeling of suspense is there for sure though and that ending .. well I know I loved it, not sure about others, but that's the way to do it!"

","A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds suddenly begin to attack people.<br/><br/>It sounds silly, but it does kind of work. I personally don't think this is one of Hitchcock's better films, but it's still pretty decent, and worth at least one viewing. The film's pacing is at times glacial, but it's worth sitting through for the iconic bird attacks, some of which are still sort of scary, even if the visual effects aren't too impressive anymore. Still, I like the ending, as well as the fact that the film succeeded in making fairly mundane-looking birds pretty damn scary, but I just wish the film was about twenty minutes shorter- it's about two hours long, and at points you can really tell. (Just to let you know, I'm fine with two hour plus movies if I feel they justify their length, but The Birds is pretty much a B-movie with solid acting and A-grade directing and effects (for their time)- it really doesn't need to be longer than 100 minutes in my opinion). 6.5/10"

","It's been a while since I've been to Bodega Bay, but Hitchcock has been a favourite since I first watched a VHS of this some 30 years ago. Today I'm introducing my daughter to Alfred's avian nightmare. Now if I'm really really honest, The Birds is pretty cheesy. Hammy acting, the lovebirds swaying in the car footwell, not to mention the retro 60s charm of matte effects, but I love The Birds. Even knowing everything that happens before it graces the screen, the tension is gripping and my young companion gasps accordingly. In 60 years on The Birds hasn't lost its magic. Melanie Daniels proving that the rich have a lot of time on their hands, to go flirting with Mitch Brenner in the outskirts of San Francisco. The old fashioned bayside town is really the star for me, even more than the birds themselves and the cast of backwater characters and their simple lives acts as the perfect canvas for something so unexpected as human hunting airborne marauders. We get a ""whoa"" as the children sing in the school house as the birds amass and I'm taken back to my teenage self watching in awe as each scene painstakingly builds. Yes it's schlocky, yes Tippi Hedren is a bit wooden and yes it's essentially a single premise slowly drawn out over two hours, but this is one of my favourite Hitch outings and I can't wait to relive more."

","""When I was a budding young cinephile, my parents started to introduce me and my siblings to some of Hitchcock's tamer films like ""North by Northwest"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and this film. These films made quite an impression on me when I was young, but I grew older and watched more of Hitchcock's oeuvre, and whenever I was in the mood to watch one of his films I found myself gravitating towards either rewatching my favorite- ""Psycho""- or checking out one the films of his that I had not seen as a child (like ""Rebecca"" or ""Notorious""). It had been a long time since I had revisited this film, so when we at TMM decided to revisit Hitchcock, I thought this would be a great time to go back to a movie I hadn't seen in probably fifteen years.<br/><br/>I remembered this film to be pretty intense, but that was from the perspective of myself as a child. I honestly was a bit nervous to revisit this, because, out of all of Hitch's films, I have to say that this one probably has the schlockiest plot. Nevertheless, I started my journey to Bodega Bay, and to my delight, I found the film not only still holds up, it completely elevates all of the schlocky elements to the point that it becomes artistic. It just goes to show you how great of a director Hitchcock really was.<br/><br/>I think the thing I like most about this film is the way that it sort of starts off as a rather melodramatic romance, plodding along rather pleasantly, before it shifts, ever so violently, and suddenly the viewer finds him or herself in a horror flick. This sort of structuring isn't unusual for Hitch (look at ""Psycho"" which starts out as a thriller about a secretary stealing forty-thousand dollars, before it shifts, and we're suddenly watching a movie about a mad, cross-dressing serial killer), but it does put the viewer in a position of feeling unprepared for whatever will happen next. I think one of the reasons I like that shift so much is because A) it allows time for us to get to know the characters and their backstories, and B) when freak phenomenon happen (realistic or fantastical) usually there isn't a lot of warning when said phenomenon occurs. Not only does it feel far more realistic to have our characters wandering about their lives, going about whatever it was that they would normally be doing before the phenomenon happens, it makes it much more frightening when that shift does happen."

For instance I believe that it should have been explained why the birds attacted people or give at least some details on that because it was the main story. To sum up I think that the film is based on good actors and great director but they forgot about the plot."

","Well, I'm so glad I sold my Budgies and Cockatiels before I watch this movie. Because this was pretty darn disturbing!<br/><br/>The Birds finds Hitchcock at his very best building up the tension and creating suspense. The way the minor details are revealed in this movie is enough to make you glued to the screen throughout the whole movie, but I already know that Hitchcock is the best in doing this.
What I didn't know before watching this movie is that The Master of Suspense is also a Master of Symbolism!<br/><br/>Many people consider The Birds as one of Hitchcock most modest films, even some of his fans. I can see why, and it's simply because the movie seems that it left a lot of very important questions unanswered. I said it seems because it really did answer these questions symbolically.<br/><br/>I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen this gem yet, but I'll just point that the key to all these questions is a very important character and everything related to it.<br/><br/>Just try to think which character the movie gave it a lot of exposition, and you'll easily understand the whole movie. And there is where I've an issue with The Birds. I think it gives a lot of explanations to this character that we don't necessarily need to because the movie expose some details what have already been revealed before. That being said, all characters are well-grounded, compelling, interesting, and necessary to the plot.<br/><br/>All the performances were excellent, specially from Tippi Hedren who played the movie's protagonist. She is a wonderful actress, and her performance in this movie is nothing short of endearing. She is as charming as Audrey Hepburn!<br/><br/>Some few decisions the characters made, may be one or two, are not so subtle, but the execution of the results to these decisions is what annoyed me a little bit. The characters seemed forced to fall into the trap.<br/><br/>Although there is some blood and gore in this movie, Alfred Hitchcock proves again that what the scenes imply can be way more brutal than what they show. The scenes when the titular creatures attack are very painful to watch. Adding insult to injury, the birds acquire a metaphorical complexity that is as distressing as their beaks!<br/><br/>Overall, The Birds is a very underrated Hitchcock film that doesn't lack any of Hitchcock's unparalleled brilliance. Also it would make a great companion to Hitchcock's most famous work, Psycho!<br/><br/>(9/10)"
"LuckyMatt93","10","0","0","22 August 2009"," ""Suspense and shock beyond anything you have seen or imagined!""
","The Birds is easily one of the best horror films of all time. It's Hitchcock's second best achievement (behind the fantastic horror masterpiece that was Psycho).<br/><br/>One of the great things about this is that there's no soundtrack, just the ominous sounds of the birds flapping and screeching. It only underscores Hitch's sure directorial hand -- who needs a clanging, scary soundtrack when the images and well-plotted suspense do it all for you? The fact that we cannot really unravel the mystery gives the film an almost mythic quality, as if it means more than it actually does.<br/><br/>The performances are top notch. Tippi Hendren steals the show as the wealthy but fun-loving socialite. Jessica Tandy provides a hypnotic and wonderfully disturbing portrait of a possessive mother, and Suzanne Pleshette is excellent as an emotionally devastated schoolteacher -- she blends toughness and vulnerability to perfection in a small role.<br/><br/>There's only one small problem. The matte paintings and animation that create the attack scenes are admittedly both tame and lame when looked at today. Yet it hardly detracts from the rest of the film anyways, so it's really nothing. <br/><br/>I don't know how else to put the way I feel abut The Birds except to say ""indescribable"". The unsettling atmosphere, the mounting terror, the slow building suspense, etc. It's still as frightening as it was back in 1963, laced with shots that will haunt you long after you watch it."
"OneTreeHillRULEZ","8","0","0","25 January 2008"," Not Hitchcock's finest, but overall a great film
","The Birds, Alfred Hitchcock's second adaptation of a Daphne du Maurier novel (the first being Rebecca), is about a fictional town in Northern California which is attacked by birds after Melanie Daniels, the main character, comes to visit a man who caught her interest, Mitch Brenner. It is a thriller/horror.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was well-done. Although not as great as some of Hitchcock's other films, he definitely left his mark on it, as he does with all of his films: the dark humor, the haunting mom character, and, of course, the blonde female victim.<br/><br/>Using key collaborators which have worked with him on other projects, Hitchcock used his skilled team to make a great film. Robert Burks, the cinematographer who worked with Hitchcock on other projects such as Strangers on a Train (1951), Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), To Catch a Thief (1955), Vertigo (1958), and North by Northwest (1959) did a remarkable job. This one shot, where he shoots upwards, after the last attack, is terrifying as I kept expecting another one.<br/><br/>What I found in Hitchcock's films, specifically in this one, is that the action scenes aren't the scary part, the anticipation to them is. The scene in which Melanie goes up the stairs and you just know something bad is going to happen and there will be birds was more nerve-wrecking than the actual attack. This, in my opinion, is Hitchcock's strong point. He is able to hold the suspense in such a way that is shuddersome.<br/><br/>Regarding the comedy, in the scene in the diner, the one guy who kept commenting on it being the end of the world was fitting for Hitchcock's humor, as it was more comedic than actually serious.<br/><br/>Although there was no musical score in the film, Bernard Hermann is still credited as a sound consultant. I found that fact interesting, as there wasn't even a beginning score, just the sound of birds.<br/><br/>The female character was, of course, the victim once again in this film as in many others of Hitchcock. Male superiority is clearly seen. An example in this film is when the man at the gas station is hit. Mitch orders Melanie to stay inside while the rest of the ""hopeless"" females and children watch on the sidelines as the brave men go outside to try and save the day.<br/><br/>As said earlier, the film was overall a good one. It is too overrated when it comes down to it being as scary as people say. The performances were good, nothing great or exceptional such as in Hitchcock's Rear Window. Hitchcock used his ""suspense-skill"" in a perfect way and his sense of humor shone through as well ."

","The short story by Daphne du Maurier is transposed from South West England to America for this Hitchcock outing. It contains some really effective and scary moments and is beautifully photographed. It also has some typical Hitchcock humour. Without giving the game away for those yet to view this film, it concerns a strange phenomenon - all the birds start to gather together for a concerted attack on mankind. This attack is viewed from the perspective of the inhabitants of a small seaside community and an outsider - played by Tippi Hedren. The very ambiguous ending is as per the original tale, and all the more chilling for it. When short stories are expanded to full length films the original's impact is frequently lost. Not so here, I think. One does not look at gulls and starlings in quite the same way, having seen this film!"

This is Alfred Hitchcock's best in my opinion. However, the only movies he's directed that I've seen are Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, The Birds, Rope, Marnie, Vertigo, and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This movie brought much fear to me and I wish that they weren't making a sequel because they will ruin the whole thing. This was smart, suspenseful, and gave me the feeling that Hitchcock could do anything. He can, too (including appear in his directed films. In this one, he appears coming out of the pet shop about a minute after the credits). I urge you who love suspense that have not seen The Birds yet to do so. You'll have the thrill of a lifetime."

","If you watch this on DVD or from digital television it doesn't look like as if it has aged at all.

Hitchcock puts deepness into characters and it makes them believable but it also makes this movie pretty slow because of the long lasting dialogues. Another thing to notice is that there's no soundtrack, just the ambient sounds. It's good in a way and it actually suits the film really well.<br/><br/>If they remaked this movie they could not use birds in that way because there's a law to prohibit cruelty to animals.

","First off, Tippi Hedren was great for the part. This movie just shows that you don't need to have ANY music in a movie just to make it scary. It's great how Hitchcock slowly builds up the suspense, as he does in all his movies. The scary thing about this movie is that when you see it, it is not only scary to see these innocent people being attacked by the birds, but it's also sort of psychologically scary because Hitchcock almost forces you to believe that this could really happen at any time when we least expect it. In my opinion, the only REALLY scary scene is when Melanie goes upstairs and is attacked by the birds and is basically trapped, what makes that scene so scary was that the it shows the birds coming right at the camera and also that they show so many times the birds biting her hand in the same place, you feel likes it's almost happening to you. An excellent film but you might not want to see it if you are already a little afraid of birds."

","This movie is definitely gripping in parts but why on Earth do the birds attack only at certain times? This is never really revealed. The development of the characters is also wafer thin. Having said that, this is a genuine Hitchcock thriller. It came during the peak of the great masters powers films like Rear Window,Vertigo, North by Northwest, Psycho, and the Birds all appearing within a ten year period. Hitchcock's earlier and later films with the possible exception of Frenzy in 1972 never quite seemed as captivating as what Hitchcock produced in the 50s and early 60s. It featured the debut of the masculine Australian actor Rod Steiger who went on to become a widely respected actor. Hitchcock's fascination with blondes continues with Tippi Hedren in this case being the leading lady. The location of Bodega Bay, California seems ideal and portrays the intended isolation quite nicely. A little more meaningful dialogue and character development would have been all that this needed to become a true and timeless classic. Well worth a watch."

","When it first came out, the public was disappointed. It wasn't Psycho and seemed to pale in comparison to Norman's story, but I liked it better than Psycho then and still do today. Along with Shadow of a Doubt and 39 Steps, it is my favorite Hitchcock. <br/><br/>I watched it again last night, Halloween, on a VHS tape from several years ago. Today I came to this board; I notice there are 22 pages of comments, so I doubt I can add anything new, but here are some thoughts in general that may engender more discussion on boards:<br/><br/>1. The final scene will always stick with you; 2. How many times does Hitch let his heroines enter a room that they should not? This plot device goes back to Mary Roberts Rinehart, but it works every time. 3. Get the wide screen DVD; there is one scene in my 'fit to your screen' tape where Mitch is talking to Melanie walking back to the house, but he is not on the screen. 4. Tippi is gorgeous, but there are times you can hear daughter Melanie's helium voice bursting out. 5. I wonder about the necessity of the scene in the restaurant with the end of the world man, the old lady who studies birds, the mother and kids eating lunch and the fisherman. It is borrowed from many 50's SCI-FI pictures. The purpose, of course, is to give a pause until the next attack, but all the dialog sounds so trite. 6. Is Annie the only teacher in that school? 7. And what did Mitch's father do for a living when they resided in Bodega Bay? Today such a place would be overrun by tourists. 8. I cannot get over the confidence of Hitchcock, to set that first gull attack on Melanie without music. I keep trying to think what Jaws would be like without the pounding score. 9. Then again, sharks do not caw or coo. There were over 100 starlings and blackbirds on my lawn and in the trees this morning, making what sounded like a hideous racket. Yesterday the noise would not have bothered me, but today? 10. Can we make a pact to shoot the first producer or director who announces he or she wants to remake the film?"
"middleburg","8","0","0","31 October 2005"," ""Why are they doing this.....the Birds?""
","Each time I see ""The Birds"" I am enthralled. And yet each time I get annoyed. I am one of those viewers duly recognizing the eternal genius of Hitchcock--and The Birds is right up there with the best of his films. For film magic to really take effect--one of course has to suspend disbelief. And while there are moments that I quibble with in each of his films in terms of common sense or in terms of the way people would really talk or react in the given situations--with ""The Birds"" there are so many more of those moments. OK--here goes:<br/><br/>What I love about ""The Birds"" 1. that famous scene of the birds circling down from the heavens over the burning gas station. 2. The great schoolyard scene--what a visual jolt the first time both Melanie Daniels and the viewer sees the full scope of the perched birds. (In that scene I even like that dumb song the kids are singing--I could sing it right now!!) 3. At the end of the scene where the family, in their own household cage, are surrounded by the frightening sounds of the bird attacks, and each character comes into view with the camera down below looking up at their eerily lit and haunted visage. Disorienting and Intriguing as could be. 4. The variety of the bird attacks--no two are the same--each one grows in intensity--and is so singular. One doesn't really prepare the viewer for the next one. 5. The electronic score. Mesmerizing--right from the word ""Go""! 6. That well-needed moment of repose in the seaside diner with the assorted town characters all chattering away. We're in the middle of a cataclysm, in the middle of our roller-coaster ride, but we enjoy the humor, irony, and sort of comfort of these people all gathered together. (We would not want to be alone during an attack like this--we crave human contact.) 7. The beautiful visuals--whether of the ride up the coastal highway, or the curving Bodega Bay, or the School's majestic position on the hill. 8. The final, eerie landscape of the birds in closeup around the house--to an infinite distance. 9. The intriguing ending--leaving it all up to our imagination as to ""what happens""--and making us want to see the film all over again to search for clues to what indeed happens. 10. Hitchcock's genuinely funny appearance at the beginning walking out the store with his two funny white dogs. Incongruous and adorable.<br/><br/>What I find annoying about ""The Birds"" 1. I'm sorry-- I know, I know--the opening helps set the mood, and there is lots of symbolism, and lots of Red Herrings as to where the plot might go--but it is still too damn long before anything ""good"" happens! 2. Some of the acting is just execrable. Tippi Hedron is beautiful--but that voice!! 3. The whiny kids! They had me rooting for the birds sometimes. 4. Why does Melanie leave the diner for the phone booth? Oh--the visuals in the phone booth are spectacular. But why did she do that? 5. Why does Mitch spend ALL that time hammering wooden boards onto the outside windows of his house, when he should have just taken his family and gotten the Heck out of there? (Of course that would have deprived us of some additional spectacular scenes.) But it just seems silly what he is doing. 6. The sound of Cathy throwing up. (As she delicately coughs a couple of times. If you listen really hard--you do hear the sound of a bit of a ""throw-up sound""--but that may be wishful thinking! I say its just coughing!!) 7. Lydia's character. What an annoying human being. 8. Mitch's opening nastiness to Melanie. Melanie has to have real co- dependency issues to be drawn to him after that unpleasant exchange! I didn't buy it. 9. Some awkward camera shots--when the car explodes in flames, there are three frozen scenes of Teppi Hedron looking from her right to her left--it looks sort of silly. Also, the cook at the end of this scene suddenly runs in saying that the birds are leaving after everyone has already accepted that fact. It comes out inadvertently funny. 10. Cathy's immortal line: ""Why are they doing this....the birds?"" <br/><br/>It's a classic and a great movie, and who knows? Maybe some of the ""lesser moments"" adds to its classic, unforgettable reputation. I've seen this film more times than I can count--and if it were on tonight--I'd watch it again!"

I've seen this film a couple of times, once when I was very young and again yesterday. I remember that the first time I saw it it really did quite scare me, as I can't remember exactly how old I was but to be quite honest I was a bit of a woos anyway!

In creating 'The Birds' he achieved what he set out to do, and that was to create a movie that would terrorise and shock cinema goers of the time (1963). However I feel that it has be said that most cinema goers of this generation would not even be slightly un-nerved by this film. With movies now such as 'The Grudge', 'Creep' and 'The Ring' I think it is safe to say that this film is not designed to shock modern society. This film is a classic and should be treated as such, but speaking as somebody who is not even a hard core fan of the horror genre and does not normally even enjoy being scared I must admit that no-longer can this film be described as horrifying, or even vaguely scary. But in saying that, don't get me wrong, I still really like this movie and despite how critical this review may sound I am not trying to put this movie down and am not by any means saying that it is bad. In fact I think it's a great deal better than many of todays movies, which is why I would still give it a 10/10 rating!"

","This movie is not just about birds that attack humans but about many things. The birds themselves may be a metaphor rather than just a peaceful creature gone bad.<br/><br/>What might these birds symbolizewomen (""bird"" is British slang for a young woman), peace (doves), love (love birds), nuclear war (a bird is a guided missile and always ready to be fired), or maybe humans who are no longer rational and go into panic mode (like birds that are no longer peaceful and become ruthless predators)? Has anyone ever flipped you the bird? <br/><br/>There seems to be the strongest connection between the birds and the women in the film. The movie begins with a boy whistling at Melaniethe human equivalent of a bird mating call. Mitch has three ""birds"" circling himhis mother who wants no other women in his life and to rule the roost, Annie who longs for Mitch to return to their nest and Melanie who is really, really, really cooing for Mitch. (Melanie's chasing of Mitch makes one wonder if she is wearing a testosterone patch or maybe has ingested the same thing that make the birds so predatory.) At the birthday party when the real birds first attack en masse we see a shot of the mother, the new girlfriend and the old girlfriend and how they have changed from lovely ladies to conniving females--just as the birds have changed from docile creatures to deadly predators. The ""bird as human female"" analogy continues with Melanie longing to return to the nest since her mother flew the coop when Melanie was only 11. In the end though Mitch triumphs over all these various bird incantationsyea Mitch! <br/><br/>Remember the movie begins and ends with the love birds""love thy neighbor"" being the second most important commandment according to Jesus.<br/><br/>For those who have trouble with the idea that a bird would ever attack a human being, please get close to a Mockingbird's nest or have food around an Ostrich or EMU. Still not convinced? Then may I suggest you go get your car washed and then park it under a tree filled with birds? They do attack you from one end of their bodies or the other!<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock does have style. Even when Melanie's face is bloodied by the bird attacks he still uses a soft focus lens to make her look beautiful. Ahh beauty and the bloodied, bird pecked face--not an easy thing to pull off.<br/><br/>The sound effects are ethereal and there is no music like in the rat movie ""Ben"". Too bad. ""Ben"" produced a hit for Michael Jacksona scary story in itself."

","The Birds by Hitchcock is one my favorite movies of all time! and i also love the director Hitchcock, because is smart, interesting and for his time his movies were very high-tech and was an original inventor. Even though this movie is old, it's still a great movie, i'm not a big fan of the new movies because i mean I'm not a big fan of the language, nudity and other aspects. I mean it does not bother me but i liked the old movies because you could imagine what was happening and you could use your imagination today it seems like people cant think for themselves and would rather not. I mean for the example the old version of the ""Texas Chain saw Massacre"" it didn't have to show people being killed by blood and gore as much and you could use your imagination, and that's what i liked about old movies. I mean everyone is entitled to their opinions but i just like the old movies, but i mean i like the new ones too. it just seems like new movies are fake and not productive."

","-The Birds- is one of two great animal-attack films; the other is, of course, -Jaws-, a very different movie. -The Birds- and -Jaws- are the only truly good movies of a genre that easily degenerates into pure schlock, exploitative, low-budget fare with bad scripts and dreadful acting. The two masterpieces of terror by animal assault the human conceit that 'we' own the world. The third best is the merely 'good' -Them-, whose overgrown ants do their predation on a bigger scale -- our scale -- than their usual world. <br/><br/>We may hold the land; the birds own the skies, and they can be anywhere. Only because of their small size are they generally harmless, but if they ever ganged up on us we humans would be in big trouble.<br/><br/>DuMaurier and Hitchcock exploit such a primal fear by turning the tables on us, exploiting our primal fear of sudden, horrifying death from animals striking from above, recalling our monkey-like ancestors who had cause to dread the lethal strike of beak and talon of a hawk or eagle. The birds have gotten organized, and they have chosen to take back their world. Unlike the shark that one never sees striking from dark aquatic depths, we see the birds coming and we fail to believe that they can do anything to us. <br/><br/>Plausible? Not really. At least it's well done, and that is all that we can expect, with the superb cinematography that one would expect from the great Hitch. It's second-rate Hitchcock, but second-rate Hitchcock is better than first-rate work of almost anyone else. This is the only horror film from him in which nature provides such terror. Aside from the original -Jaws- (which I think owes more to -Psycho- than to -The Birds- ), and -Them- (with the overgrown ants that result from irradiation that destroys the controls upon their growth), this is the only animal-attack movie to have cinematic worth."

","The Birds is no doubt a very good Hitchcock film that has stood the test of time pretty well.  Some of the Special Effects are a bit amateurish by modern standards, but get the point across well enough in my opinion.  I have to strongly disagree with many of the comments here regarding Tippi Hedren.  I think her performance was quite good, especially for a first major role.  She was just absolutely stunning to look at, especially in the opening scenes of the film in the Bird Shop.  The basic premise of her character (i.e. the outwardly cool and confident female beauty possessing a core of vulnerability) was not new or groundbreaking.  Grace Kelly made a brief and meteoric movie career playing this type of character, well before Tippi was discovered by Hitchcock.  But Tippi was a beautiful and classy woman who gave a fine and appropriate performance in my opinion.  Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are great too.  I was not real impressed with Rod Taylor's performance, but his character was possibly stiff and measured intentionally, as opposed to being poorly played.  Great movie, a must see for all movie buffs and fans of classy old movie stars like Tippi Hedren."

","I wish I was around when this was first released on the cinema.  Every time I watch it, it freaks me out.  Tippi Hedren is particularly excellent in her role as Melanie Daniels.  However, the bit where the camera focuses upon the woman in the cafe and looking straight down the camera lens, she says, ""Ever since you came here, this started happening...it's your fault!"" - absolute genius.  In my view, that is one of the finest moments in cinema history. Is the woman talking to Hedren's character or to the viewer?! It's awesome. There's something very real about the whole situation and the way it is shot is superb, nothing short of genius.  Hitch really was a genius.  They really don't make horror movies like they used to."

","An enigmatic chiller posing as a romance, Hitchcock and screenwriter Evan Hunter (better known as crime writer Ed McBain) remove the film of context - the puzzling Whyness of what is happening is something that stands over the film with far more anxiety and unease than do any of the individual attacks. The film has a scene where everyone offers up an explanation - they considering the Bomb and pollution - but Hitchcock and Hunter sit neither confirming nor denying. The ending is perhaps one of the most famous anticlimaxes in film history and comes with a baffling perplexity - after the intensively sustained onslaught of the previous night, hundreds of birds allow the humans to leave the farmhouse and simply sit and watch as they drive away. Hitchcock reportedly did film an ending but chose not to leave it in. As a result he has created a film that is not only removed of source and explanation but also of outcome - rather than ending with the birds defeated or triumphant, the film now just fades off on an anxiety-inducing state of ambiguity and unease. <br/><br/>The Birds doesn't quite rank up among the real Hitchcock classics like Saboteur (1942), Lifeboat (1944), Rear Window (1954) or Psycho (1960) - but is no less a great film for such. The bird attacks are mounted with superb artistry in the same clipped, droll and immaculately staged style we have come to know from Hitchcock. There is a terrifying sequence with Tippi Hedren trapped inside a phone-booth where Hitchcock places the camera inside the booth sharing the claustrophobia of the assault. And the climactic siege of the farmhouse (which is the only real connection to the slim Daphne Du Maurier short story that the film is based on) with Rod Taylor fighting off frenzied avian suicide attacks in trying to barricade the house and save a mobbed Hedren from the attic contains some real seat-edge suspense.<br/><br/>
Like Psycho the film has a lengthy preamble, where Hitchcock involves one in the unrelated day-to-day happenings of its characters before disorientatingly switching tracks to the main story. One is drawn into the rather silly and petty prank Hedren plays on Taylor and her sudden desire to follow him - another of Hitchcock's characteristic long pursuit sequences - but, as in Psycho and the long preamble involving Janet Leigh's theft of the money and flight to the motel, this is only extended prologue to the main story. Hitchcock was playing with audience's expectation of films and pulling the rug out from under them way before anyone else ever was.<br/><br/>
The casting of Hedren and Taylor is an admirable pairing - both play off each other with a sly, mocking charm. Poor optical work on the bird attacks does regrettably lend certain artificiality to the film - and some modern genre purveyors have tended to downplay the rest of the film's excellence as a result. Saul Bass creates the finest of his famed credits sequences for Hitchcock - one with animated black bird shapes frenziedly screeching across a white background while the credits form as piecemeal shapes around them. Despite the listing of Hitchcock's regular composer Bernard Herrmann as sound consultant', the film has no score. <br/><br/>The Birds suffers from unintentional giggles. The sets are hugely unrealistic, and sometimes Taylor and Hedren are quite wooden. However, The Birds remains a hugely influential and extremely sadistic horror film.<br/><br/>Verdict  Dark, and blackly comic, The Birds will peck away at your sanity for its duration, and will have you looking at our feathered friends with suspicion for the rest of your days.  ****"

","I watched ""The Birds"" for probably the fourth or fifth time tonight, the night before the US holiday of Thanksgiving.  It was an appropriate choice: I feel gratitude to Alfred Hitchcock for the wonderful body of work he left to moviegoers.  <br/><br/>As with some other Hitchcock films, I enjoy ""The Birds"" more every time I see it, and I notice little things that I didn't notice earlier.  Re-seeing a Hitchcock movie is like visiting an old friend, or wearing favorite old clothes.  It's a little island of comfort in this increasingly uncomfortable world.<br/><br/>I found myself grinning as I recognized one Hitchcock ""trademark"" after another: the traveling shot after a horrific event culminating in a bucolic panorama, as if to say, ""Look how this horror is only a tiny part of the world--still, it's the world YOU know.""  The hesitant hand on the doorknob. The magnificent scene beginning in the boat, over five minutes with no words, no music, just the camera telling the story as only Hitchcock knew how to make it do.  And so many others...<br/><br/>I'll be the first to admit I think Hitchcock made some crummy films.  But he made so many marvelous ones that the poor ones fade into insignificance. And I believe he had a style, a flair, an audacity, that was inimitable.  No wonder the French appreciate his work so much.  And no wonder this francophile feels the same way."

","As per usual when confronted with a really challenging movie most viewers are lost.<br/><br/>Pay attention I say.<br/><br/>One wonders what was Hitch's intent? More than likely it was to make an open ended movie that one can interpret multiple ways. There is no explanation of why the Birds are attacking and the ending leaves no clues as to whether they will continue to attack.<br/><br/>The Birds becomes more interesting everyday foreshadowing the environmental consciousness and animal rights consciousness. Revolutionary at that time.<br/><br/>There are no human hero's here. Almost every character has glaring flaws, petulance, jealousy, callousness, egotistical, lust. Melanie is a rich spoiled brat, Mitch is a lawyer who has lust for Melanie and is not very nice to her at the start, Annie is jealous, and Mitches mother is weak and clinging. The Bar scene is especially delicious, every one who speaks is a jerk, from a self important ""expert"" ornithologist to a drunken bible thumper. Hitchcock, of course, was a master at exposing flaws in human psychology.<br/><br/>Metaphors fly right from the start, as the protagonist human brings caged love birds ostensibly as a present but really to buy into a sexual relationship.<br/><br/>We hear a lot about how good the shots were and the special effects, and they are good especially for the time. But the true story is really how Hitch was able to get us to watch a film with no ending.<br/><br/>Like most truly great film this film presents plenty of questions but gives no answers. That's what's what is really interesting about this film. You don't just sit there and get entertainment spoon fed to you like a baby, you have to interact with the film.<br/><br/>That's what most people don't get. Art is about questions not answers."
"15231","Null","0","0","12 October 2003"," One of Hitchcock's Best
","There are so many wonderful Hitchcock elements within this movie.  The silent scenes in which tension is built and a story told with almost no dialogue or explanatory sounds, the slow building of suspense mixed with misdirection and bewildering amounts of detail in the story, the supporting town characters that are all too real in their attitudes and actions, the then state-of-the-art special effects of the birds themselves, and the excellent point-of-view camera work all add up to a great movie that does not rely just on the gore of the victims to keep the audience engaged. <br/><br/>
The Birds is best watched and taken at its face value without trying to find symbolism or meaning in what is presented.  I think that is what Hitchcock intended.  The terror is that the birds are attacking for no apparent reason - and no reason is hypothesized in the movie.  It simply is happening.  The characters have to adapt to the situation and try to stay alive.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren's character of Melanie Daniels is all too typical of a type of rich, sophisticated woman of the late fifties and early sixties who lived off of Daddy's money and had no real purpose for her own life.  I knew women like her.  <br/><br/>The problem with the movie comes from all of the main characters having too much emotional and historical baggage carried with them that for some unknown reason has to be exposed and discussed.  These elements add nothing to the movie and drag down the pace of the story with long scenes of dialogue during which the characters talk about past romances, insecurities, family problems, etc. Hedren's, Tandy's, and  Pleschette's characters all are plagued with so many emotional encumbrances that at times their characters just look silly or pathetic.  Such neurotic-type problems may have been fairly common of movie characters of the sixties, or it may have been Hitchcock planting proverbial red herrings, but it gets annoying at times.  The innuendo about sex in what had to have been an attempt to make the film look more `mature' now looks childish.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, I still place The Birds up there with Psycho and think it remains one of the best suspense/thriller movies ever."
"homeimp","9","0","0","4 October 2003"," The Birds - The Community vs the Outsider
","I think this movie is about the problems of outsiders in being accepted in a small self-contained community. The community is fine until Melanie shows up with the lovebirds. Nothing untoward happens until Rod Taylor jumps into the car to go after Melanie, thus effectively indicating his acceptance of Melanie into his world and into town life. Then comes the first attack.<br/><br/>
Note the resemblance in hairstyles when Melanie meets Rod Taylor's mother. He is obviously searching for the love he did not find in his mother. As the birds do not accept the presence of Melanie and the lovebirds in town, so the mother will not accept a new woman in her son's life. She wants someone in her own life badly and realizes too late the barricades she has put up. Not even her own son has been allowed to enter<br/><br/>The birds single out for attack the sister, who befriends Melanie, and the schoolteacher, who takes her into her house. When the schoolteacher arrived in town, she was rejected by Rod Taylor, thus not incurring the enmity of the birds. Also note the striking moment when the woman at the restaurant hurls abuse at Melanie. ""It's your fault! Nothing happened here until you came!"" The community always seeks to ostracize and drive away the newcomer. The opera ""Peter Grimes"" tackles the same theme. The birds allow the family to leave as they have won. Melanie and the lovebirds drive off to San Francisco. The town can return to normal daily life. Anyway, that's my take on this Hitchcock opus."

","Why do the birds attack? Despite the warning of the tweed wearing woman in the diner that the birds represent nature rebelling against man's interference, I have my own theory that will change the way you see the movie. The birds represent repressed female sexuality. Think about it and the movie becomes pretty funny. Every time the women in the movie start becoming sexually frustrated, the birds attack. The first attack is when Tippi Hedren has teased Rod by leaving the lovebirds (who, after being given to a prepubescent girl, are the only birds not to attack anybody) and is racing back to the dock while he chases on the road around Bodega Bay. Then, the schoolteacher and Tippi are talking and a bird dies after hitting the door. By the time we get to the oedipal scene with Rod's mother, the birds are bursting from the chimney(Go Freud!). Watch it with this in your head and it confirms what Hitch said after a reporter mentioned that he should do more comedies because ""To Catch a Thief"" was so funny. He deadpanned, ""Young man, all my movies are comedies."""

","Hitchcock has taken the fantastical idea from Du Maurier's book and created a film that I judge more on the skill of the director than of the strength of its cast. The portrayal of the birds as vicious, unpredictable, killers is extremely effective and frightening. The cast are methodical, all that is required for this film. Viewers may have a tiny amount of interest in the romantic sub-plot, but what really hooked me was the suspenseful imagery that Hitchcock uses: Crows on climbing frame, or crows on a telegraph line. The ruthless attacks on the children are gripping and shocking, however I would point to the scene that depicts the besiegement of the house from within as the high point of the film: No birds are to be seen but are instead represented by a pulsating crowing reverberating through the house as the desperate situation of its occupants intensifies.

","The most interesting question of this film is the question - why attack the birds the people? In the short story from Daphne de Maurier (called The Birds too) the answer is easy - the complete story based on the attack of the Germans on England in the second world war.<br/><br/>A man is standing at the ocean and see the birds a coming like airplanes. The complete english country is attacked. Hitchocks film has changed this things. Only one town called Bodega Bay was attacked and the person in the center of the story is not a man (as by Maurier) either a women. She is it who was first attacked. She has big psycho-problems with the relation to her mother - and in Mitch mother this old conflict become a new dimension. As bigger the love story between Melanie and Mitch as most the birds will attack the people. Lydia is against this love - and thats one point in the conflict who was never directly seen between the women.<br/><br/>
In other words: The conflict between the women who are mirroring themselfes in the other has an paranoid dimension - on this place the birds are situated. They are the sign of this paranoid picture world- the are the result of the conflict for the visitor of this film. Scary is the great dimension they have - not the hole country but the hole town. This are the two points of a paranoid structur: projection and universal. - The psycho dimension become a place in reality! A real protection is impossible - because the beginning of the attacks is inside the subject - thats the reason why Hitchock let left the title ""The End"" in the end of this film - because the conflict in Melanie have no end inside this film. The scary monsters - the birds will be peaceful again, when she will find a solution for her conflict. We have an apocalyptic picture in the end - who is not an end - the birds are sitting there but in the next moment they can attack the people again. The sky is dark - the world is in danger."

I did enjoy it.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), the daughter of a rich head of a newspaper, who is in a bird shop after minor birds, when she meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), a lawyer who remembers seeing her in court after she supposedly jumped into a fountain. He is after love birds for his little sister Cathy, as a gift for her 11th birthday. He pretends to think she works there, and waits until she makes a fool of herself, and lets birds out of their cages. There are none in stock, so Mitch heads elsewhere. Melanie's minor birds aren't going to be in yet, so she goes after him, and sees his license plate, and calls it in, and gets his address.<br/><br/>Melanie gets some love birds and takes them to his apartment, only to learn that he has gone up to Bodega Bay, about an hour and half from San Francisco, where he and Melanie live, where he goes every weekend to visit Cathy and his mother. Melanie decides to drive up there personally to deliver the love birds. But when she arrives, birds of all sorts, from gulls to black birds and crows, thousands of real birds and about 400 trick shots, swarm Bodega Bay, and Melanie and Mitch must put their differences aside, and fight for their lives.<br/><br/>The film has plenty more good acting, with Jessica Tandy playing Lydia Brenner, Mitch's and Cathy's mother, who has a distaste for Melanie, and any woman associated with Mitch, as she is afraid of being abandoned, like she was when her husband died, and Suzanne Pleshette playing Annie Hayworth, the Bodega Bay School Teacher, who is in love with Mitch, though denies it to Melanie.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this film, but it is very far from Hitchcock's best, which would most likely be Psycho (1960), or Rear Window (1954).

","Complex interpersonal relationships with their possessiveness, jealousies, insecurities and anxieties are played out against the backdrop of spine-chilling massed attacks by birds in a small picturesque town near San Francisco. Why the birds attack without any provocation is neither made clear nor is any hypothesis proffered. It is this open-ended quality that elevates the film from being a mere bloodcurdling thriller at the superficial level to a subtler plane with many possibilities of psychoanalytical interpretations. The sub-textual reading of the film offers many hours of pleasure to the armchair psychologist. All the four principal characters, though outwardly simple, seem weighed down by some not so pleasant pasts, which they are reluctantly suppressing. The birds perhaps symbolise the cathartic release of their bottled up emotions. The almost tranquil anti-climax of the film makes you wonder whether the birds were just demons of the mind that have been expurgated. The present of caged lovebirds, which seemingly trigger off the inexplicably bizarre chain of events, are also central to the sub-text, and can be infused with several layers of semantics. In a most poignant final sequence, the little girl Cathy, who has been traumatised by the recurrent bird attacks requests her family to take along the caged birds with them as they flee to safety. So does the cage stand for security rather than the oft-repeated cliché of bondage?  an interesting speculation!  In a strikingly refreshing departure from modern day films of animal terror, there is no attempt to avenge the attack, which further lends weight to the feeling that the birds are a chimera. 	Even if Freudian analysis is not your up of tea, this is a fine film to be enjoyed for its sheer craftsmanship. Notice that the film is totally devoid of background score, debunking the notion that music heightens suspense. The long silent pauses are actually deafening. The sequences of bird strikes are amazingly well done. The camerawork is graceful  particularly noteworthy is the sequence in which Melanie stealthily arrives by boat to deliver the caged birds. A film out of the top drawer of Hitchcock."

","Hitchcock intentionally omitted the words ""the end"" from the conclusion to give the impression of unending terror.  Unfortunately, the lack of any resolution or conclusion to the story leaves the entire picture wanting. Granted, Hitchcock frequently ended movies without what some might call a ""satisfactory"" conclusion (or even a ""happy"" ending), such as VERTIGO, but there was always some type of resolution.  The fade-to-black at the end leads one to think that the director and/or screenwriter was at a loss as to how to resolve the story, or did not wish to attempt an ending.  I could make several suggestions; and this may, in fact, be what Hitchcock wanted us to do all along.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it isn't PSYCHO (the picture to which it is most frequently compared).  It's a good Hitchcock movie with excellent special effects for 1963 and a workable storyline, but lacking any type of resolution, I have a hard time giving THE BIRDS very high marks."

","Alfred Hitchcock's film `The Birds' is an outstanding horror film and is very suspenseful, portraying different types of birds going psycho and attacking people. The birds somehow seem to be attracted to light in my point of view. Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner and Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels who are the main characters are excellent actors. Even though most of the time the birds were fake both characters made it look as if it was really happening and they were really being pecked at. The whole idea of Evan Hunter writing a horror story about birds attacking the small town of Bodega Bay then Alfred Hitchcock making a movie out of it is a neat idea. What makes this movie so good is all the suspense and even though it was made in 1963 the graphics and special effects are awesome, even the sound effects of the birds flapping and screeching are good, and the sound is only in mono. Although I think the ending could have been better, the birds looked very real, as did everything else. I give this horror movie for the time period it was in a nine out of ten."

","Alfred Hitchcock's film `The Birds' was an outstanding show. Teamed up with Evan Hunter, Alfred Hitchcock made a very suspenseful movie. It was a good idea not to add music it added even more suspense. This horror film also had some pretty good special effects for being made in 1963.  I thought the birds were very lifelike. It was awesome how he thought of making a film about different birds going crazy and attacking the small town. I would have never thought that birds could go crazy and attack people. I especially thought the scene with the children running down the hill was very lifelike. Even though the birds were probably fake, it really looked like they were pecking the children.

Hitch's plodding drama may seem slow by todays standards but I feel that is one of the very reasons the attacks are so delightful! You get caught up in this slow moving story and whamo the birds attack out of nowhere.  One wonders why after all these years no one has ever been able to recreate such a great film.

","I am a fan of most of Hitchcock.  I was pleased when I watched 'The Birds'.  There are many things in this movie that are quite outdated, such as some acting techniques, as well as special effect techniques.  Even with such faults, minor ones if you ask me, Hitchcock manages to create some real suspense that is still effective today.  Specifically in the last half hour of the film.  <br/><br/>    He creates great suspense with his incredible use of sound effects creating the deafening noises of the birds attacking a house.  What we get to see is the terror the people inside the house feel.  In this whole sequence of events we get an excellent climax.  Plus he gets us very well, not by making things happen, but by putting the thought into our heads that something could happen.<br/><br/>    The most ominous parts in this movie are not when the birds attacking, but when Hitchcock frames them gathering.  The attacks are excellent in and of themselves, but its the waiting that creates the suspense.  Its our knowing something that the characters don't that make it exciting, and Hitchcock does a great job of utilizing that here.  <br/><br/>    Its not the greatest movie I have ever seen, but it was very good, and even with some things being outdated, it was still an innovative idea and you should check it out at least once, just to see for yourself.  8 out of 10."

","I first saw this film when I was a cynical teenager, adamant that nothing could scare me, and it didn't- I point blank refused to let it happen.  Not the Exorcist, not Freddy or Jason and not the Birds could shake this tough-girl up. So now I am a bit older and wiser and I also know a lot more about film. And I watched the Birds again for a different look at it. <br/><br/>It is SO cleverly done. As an earlier reviewer said, Hitch plays the audience like a finely tuned instrument and the effects can be stronger than you would realise especially for a 1963 film being watched in the 21st Century! (A lot of younger people seem to believe that old films are at best cute and at worse, old fashioned and irrelevant- oh if only they knew, they were so much worse than anything that is considered ""Shocking"" today) EXAMPLE: I am not scared of spiders but they bring out an almost primeval instinct in me, My hands sweat, I get cold shivers and goose bumps all over but at the same time my rational brain tells me it's ok and I pick up incy-wincy and chuck him out of the window- no problem. But after  I watched the Birds, it happened again. Some scenes gave me the shivers so bad that I thought I was going to flip out and hide in a cave somewhere and by bed time I was pumped so full of adrenaline that I couldn't get to sleep. It's Hitch you see, not only does he know film, he knows YOU as well and how to get to you.  I will try to keep it brief as to what makes this film so special. Firstly, he lands heavy portents on the characters.  The early scenes all end with a bird acting strange, in a variety of ways. Secondly, silence is sometimes golden.  The indoor attack sequences are unique in the reaction of the victims, I will say no more as it so effective and scary.  But at the same time it is the sort of thing I have nightmares about a remake putting in a ditzy female screaming or something, (please leave this film alone!) Thirdly- The sounds of the birds!  Enough said- I got that shiver again... Fourthly-Hitch tricks.  You KNOW she has a load of crows behind her, but then it turns out you had no idea at all.  He likes to lure the audience into a false sense of security ""Don't worry chaps, I'll show you what's happening, just don't tell the actors"" but when revelation occurs, you realise you've been had just as much as those on screen. Fively (?:-) there are some scenes which are truly horrific.  It's as simple as that.  It's a horror film. There are 6-10 points, I could go on all day but this is probably long enough."

","Like many other animal-attack movies (Jaws, etc.), you would think that the solution is to stay away from the animal and it will not harm you, right? What do you do if the adversaries can get to you inside your own home? Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of The Birds by Daphne Du Maurier is a thrilling movie that asks the same question.  Hitchcock has been known to produce suspenseful thrillers that send you home thinking, but The Birds can actually draw you into the town of Bodega Bay.  The plot starts out with a young woman, Melanie Daniels, traveling to the little town near San Francisco to see a man named Mitch Brenner.  The town's eyes were upon her, watching her every move, as she traveled out to Mitch's house.  Mitch lived with his jealous overbearing mother, Lydia Brenner, and younger sister Cathy.  Mitch and Cathy love Melanie, but Lydia is very suspicious of her. The unspoken tension that comes from Mitch's ex-girlfriend Annie Hayworth (Cathy's schoolteacher) is a technique that is somewhat difficult to find in the character development of modern-day characters.  Once the birds begin to attack, Melanie's character development becomes the center of attention. She goes from a wealthy, boasting, girl to a well controlled, lovable woman by the end of the picture.  Mitch Brenner, on the other hand, is a more prominent figure in Bodega Bay.  His complacent demeanor settles the movie's enigmatic attacks.  Alfred Hitchcock continues the element of suspense from the beginning of The Birds all the way to your living room.  The fact that there is no music in the movie adds to the eeriness of the birds when they mass and attack, juxtaposed with the melody of children in song.  Hitchcock also delayed the first major attack until near sixty minutes into the movie, a technique modern filmmakers use recurrently.  There could possibly be a symbolic relationship between the birds and Lydia's jealousy of her son's women; once Lydia learns to accept Melanie, the birds can be looked upon with a different perspective.  The scenes of the bird attacks may seem tacky today, but when the film was released, the birds in the movie were the newest special effect the public had seen for a while.  He believed that the characters' reactions to the attacks were worth much more than the attacks themselves.  Because of his passion for atypical, Hitchcock left out a reason for the attacks-the avoidance of that explanation was purely startling to audiences.  Some may be disappointed by the slow progression of discovery that is hindered by the ending of the movie, but this is one that is left open to the imagination.  To watch this amazing, thirty-eight-year-young Hitchcock classic come to life, rent The Birds today."
"Jim Griffin","Null","0","0","26 February 2001"," Hitchcock is just sick, sick i tells ya!
","As is the case with Psycho - the classic made directly before this film - The Birds is a story that can be split into two halves.  Where Psycho gave us Janet Leigh's getaway before turning its attention to Norman Bates, The Birds gives us Tippi Hedren's practical jokes before letting the winged freaks terrorise us.<br/><br/>As is also the case with Psycho, the opening thread works well enough on its own, so that the gentle romantic comedy and Hedren's practical jokes feel like well-developed set-up rather than padding.  Hedren is effortlessly charming, and her smoker's voice is cute and occasionally sexy (before it was passed down a generation to become irritating).  The chemistry between her and Rod Taylor seems genuine enough, and the unspoken tension that comes from his ex-girlfriend and overbearing mother add depth to the characters. It seems strange that so many reviews complain of the wafer-thin story; these are details and depths that would be hard to find in the set-up of most modern movies.<br/><br/>Having Hedren's character as a practical joker is a nice touch, as most people know Hitchcock was a bit of a trickster himself.  You get the idea he's sniggering to himself behind the camera, thinking `my jokes are a lot meaner than hers!'  His sense of humour is perhaps more prominent than ever, and leads to my favourite shot in the whole film; as Hedren drives badly along winding roads, we see her love birds clinging on to their perch, leaning to one side and then to the other as she swerves all over the road. It looks incredibly fake but it's just such an inventive idea you laugh with it rather than at it, which I suppose was the point.<br/><br/>Once Hedren's flirting with Rod Taylor begins in earnest, and the story moves to Bodega Bay, the film begins to lose its similarities with Psycho. Whereas the shower scene in Bates Motel changed the tone of the film instantly, here we are witness to a rather slow build-up and an impending sense of doom.  The tension is built with predictable expertise, so that things that shouldn't be scary genuinely are; when all you hear is a flapping of wings it's scary, when all you see is a bird landing on a climbing frame it's scary.  The effects have aged quite badly, but they are no real barrier to the tension and fear you will feel, although you probably get more from the film if you're not too keen on birds already.  While I haven't got a phobia I could live quite happily without their flapping wings and biting beaks so all the movie's tricks worked on me.<br/><br/>As other reviews have pointed out, the most noticeable difference with Psycho comes in what we are allowed to see.  Shadows and chocolate sauce were enough to scare in Psycho, but in The Birds we see everything, including a horrible shot of a corpse whose eyes have been pecked out.  It is testament to Hitchcock's skill that he could approach these movies so differently and have them both work so well, each scaring the audience in their own way.<br/><br/>The ending is deliberately abrupt, and I'm not quite sure if I liked it or not.  It was a nice idea to suggest that this wasn't the end of the story, just the end for these characters, but as with most older movies the absence of an end credit sequence means there is no time within the film to think about it.  It was probably a little too abrupt, but it is hard to see how else it could have ended.<br/><br/>My main recommendation for the film is that for a few days after seeing it, I noticed loads more birds than usual on the wires and rooftops outside my house, and felt rather suspicious of why there were there.  I'm sure Hitchcock would have wanted it that way."

","Little known to most filmgoers was a traumatic experience that befell Hitch as a young boy, he was accidentally locked in a stairwell that had in it several badly decomposed bird carcasses, where he was forced to remain amidst the stench for hours one afternoon and evening until finally detected and freed.  While Hitch counted the experience as notable but not significant in his childhood development, he did acknowledge it as a partial wellspring in inspiring 'The Birds'. The other major contributing factor was linked to his well known fear of the police.  After completing 'North By Northwest', Hitch was invited by an associate to a social gathering of former policemen who had entered the intelligence profession, and their straightforward discussions of prospects for nuclear apocalypse apparently jarred Hitch to a level of discomfort that he felt the need to take on the apocalyptic dimension of life in the Cold War in a metaphorical manner.  As the concept was being fleshed out, the idea came to Hitch of using the birds as a representative vehicle for life out of balance, and the rest is as they say, history.  Just imagine, if these criteria had applied to the inspiration for ""The Sound of Music"", what a different film that would have been....."

Everyone says he is a genious, but this film proves it more than any other. Sometimes I watch movies of his like Saboteur and say ""What's so great about Hitchcock?""

","Well, its Friday the 13th, of Aug. '99 of course, and someone from beyond the grave wants to spook you.Actually its Hitch's 100 rd birthday and what better way to spook you than with THE BIRDS.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie as a child and it scared the pants off of me.I had nightmares for months after, like millions of other young people. Today I appreciate the mystery its conveys.<br/><br/>In the movie we just don't know why the birds attack unprovoked but we're treated to some speculative ideas.<br/><br/>Initially, Tippi Hedren gets the blame, the attacks starting when she arrives in Bodega Bay.Playing the character, Melanie Daniels, a rich daughter of a newspaper magnate,Hedren is labelled as 'pure evil' by one of the townsfolk.<br/><br/>But this isn't right, you see Melanie is not even raven-haired, she's pure blonde.Hitch knows we won't fall for that old trick,so in comes a charute smoking ornithologist complete with feather in hat who blinds us with fact after fact about how sweet and nice our fine feathered friends are. The birds dispute this by their actions surrounding a cafe menacingly. naw,that's not the answer,back to the drawing board folks.<br/><br/>So there is no explanation given except perhaps that the Bodega Bay residents were skimpy with the bird seeds that week and therefore the birds felt,er a little .. peckish.No it's just as if..as if your left in silence, like the silence of no movie score, or the silent scream of Jessica Tandy, or perhaps the silence of Hedren being peaked to death in the attic scene. Each element is like gathering a twig here, a sapling there,a leaf elsewhere and building them up into a nestling symbolism that comprises, stealth, secretiveness,mysteriousness and pure creepiness that eventually hatches under your skin.<br/><br/>Technically unique,THE BIRDS uses various special effects ,such as, animation,models and live birds to stage the attacks.It's truly amazing, the school house attack being my favourite.<br/><br/>But my overall favourite piece is when Rod Taylor tries to walk to his car at the end of the movie.A single perched crow turns its head and curiously looks up at Taylor then at his hand and bites it!!. Seagulls timidly peck at his pants and shoes,all the while cooing softly. In our minds were saying Rod get back in the house your outnumbered!! It's not truly anticlimactic,it's just pure suspense,anticipation of what might happen rather than does.<br/><br/>It's also amazing that no other director,at least to my  knowledge, has pursued this aviaristic theme.<br/><br/>There's a very funny story told by the director Peter Bogdanovich about Hitch.<br/><br/>One day he was waiting for Hitch at some hotel somewhere and when they met,they got on an elevator to go down to the hotel lobby,some 20 stories below them. Hitch got in the back and the lift filled up with people.Suddenly Hitch starts to speak... ""There was blooood eveerrywhere"",he starts in his British accent. ""Bloooood on the carpet,blooood on this chaps clooothing,blooood on the couch,"" Bogdanovich is trully puzzled,what brought this on, he thought,but he decides to chime in. ""Really,Hitch?"", ""Yeeesss"", drools back Hitch. The elevator stops somewhere on the 12th floor,there's an exchange of people and it moves off again. ""Blooood streaming from his nose,"" continues Hitch, ""His cloothes were a complete meess,"" Unable to escape the talking,people were cocking an ear or two to this diminutive,bald,rotund gentleman with the oh-so drool English accent. The elevator gets close to the lobby, Hitch goes in for the kill.<br/><br/>""GOOD GOD MAN,WHAT EEEVVVEEERR HAPPENED TO YOU?"" continuing slowly he says, ""..and do you know what he said to me""?<br/><br/>The elevator reaches the lobby,doors part, and nobody appears to want to move. Hitch quietly makes his way out of the lobby trailed by a small contingent of people seeming to follow him.Bogdanovich comes up to Hitch's level. ""Well, Hitch, what did the man say""? ""Whaaat""? replies Hitch. ""The man with the blood all over him"". ""OH thhhaat,...nothing..that was my elevator stooory"", and walks on."

","This is an interesting film about different species of birds attacking a small California town called Bodega Bay. The attacks begin when Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) arrives with two love birds as a gift for a resident of the town. Did those two caged ""love"" birds stir the whole mess up in the first place? Will their horror continue because they take the ""love"" birds along with them in the end? There are no answers to be had at the film's conclusion & what's next for the characters is left to the viewer's imagination. 'Tippi' Hedren was an attractive female lead for this role. Her appearance was obviously more important than her acting skills. Rod Taylor is beefy, & sexy. Suzanne Pleshette is like a dark haired Susan Hayward. Jessica Tandy (was she ever young??) plays the possessive, widowed mom with fears of abandonment well. (She's so wrapped up in her own angst & weaknesses, in most scenes Melanie, who's a virtual stranger, comforts her daughter when she's horrified.) Although the movie holds up very well (especially the diner scene where everyone is pontificating about bird attacks) some scenes are very hokey, & unintentionably laughable now. Those still close-ups of 'Tippi's' facial expressions before, during, & after the gas station explosion are jaw-droppingly hilarious! I'm not sure this movie should be remade. Unlike the unnecessary ""Psycho"" remake, at least ""The Birds"" could benefit from modern day special effects. It would be great to see Hitchcock's original ending realized: The Golden Gate Bridge covered with ""The Birds""."

","The Birds is a moody and entertaining delight. Possible SPOILERS ahead: Tippi Hedren plays Melanie Daniels; a free spirit that does have a serious side. Melanie wants a prank revenge with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) because he got the upper hand as she was playing one of her pranks. Melanie is also somewhat intrigued with Mitch. She learns Mitch has left the city for the small hamlet of Bodega Bay. She then decides to continue with her prank, and takes the coastal road to Bodega Bay. She finds out where he lives and who he lives with, and boats across the bay to continue with her prank of delivering lovebirds. Soon her charade and pranks stop when she gets more involved with Mitch and his family, and she stays in Bodega Bay longer than she planned. She meets Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy), who seems distant, worried and somewhat cold. Melanie also meets Mitch's little sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartright), who she finds warmth from. Melanie is invited to dinner, and then to Cathy's birthday party. She takes a room at the home of an ex-girlfriend of Mitch's (Suzanne Pleshette), and they seem to awkwardly get along as it's realized Melanie and Mitch are attracted to each other. A minor bird attack has already happened to Melanie, and soon more frequent attacks happen. The characters all become involved in the attacks by the birds. The attacks seem to become more vicious. The ending of the film leaves the situation of further bird attacks, and the escape of our main characters to the viewer's imagination. The Birds is well acted, and delivers fine drama and tense bird attacks. The drama may bog down the story for those who need to have constant action, but what you might be missing is how the dramatic parts ease things until another sudden bird attack happens.-- The audience relaxes with the interactions of the characters, and suddenly there's a bird attack disrupting everything! There are some very interesting camera angles in The Birds. Some of the special effects may seem unconvincing by today's standards, but one must remember this film was made in 1963. I find this film to be highly entertaining, and the bird attacks are somewhat tense (particularly the attack on the school children as they flee the schoolhouse.) Hitchcock's direction delivers a perfect mood in every scene. The scene in which the birds attack the now boarded up Brenner house could even be thought of as claustrophobic as Melanie with Mitch and his family hear the birds all around the outside of the house during the attack. Most viewers who are familiar with films of this era will find it entertaining. Viewers not accustomed to watching older suspense/horror movies may find it very entertaining if they realize the dramatic parts are necessary to get us to know the characters, and also to present a calmness before another bird attack happens. The Birds is a film I've enjoyed several times, and will enjoy many more times."

That said, Hitchcock was solid and has some nifty camera angles that do make his films much more unnerving and intense than a good chunk of modern horror.<br/><br/>The movie itself must have been amazing in its time. A lot of R-rated movies today are tamer than this PG-13 rated movie, and nowhere near as intense.

The scares and intensity of the last 30 minutes are hard to match if you aren't laughing at the bird animations.

","Birds is a good and very different film for his purpose, but it fails a lot in very basic levels to be considered a great one. Some special effects are super-outdated, honestly it's very awful if compared to nowadays standards(which is obvious). But is obviously as well that i can't blame a film made in 1963 by having bad visual effects. I would be a jerk if i do such thing. Anyways, it's laughably bad. The major problems that i find in this movie are all located in the second half. Some pointless and incomprehensible actions by the characters really annoyed me. Troubles variated since bad editing to mediocre acting. Some of these problems really disappointed me, because i was sure that this movie was going to be great, due to a excellent first hour. But with such big flaws, it can't be considered nothing more than a good film. Shame. But despite some awful and bad planed/executed sequences, the film as a whole it's not so bad in that quest. I was quite satisfied with the birds 'motivations' to the attacks, for example. Also, the great character development is fundamental to the film 'finale' effect, and the dialogues are also very good. To finish, If i had to make a balance, the first half would be a 9.5 and the second half would be something around 5 or 6. Overall, a 7.7/10 is enough."

","Only a director of Hitchcock's calibre could transform a patently silly idea like killer birds into such a nerve wracking and thoroughly entertaining movie, one that proves without a doubt that he really is 'the master of suspense'.<br/><br/>The director spends the first half of his film investing purely in the characters, letting his audience get to know them, making the viewer care so as to increase the potency of the horror once they are eventually in peril. Before we even see the birds in action, Hitch shows exactly what his feathered fiends are capable of, with a truly shocking shot of a victim, eyes pecked out, covered in blood. The scenes when the birds attack are suitably vicious and gruesome, Hitch making it abundantly clear that no-one is safe from harm, not even children.<br/><br/>But it is the moments between the attacks, the calms before the storm, when the director really pulls out all the stops to show how just good he is at cranking up the tension. A flap of a wing, a few creepy echoey caws, screeches and squawks, a malevolent glance—that's all Hitch needs to have his audience on tenterhooks. Case in point: my favourite scene of the film, in which Melanie (Tippi Hedren) sits smoking yet another cigarette while crows slowly gather behind her; when she finally turns around, there's hundreds of the bloody things—superb!"

"Quinoa1984","10","2","5","5 April 2007"," both absurd and completely terrifying, a film of massive intelligence and enthrallment
","What a repeat viewing will bring: The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's blockbuster entertainment that somehow can appeal to the ""art-house"" movie-goers as well. Meaning that even more than with Psycho, and certainly on a much grander and ambitious palette than North by Northwest, we have Hitchcock the grand ol' Master of Suspense for his mainstream fans, and at the same time gives an appeal to those who might consider themselves too high-minded to be considered part of the 'mainstream'. Meaning if you're in a coffee shop and on one end there's a group of teenagers and on the other end a couple of middle-aged psycho-therapists with numerous degrees, they could both be talking with similar depth &/or enthusiasm over the Birds. It's a work where the story gets set up very well: Tippi Hedren as the daughter of a high-ranking official (maybe a few brain cells and style-wise above Paris Hilton) in San Francisco who wants to get to know better a man, Mitch, who's from an island off the coast. She follows him down to the island only to be confronted by Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy) as well as his sister. It's a little uncomfortable a situation in the sort of mother-son dynamic she rattles...but that's not all her presence seems to be incurring.<br/><br/>What unravels from there is sheer Hitchcock exploitation film-making- exploiting the audience's wildest fears- always with the most assured and inventiveness that one would expect. Several shots stick in one's memory, perhaps the greatest being the from-the-sky view of the fire that breaks out in the city, and then the seagulls that come into the foreground (point of view is put into question here, and it's a shot that works on both levels as mentioned before). As for the average horror fan, The Birds may work even more effectively than Psycho, despite its age shown in the bird attack scenes- which are nevertheless extraordinary in the usage of composite shots- because after the initial shock of the middle chunk of the film Hitchcock gets into something of a near zombie movie in the last third of the picture. Mitch barricades his mother, sister and Melanie in the house, only to have the rancor-loaded birds crashing head on to get at the house. Getting at what, who's to say? There's explanations that can be given, to be sure, but it may not even be necessary, it just is (one gets this amusingly from Hitchcock via the scene in the restaurant/bar with the town locals giving their drunken/angered/well-informed viewpoints).<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, The Birds is not entirely as emotionally disturbing or complex as Vertigo, and one might be reluctant to say that it is art because of its appeal on a commercial level. But art it is, conjured out of a premise that seems ridiculous yet made all the more prescient and startling through Hitchcock's ever-careful style, and specifically the lack of a traditional Herrmann musical score (albeit with his contribution as a sound-designer with the birds notwithstanding). By the last scene, one sees how what might have been a cheesy, trashy work by a lesser filmmaker out for cheap scares, becomes something of a bizarre, discomforting statement on nature versus human beings, or at least what can be capable of those we all take for granted. It's also a hell of a lot of fun for the whole family, more or less; watch for the school-yard singing as the birds swarm around the playground, later parodied wonderfully in High Anxiety."
"EUyeshima","9","2","5","4 March 2006"," Visceral Terror and Freudian Psychodrama Meld Seamlessly in Hitchcock Masterwork
","I remember as a child in the late 1960's watching this Alfred Hitchcock masterwork in the darkened family room and being terrified awaiting the next bird attack. It was great, and to my pleasure, it still is. Now that I am far more familiar with Hitchcock's filmography and realize the gamut of sophisticated drama and thrilling suspense he created in his long career, I think 1963's ""The Birds"" is far and away the wonderfully visceral experience he produced on screen. The film is one part allegory on man's impudence over nature and one part family psychodrama full of unresolved feelings, and the two parts work seamlessly together thanks to Evan Hunter's shrewd screenplay. Hitchcock recognizes that more than the technical effects he amassed to simulate the surreal, bludgeoning bird attacks, the actual storytelling is what drives the plot.<br/><br/>Although the birds provide an ominous presence from the outset, it starts with a flirtatious, love-hate romance between spoiled socialite Melanie Daniels and insolent attorney Mitch Brenner. Seeking but failing to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his little sister Cathy, Mitch travels to his family home in the friendly hamlet of Bodega Bay north of San Francisco. Motivated by her attraction to Mitch, Melanie goes up to leave the lovebirds secretly at his home, but oddly, a seagull attacks her as she pilots a boat on the bay. This is the start of what becomes a series of attacks that increase in scope and terror, and what I appreciate about Hitchcock's style is how he manages to build to them gradually, almost nonchalantly until the moment of strike when he lets the birds take over the screen. Equally intriguing is the way the characters are presented, especially Mitch's subtly dysfunctional family, and react to the attacks.<br/><br/>In a surprising twist, Hitchcock eschews the glamorous stars he usually casts for the leads, though ironically the journeyman-level contributions of Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor seem to work in the film's favor as they don't distract from the allegorical storyline. Taking over for Grace Kelly, Hedren manages to exude the sophistication if not quite the complexity of Melanie. As Mitch, Taylor has always been a lunkish presence on screen and barely charismatic enough to elicit such fervent behavior from the women around him, but he manages the heroic sincerity necessary in the role. Far better are Jessica Tandy, who sublimates her natural likability to play Mitch's controlling, needy mother Lydia, and a sonorous Suzanne Pleshette as repressed schoolteacher Annie who still longs for Mitch despite Lydia's objections. I also love Ethel Griffies's bit as the elderly ornithologist who happens to be there to explain the genesis of the various bird species.<br/><br/>Even though the matte shots look dated compared to today's seamless computer animation, the effects are still startling, and some scenes are developed brilliantly, in particular, the schoolyard accumulation leading to a direct attack on the running children. There are quirks that are a bit frustrating for their artificiality - heavy use of back-screen projection, the predictable behavior of stereotypical town folk - but none of this detracts from the superb craftsmanship and breathless pacing toward the apocalyptic ending. There are several extras included with the DVD, the best being the looking-back documentary, ""All About The Birds"". This represents grand execution by a true master."

","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is undoubtedly one of the low points in his career. I am not sure why he chose to make this move. It has a weak plot that was doomed to fail. Of course Hitchcock was still able to deliver some eerie scenes of the birds. Also he was able to give the setting of the small town its own life, just as he did in Psycho and Rear Window. In those movies, as in the Birds, he allows the setting to become its own character. Other than those two positives, the movie was lacking quite a bit in other areas. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor were perhaps Hitchcock's worst lead pair. Most scenes were over-acted. Also the direction was not up to par with Hitchcock's other movies. I give it a solid 5 out 10."

My opinion - to which I am entitled - that Hitchcock is vastly overrated is known to anyone who has read my review of any Hitchcock film on IMDb but in this case he had some real expertise in the shape of a screenplay by Salvatore Lombino who is perhaps better known by one of his pseudonyms Evan Hunter and Ed McBain being the two most recognizable. The fact that Jessica Tandy, the great English actress who emigrated to the US around the same time as Hitch and went on to create the iconic role of Blanche du Bois in the original 1947 production of A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway, is also on hand is yet another plus factor, to say nothing of reliables like Charles McGraw and Lonny Chapman in smaller roles. I suppose what I'm really saying is, given the screenplay and the named actors you could assingn this to a journeyman like Tay Garnett and you'd still get a decent movie, so hold the genuflections to Hitch."

"rudyallan","10","3","11","3 February 2017"," The Birds Explained
","Of course Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is a classic and a great movie for many reasons. The camera angles, panning and tracking, the suspenseful plot, the emotion in the story-line and actors, and of course the great actors and actresses Hitchcock used.<br/><br/>But there always seems to be a very interesting underlying ""symbolic message in the bottle"" in Hitchcock's plot and sometimes it is not easy to decipher. Of all the reviews here about The Birds, the underlying message has escaped the other writers. Not sure why. Might be that people don't read many actual paper books anymore and spend long hours online where everything is ""told to them"". Maybe its because films are not really studied or analyzed anymore as much as they are consumed in a ""entertain me now"" kind of way.<br/><br/>Anyway...the name of the movie itself should be a great hint of the underlying symbolic ideas. ""The Birds"" and thus the birds and the bees. The Birds and the Bees refer to the old ideology of the natural order of things which were changing at the time this movie was made. This idea of natural order encompassed the idea that only ""men and women"" were allowed to be in love, married and making love and that only men were supposed to be the pursuer in this natural order of human love.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's plot opens in San Francisco, which at the time was just becoming known as a gay friendly city and was opening the doors for the gay liberation movement. This gay embrace was very shocking to conservative USA. This shock value was not lost on Hitchcock. Northern California was also the first to embrace women's equality and liberation. The first major impact of women's liberation was the sometimes reversal of pursuer roles and women becoming assertive in their pursuit of men if they so choose. Hitchcock utilized both of these ground breaking social changes in this movie, filmed in and near San Francisco, the center of both the gay liberation movement and the women's liberation movement.<br/><br/>There were actually two symbolic messages that were carried together to Bodega Bay and none were in a bottle. One was in a cage and draws great symbolism captured in other famous stories such a La Cage aux Folles and the other broke the cage of women's conservative norms which eventually sweep the US and allowed women to finally spread their wings and fly. The first message was the love birds bringing their unnatural love to the quiet little village of Bodega Bay. Even to expert ornithologist, determining the love bird's sex is very difficult. So it could often happen that two love birds paired and affectionate could both be male or both female living life together monogamously. Here I believe that Hitchcock insinuated the Love Birds were of the same sex. This little message carried the notion of two gay partners coming into a small town and disrupting the existing conservative values. <br/><br/>As the love birds were brought into Bodega Bay, their arrival rocked the natural order of things and the existing birds of the community rebelled, first attacking Melanie Daniels who brought them there in an open boat coming slowing across the central bay for all the local birds to see. They then eventually attacked the home which they resided and humans who were harboring them. This story could be easily paralleled with the La Cage story, abet much more suspenseful and horrific, of a gay couple coming into a small town and moving into a home and having the conservative townsfolk rebel. And rebel they did in the most horrific way imaginable. This rebellion was where Hitchcock came into his element and utilized his famous horror and suspense.<br/><br/>And just as the love birds came into Bodega Bay and changed the natural order of things, so did their carrier in Melanie Daniels. Melanie broke all the normal rules and customs of the East Coast conservative male/female dynamic when she immediately began to seek, prey and chase her suitor Mitch Brenner. Racing her high performance sports car around the narrow curves of the Pacific Coast Highway, renting and manning a boat by herself to find his home, entering his property without permission or invitation, leaving a love letter on his desk and spying her prey from the bay on her skiff. All of these actions in the course of a few minutes broke the natural order of Victorian women's protocol wide open forever. She was a hungry tiger and very much upset the natural order of things which was most evident in Mitch's mother and the layers of emotional depth that involve a man and his conservative mother as the natural order is challenged or broken. <br/><br/>Once the attacks began Melanie quickly took back her already antiquated role as a damsel in distress, which Hitchcock may have needed to enhance his dramatic suspense. But even in her damsel role, Hitchcock allowed Melanie much bravery and an equal level of courage to her co-star Mitch Brenner in the face of a brutal bird rebellion. Here Mitch's mother began to over come the shock of Melanie's aggressiveness and see the brave woman in a more human and accepting way. I think suspense and dramatic distress can be a wonderful instrument in which to allow the viewing of a character in a new and sympathetic light. Hitchcock clearly wanted to show the disruption in our presupposed notion of the natural order of the birds and the bees and also to show the effect of this disruption upon conservative small town societal values again a la Cage aux Folles. <br/><br/>Yes, Hitchcock's symbolic message in a bottle. Yet another added dimension to an already brilliant film. Look for more of Hitchcock's underlying symbolic messages in his other great films Vertigo, Psych and North by Northwest."

The women and young girl just stand around, doing and saying stupid stuff, acting pathetic. As women aren't like this in real life I think Hitchcock must have had mother issues somewhere in his life.
Not a classic but a lesson in how not to direct."

","The Birds, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a really strange movie. It has a complicated plot which can sometimes drive you crazy. However, the storyline is quite interesting and original, for the time. It takes a while to get into the story, it would be better if the issue that the characters have to face came earlier, because it is really long, and boring. The acting sometimes was a bit overacted. The main actress, Tippi Hedren, is really pretty and plays well, and Rod Taylor is also a good actor. The mother's character, played by Jessica Tandy, can seem annoying because she is overprotective with her son, not being nice to whoever he brings home. The movie fits the society of that time, like the fact that there is no father in the family, or their way of life which is normal. The special effects can seem ridiculous, but for 1963 it has an amazing quality. It was realistic at that time. However, the end is realistic but the suspense goes on and on, and it doesn't have a real end. It seems like the movie was just cut off because there isn't an outcome. The suspense is good and you want to discover more, but since there's no ending, you don't know the end of the story and it's frustrating."

","Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is a wealthy San Francisco lady who falls for handsome combative Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). She follows him to coastal small town Bodega Bay, and finds him there with his mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and sister (Veronica Cartwright). She rents a room from school teacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). Melanie and the town get attacked by birds.<br/><br/>I find that Tippi Hedren has an air of entitlement. And I didn't see much in Rod Taylor other than his rugged good looks. I don't feel much chemistry between them. It makes the long setup very tedious. I don't find their courtship compelling although the bird store was kinda cute.<br/><br/>It takes too long to get the birds started. The effects look good especially considering the times. It has some excitement, but I don't think it has enough tension. Birds attacking is just not a phobia that most people have, other than bird poop. Once they stop attacking, the birds aren't that scary."
"JamesHitchcock","7","2","6","9 January 2013"," Contains brilliant set-pieces, but other important aspects seem lacking
","""The Birds"" is an unusual entry among Alfred Hitchcock's oeuvre. Although there are a few psychological dramas such as ""Marnie"" which do not fit this pattern, most of his suspense films feature a hero or heroine who is under threat from a human source. This threat can come from an individual criminal (""Psycho""), from a gang of criminals or terrorists (""The Man Who Knew Too Much""), from the authorities of a foreign state (""The Lady Vanishes"") or, in those films which deal with a hero wrongly accused of a crime, from the authorities of his own state (The Wrong Man""). Sometimes, as in ""The 39 Steps"", the hero is under threat both from the police and from the real perpetrators of the crime of which he stands accused. <br/><br/>In ""The Birds"", by contrast, Hitchcock deals with a hero and heroine- indeed, with a whole community- under threat from a hostile nature. It was his third film based on a story by Daphne du Maurier, the others being ""Jamaica Inn"" and ""Rebecca"", although he transfers the action from Cornwall to Bodega Bay, California. The plot is too well-known to need setting out in any detail, but it concerns numerous unexplained violent attacks by birds on the human inhabitants of this small seaside village. <br/><br/>This has become one of Hitchcock's best-known films, yet seen as a piece of storytelling it is not very good. Most of the first half is taken up with the growing romance between the two main characters, Mitch Brenner and Melanie Daniels, a wealthy young socialite. The story of their romance is told in the best screwball comedy style- the scene in which they meet in a San Francisco pet shop could be a classic romantic comedy ""meet-cute""- and seems out of key with the later horrific scenes. Only once, when Melanie is hit on the head by a seagull while crossing the bay in a motor-boat, do we get a foretaste of what is to come. The ending of the film is notoriously obscure and ambiguous, leaving too many issues unresolved. (When I first saw the film, having recorded it from the television, it seemed to end so abruptly that I assumed I must have set the video recorder wrongly and failed to record the ending). <br/><br/>What makes the film stand out is the series of increasingly violent scenes in which the birds attack, with special effects being used to produce some very scarily realistic moments. As in Du Maurier's story no explanation is given for these attacks; doubtless the director and scriptwriter felt that they would be more frightening if they were left unexplained. Some have inferred that the attacks are a form of revenge for man's exploitation of nature, but this is never stated explicitly in the film itself. There is, however, plenty of evidence for those who prefer this interpretation of the film; a pair of caged lovebirds plays an important role, we hear of chickens being kept for their eggs or eaten, and one individual volunteers the extreme opinion that all birds, of whatever species, should be exterminated. <br/><br/>This was the first of two movies which the lovely Tippi Hedren made with Hitchcock, the other being ""Marnie"" from the following year. It was, indeed, Hedren's first-ever film, apart from two uncredited minor roles in the early fifties. It is not as good a performance as she was to give in the later film, but then Marnie Edgar is a much more psychologically complex and demanding role than Melanie, who for most of the time has little to do except to scream and look frightened. (If Hedren's account of her relationship with Hitchcock, as detailed in the recent film ""The Girl"", is to be believed, she was quite genuinely terrified for most of the time while filming). Hedren was a model before becoming an actress, and her performance here is typified by the sort of grace, elegance and ease of movement which one might expect from a former model, but which one does not always get from today's catwalk queens when they try their hand at acting. (No names mentioned). Rod Taylor in his only film with Hitchcock makes a solid, dependable hero, and there are also good contributions from Jessica Tandy as Mitch's possessive mother, Suzanne Pleshette (as striking a beauty as Hedren) as the young schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, and Ethel Griffies in a cameo as an elderly ornithologist. <br/><br/>Some would claim classic status for this film, but for me it does not really represent the very best of Hitchcock. There is an instructive contrast between this film and the two which preceded it, ""North by North-West"" and ""Psycho"", both of which I would regard as among his best. Both those films contain memorable directorial set-pieces, the crop-duster and Mount Rushmore scenes in the first, the shower scene in the second, but both are also superior pieces of storytelling, combining suspense with a great plot and satisfying characterisation and, in the case of ""North by North-West"", humour as well. ""The Birds"" probably contains more set-pieces than any other Hitchcock film, but other important aspects seem lacking. At his best, there was always more to the great man than a series of brilliantly directed individual scenes. 7/10"

","I suppose Daphne Du Maurier should first be acknowledged for her incredibly original story. The idea that the beautiful birds that we find so wonderful to watch in their winged flight could turn upon and attack with such violence! Then there are the writers of the screen play. Where do they start in a story like this? And next, the big challenge...how to make the birds do what is required of them. Birds have a habit of not following the script. Despite all the anticipated complications, Alfred Hitchcock has not only brilliantly overcome them but has as a result given us one of his very best productions.<br/><br/>The film starts off rather lamely when a guy chats up a blonde in a bird shop. Apparently she likes his cheeky approach because soon after she is on her way to his weekend holiday house with a couple of love-birds in a cage. At this point one could switch off; but hold on a minute. Because the blonde wants to present the birds as a surprise she decides to go by motorboat across the bay instead of arriving by car. When a big gull dives down gashing her head, an element of mystery starts to creep into the film. All is not right in this sleepy fishing village. The local schoolteacher acts strangely too.<br/><br/>The locals blame the blond for the frightening events that follow. The lovely little village becomes a ""war zone""...a terrifying battle against marauding birds dive-bombing every human being in sight. Watch your head...watch your eyes...run for your life...nail up the doors and windows and don't forget the chimneys! It's a terrifying experience which will leave an indelible impression. Rest assured you will always remember ""The Birds"". The bird attacks are so real they are absolutely believable. All credit to those responsible. If you buy the DVD there is a special feature explaining how it was all done! Just incredible."

The plot was done better by George Romero 2 years later in ""Night of the living dead"" it is essentially the same movie once the birds actually start attacking in large groups, and the Romero movie doesn't pretend to be anything its not.

"SimonJack","9","1","2","30 November 2017"," Superb special effects in a Hitchcock thriller
","""The Birds"" was a film that struck wonder in many a movie fan when it came out. How did they film those bird attacks? Did the birds really attack people, and if so, how did they get them to do that? Or, what kind of special effects could make those scenes seem so real?<br/><br/>The film was a smashing success for Alfred Hitchcock who had established his place in film history as a tremendous director and creative movie maker. Most especially of thrillers that often had frightening parts. No one could make such films better. Ironically, Hitchcock never won an Academy Award. But, of the 70 films he directed, he received five nominations. The Hollywood Foreign Press however, bestowed two Golden Globes on Hitchcock. He received a 1958 Globe for his television series, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" which aired from 1955 to 1962. And, he won a Golden Globe for his 1972 film, ""Frenzy.""<br/><br/>The cast all are fine in ""The Birds,"" and Americans got their first look at Tippi Hedren. Everyone in the cast does a good job conveying a sense of fear or fright about the birds after their first attach. The plot, filming, direction and editing all are superb. The location shots in Bodega Bay, California for scenic and very good. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" uses special effects for longer time than any other film movie that comes to mind. It received an Academy Award nomination for special effects for 1963. The various scenes of attacking birds look so real. But they were all shot at the Walt Disney Studios. Disney's master animator, inventor and special effects guru Ubbe Iwerks did the job. The process used different background screens for shooting and then different developing processes. The finished product looks so real because it overlays the shooting of real people and birds. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" was the third movie Alfred Hitchcock made from stories by Daphne du Maurier. The English novelist and playwright was one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century. More than a dozen movies have been made from her novels and short stories. Besides ""The Birds,"" Hitchcock directed two of her earliest novels for the silver screen. ""Jamaica Inn"" of 1939 starred Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara, and ""Rebecca"" of 1940 starred Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. <br/><br/>""Jamaica Inn"" is a crime mystery and thriller set on the Cornwall coast â€“ the westernmost county of England. Hitchcock and others distanced themselves from the film soon after it was made. Apparently, Laughton had bought the film rights from du Maurier, with the intent to use it to promote himself. He had control over the whole film and one can see that his presence overwhelms it at times. His forced changes in the script and his character departed a great deal from the book, and du Maurier wasn't happy with the film. But, the film was a success. Moviegoers didn't seem to mind and may even have enjoyed Laughton's exaggerations and overacting. <br/><br/>Anyhow, it was Hitchcock's last film in England, for he went from there to Hollywood. Laughton also went to Hollywood for ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" and he took Maureen O'Hara with him. She had been a little known actress before Jamaica Inn, but ""Hunchback"" made her a star. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" was what people regarded in the mid-20th century as a good ""date"" movie. That's because the frightening scenes would usually lead to a girl nestling close to the boy, and the boy ""protecting"" her with his arm around her shoulder."
"Realrockerhalloween","Null","1","2","30 August 2016"," Birds attack
","Hickcock delivers an arousing picture about the end of the world where planes are crashing, ships are sinking, cars piling up from an unlikely source birds. As silly as it may sound they are a deadly force grouped together, watchful and flying over cities waiting to swarm at unsuspecting victims.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock builds tension like Melanie noticing the birds gathered on the school playground, one flaps a wing, she rushed into the school house, the kids are evacuated and run for their lives as the attack commences. So full of energy, brutality and frightening imagery. The music rising like a volcanic until it erupts the screams out of the audience. <br/><br/>The characters are likable, fleshed out with history and flaws. Annie having a past with Mitch and Melanie wanting a mother only to find it in Mitch's while she finds a daughter. Rich characterization kept you interested and cheering for humanity to be the victors.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect is we never find out an over bloated motive or reason they might be attacking. Stubtle hints like the love birds, evolutionary or him an factors are suggested.<br/><br/>The birds is an unusual film and you'll never find another like it."
"PimpinAinttEasy","8","1","2","23 August 2016"," The second best movie of place .....
","Polanski made the greatest movie of place - The Ghost Writer. Hitch made the second greatest movie of place - The Birds. Set in Bogeda Bay, a beautiful scenic island whose idyllic life is not too different from an American small town, the island is as much a character as anyone else in this film.<br/><br/>There are some great action set pieces. I liked the way the birds silently flew in and sat outside the school. Most directors of today would have made that into a loud action scene filled with fast cuts and weird camera angles. The second action scene at the bar/cafe was also terrific.<br/><br/>Tippi Herden had too much make up on. The relationship between her and Rod Taylor's mother was strange at best. Sussanne Pleshte's (she was smoking hot) character who stays back in Bogeda Bay to be close to Rod Taylor was also unusual. Hitchcock's films are often populated by these strange characters involved in some seriously weird relationships. Remember the wife in The Paradine Case who longs for her lawyer husband to save her sexual rival in court so that they can fight fairly over the man?"
"sharky_55","9","1","2","13 August 2016"," Can I bring the lovebirds, Mitch? They haven't harmed anyone.
","I have always maintained that a horror movie's power is most noticeably dulled by muting the sound, and no film is more affected by this phenomenon than The Birds. In an age where cheap scares are a dime a dozen and magnified ludicrously by the soundtrack's crashes, booms and roars, The Birds becomes a marvel of personifying the growing discomfort of silence. True to his nature, he does not ever give so much as a still shot of a seagull's vicious claws - the birds are always dive bombing in and out of the frame, fluttering on the edges, or in an erratic, chaotic mess covering the entire screen. So what do the poor humans have to rely on, then? The almost mechanical screeches that signal impeding doom are key. First there is silence, so jarring that the camera sweeps across the room looking for solace and finds only distressed figures that are so traumatised they have already begun the inevitable, hunched over wait for the next wave. Oskar Sala's symphony creeps into the ears as it matches the growing darkness descending over the roof and room (not unlike another pivotal, frightening scene in the car from Psycho). Gashes appear on the wooden door and Mitch hurries to barricade the weakness, briefly muffling the screeches, before they are assaulted by another cacophony of shrieks from the right. The scene is as much aural as it is visual; the birds manage to snuff out even the last feeble lights, plunging the humans into an abyss, but it is the implied threat of the mass of sound overhead and all around that strikes fear into their hearts. It's a clever reversal - the film starts in a pet store, with caged birds that rattle and chirp from their cages, and by the end it is the humans who are the ones having the walls of their cage banged and rattled.<br/><br/>But first there is the setup, which to Hitchcock is just as important as the payoff. He creates what is basically a nuclear test site, so pristine and so idyllic that there must be something hiding behind the edges. The characters are pointed caricatures, and clash in the most obvious of ways. Melanie Daniels is the prissy, delicate daddy's girl, who walks with a model's poise and an immaculate sense of dress. Hitchcock discovered Tippi Hedren in a commercial and recreates it in the opening here, with her striding across the street in those long legs and heels and greeting an audacious wolf-whistle with a dazzling smile. It's such an obviously enclosed moment, ripped straight from the spotless, faux-reality of television, but that is the idea; she is the pretty blonde taken to the extreme so it is all the more shocking when she is ripped apart and defiled (one might also theorise that Hitchcock and Hedren's strained relations play into this treatment). Melanie is a socialite, which means that her primary occupation is attracting scorn from baser, plainer women for how she prances about, flaunting her beauty, promiscuity and coquettishness. She is a direct opposite for the more moderate competition. The dumpy, despondent schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, who has an acute self-awareness of her character and knows that she has no chance with Mitch. And Lydia, the domineering and possessive mother, who is everything that Melanie is not; the unadorned, conservative housewife, who has remained rooted in her traditional feminine place (her nest, you might say) while she was splashing around the world naked in fountains. Oh, it's a wicked, wicked portrait that Hitchcock paints, and so it is all the more savage when he tears it apart.<br/><br/>They are all fighting over Mitch, and why not? Rod Taylor plays the absolute paragon of manhood, a high-end lawyer with enough flexibility and sensibility to easily juggle his work and his family. The star pair meet cute in the bird-shop, trading barbed dialogue and sarcastic quips that thinly veil their instant attraction to each other. He also shows an inkling of mischief that makes him all the more intriguing, and because it is a movie, she is able to instantly track him down and turn up the next moment without any fuss. How romantic. And then slowly but surely, signs of the birds and their violent intent begin to reveal themselves. After the initial seagull bombardment Hitchcock has a brief interlude where we think we might be let off. There are the usual archetypes; the kooky, disheveled cryptic that interrupts periodically with warnings of the impeding doomsday, and the venerable British expert who waves off any concern with a bit of common sense. So pandemonium, and then silence, and the uncomfortable lull that accompanies it. Only after Melanie's beauty is scarred and tainted can the birds cease their attack. Only then, when her threat is extinguished and her blonde curls tightly wrapped and soiled by the smear of blood, can she lay under the wing (heh) of Lydia's motherly nurture. But the birds are not so quick to forget. In that stunning final shot of the car in its agonising crawl towards San Francisco, they cover every spare inch of the frame, an oppressive wall of dread as dark as the night itself. As Mitch starts the car the screeches begin to build again, as if they are daring him to make a wrong move."
"C22Man","9","1","2","17 July 2016"," Hitchcock's Last Great Film
","Hitchcock never limited himself. He stuck mostly to the thriller genre but his films always blended varying styles and themes. The Birds is his venture into pure horror, an area that he'd touched on previously but never fully dived into. It's him taking the atmosphere that runs through many of his mysteries and combing it with imagery and ideas that succeed in being as macabre as possible. The whole idea behind the film is preposterous, yet it is clear that the whole point is using it to create as frightening a spectacle as possible and that is something the master of suspense achieves. <br/><br/>The set-up involves wealthy Californian socialite Melanie Daniels journeying to Bodega Bay in order to woo lawyer and bachelor Mitch Brenner, after he makes a thinly veiled invite to her. She meets his icy mother and cheerful little sister, the local school teacher and the townspeople all seem nice enough so she decides to stay for the weekend. Of course this is part of the film's genius, everything moves along smoothly and seems pleasant for most of the first half, creating a sense of ease on the surface that you know is just waiting to be torn apart. Tippi Hedren puts in a very good performance, far greater than she would later do in 'Marnie' where she appeared to be suffocated by the complexities of the material. She is clearly at her best when she can play to her naturally warm and charming personality, which are traits she aptly passes on to Melanie.<br/><br/>Something more sinister starts to form when large groups of birds begin attacking and killing the locals at random with no reasoning, leaving the entire town stranded, confused and defenceless against further attacks. It's a true testament to Hitchcock's genius that he was able to make a species as seemingly harmless as birds appear to be the most vicious and terrifying out there. He does what he is so good at, building unease and dread slowly out of seemingly ordinary situations. It would be nowhere near as scary if it wasn't for the deliberately paced build-up. The film is surprisingly brutal and visceral even for modern day. There's no shortage of people cut or sliced as a result of the attacks. The scene where the farmer's body is discovered is truly horrifying. Even the bleak ending, something Hitchcock was no stranger to, feels much darker than usual. <br/><br/>The characters present here are so enjoyable and distinctly drawn that you could lose the entire birds gone wild aspect and it would still be an interesting watch. The suave Mitch (played smoothly by the ideal Hitchcock leading man Rod Taylor), his distant mother Lydia, the sharp school teacher Annie Hayworth, the crotchety old ornithologist, they are all sharply defined and engaging presences. It's something that Hitchcock also did to great effect in his previous film 'Psycho', he gave us characters that we gain some kind of connection to so that when the terror begins we feel invested in what's at stake. There's plenty of smartly handled scenes that establish details about their personalities and moods, such as a nicely emotive one that explains Lydia's coldness. Hitchcock has paced the film perfectly, there isn't a second that is boring or uninteresting to watch. <br/><br/>The effects are understandably dated, but still rather impressive for how much creativity was used in making it look like a massive flock of birds was causing so much destruction. All kinds of techniques were used and most of them blend together effectively. If anything it is simply guilty of showing too much ambition for the time period. What is notable is that the film contains no score, regular collaborator Bernard Herrmann is noted as 'sound consultant', and that is an interesting stylistic choice. The film appreciates the strength of silence and uses it fantastically. How unease can be crafted because everything appears to be too quiet. There is a potency with in that which the film taps in to. It also means that the piercing squawks that emerge once the birds attack are all the more startling.<br/><br/>For me personally this is Hitchcock's last truly great film. One where the story, the writing, the acting, the scares and the direction all came together to create something both spectacular and memorable. None of his films that followed ever reached the same heights, whether it was because one of these areas was dealt with poorly or a multitude of them were. Here Hitchcock knew better than anyone that there has to be a story and set of people that we feel invested in for the film to truly work. As a result this film is a masterpiece in how to gradually build tension and craft horror that packs a punch. When the scares come along they work outstandingly, partly because of the gruesome imagery but also because we're invested in the story."

","Alfred Hitchcock's ""THE BIRDS"" is his last real masterpiece. It was released three years after the colossal effect of PSYCHO on audiences. This movie is different; it is Hitchcock's 'creature feature', yet the creatures in this film are not vicious monsters; they're birds: seagulls, sparrows, crows, etc. <br/><br/>This movie is exceptional and stands out because the mystery element is abundant; we are not given any specific reasons as why the birds are acting the way they are, nor what happens in the end. We just see the main characters driving away with a shocking amount of birds surrounding them. This unique storytelling ability (which would definitely fail if handled in other ways with less remarkable directors) is very typical of the master of suspense.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren plays the lovely heroine, Melanie, a socialite who is smitten with a young lawyer. The story involves the two of them, his mother and sister. Other characters include an unfortunate schoolteacher, Annie, who is killed by the birds in an attempt to protect the little sister of Rod Taylor's character. <br/><br/>Considering this was in the sixties, the visual effects were quite impressive, and the sound effect of the bird noises was haunting.<br/><br/>All in all, Hitchcock has crafted one masterful, eerie classic worthy of being preserved for generations to come."

Some argue that this is ridiculous but soon more and more attacks take place and the whole town is in danger.<br/><br/>This Hitchcock classic could be mistaken for a gentle romantic comedy if it weren't for the opening shot of vast numbers of birds flying past. These early scenes are fun with little to hint at what is to come. When the bird attacks begin in earnest it is quite disturbing as we see familiar species gradually building in number; most notably crows and gulls; birds than can seem menacing at the best of times! It is this that makes it so frightening. The shots of the bird attacks feature effects that while good for the time appear a little dated now however they do capture the terror of the attacks; especially in the scene where the school children are attacked. We see a major character die which leads us to believe nobody is truly safe; indeed the ending hints that the danger is far from over. The cast do a decent enough job although it isn't the best cast Hitchcock has used and some of the minor characters are somewhat weak. Overall though this isn't Hitchcock's best work it is well worth watching and if you are a fan of Hitchcock one really should see it."

","After the proliferation of all those Flying Saucer Movies of the 1950's that told us to ""Keep Watching the Skies"", Alfred Hitchcock chimed in with this Bloody Horror Movie. It is Oddly called one of the Scariest Movies ever, and also one of the Least Scary Movies ever.<br/><br/>There is Diverse Opinion, depending on Taste and Expectations. It is certainly a well Crafted Suspense Picture with a Surprising amount of Bloodletting for a 1963 Film. It's Lack of a Musical Score and some ""Silent"" Scenes it has, again, been both Praised and Vilified for its Psychological Terror and Lack Thereof.<br/><br/>It is a Slow set up and is Talky and Stiff, even by the Standards of the Day. The Director's Trademark use of Matte Shots and Blue Screen are Evident, but the Special Effects of the Bird Attacks, for its Time, are Effective and the use of Sound Distortion Samples were Innovative and New. <br/><br/>It is distinctively Apocalyptic with the usual HItchcock Freudian Sexual Overtones. The Shoot is Notorious and Debut Star Tippi Hedren's Ordeal has been well Chronicled and Her Week long stay in the Hospital after Filming, only sufficed to add Credence to the Director's Misogyny and Cruel Behavior toward His Actors.<br/><br/>Overall, Today the Film seems Odd, Distinctive, and is surely one that can still Divide Viewers. It was a tremendous Hit in its Day and Remains One of Alfred HItchcock's Most Famous Films."

","The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"steven_torrey","10","1","2","6 March 2011"," One of Hitchcock's most suspenseful
","Of all Hitchcock's movies, this horror flick is one of his most suspenseful; the most tension filled. He created this palpable tension by focusing the camera on the person fidgeting, or moving, or just sitting.<br/><br/>The film resembles very much Greek Tragedy: clearly Mitch's mother does not want her son to leave her, she fears profoundly the loneliness of her senior years--isolated without her son. She resents Annie and yet she makes friends with Annie; by the end of the movie she embraces Melanie, clearly an evocation of Mary the Mother of Jesus embracing Jesus in Michael Angelo's PIETA. <br/><br/>Is Melanie the cause of the bird's attack? And what is the specific motivation of her as symbol to the birds to justify attacking humanity? Melanie as symbol to the birds, what does she represent? During many scenes, Melanie incongruously wears a fur coat; crossing Bodega Bay in a skiff, she wears this fur coat. At the end of the movie she, wounded by the birds, wears the fur coat as she is escorted into Mitch's car.<br/><br/>Does she become symbol to the birds by carrying love birds in a cage?<br/><br/>Spring 2010 saw the British Petroleum pipeline explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, spilling millions of gallons of oil into the sea for more than 90 days, devastating the ecology. In one news item, a large oil soaked bird is attacking a small boat with it's beak, as if to say: ""You got me into this mess, now get me out."" Humanity's predation of planet earth could very well spell the demise of Planet Earth's habitability--a millenia sooner than what might be expected from natural processes; for example, expansion of the sun in a next billion years to that of a red giant first broiling the planet then engulfing the planet. But Humanity's predation could sterilize the oceans of food, sterilize the atmosphere with excessive co2 emissions, sterilize the land with deforestation.<br/><br/>And this is Humanity's legacy to Planet Earth. The birds of the Air, and the Beasts of the Field are victims of this mass extinction brought on by Humanity's predation. Alfred Hitchcock's tale is a Greek tragedy about an unfolding mass extinction brought about by humanity's demonic predation; the birds are simply seeking revenge.<br/><br/>Or is this giving Hitchcock more credit than he deserves? A movie taking on more weight than the artist intended. The artist must always be reminded that he/she is not the final arbitrator of a movie's interpretation. A movie succeeds because it evokes more than it's immediate import. So while Hitchcock did not intend a morality tale on the environment, some fifty years after the movie, it has transcended itself to a morality tale about the environment and ecology.<br/><br/>I saw the movie when it came out in 1962 and then saw it again at Oakland''s art deco Paramount Theatre; it had lost none of its force in those years; if anything, the modern ecology movement and warnings of global warming and a sixth mass extinction brought on by Humanity's predation made the movie even more powerful and moving."

","Okay, so I was really excited to watch this movie because of the theme in it: birds attacking people? Wow, intriguing. However it kinda disappointed me. Not the movie, but the story... Mainly the end. Why were the birds attacking people? Were they able to get to San Francisco? What did they do to the birds? Did the birds take over the world? Or did they eventually just disappeared with no explanation? And Cathy talked so many times about the love birds that I actually though the love birds would be the ones to give the explanation to all of it. But they didn't. Anyway, I have to give this movie credit to the special effects. Obviously, when compared to the movies we have nowadays, the special effects suck... But this movie was made in the 60's, and I think Alfred Hitchcock was very clever in the way he planned everything. I really wish I was able to give more than 7 to this movie, but I can't because of the end. It is still an awesome movie and everybody should watch it."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","2","13 November 2010"," Birds of Prey
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is among the first 'predators-hunting/killing-in-packs' thriller. While there have been almost countless followers that tried to ape the effect of Hitchcock's film, hardly any of them come even remotely close to 'The Birds'. It stands on its own and even after decades, it manages to remain just as engaging, intense and chilling as the first time I saw it as child.<br/><br/>The movie more or less starts off as a romantic comedy. The interaction between Tippi's Melanie and Rod's Mitch is amusing to watch. I found this an appealing approach to introduce the characters and their personalities without any distraction. Once Melanie is attacked by a seagull tension gradually builds both between the characters (for example when Melanie meets Rod's family) and then within the town as the birds attack.<br/><br/>The special effects and art direction are brilliant. Music is effectively used. The screeching and pecking sounds of the birds is haunting. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor have great chemistry. I liked that they didn't play the cliché hero and heroine that was so apparent in films of that time. Veronica Cartwright, Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette are superb in their roles.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is a chilling and creepy little film, one of the best of it's kind. While the bird attack sequences are tastefully shot, it is the fantastic end sequence that sends a chill down the spine."
"freema19","Null","1","2","15 September 2010"," The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock doing Alfred Hitchcock
","The Birds is one of Hitchcock's most well-known movies. It's one of the movies that people identify with him. Hitchcock is known for spellbinding his audience. In Psycho, Marion Crane eats her last supper with someone more neurotic and unbalanced than herself. In Vertigo, Scotty and Judy begin an affair that makes them dizzy, obsessive, neurotic and filled with revelations.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's style uses the camera to imitate a person's gaze and forces viewers to ""be there"" as an event is unfolding. He framed shots to maximize the audience's anxiety, fear and empathy. He used innovative film editing. He had a love for the technical side of film making. The suspense in The Birds will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is scarier when there are no birds to be seen, but you hear them shrieking and gawking in the distance and in the trees. There is the tension, the silence, and the mystery. This is suspense for the lovers of suspense.<br/><br/>In this movie there is no bad guy, no car chases and no serial murderers. The main plot is Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren); a young rich girl goes to Bodega Bay to pursue her new attraction. She is bringing two love birds to give to Mitch Brenner's (Rod Taylor) 11 year-old sister. She had recently met him in San Francisco and wanted to get to know him better. He spends the weekends in this small town with his mom and sister. The suspense begins to build as you watch the birds standing, watching and waiting. The crows on the monkey bar sitting in a row is very mysterious. Something tells you they are thinking with those little beady eyes. Almost as if they are planning their strategy.<br/><br/>Melanie finds herself trapped with Mitch and his family inside their home. His mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright. We see the birds gather and attack in increasing ferocity. The small town is battered and torn. The bird's presence is dark and scary. Sound imitating bird shrieks are so high pitched and awful you can barely hear yourself think. Everyone inside the house is twisting and turning in reaction to their fury and imagining their own horrible deaths at the beaks and talons of these creatures. Melanie goes up the stairs because she hears a rustling noise; we all know what lies on the other side of the door, nothing nice. Melanie is attacked and gets trapped on the other side of the door. Mitch tries to get inside but finds he cannot because Melanie has her back to the door and are too busy fighting off birds. She slumps and surrenders to the birds, her face shows a combination of horror and defeat. If you are wishing for a happy ending-don't watch this one. Final scene, Hitchcock looks and winks at the camera. <br/><br/>The characters are excellent, the support cast who has only a few lines does an excellent job of fighting off birds and screaming. The famous editing techniques by Hitchcock are very obvious in each scene. Overall, this is a great black and white horror movie. It is a perfect example of why Alfred Hitchcock is considered, one of the best in the suspense business."
"poweller","9","1","2","4 April 2010"," Genuinely Terrifying!
","Consider for a second some of the incredible films Alfred Hitchcock has directed; Rear Window, Psycho, Vertigo to name just a few. It is therefore saying something that in my opinion 'The Birds' is the directors greatest accomplishment.<br/><br/>The film, based in California, focuses on a mass outbreak of bird attacks against the residents of Bodega Bay with its main characters the macho Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and a rich 'it girl' of the time, Melanie Daneils (Tippi Hedren). Its perhaps fair to say that if you aren't a fan of leaving questions unanswered in a film this may not be for you. We are never presented with any answers as to just why these birds are choosing to seemingly wage war with humanity, yet in a way this is what makes the film so haunting.<br/><br/>As a fan of the horror genre too many films tend to fall in to the trap of displaying frequent over the top gore as a way of providing the shock factor. Whilst 'The Birds' does provide genuine gore, in one scene Brenner's mother travels to a friends farmhouse to find the birds have laid siege to the house and pecked the mans eyes clean out, it is the eerie silences when the birds are gathering and the excellent POV shots that help build suspense, meaning when the shocks do come they are genuinely terrifying!Indeed when Melanie is waiting outside the school and the birds are gathering in silence on the climbing friend behind or when she climbs up to the attic with nothing but torch light.<br/><br/>Another thing modern day horror tends to fall into the trap of his underestimating the sheer terror of pure silence. There is no music in 'The Birds' meaning when they do attack all we hear is the shrill sound of the bird calls and the flapping of their wings. Believe me, its a haunting sound! You also cannot underestimate the role the characters play in this film, they are real people who you genuinely care what happens to them. Taylor and Hedren are both excellent but it is arguably Mitch's mother, Jessica Tandy who is the cream of the crop as a character petrified of being left alone. Note her haunting reactions as the camera provides to sudden close up shots after she discovers her friends eyes have been picked out! It may be some 47 years since the release of 'The Birds' yet you would have a very tough time to find many films that can be as genuinely haunting. It is a Hitchcock must see!"
"Aaron1375","7","1","2","9 July 2009"," A good nature goes berserk movie.
","This is like the only Alfred Hitchcock movie I have seen, and it is a rather good nature strikes back type of movie. That is the best way to describe this movie as you never really find out why or anything to that effect in this movie, which kind of adds to the charm of it. In another director's hands this movie would probably be rather silly, let's face it, birds on the attack does not sound particularly frightening, but it is here. Also, it is rather bloody for an early 1960's motion picture, it is certainly not toned down or anything. The story is simple enough, a lady is visiting an island or something and while boating on over she is attacked by a bird. This seems only minor at first, but it ends up being the start of something very big and nasty as soon all the birds in the area start to go on the attack. The attack on the school and the attack on the street near the diner being two of the more memorable attacks. The end it gets more into the type of movie where survivors board themselves in a house while the animal that is on the attack tries to get in and at this point the movie weakens a bit. The film is still somewhat good just not like it was in earlier attack scenes. The effects are reasonably good for the time and convincing enough to pass the test. There would be a sequel made years later, but I pretty much figure that one is going to be horrible."

","This movie is great, but I think it lacked a resolution and the ending disappointed me. It was definitely Hitchcock's darkest movie, and it unfolded in a great way. I have a few problems, but I won't bicker. The effects are great for its time. You can tell that they've been chroma-keyed from todays view, but what it has done has made the movie genuinely scary. Where are the birds? Oh, they're there! Will they attack? Oh yes, they are! The gore is pretty full on too, to think Hitchcock made Psycho Black and White because he thought it would be too gory. This gore is Life-Like! I couldn't tell if they were real people or not. It's a great movie though.<br/><br/>8/10"
"bobsgrock","8","1","2","2 June 2009"," Wings of desire.
","Certainly one of the stranger movies of his career, Alfred Hitchcock nevertheless is able to astound and amaze use even forty years after the release of this story of horrific occurrences in a small bay side town involving fine-feather friends.<br/><br/>What makes this a memorable experience despite its shortcomings, is how Hitchcock never explains to us the reason behind the birds. They attack but essentially there is no logical or natural reason to understand this. Perhaps it is supernatural, but that also is never examined. What Hitchcock wants to do is put ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and study how they behave. He did this in Psycho, North by Northwest, and Vertigo which are three of his personal best as well as three of the best films ever made. Here, he uses elements from those films and creates a rather dizzying portrait of a small group of people trying to band together and fight against whatever nature brings them.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure what Hitchcock is trying to say here. Perhaps he is saying that sometimes nature will impose its will on us and we shouldn't try and fight it. Or maybe he is suggesting we do fight back. However, I think that is besides the point as this is yet again a huge step forward for movies from the 1960s. Hitchcock insisted on using the ground-breaking technique from Disney to combine two different backgrounds and foregrounds to create shots that seem to be together but really weren't. Even today, this stands as some of the finest examples in special effects. Some elements of the story don't work as well as his other movies, but this is an enjoyable and strangely mesmerizing tale of scary things happening in a place you wouldn't expect by creatures you wouldn't expect. Next time, cover your head when you go outside."

"gftbiloxi","8","1","2","3 February 2008"," More A Series Of Set Pieces Than A Coherent Film; Fascinating Nonetheless
","Time has a way of qualifying our initial assessment of films, and this is particularly true of films made by director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980.) Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded as a solid craftsman but not an artist; in the 1950s many of his films, most notoriously VERTIGO, were received with lukewarm interest. In the 1960s, however, attitudes about his work began to change, and with that came a major re-evaluation of his films. Films that had been earlier dismissed were recognized as great classics; some films that had received tremendous recognition at the time of their release were now seen as somewhat over-praised.<br/><br/>To a certain extent this re-evaluation continues today, and at this point one film in particular proves extremely contentious to critics: THE BIRDS, which was considered both extremely innovative and a great shocker in 1963 but which is now teetering on the brink of critical dismissal. Just as it took some thirty years to fix VERTIGO's position in the Hitchcock lexicon, so may it take fifty to arrive at a final summation here.<br/><br/>According to film lore, Hitchcock was intrigued by a newspaper story about a ""bird attack,"" and his interest in the story gradually evolved into THE BIRDS. (Although technically based on the 1952 novella by Dauphne du Maurier, the story and film bear little relation to each other.) The story developed by Hitchcock and Evan Hunter concerned slightly wild San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who becomes infatuated with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and whimsically follows him to his home at Bodgea Bay as a prank. Not long after her arrival, however, she is attacked by a seagull, and although her injuries are slight she is quickly, albeit somewhat unwillingly, received by Mitch and his circle. One attack soon leads to another, and before very long Melanie, Mitch, and the entire community are under siege.<br/><br/>THE BIRDS is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks. Two of these are particularly famous. While Melanie sits on a bench outside the grade school, her attention is attracted by a flying bird--and she turns to find the playground's jungle gym covered with crows, assembling for an attack as the children leave the school. Later, when the birds attack the town itself, Melanie is trapped in a telephone booth, a helpless witness to the horrors around her even as the birds begin to batter the glass that protects her.<br/><br/>But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself. Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where THE BIRDS is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps. It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film. This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole. Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one? Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room? Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be? Hitchcock apologists tend to justify these and many other loose ends in the film by stating that THE BIRDS is intended to have an open-ended structure without resolution and that the random and often incomprehensible nature of the script is intended to reflect the random and incomprehensible nature of the bird attacks. A typical argument in favor of the film also notes that the film is driven by themes instead of plot points. Well-- maybe. But I'm an ""art film"" fan myself, and I can't see it.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, THE BIRDS is more akin to modern ultra-commercial action and adventure films than it is to an art-film, with the action and adventure distracting you from the holes in the thing--including the fact that the film is surprising slow. Even so, while THE BIRDS has major flaws, it is so crammed with iconographic moments and visuals that it is impossible to completely dismiss the film as a commercial wallow pure and simple. At its best, THE BIRDS has an incredibly high level of artistry, and those moments really do carry the film and impress themselves in your mind in a most remarkable way. I offer my own experience as an example. I first saw THE BIRDS on television when I was a teenager, and although I thought it was entertaining enough I wasn't particularly impressed. The next morning, however, I opened the living room curtains--startled a flock of birds perched on the outside window sill--and I was scared half to death. And that's cinematic power, nothing else.<br/><br/>The DVD presents the film in excellent form and includes several bonuses, most particularly Hitchcock's darkly humorous movie trailer and outlines of a deleted scene. Final comment: it's extremely uneven, but it is also extremely powerful. Recommended.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"HelloTexas11","8","1","2","31 January 2008"," no explanations
","'The Birds' finds Alfred Hitchcock at the end, and at a peak, of a most productive and impressive run of films, which for most people began with 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' in 1934 and continued through to 'The Birds' in 1963. There were Hitchcock films before and after, of course, but for this thirty-year period, he averaged a film a year with very few duds. 'The Birds' is full of Hitchcockian touches and is a genuinely disturbing film. Not for the first time, the director lulls us into thinking we are watching a perfectly ordinary, one might even say pedestrian, comedy/drama; this time about a lawyer/playboy (Rod Taylor) and a rich society playgirl (Tippi Hedren) and the flirtatious back-and-forths of their budding relationship. You know, she can't stand him so she finds any excuse to see him, etc. The other main characters are the lawyer's possessive mother (Hitchcock did have a thing for possessive mothers), his annoying little sister, and an old flame (played by a young Suzanne Pleshette). Early on in the film, the birds themselves only intrude on this little soap opera at odd moments, just enough to make the audience go 'hmm.' But soon they are the focal point after a series of attacks in the California coastal community of Bodega Bay cannot be explained. And this is precisely where Hitchcock plays 'gotcha' with the audience. At no point in the movie is there even a hint of a logical reason for the bird attacks... the 'why' that people so desperately want and need to know when faced with a crisis beyond comprehension. The characters in the film become pawns of sorts to the madness, as incapable as the audience of understanding what's happening. They are also incapable of defending themselves. (It never occurs to anyone, even at the end, to get some shotguns and shoot the little bastards.) The juxtaposition of the humdrum with the carnage of the bird attacks is jolting at times. In perhaps the most sadistically brilliant scene, the domineering mother drives alone to a neighbor's farm to find it deserted. As she walks through the farmhouse, it appears largely undisturbed at first, only small tell-tale signs present themselves... a cracked wall hanging here, a feather there. Then she comes across the farmer, slumped to the floor in pajamas, and in a series of quick-cut close-ups, we see his bloody eye sockets where his eyes have been pecked out. The special effects themselves are variable, from quite believable (the above-mentioned scene) to almost laughably phony. Hitchcock films are notorious in this regard (see his next film, 'Marnie,' with the painted backdrop of a battleship in the final scene) and it's hard to know if this is intentional or not. The famous director did have a wicked sense of humor. Most horror films concern characters who are unalterably caught up with the terrifying forces that menace them. In 'The Birds,' the characters try their best to ignore them, to no avail."

"ShootingShark","8","1","2","20 November 2007"," Unmissable Hitchcock Horror Classic Of Terrifying Bird Attacks In Coastal California
","San Fransisco socialite Melanie Daniels meets lawyer Mitch Brenner in a pet store and there is an instant mutual attraction. She follows him to his family home in the small fishing village of Bodega Bay, but suddenly and inexplicably large flocks of birds start to attack the townspeople. Confused and frightened, Melanie, Mitch and his family board up the house and try to fend off this mysterious threat.<br/><br/>Everything about The Birds is genius; it's one of Hitchcock's greatest films, one of the very best scary movies ever made and has a unique position in horror cinema. If Night Of The Living Dead represents the birth of modern horror (and it does), then if there's one film it owes a debt to, it's The Birds; unexplained threat, realistic setting, nice people get killed, nervous breakdowns, impotent hero, besieged farmhouse, unresolved ending. As well as thematically, it also set many trends visually - measured tracking shots (Melanie delivering the lovebirds), clever use of sound and visual effects (the attack on the school), sudden shock moments (Lydia discovering the farmer's corpse) - watch any of the great horror films of the last forty years (The Exorcist, Halloween, The Evil Dead) and you will see these motifs refashioned countless times. At the age of 62, Hitchcock embraced new techniques and technology to make his one true horror film and turned in a masterpiece. What makes it so good for me is the mixture of the peerless style with the intriguing story and characterisation. People tend to remember the last half-hour of the film very well but forget that the entire first half is just all character development; we learn about Melanie's wayward past, Mitch and Annie's history together and Lydia's fears. The performances are all smooth and naturalistic, with Tandy and Pleshette both outstanding, and it's purely because we know and understand these people so well that the subsequent horrors have such an impact on us. The support players in the diner are fun too, notably Griffies as the gruff ornithologist and Lang as the panicking mother, and thirteen-year-old Cartwright - a future horror icon from Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and Alien - is wonderful as the terrified kid sister. The script by Evan Hunter (aka crime novelist Ed McBain), based on a great old story by Daphne DuMaurier, keeps reversing movie clichés - the characters aren't dumb but they panic, react wrongly, waste time and snipe at each other. Tandy is a textbook example of good acting enriching a horror film; watch the standard scene where the hero is reporting what happened to a cop and Hitchcock completely ignores them and chooses to follow Tandy around the room instead as she picks up broken crockery and tries (and fails) to restore normality to her life. The masterstroke is the revolutionary open ending (note that the traditional The End title does not appear) with our heroes driving off through an endless vista of watchful birds to an uncertain future. The horror never ends. On a visual level too, the film is quite wonderful. At this point, cameraman Robert Burks had made ten films with Hitch and editor George Tomasini seven, so they were in perfect accord. Burks' photography is outstanding both in technical terms since there are lots of complicated effects sequences (my favourite is the birds-down-the-chimney scene) and also the amazing faked location photography. Some of the film was shot in the real Bodega Bay on the Sonoma/Marin County border but most of it wasn't, yet it all appears to take place there. Take the scene where Melanie and Mitch drink wine on a bluff above the children's party; only the opening and closing shots are real - the rest is a studio but you have to really watch to pick these up. Even better though is Burks' eye for an unusual atmospheric shot - a profile of Pleshette reclining in a chair and smoking, the broken cups still hanging on their hooks, the horse-and-cart tearing down the panic-stricken street, the bird beaks picking away at the front door unseen, countless others. Combine this with Tomasini's brilliant editing (the birds amassing behind Melanie on the school's climbing-frame is just the best) and breathtaking matte/animation work by Ub Iwerks and Albert Whitlock and you have a film with an almost perfect technical pedigree. The final stroke of genius is the wild soundtrack, which features no music, only dialogue, effects and the ultra-creepy electronic screechings of the birds. Music does many things in films but one thing it does is provide a cathartic release - Hitch daringly took it all out (has any other mainstream film tried that since ?) leaving us with nothing to do but scream. If you're ever tempted to think that Alfred Hitchcock is overrated as a filmmaker, give yourself a slap and then watch this movie. It's that rare bird (sic); a hugely entertaining, amazingly original, brilliantly constructed, technically dazzling, atmospheric masterpiece."

","""They're birds, aren't they?"".<br/><br/>This film is truly a Ornithophobic's nightmare and is a film that makes you think of what menial power humans have in contrast to the potential power the animal kingdom can have over us.<br/><br/>Its about a small harbour city that gets terrorised by all the birds that live there such as the Crows and Seagulls. The birds turn deranged and militant.<br/><br/>The question is why do these birds turn on mankind? Hitchcock never stated a reason but it is widely believed that the birds turning against mankind is a symbol of how much us as humans live on the edge of the animal kingdom. Think about it, there are 100 billion birds on earth, if they turned against us, mankind would shrivel away.<br/><br/>Its a frightening thought and the film presents this thought which leads to a chilling classic.<br/><br/>There is no music in this film which although is original, i believe it tones down the tension of the film. However, the absence of digetic sound gives the audience a natural feel towards the film.

Taylor at times looks like he was wearing something President Kennedy would have worn then.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, yet unremarkable. All the leads are very good.

","43 years after it was initially released the Birds is still a stunning, haunting, masterpiece. Hitchcock's last great film, the special effects hold up well especially with newly digitally mastered prints as well as DVD'S . I just watched the movie on T.V. for the perhaps 30th time and it was the clearest , cleanest print of the BIRDS I'd ever seen . DVD included. One thing that often gets overlooked in a Hitchcock film is the acting. The acting in this film is terrific. It seems static at first but that is perhaps due to the lack of a sound track. During the horrific scenes near the end of the movie the acting is near letter perfect including Tippi Hedren who had never been in a movie before. Her depiction of someone who has been traumatized by birds is one of the most honest pieces of film acting I think I have ever seen. As for the rest ... well let's just say this is a timeless movie that is a treasure for all real movie fans."

","Alfred Hitchcock is arguably the best director ever to make a film. And The Birds is in my opinion his best work, it does something I thought was nearly impossible and beat out Psycho and The Man Who Knew Too Much. The Birds is a magical film adventure that tells the story of a woman named Melanie Danielles who after being on the wrong side of a practical joke goes after the man who did it to play one on him. On her way back from the house she is attacked by a seagull. The man helps her and invites her to dinner. She goes and later they invite her to the mans kid sisters birthday party. At the party the children are attacked by more birds. Later on they are attacked again while at school. Soon The Birds are attacking often and this time are killing as well, and soon they start to take over. This is the fairly simple plot of the Hitchcock masterpiece The Birds. The film does many great things, one is that it never really explains why or how the birds are attacking, that makes it even more scary. The screenplay is also great with amazing dialogue and characters. The acting is also very good, Tippy Hedren in particular is amazing. The direction is flawless, it is perfect. Hitchcock has something he always does. You can have the film on mute and still get the entire story, it is amazing. The visual effects are also surprisingly good for the sixties. Some of them are even very good for today. The Birds is a masterpiece that everyone should see, it is terrifying and bone chilling but most of all just wonderful."

","Esteemed director Alfred Hitchcock's follow up movie after Psycho. The Birds depicts what happens when a coastal town is overtaken by hostile birds. Socialite Tippi Hedren meets handsome Rod Taylor in a bird store. She follows him to the town where he lives with his mother and young daughter. It seems every time Hedren shows up there is some kind of bird attack. She herself is attacked by a gull as she drives a boat across the lake. Why are the birds attacking? Hitchcock and writer Evan Hunter never answer that question. The birds are the ""maguffin"", Hitchcock's term for a plot device to get the story moving but having nothing to do with the actual story.

She follows him to Bodega Bay with a couple of caged ""Love-Birds"" and is herself, followed by flocks of Birds. When I was young and watched this - I thought it was fairly cheesy - with non-convincing special effects - but good for a bit of a squeal. But recently watching it again, from an adult perspective - I found it quite apocalyptic and unsettling in the way it brings up ideas of environmental damage and man against beast.  The way Hitchcock devises tension in this film is quite memorable and fantastic. I love the warped ""Bird"" soundtrack - which just adds to the surrealness of it all.

"malkane316","10","1","2","26 May 2004"," quick reviews!
","SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Hitchcock does it again, by taking a seemingly preposterous situation, and turning it into one of the most impressive, intelligent, tense, and image filled horror movies ever. Tippi has often been accused of not being the greatest actress, but in this she is suitably mysterious as the outsider, at the same time seductive and vulnerable. One look at Jessica Tandy's face is enough to show the viewer that this woman is not wanted in their cosy town. For reasons unknown, Melanie Daniels's arrival heralds the attack of countless birds, ending in death and chaos. It is often assumed that the birds come as a warning about overt female sexuality, as Melanie travels to Bodega to get it on' with Mitch Brenner (Taylor). Whatever the reason, what ensues is a gripping finale as the remaining townsfolk hide in their house, wondering when the next attack will be. The scene in the café, as the town argues over whether a recent bird attack is real or fake, quickly followed by a full scale bird assault. We are ominously told that birds vastly outnumber people. While people fumble around, trying to escape incompetently, the birds of a different feather flock together (very sorry), and work as an unstoppable group. If you kill one, there's a thousand more. The stand out scenes are obvious; the birds gathering on the playground, the attack on the school children, the don't open that door scene', and the final scene, as the humans leave, defeated. The birds themselves are truly remarkable, again making CGI seem very very stupid. Perhaps too slow for some, especially those expecting a fully blown gore and shock fest, but for those who don't mind that kind of thing, it is superb.<br/><br/>10 OUT OF 10"

Fortunately, Hitchcock lets her live longer than he let Janet Leigh.

There is a single bird attack, beautifully directed, during this period.<br/><br/>My children were skeptical about a bunch of birds being a threat; however, the scenes of the mass attacks by the gulls, ravens and sparrows MAKE you believe.<br/><br/>One last thing:  I'm sure that this is often talked about, but I have to say that I was impressed with the sequence in the schoolyard.  The woman is smoking and listening to the children sing as a few crows perch on the playground equipment.  They cut away for a moment and then there are hundreds behind her.

Even Novak comes across more interesting.  Hedren resembles Costner, a prop for events to happen against, rather than a real person. Reaction versus acting.<br/><br/>The assaults, while their instigation is never explained, rank as one of the 10 most eerie cause & effect scenarios in film.

Sure, it is suspenseful, but it doesn't offer anything insightful like ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window"", and the quality of the plot falls short of the likes of ""North by Northwest"".

"jacob rosen","6","1","2","25 October 2001"," Two Films
","Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of the famous Daphne DuMaurier novella is really two films: the first hour sets up a flirtation between rambunctious socialite Tippi Hedren and conservative attorney Rod Taylor; the second hour throws the construction aside to concentrate on random attacks on a small California village by flocks of wild birds. Of course, as with Hitchcock, nothing is unnecessary and the relationship between Hedren and Taylor becomes a family unit in order to rescue unity from chaos. Hitchcock's worldview is extremely dour here (everyone--even children--are subjects of graphic torture) and the conclusion suggests a slow impending doom--it's extremely upsetting to say the least. The first hour, however, is talky and dull. There is no musical score but Bernard Herrmann does have a hand in the sound. Disney pioneer Ub Iwerks is listed as a `Special Photographic Advisor'."
"Kakueke","10","1","2","21 October 2001"," The Birds rules, birds rule
","Superb, original film by Hitchcock, combining a novel horror idea of attacking birds in a somewhat surreal country setting with a very pretty protagonist (or antagonist).  Tippi Hedren's character of Melanie evokes both sympathy and some disdain for her sneakiness, mystery (whatever might lay behind it), and (causation?) throughout the film, and in contrast to ""Psycho,"" things are not resolved.  Attraction exists between Melanie and her beau, but closeness is deterred with a mutual feeling of distrust and suspicion, cleverly developed by Hitchcock.  While the characters --townspeople etc. -- are somewhat understated, as appropriate in most horror films, their psychology and interplay are well done, almost brilliant.  The color is subtly essential to this movie just as black & white is to Psycho.  But ultimately, the film is for the birds, ever ominous and on the offensive.

","'The Birds' gets you involved with the story right away as the camera follows Tippi Hedren into a pet store where she makes an inquiry about love birds. Next, she meets Rod Taylor and we immediately sense that there will be a growing bond between them that will lead to a bird attack of some sort. After that, Hitch slowly builds the suspense, climaxing midway with a gas station scene in which an expert on bird behavior (Ethel Griffies) expounds on her theories before a vicious attack outside the diner silences her. The most brilliant touch of all occurs during the schoolhouse scene with Hedren seated outside waiting for her teacher friend (Suzanne Pleshette). Unknown to her, birds are quietly lining up on the telephone wires and elsewhere, looking like ominous creatures against the sky. Other scenes are equally scary--particularly when the birds even attack by coming down the chimney--with the final attack occurring when Tippi Hedren climbs the steps to the attic. A gripping film, slow in starting as characters are introduced, but masterfully directed for the maximum of suspense once the birds start attacking. Definitely a ""must see"" for any fan of Hitchcock films. The color photography of Bodega Bay and surrounding areas is excellent. Missing is a Bernard Herrmann background score--but the flapping of wings does nicely!"
"The_Movie_Cat","8","1","2","18 December 1999"," The pinnacle of underachievement from the most overrated director of all time.
","The fifty-fourth film of Hitchcock's 59-strong career as a director (out of which only 20 or so are really well-known), I will commit film heresy by lumping this one together with `The Big Sleep' and `The Exorcist' as examples of films that are vastly overlauded by the movie critic industry. Psycho is a worthwhile piece of work, and IS well-shot, though others  such as the middle-brow, clumsy exposition of North By Northwest  are vaguely above average and surely not worthy of such high praise?<br/><br/>Reappraisal for weak films happens all the time and I feel certain that this should happen in reverse. The Birds may have worked in 1963, when its overlaid pictures of flying birds and feeble puppetry looked convincing. But without such sophistication in a 90s context, the attention is instead drawn to the script and acting, and that is where it clearly falls down. Okay, maybe I come from the Robert DeNiro method school and would have liked the birds in question to have had some motivation, rather than `let's just peck people for the hell of it'. But even extracting that argument away from this film, it still falls on many levels. The dialogue is a stilted, stylised set, with deliberately encouraged underplaying by the cast, Jessica Tandy particularly. This would be fine in another film, but in one as bizarre as this it means we are left with no sense of reality.<br/><br/>There are the silly bits, of course, such as the two (laughably fake) budgerigars that sit on the car floor and bend in time with the bends in the road. Okay, I will refrain from making pathetic puns about this film `giving me the bird' and the bird in question being a turkey. All I will say is that this film would not be accepted from any other director. It is a cheap, low-brow exploitation picture that takes its audience for granted and shows them no respect in return. From any other director this one would be regarded as pulp horror of the cheep, sorry, cheapest variety. But at date of writing this one is ranked 222 in the IMDb top 250."

","Spoilers!<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is still a star for this film (recent SF film festival promo commerical paid trib. with a Bird's take-off and a Hedren stand in actress). We see 'Hitch's intro to the thing, with the sort of 'environmentalist' apologetic against man's exploitation of anything fowl.<br/><br/>Given that, the bird's attack cause . . . they're mad, basically. No more turkey dinners. No more aviaries. No more producing tons of eggs that just go bad anyway on the store shelves, anyway. The bird's are fed up and just aren't gonna take . . . well - 'nother movie.<br/><br/>Basically, it's an adaptation of the 50s monster movies. The monster gets loose, authorities are slow to react, to see the larger picture. They run through hoops to explain the evidence. Eventually the army gets called in - save in the other films you saw the jeeps and trucks rolling - here it's just reported on the radio, toward the end.<br/><br/>The birds rampage the town, then chill for awhile, then rampage, chill, rampage, and so on. People get cut up, killed, eyes get pecked out, and so on. Pretty bloody for early 60s. There are just some classic scenes, of course, borrowed and parodied so often since. The bird gather on the jungle gym next to the schoolhouse, as Tippi sits there oblivious. Tippi and kids run in panic as the jungle gym birds alight and swoop down on them. Tippi heads for phone booth as the birds attack the town - birds smash into the glass of said booth. And, of course, the final scene where they slowly drive off, to get Tippi some professional (medical) help, amid thousands of birds just quietly milling around outside the battered homestead, getting up the strength to set off again.<br/><br/>It's different from the other monster attacks movies in that you don't see the army in control, and the monsters vanquished. It's sort of left up in the air (no pun intended) - the big question mark (literally) at the end of some of those films. Did the army successfully rout the birds? Was it a worldwide conspiracy or phenomenon? Did things get back to normal, or was it the beginning of the end for humanity?<br/><br/>Of course, you wonder how the birds could be so intimidating and powerful. Can an angry seagull, even a bunch of them, really do battle with someone holding so much as a baseball bat? I don't know. Blackbirds, ravens - maybe. They seem big with their wings spread. But tons of sparrows? That has to have been a little bit of a joke.<br/><br/>Anyhow."
"villani","Null","1","2","2 April 2002"," A lesson on woman's proper role
","The macguffin' in Alfred's Hitchcock's The Birds is really not a mystery after all. The birds' behavior and their attacks are used to represent the various threats posed to the town by Melanie's sexuality and solitude. In this respect, the birds are representative of Melanie. However, in their eventual attack on her, the birds represent an extension of Lydia's will to make Melanie embrace her proper and acceptable role as a woman. The lovebirds serve as that ideal of proper womanhood that Melanie has attained by the final scene of the film.<br/><br/>Hitchcock establishes the link between the birds and Melanie's sexuality the first time she steps onto the scene. The birds begin to caw immediately after some ogling men whistle at her, foreshadowing the future encounters between the birds and humans caused by her sexuality. However, while in San Francisco there is no actual contact between the two, as exemplified by her unsuccessful attempt to catch a canary for Mitch. This is because Melanie poses no threat to Lydia's conception of an acceptable female while in San Francisco. It is only in Bodega Bay that Melanie becomes a threat and the subsequent attacks occur. Hitchcock further links Melanie to the birds in order to demonstrate that what is acceptable in the city, namely Melanie's solitude and freedom, is not acceptable in Bodega Bay. While she is in the bird shop during the first scenes, she laments that the `poor, innocent birds' are enclosed in cages, until one lone bird, representing her, does in fact fly free. Mitch catches and subdues that bird, as he would later catch a subdued Melanie. In these instances, Hitchcock establishes a strong link between Melanie's sexuality and solitude with birds.<br/><br/>These characteristics pose a threat to the town, and the birds' behavior and attacks demonstrate what those threats are. When the sparrows come down the chimney and destroy the house, it signifies Melanie's role as a home wrecker' if she should take Mitch away from his mother. The death of the first man is similarly close to Lydia. His death, significantly with his eyes plucked out, signifies fear of the gaze and the sexual attraction that Melanie elicits from men, especially Mitch. The birds' attack on the man in the boat is an attack on his livelihood, thus on male stability. The attack on the children coming from school signifies a disruption of the family ideal. Women are not meant to be sexual objects, but rather nurturing mothers. When the birds attack the man pumping oil, much more of the town is affected and destroyed, because Melanie's threat to the family has grown. She has insinuated herself into their lives by saving Cathy and helping Lydia in bed. It becomes Lydia's will to put Melanie in her place, and Hitchcock represents this lesson with the birds. <br/><br/>Because Lydia is scared that Mitch will leave her for the love of another woman, she metaphorically picks' at Melanie until she is as subdued and non-demonstrative as the lovebirds. The viewer knows Lydia mistrusts Melanie because of her outright declaration in the kitchen to Mitch. Following this first encounter, birds line the telephone wires as Melanie drives to Annie's. Further foreshadowing the attack on Melanie at the climax is the gull that swoops down on her when she first goes beyond the bounds of acceptable female etiquette. After she accepts an invitation to the party because she is interested in Mitch, a bird flies into the front door despite a full moon. As Melanie comes closer to the ideal, becoming more subdued and helpful to Lydia and Cathy during crisis, the birds attack and kill Annie since it is now her pining presence that is a threat to any serious relationship forming between Mitch and Melanie. However, just as Lydia is still wary of the lovebirds, and keeps them in the kitchen, she is also still not comfortable with Melanie. The birds attack Melanie in the attic with viciousness and Mitch has to save the helpless and disheveled Melanie from them. In an effort to drive her out of town, it is obvious that Melanie has not only gained Mitch's love, but also Lydia's acceptance. The lovebirds in the car, and peace of the birds right outside the house, attest to the proper role of women as desexualized, since Melanie is disheveled, and dependent on man and the family structure. <br/><br/>The birds in this film actually have a very symbolic and predictable role in establishing the moral. Sexual and solitary women are acceptable in the city, but are very threatening to the family structure of a small town like Bodega Bay. The birds are both linked to Melanie's character to symbolize the threat she poses, and to her ultimate downfall to symbolize the proper non-demonstrative role of a woman."

I thought that ""The Birds"" was a job well done for the 60's and was still scary in the 90's<br/><br/>""The Birds"" would be a great movie to remake in the 90's.  With all the technology and special effects we have today the movie would be extremely scary and gory."

","Nothing like the book. Yet Hitchcock was suppose to be a fan.The book does not need altering for dramatic effect, true is is written by an English Lady and set in England, but it could be set in the USA as still keep true.Both end with no conclusion, but in the book it is a wide spread attack, possibly the whole world, making the danger far greater than the film, where most attacks are only at that bay. Of course there is no glamorous blonde in the book, but instead centers around a married man trying to keep his wife and children safe. The film is set in summer, where as the book in winter, Hitchcock also added an attractive school teacher and townsfolk, all not in the book.So you lose the isolation of the farm where the family live. The film is fine if you don't know the story, and I admit I quite enjoyed it, but please don't see it as a work by Daphne Du Maurier as it is not her story."
"jacksflicks","7","2","7","5 July 2001"," Not as Good as the Rating
","I guess the people who give this a high rating are those who have bought into the self-promotion and Hitchcock hype over the years.  The generous rating for ""The Birds"" seems to bear this out.  An interesting ""what if"" premise is spoiled by the incessant lapses in logic and cheesy special effects.<br/><br/>The Bodega Bay setting is lovely and the characters attractive, if a little dim.  As is typical with Hitchcock, the pacing is excellent and the shots well framed; and the editing is excellent, as indeed it must be to fake so much of the action.<br/><br/>Whatever their ulterior motives, and I have little doubt they have them, the Motion Picture Academy was correct in never bestowing an Oscar on Hitchcock. Most of his films are entertaining, but few of them, such as ""Foreign Correspondent,"" ""Dial M for Murder,"" and ""Frenzy,"" are very good."

","This is one of the most terrifying films I have seen in years, and what's great about it is that it's a work by one of the greatest cinema directors, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. The story is that Melanie Daniels (introducing Golden Globe nominated Tippi Hedren) meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a bird shop where is trying to buy love birds for his little sister's birthday. So Melanie decides to take some to him herself. Suddenly before returning to shore after delivering the birds she is attacked. Not long after birds start to attack many other innocent people, until finally the entire town of Bodega Bay is overrun by these horrifying birds. A gripping story with some blood involved and some very good effects. Hitchcock himself said that this is probably his most terrifying film ever! Also starring Driving Miss Daisy's Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner, Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth, Alien's Veronica Cartwright as Cathy Brenner, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man leaving the pet shop with two white Sealyham terriers past Hedren. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!"

","Dazed and confused by the pure brilliance of Hitchcock's greatest film, many critics sank to the cheap shot evaluation ""It's for the birds,"" and thus undercut the initial box office for this picture. The laugh would come later as THE BIRDS scored whammy ratings over and over, every time it was played on TV, for decades. Based on a razor thin short story, Hitchcock elaborated into a multi-teared suspense drama juxtaposed with the strongly drawn romantic relationship between Tippi Hedrin and Rod Taylor. Hitchcock was the ""master of suspense"" but how many other of his films can match the raw suspense, hitting the viewer over and over, of this masterpiece. The answer is zero. PSYCHO's asset was shock; THE BIRDS was suspense. From the initial single bird attack at the docks of Bodega Bay, to the brilliant scenes at the schoolyard, to the unparalleled fear inside the boarded-up house, no other Hitchcock film even came close regarding suspense. The scene censored from early TV screenings, running 1.5 seconds, where Jessica Tandy enters her neighbor's farmhouse and finds him dead --- the fact that they'd cut 1.5 seconds says it all. The romance has real magic to it, and Hitchcock succeeds with this despite the absence of his trademark heavy-necking scene. Finally, the suspense factor obviously is gone after the first viewing; nonetheless this film stands up tall for multiple replays. An absolute classic."

","The Birds starts in a San Francisco pet store where rich socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is about to pick up a Mynah bird for her aunt when a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) decides to play a joke on her & assume she's a shop assistant. Taken back by Mitch's charm & sense of humour Melanie decides to track him down & calls in a favour to find out where he lives, it turns out that Mitch spends every weekend at a small coastal town called Bodega Bay & drives down there herself where she meets his mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy) & younger sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). Mitch & Melanie fall for each other but find Lydia opposed to the relationship, meanwhile the birds in Bodega Bay have been acting strangely. At first it was the odd isolated attack but it has grown into full scale destruction as huge flocks of birds attack anybody they come across...<br/><br/>Produced & directed by Alfred Hitchcock & loosely based on the short story by Daphne Du Maurier The Birds has an imposing reputation, the sort of reputation that gives it classic status, unfortunately I must admit that I didn't actually like The Birds that much for several reasons. The biggest reason why I didn't like The Birds is because it's so slow, during the first fifty odd minutes next to nothing happens & for me the silly romantic game of cat & mouse between Melanie & Mitch just wasn't enough to maintain my interest & when Lydia the mother got involved I was wondering if anything was going to happen at all. To it's credit The Birds does pick up for the second half but it's a little bit too late to save the film, while I understand about the deliberate way The Birds builds up with just the odd attack or the odd gathering of birds during the first hour or so but that still didn't make it any more enjoyable with it's dreary romantic subplot that dominates the first half. At almost two hours long it felt like an effort to reach the end which it shouldn't have. The script is rather ambiguous, no solid explanation is given to the bird attacks, no explanation is given as to why Bodega Bay is the center of the attacks & there's that nothing sort of ending which neither has the birds or humanity triumphant so in effect there's no cause or resolution & the whole film feels a bit empty. Undeniably influential & much loved I can actually see where they are coming from but The Birds just didn't do much for me, sorry.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was a master of his art, of that there is no doubt & even here in The Birds there are some terrific individual moments like the flock of black Crow's gathering on school playground climbing frames behind Melanie or an aerial shot of Bodega Bay after an explosion that starts off clear but soon dozens of Gull's have flapped into view & head straight for the town or the final attack on Melanie. The setting is nice & Bodega Bay has turned up in another couple of horror films The Fog (1980) & Puppetmaster (1989). The Birds hasn't dated too badly, sure some of the fashions & cars have but the special effects are quite good & the locations still probably look like this even now. There's a bit of blood & there's a dead body with it's eyes pecked out, but it's only seen briefly & the amount of character's that smoke in The Birds is very noticeable as they light up at every opportunity. Oddly there is no musical soundtrack to The Birds, one of the few films not to feature any incidental music.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $2,500,000 The Birds has great production values & decent effects for it's time, filmed on location at Bodega Bay & back at Universal Studios in Los Angeles. The acting is pretty good, Tippi Hedren (who is the mother of actress Melanie Griffith) & Rod Taylot make a nice enough couple & play off each other with a sense of humour.<br/><br/>The Birds is a film that I just couldn't get into, while I appreciate it's strong points of which there are a few the negatives completely swamp them & turn what could have been a great film into a dreary & boring one with no sense of reason or resolution behind it. A made for television sequel The Birds II: Land's End (1994) was apparently crap enough for original director Rick Rosenthal to have his name removed from the credits & replaced with the standard Alan Smithee."
"g61268-1","3","2","9","30 July 2017"," I don't get it.
","The first half of The Birds is a dull, soap-opera-y story involving Rod Taylor, his soon-to-be-girlfriend Tippi Hedren, his cold mother Jessica Tandy, sister Veronica Cartwright and ex-girlfriend Suzanne Pleshette. It might as well have been lifted from another film since it has nothing to do with the birds.<br/><br/>In fact, the birds don't begin their attacks until about fifty minutes into the movie. When they do there are some genuinely scary moments, although of course the special effects look rather dated today, even the fake blood doesn't quite look like the correct shade of red. We're never told why the birds behave this way, which makes the film pretty intellectually unsatisfying. They just start killing people for apparently no reason.<br/><br/>Finally, after witnessing much death and destruction, Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren leave town, but the birds are still hanging around en masse, ready to attack more people. I half expected a title card reading, ""End of Part One"", but no — that was the whole movie.<br/><br/>This film is called a classic by the critics. But most of the time I was bored, waiting for something to happen, and even when the bird attacks came, I couldn't help asking myself, ""so when do we find out why they're doing this?"""
"andrewmerritt-31652","5","1","3","7 August 2019"," Not Hitchcock's best film
","The Birds stars Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film follows Melanie Daniels who decides to pursue a relationship with a criminal defense attorney at Bodega Bay. But her plans are cut short when a group of birds attack her and the residence of Bodega Bay. As much as I love a good Hitchcock movie, I have to say that this one is not his best. Don't get me wrong getting terrorized by a flock of birds is pretty scary and having them perched on your house, car, to just about anywhere is creepy and eerie. This movie however can't make up its mind on whether it's a romance or a horror movie. This film does provide great acting, dialogue, sound mixing, but where was the score? I understand that Hitchcock wants to give us a good scare but having no music for a two hour movie gets to be pretty boring and awkward at times. The music does work during the last hour of the movie, but before that happens we're left in that awkward state of mind if anything is going to scare us. So in the end, while this film does provide some creepy eerie scenes, the movie misses its target that gives us a two film where the first half is romance and the other half provides the horror. And this would've been perfect had the two found a middle ground instead of giving us a confusing film."

","THE BIRDS is a mysterious horror drama about an inexplicable conflict between the innocent creatures and the greatest enemy of nature. It is loosely based on the 1952 story of the same name by Daphne du Maurier.<br/><br/>The main protagonist is a young woman, who is known for compacting inappropriate jokes and misbehavior in public. One day, she meets a charming lawyer in a San Francisco bird shop. He wants to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his sister's eleventh birthday, but the shop has none. He had seen her in court once before when her recklessness resulted in the breaking of a plate glass window, but she does not know him. He plays a prank by pretending to mistake her for a salesperson. After his departure, she becomes curious and decides to know him better. She finds his weekend address in Bodega Bay, purchases a pair of lovebirds, and makes the long drive to deliver them. The two of them meet again. However, something else is in the air ...<br/><br/>Mr. Hitchcock has replaced his traditional tense story with an extreme mystery. He has, through a bizarre apocalyptic atmosphere, a frivolous romance and an idyllic life philosophy, made a symbolic game of destruction. His allegory, in which good and evil are a sort of metaphor, is excellent. The story is intriguing and unfortunately average, but the direction is very good.<br/><br/>Hitch plays with visual effects and sound elements. He constantly enhances his horror, through scenes of massacred bodies, explosions and hysteria. The protagonists are constantly exposed to danger and none of them are safe. The fear has changed their character. A psychological or just logical explanation, that is cause of animal attacks, is absent.<br/><br/>Characterization is good, while the performances is a bit wooden.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels is a beautiful and dangerous blonde. She is the main carrier of a danger and reason at the same time. She is an exotic phenomenon in an idyllic landscape. The term ""heroine"" is perhaps too strong, but her performance indicates that notion. Rod Taylor as Mitchell ""Mitch"" Brenner is her support and better segment of their romance. His character is torn by three women. Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner is confused, lost and frightened in a complex role of a mother. Suzanne Pleshette as Annie Hayworth is a bit sinister and jealous as an ex-girlfriend, but her performance is the most realistic in this movie.<br/><br/>Maestro has offered a bit ""malicious"" end."
"zkonedog","8","1","3","11 March 2017"," Hitchcock Goes Paranormal
","Usually, master film director Alfred Hitchcock used the psychological approach to filmmaking, crafting thrillers that preyed on deep-seated fears or tension-filled situations. With ""The Birds"", however, Hitch actually delves into the paranormal a trifle in order to work his cinematic magic.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Birds"" sees young socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), on a vacation in Bodega Bay, become suddenly smitten by local boy Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). However, as the two begin to mingle, the small island town is suddenly beset by bird attacks both large and small, seemingly without reason.<br/><br/>As usual, this film is such a classic because of Hitchcock's ability to create tension. By the title alone, the viewer knows that birds will play a large role in this film, so in the early-goings Hitch uses certain scenes/images to foreshadow what is to come. Basically, as a viewer, you know what is going to happen...you just don't know when or from where!<br/><br/>The acting in this movie also really stands out. Hedren and Taylor are solid, while supporters such as Jessica Tandy and a young Veronica Cartwright turn in fine performances as well.<br/><br/>About the only criticism I have (aka why I can't give it 5 stars) is of the ending, which many will find quite polarizing. Let's just say that, depending on your point of view, a lot of character development may have circled the drain upon the film's conclusion.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is a solid film that deserves a place among Hitchcock's best."

The plot is based on a pathetic love story which involves Mitch and Melanie.

However, an attack of birds is creative and original compared to the other typical horror movies, which is a good point.

Even if the film ends too early as if it was cut, the plot is really original and passionate. The actors are well chosen, Mitch (Rod Taylor) is the man for the job. Althrough the film we can feel a tense atmosphere, particularly when Melanie (Tippi Hedren) climbs the stairs to look into the bedroom. The story is very absorbing, but the movie is too short !

The suspense created in these scenes will have you either holding your breath or screaming at the screen for the characters to wake up.<br/><br/>The wooden performances, especially Hedren, are irrelevant to the artistry that is Hitchcock that makes this classic a film that gave me nightmares for months and to this day, I still get very nervous when I see 3 or more birds gather in one location."

Hitchcock thought he was only making a ""B"" movie, but when the critics saw it they thought that Hitchcock is too good for making ""The Birds"" a ""B"" movie. So it now means that ""The Birds"" went from a ""B"" movie to an ""A"" movie. That is very much like when Steven Spielberg thought he was making ""Jaws"" a ""B"" movie, but it wasn't. I thought the story was great and it really works that there is no need to explain why the birds are attacking and killing people. This suspense of this movie really works, and does its job to not make things laughable. ""The Birds"" does keep you on the edge of your seat and wonder if the birds will attack and kill people. There is no music by Bernard Herrmann in this movie, but it does make it more effective when you only hear sounds like birds and such. The special effects in this movie are great, and they do a great job to get the birds into frame when they are attacking. However, I will admit that some of the projector screens are good and some are not, but that is just only a minor nitpick. The cast did wonderful in this movie. I give props to Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, and a young Veronica Cartwright. ""The Birds"" is one of the most shocking and terrifying movies ever made. I give a 10 out of 10."

Hitchcock is an amazing director and he creates a perfect example for us of his amazing talent every time he made a movie. There is no wonder why he is called the master of suspense, The Birds has suspense building right from the start of the movie all the way to the climax and even in the falling action we see compounded horror and suspense of these birds. The special effects are considered ""campy"" now and that takes away a little bit of the intended horror that the audience is supposed to be in shock at.

","The Birds failed to make it on the American Film Institute's list of one hundred greatest American movies, but nonetheless, it has still been influential. A true horror movie, The Birds inspired such films as Jaws, and is unique among Hitchcock films because, unlike others, which rely on psychological horror, The Birds is graphic, violent and terrifying. The plot follows a young woman (Tippi Hedron) as she journeys to a tiny village in northern California called Bodega Bay. It seems like an average small town until a bizarre event happens. Formerly peaceable birds suddenly begin attacking people without provocation. The first attack is nothing more than a knick from a seagull but larger swarms of birds begin to strike to kill and nobody can figure out the cause of such violence. The Birds makes use of some innovative filming techniques to capture the vicious scenes but Hitchcock was not above putting his actors in danger in order to get a shot. Most notably, the final attack scene was all real and live birds were used. The Birds is a good film but not necessarily a great one. It is a movie that seems to focus on the horror and intensity of the attacks rather than the logic behind them. Thus, the plot suffers and is not as strong as the story lines of previous Hitchcock films (although the plots of most Hitchcock movies seem to fall apart if over analyzed anyway.) The film also seemed to lack the star power of Hitchcock's previous movies. In its most primitive development, Hitchcock had wanted The Birds to star Cary Grant and Grace Kelly but the former was aging and the latter had married Prince Rainier of Monaco and had retired from acting. So, Hitchcock ended up with Rod Taylor and a rookie Tippi Hedron."

"Fordrickwoodmann","10","1","3","6 June 2013"," Dark, Large, and fundamentally Hitchcokian.
","Continuing with his Birds and Mothers themes carried over from his previous movie ""Psycho"", Hitchcock went all out for what is one of his goriest, and most disturbing films. He combined the visceral violence of ""Psycho"" with the large set pieces of ""North by Northwest"" creating a paranoid and frantic thriller, which successfully turns a mundane creature into a frightening nightmare. <br/><br/>The Story starts, as many Hitchcock films before it, with the introduction of a young blonde woman. Although Tippi Hendren was a poor replacement for Grace Kelly, she performs adequately in the role of an initially shallow young woman. Much has been said of Hitchcock's treatment of hair during production, and Hendren herself has made some particularly libelous statements. But whatever he did, it managed to illicit of truly fearful performance during the more integral moments of the film. <br/><br/>The Bird motif is established early on, as the first scene takes place in a Bird Shop where they're all caged and harmless, a condition which evidently changes as the film goes on. As the woman decides to pursue a man, a drama story is established, as she contends with his mother and integrates herself with his family and the town of Bodega Bay. Alongside this is the increasing intensity of Bird attacks, until eventually the focus of the story shifts to this in the final act. The slow and meticulous unraveling of the story not only allows for Hitchcock to drum up suspense, it also means that when the characters are under the most extreme threat we have spent a lot of time with them, and know them inside and out. This means that we feel every hit that they take, as well as making us more fearful for them. <br/><br/>The choice of Hitchcock to not use a traditional soundtrack, despite having Bernard Herman at his disposal, was an inspired one. The cawing of the Birds is a grating and piercing noise, and is more relevant to the content of the film than a traditional horror score. The film looks beautiful, the camera captures the picturesque nature of the setting perfectly,and it is filled with strong primary colours. These 2 things make it a major departure from ""Psycho"" and shows what a pioneering and innovative director Hitchcock was, always looking to change and challenge himself, while still employing his tried and tested techniques of drumming up tension and suspense. <br/><br/>This is an excellent thriller, and you'll likely never look at Birds the same way again."

To me now, this movie is a lot more frightening than other ""scary"" movies I've seen. I think what makes it more terrifying than a monster flick, is because we all know that monsters aren't real. At least the traditional ones. But birds ARE real. The birds that were used in this movie still exist and are everywhere. What could be more frightening than something that is so ordinary, in nature, suddenly turning its back on us? It's really very unsettling.<br/><br/>I think they did a great job casting this movie, every actor fit their part. No one seemed or looked oddly misplaced. A couple scenes seemed oddly edited for me, though. Almost like they suddenly skipped over or the sound would happen before a scene.

","It's possible that none of Hitchcock's movies have inspired so much passionate debate as this late-career entry in the animal horror genre. You have everything in the spectrum from those who believe that it's a subtle psycho-sexual allegory to those who believe that it's a ridiculously stupid movie about birds attacking people. I'd have to place myself somewhere in the middle of that debate, although at one point in time I'd have fallen more into the latter camp.<br/><br/>What I like about the movie is Hitchcock's wicked dark humor. The whole scene in the restaurant, beginning with this ludicrous conversation about birds attacking children and ending with the offended woman screaming ""YOU'RE EVIL!"" at the leading lady, is just incredibly funny to me. There's of course the guy in the corner who keeps saying, ""It's the end of the world"" at the worst possible moments. It's a fantastic scene that includes the film's most stirring action sequence (an exploding gas station, the heroine attacked in a phone booth) as a sort of main course in the midst of the black comedy.<br/><br/>The film does have problems in my opinion. The leading lady and leading man, Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor, might as well be made of cardboard for all their ability to emote. They have no chemistry and the Howard Hawks-ish way they are introduced is almost patronizing to the audience. Jessica Tandy is much stronger as the clinging mother. The sequences with Suzanne Pleschette and Hedren, indeed most of the scenes in the first half of the movie, are tedious. The effects were laughable the day they were released, because Hitchcock overuses rear projection and shows quite a bit too much of the bird attacks for them to remain plausible.<br/><br/>On the whole however, I'm more positive about this film than I was when I first watched it all the way through a decade ago. I think that the film works very well as a sort of dark comedy about how seriously we take ourselves. I like the fact that the cause of the bird attacks is never explained. It never descends into that sort of literalism that people like Steven King who were obviously inspired by this film tend to succumb to. But that really doesn't mean that the film is an allegory. I would prefer to think of the film as being on the level. I think all the stuff about the main character's mother complex and his budding romance with the Hedren character are basically given a lot of emphasis so that we can easily see how trivial it all is in the face of a massive bird attack. It's precisely the unexplained nature of the phenomenon that makes it so compelling. If you were to say that a giant radioactive cloud had infected these birds, the movie would lose all of its power. To me, the movie works on some level because there is such a strong disconnect between the ""drama"" going on with the characters and the horrific events with the birds. To try to draw these distinct threads of the movie too close together through symbolism actually undermines the essential strength of the film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Maybe that was Hitchcock's goal, I really can't say. We want so hard to understand the cause of the bird attacks, to somehow make it match up or fit with the human drama, that we can create these connections ourselves. In doing so however, we're no more sophisticated nor any less laughable than the hysterical mother who accuses Tippi Hedren of being evil, who stretches so far to find the cause of the attacks herself."

","""The Birds"" is slightly overrated but still a really entertaining film.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Trying to get a rare bird, Melanie Daniels, (Tippi Hedren) is shown up in a prank by Mitchell Brenner, (Rod Taylor) and tracks him to Bodega Bay, a small coastal community. Arriving there, they try to kindle a romance only for a series of strange series attacks by birds. Joined by his mother Lydia Brenner, (Jessica Tandy) and his younger sister Cathy, (Veronica Cartwright) for her birthday party, they get a chance to know each other better. After a couple more, even stranger attacks from the birds, they start to think that the birds are attacking the community. When they finally decide to launch a war against mankind, the remaining town-members fight back to save themselves and understand why they have begin acting like they are.<br/><br/>The Good News: This was a really good film with a lot to really like about it. The best feature is the idea of unending terror without a given reasoning behind how these birds got this way. This tends to make the understanding of this movie really dependent on viewer, and it works for the better because the audience doesn't really need to know that. Birds are attacking and killing people and, instead of worrying about what is causing it, the characters just need to worry about surviving. That allows for a dramatic increase in the terror, since the survival matters more and can pay out to better effect. This also has an added bonus factor in that the birds that attack the humans aren't birds of prey but rather an assortment of ordinary everyday birds. That's what makes the attacks all the more frightening, as a regular bird seen everyday instills more terror than those that aren't interacting with them on a daily basis. It gives off a realistic vibe that connects, making the randomness of the events that much more horrific. That the big reason for the film's success lies in it's superb attacks aren't all that odd either. Most notable is the entire diner sequence, where a long conversation about the impossibility of the event is broken when they start unleashing their assault. There's the scene inside a phone-booth where the film traps us within the confines of the booth whilst birds ram the glass to try and break in. You can feel the claustrophobia there as there is no escape until the attack subsides, and the ferocity of the birds to break in is explicitly shown in the repeated attempts to get in. It's a long, drawn-out scene with a lot more action than normal for such a scene, as it plays out in spectacular fashion and gets a lot of time to do so. Another attack that really works is the one on the school children. With every new shot of them climbing the frame outside, there are a few more birds waiting until the camera takes you outside to see that it's completely covered in birds. When they decide to take flight, the sheer amount of birds is simply awe-inspiring, and the relentless, remorseless attack is brutal and bloody, making that it's about school-children even more frightening. The pecking and scratching is seen there, and it delivers the shock required. The single best, though, is the final assault in the climax, where their ferociousness is seen first-hand in their unending attempt to get inside. Pecking through doors, crashing through windows, and trying to eat at exposed body parts with determination, it sells them wonderfully, and the second encounter is just simply brutal. This also starts the best possible way, where a single, weird coincidence gradually grows by leaps and bounds by each encounter, with the final one the best one. That's the way it should work, and help make this a spectacular entry.<br/><br/>The Bad News: This really doesn't have a whole lot, but there is a few problems. The biggest one is the general pacing, which is rather off. The romantic subplot takes up the first fifty minutes before any sort of prolonged attack occurs, leaving the first half really slow-going. That it also contains numerous scenes of talking that leads nowhere also takes up a lot of time. The most obvious ones, where the two girls discuss past dating history, and the girlfriend and mother discuss what happened before they even knew each other are just prime examples. The answers and topics aren't brought up again, and while cementing the relationships, they drag the film out needlessly. At the very least, they could've been trimmed substantially and still kept their overall intent intact. There's also some problems with the special effects, which are, for the most part, pretty bad. The live birds do fine, but are inserted into the scenes so haphazardly that it's so obvious it's a special effect that it takes you out of the scene. There's numerous shots too many to mention where the birds don't come off anywhere near realistically, even if the action itself is spectacular. These hamper the film the most, and are it's main weaknesses.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: While it is overrated a tad, this is still a very enjoyable film that has a lot to offer for fans. Most of the nit-picks are easily avoidable and might not even make a dent in viewing, leaving this open to classic horror fans or those looking for a different kind of creature feature altogether.<br/><br/>Today's Rating-PG-13: Violence and children-in-danger"
"drownnnsoda","10","1","3","20 November 2007"," Classic Chiller With An Apocalyptic Feel.
","""The Birds"" is about a San Francisco woman named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), a flirtatious woman who meets a charming man, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a bird shop of all places. Melanie decides to pursue Mitch and follows him to the rural seaside community of Bodega Bay, where Melanie stays with Mitch and his frantic mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). But the calm town of Bodega Bay has no idea what it's in for, when birds begin savagely attacking for no reason - swooping from the sky and chasing, flapping, and pecking people to death, causing chaos among the city - is it possible for Melanie to survive the birds?<br/><br/>Most of today's modern audiences would look at this film and likely laugh, deeming the plot ridiculous, which is understandable. I'd assume there wasn't a scary bone in the entire film as well. But if you really put some thought into it, you'll understand just how scary it would be if our feathered friends actually came down from the sky and started attacking us - it's a scary concept. Loosely based on a story by Daphne DuMaurier, the script is adapted with little in common with the story besides the fact that birds are randomly attacking people. However, the crafting of the story is well done and the writing is really great - I think that the writers did a solid job making their own tale out of it.<br/><br/>The special effects are a bit dated in moments, but in others I was surprised how well-done they were, especially considering the time. One thing I really liked about this film that stood out to me was its atmosphere. The film has an overall apocalyptic undercurrent that runs through all of it. The man versus nature scenario gives the film an end-of-the-world type feel, as well as a communal sense of fear and will of survival (which is brought through clearly in the restaurant scene). It's all very greatly done, and I was on the edge of my seat, to my surprise. Hitchcock was a clever filmmaker, and he uses countless camera tricks and allusions which are really genius.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren, mother of actress Melanie Griffith, leads our cast as the playful, stylish California girl who ends up caught in a terrifying and random situation. Rod Taylor plays Mitch well, and Jessica Tandy is great as his semi-looney mother. A young Veronica Cartwright is interesting to see as well. Sure, the acting is hammy at times, but not enough so to take the film down. I was stunned by the end of this movie, because of how ambiguous it was, and how it failed to resolve much. It leaves you with more questions than answers, and you have no idea why what was happening was. Some may take this as a good or bad thing, but I personally love it when films do that, so I appreciated it immensely.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Birds"" is a great little thriller from the early '60s that is one of Hitchock's best-known works. The simplicity and randomness of its story is what makes it so powerful, and it manages to pack a doomsday-feel throughout, closing without ever really resolving (in this case, the ambiguity is a good thing of course). If you don't like birds to begin with, I'd advise you to steer clear of this movie. But if you enjoy man versus nature type scenarios, then it's a great treat. For whatever reason it may be, ""The Birds"" is one of those few films that I feel like watching whenever, wherever, no matter what. 10/10."
"Sylviastel","9","1","3","11 November 2007"," When Birds go Wild!!!
","The Birds is a Hitchcock classic but I never understood why the birds attacked people in the first place. After all, they can go anywhere thanks to their flying capabilities. Tippi Hedren plays the female who travels to a small Northern California town from San Francisco to deliver love birds to a young girl played by Veronica Cartwright who becomes a great actress as an adult as she was a child. My biggest complaint is why the birds go mad in the first place. I admire Hitchcock for all his genius but I never get an answer and it's still an enjoyable movie. Maybe we just have to figure it out for ourselves or maybe we should stop abusing our habitat. The supporting cast includes Morgan Brittany, Darlene Conley, and Suzanne Pleshette as a school teacher."

","This one starts out slowly, but that's just to get you in the mood to have yourself creeped out all the way. It'll be a little while before you can look to the skies and appreciate the birds for their beauty and song, rather than in suspicion and a certain level of wariness.<br/><br/>The performances are riveting, the atmosphere is high, and the payoff is magnificent. Jessica Tandy, Tippi Hedron, Suzanne Pleshette, and Rod Taylor. If you're a fan of suspense, creature features, or Hitchcock, this is a must-see.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.3/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Sir Alfred did a great job on this film. Tippi Hedren only did one other film with him (Marne) but this one is more effective because its makes you uncomfortable with seemingly normal circumstances. Hedren's best work in any film that I have seen is here. Grace Kelly is reported to have turned down this role as being not right for a Princess.<br/><br/>The film kind of leaves the viewer open to interpretation as to why the birds behave as they do. Is it related to the way the love birds are treated by Hedren? Is it something else? Is it nature suddenly rebelling against humans? The special effects scenes are so realistic as to UN-nerve someone viewing the film for the first time. The amount of work going into this film by the film makers really shows on the screen. Hitch wanted to end this movie with the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge loaded with birds. The studio said no, too expensive & difficult to do.<br/><br/>It is a bit longer than some Hitchcock films, but worth the extra length. The sequences quietly building suspense to the next birds attack are masterfully done. The acting gives the viewer some interest as a lot of the actors became known later for television series appear in this. This film is scary viewing.<br/><br/>Hitchcock wanted to top Pscyho and in terms of special effects, he comes close to that. The story line is not quite as powerful."
"I_Am_The_Taylrus","8","1","3","3 March 2007"," These Birds Will Peck Their Way Into Your Heart ...Literally(SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock as you may know and this is one of his most memorable movies. This is actually not his strongest by a mile, nor his best, but it is very thrilling and tense. The ending of this movie was not very strong at all, and I do not really like the fact that they never tell you why the birds are murdering everyone, but maybe like the crazy woman said it was all Melanie's fault, but I doubt it. I also find it kind of ironic that Tippy Hedren's name is this movie in Melanie and she has a daughter named Melanie Griffith. Coincidence? Why should I know? By the way, Hitchcock's cameo consists of him walking dogs in the first scene.<br/><br/>Here is the plot of this movie. It is one of Hitchcock's more simpler plots. A woman named Melanie has to deliver songbirds to a man named Mitch's sister named Cathy that live Bodega Bay . After she delivers them she is attacked by a bird. Melanie stays with Mitch and Cathy's family and Melanie meets Mitch's mother named Lydia. She also meets a schoolteacher named Annie. Then, the birds in the Bay suddenly start to go on a rampage. They attack children at Cathy's party, they attack school children, they gouge out a man's eyes, they stare at people and more. Then, Annie is killed. Most citizens flee the town, except for our heroes. Melanie is hurt and has to go to the hospital. Our heroes eventually flee the Bay.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic suspense movie. They are a lot of famous images in this movie. They is the birds on the school playground equipment, they are the birds on the telephone wires, Melanie is trapped in a phone-booth, a man in a house with his eyes totally gouged out, the shot of the children fleeing the school, and more. What I always found funny is that after all these horrific attacks by birds Melanie's hair is still perfect. How is that possible? Anyway, this is a another great film by Alfred Hitchcock but definitely not his best.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>Recommended Films: Psycho."

"mjb0123","6","1","3","3 April 2005"," Good but not the best Hitch
","The Birds starring Tippi Hedren is one of those movies that everybody knows, but I'm not sure if everyone has actually seen it.<br/><br/>From 1963, this movie has been called one of the horror classics, even though I don't think it is one of Hitch's best. Don't get me wrong, it is superbly done, especially for its time period and special effects. Watching a piece on it a while back, Tippi said that the attic scene where she is attacked by birds took three days to film with the crew constantly just throwing birds at her. With what Yoda can do on the screen now, this would probably be a cgi-created scene now. Yet the Hitchcock movie effects lend a touch of realism to it.<br/><br/>I watched this movie a week or so ago, and was going to review it but first wanted to mull it over in my head. I didn't like it. It was scary and suspenseful in that a sitting flock of birds made you cringe. That was great stuff. You never knew when they would come, the ultimate in suspense.<br/><br/>The character development was weird. Hedren is basically a stalker as she follows this man 60 miles north just to prove her point. The man's own family situation was weird and that other girl that moves to be near him was sad. But maybe that was what it was saying about real life. Sometimes it is just sad the mistakes and decisions we make, even though we think they are the right ones.<br/><br/>You are almost halfway into the movie when this bird thing starts. Random attacks first plague the little hamlet, getting worse in intensity as the movie goes. Conjecture about the birds taking over the earth by their sheer numbers is monster-movie banter at its best. When the attacks come, the viewer forgets completely about the lives of these characters.<br/><br/>Maybe that was the point. Maybe Hitch wanted to portray regular everyday stupid life and then shock us with an immense horror of unending implications. If these seemingly innocuous birds did decide to conquer, would our pathetic existence seem worth saving? The movie is well worth seeing, even if just for its historical significance to the cinema, and well worth talking about and engaging about further. I want to learn more about what others see in the movie. This may b e one of those movies, like Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey that, come on, is just crap by yourself, but talking about it with others is what makes it fascinating. Go see it and come back and tell me...The Butcher Shop at Blogger."

It was also a very origianal movie, not too much like any other movies.

","I don't know exactly why, but ""The Birds"" sometimes leaves me a little cold. I admire the sense of threat, some of the signature scenes (the playground, the service station, Tippi Hedren going into the attic, the broken glass in the phone booth), but the pacing just seems slow. The pacing, however, seems slow. There is a lack of economy that I am used to in my favorite Hitchcock movies. Nevertheless, it is still a very good film. I love the premise it is based on. The DuMaurier story is more bleak and hopeless, the Hitchcock more open ended-still, the threat is there. My criticisms may seem petty, but spending less time on exposition may have made this a much tighter production. Also, I have nothing against romance, but the relationship between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren takes up too much time from the issue at hand--THE BIRDS!!!!"
"Chris-268","7","1","3","18 September 2000"," A pleasant surprise that shows Hitchcock's versatility
","A lot has been said about ""The Birds"" already, so I'll just throw in my quirky observations and be done with it. I had never seen it from start to finish, and having seen most of Hitchcock's other films, I was curious as to how it would stand up. I expected not to like it, but I wound up giving it a 7 in the voting booth.<br/><br/>I have to echo that the special effects were innovative for the time period. They weren't nearly as cheesy as I expected. The thing that annoys me about later Hitchcock films is his incessant use of backdrops. Hitch hated shooting on location, but after the 1950s the backdrop technique was badly outdated. He should have made the effort to do more location shooting. For example, in the scene in which Tippi Hedron is in the motorboat, we see a real live shot of her bringing it into shore and getting out of it. Why then, if she was actually there in the bay for that scene, did Hitch have to shoot the rest of the boat scene against a backdrop? Oh well.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me see Hitch's attraction to Tippi Hedron. She's a mediocre actress at best, and I find her voice to be nasally and grating. I would have loved to see Ingrid Bergman in this role. Perhaps if she had been cast the writers would have re-written the story and actually made it interesting.<br/><br/>The second half of The Birds makes up for the boring, slow paced first half. I never thought of ""Psycho"" as a horror film- I saw it as more of a documentary, a psychological thriller. But ""The Birds"" was truly terrifying. As has been said before, the reasons for this are the lack of soundtrack, the use of ""ordinary"" creatures like birds as monsters, and the tension leading up to climactic moments. Nothing like ""The Birds"" had been done up to that time, and nothing has been done like it since. People were afraid of Martians before they saw ""War of the Worlds"", and they were afraid of sharks before they saw ""Jaws."" Not many people were afraid of seagulls before seeing ""The Birds.""<br/><br/>I thought the scene inside the cafe was hilarious. The doomsayer, the angry fisherman, and the elderly ornithologist had me cackling. I don't even know if this scene was meant to be funny, and not a single reviewer other than myself has mentioned it as being humorous. By contrast, I didn't laugh once when I saw ""The Trouble With Harry"", which was supposed to be a dark comedy. I think that what Hitch tried to do there, he got right here.<br/><br/>
I loved the ending to ""The Birds."" I think its strength lies in its ambiguity. After such a surrealistic story, it was the only ending that was appropriate. ""The Birds"" is truly a unique film, both among Hitchcock's own body of work and cinema in general."
"CG-8","Null","1","3","22 August 1999"," Innovative & memorable; 'Jaws' with brains; aviary good film!
","(The following review contains a few mini-'spoilers'; if you've yet to see the film, please be warned -- and please *DO* see it!)<br/><br/>In 'The Birds', Hitchcock showed us yet again why he was without contest the most innovative Hollywood director of his era, perhaps of all time. Just as 'Psycho' spawned the 'crazy serial-killer' genre, 'The Birds' laid the egg for the whole 'nature gone crazy' theme -- everything from killer bees to 'Jaws' and the toothless 'Piranha'. The premise of the film is perfectly ridiculous, even laughable, but Hitchcock, using all his panache, cinematizes it in a way that's not only original, but intelligent, believable and unforgettably haunting.<br/><br/>Consider these innovations: There's no musical score (at all!); a wide-open, very 'Euro' indecisive ending without 'THE END' credits (still customary in 1963); and the characters never scream, even at the most horrifying moments. Hitch evidently thought there was already enough *bird* 'screaming' on the eerie soundtrack. Also unusual is that the characters never say 'hello', 'goodbye' or similar greetings (except once, where someone says 'hi' to a bit player) and the dialogue is also, for the most part, nicely naturalistic; they say 'thanks' instead of 'thank you', for example, which was quite unusual for a 1963 film of this type. They often say something and nobody replies; or they just don't say anything, cut straight to next scene, and Hitch knows the aud are smart enough to draw the right conclusions (e.g. when Lydia returns from finding Fawcett's body).<br/><br/>I never quite understood how the birds could kill Annie while inflicting so few scratches on her body; presumably their M.O. was asphyxiation by sheer<br/><br/>numbers. (A bird stuffed in Dan Fawcett's mouth would've explained this; his pecked-out eyes where an unnecessary grossout in an otherwise tastefully gore-moderated film.) Thank God they were sparrows/crows and not vultures or eagles!<br/><br/>Mitch believes Melanie needs urgent hospital care following the attic attack frenzy, but she still looks perfectly doll-like even when dishevelled and distraught, apparently suffering no more than a few minor cuts and one slightly tattered lime-green Edith Head suit! Mitch was obviously talking about acute psychiatric care there. Indeed, he acts more like a shrink than a lawyer the whole movie long, their one kiss is more like a peck (as if the movie needed any more of those) and he seems more fascinated by Melanie's neuroticism than her eroticism.<br/><br/>Speaking of which... Am I alone in detecting that Hitch is (possibly) hinting at an attraction between Melanie and Annie? The scenes between them are one of the most interesting aspects of the movie; especially how Annie eyes up the cute doll-like Melanie and her tone of voice when they first meet. This 'frisson' persists (for me, anyway) even after we know Annie is hetero since she had a relaysh with Mitch. Is this just my male fantasy? No, as with so many things in Hitchcock movies, I think it's there to pick up on, if you want. Suzanne Pleshette gives a fascinatingly subtle, controlled performance. What a no-nonsense, even 'butch' gal Annie is! Dig her wonderfully hardboiled vocal style! The preternaturally primped and poised Tippi Hedren looks like the sex kitten who got the cream as the pampered Melanie, drifting rudderlessly yet a dab hand at inland navigation, while Rod Taylor is required to do nothing except look manly, distant and repress the odd emotion now and then. In fact, it's interesting to watch this movie and focus just on the superb and unpredictable dialogue; the nuanced way the characters interact with each other (the result, quite naturally, of nuanced, accomplished acting perfs); and especially for the psychological complexity of Melanie. Now how many horror films can you say that about? ""'The Birds' is cunning!"" might've made a good tagline.<br/><br/>No birds were harmed during the making of this motion picture. However, some of them got pretty mad at being tied to Tippi's Edith Head suit, saying that wasn't specified in their contract, and went utterly 'berdserk' when later denied their per diems for the inevitable shooting overruns. (No, they weren't acting...their resentment was for real. The line about their brainpans not being big enough was the final insult. Apparently, they were paid peanuts. And they'd requested *sunflower seeds*!!)<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren, if you know anything of what she had to endure (quite apart from a rather unflattering dress) certainly *WAS* harmed during the making... She reportedly almost had a nervous breakdown after having live birds thrown at her all day (quite literally) in the attic frenzy scene. Maybe her zombielike state at the end of the movie didn't involve much acting!<br/><br/>The movie also marked the beginning, and sadly the end, of the lovely Ms Hedren's meteoric career -- 'Marnie' and some nondescript B-movies/made-for-TVs excepted. (She fell out of favour with Hollywood after an acrimonious rift with Hitch while shooting 'Marnie'. They weren't on speaking terms for over half of production. It's an open secret that Hitch was besotted with Tippi (though of course there's no suggestion he was *EVER* unfaithful to his beloved wife Alma with *ANY* woman), and Tippi felt he wanted to control her entire life.) Did Tippi name her daughter 'Melanie' (Griffith) in honour of this, her greatest ever role? Who knows.<br/><br/>After watching 'The Birds', you'll keep some incredible images forever -- a cast of thousands that's much more impactful than 'Ben Hur', not to mention the ultrafeisty Ms Pleshette and so-easy-on-the-eye-it's-unreal Ms Hedren -- but no longer will you use the cliché 'our feathered friends' lightly.<br/><br/>In short: Aviary good film indeed! Definitely deserves to be above #233 in the IMDB all-time ranking. I only wish I'd been alive to see Hitchcock's films when they were released to feel their full contemporary impact. And this is a long review (and I've only said 10% of what I wanted to), but it *IS* well within the 1,000 words maximum. :-)"

","I don't understand why anyone is scared over this movie. Its not scary. There are some strange elements, but this movie works more as an unintentional comedy than a horror movie. That's actually giving this thing a lot of credit as for the most part its so boring that its not even worth watching as a comedy. <br/><br/>The only reason why anyone is going to give this movie a high review is because 
a) They're a fan of Alfred Hitchcock
or b) they were somehow scared by it.<br/><br/>Acting - All the acting is very bad. Its like the only direction anyone got was ""just say your line."" Everyone is terrible and unconvincing. The characters themselves are very dull. Some of the people did seem to be trying, but overall everyone failed miserably. <br/><br/>Characters - Most of the characters act like total idiots and in general don't act like people. Motivations are very random and nothing is very well established. None of the characters are interesting enough to want to follow. <br/><br/>Birds - Except for a few of them, the majority of the birds are very fake. I realize that it would have been able to coordinate that many birds, but it just kinda takes you out of the movie. There is a very long scene early on in the movie were the main character is driving in a car. Between the painfully long shots of the woman driving, there are up close shots on the birds in a cage in the car. Both of them are fake. This scene really sums up most of what is wrong with this movie - its an overlong scene with bad effects, a hint of comedy that is ruined by how long it is, and a moment to think about how boring the story it is. Some annoying woman is driving to some obscure location to give some guy she's met once a bird. What an entertaining premise. Honestly any other movie would condense what this movie drags out for almost an hour into about 10 minutes. <br/><br/>Plot - This movie is way longer than it needs to be. Most of the scenes are way too long, and there are a ton of shots that could easily just be cut. The plot itself is already very dull an it doesn't need to be feature length. A lot of this movie is random filler designed to bloat the run time. I explained the basic premise in my previous point. <br/><br/>Sights and Sounds - The audio and visual composition of this movie are pretty good, considering how old it is.

"JakeBrinkman","3","1","4","12 January 2019"," A below-average Hitchcock film
","After watching several Hitchcock films, I've noticed four things that are common in his films:<br/><br/>1. A plot that is, at minimum, above average. This movie does have an interesting plot that makes you curious to see what comes next, even though it's never quite gripping.<br/><br/>2. Words are required to move the plot, but delivery doesn't matter at all. In some of Hitchcock's best-known films, some of the actors give good or decent performances despite Hitchcock's lack of care. However, The Birds is not one of those movies. This film probably has the worst acting out of all the Hitchcock movies that I've seen.<br/><br/>3. Similar to the acting, character development is also not important; the only thing that matters is what the characters are currently doing on screen. This movie is actually an exception to this. At least four of the characters are given interesting backgrounds and characters.<br/><br/>4. The film contains several visually interesting shots. Plot and cinematography appear to be all that Hitchcock cares about, although this movie is also an exception to that. I understand the outdated technology for overlaying the birds on the screen was cutting edge at the time, so I can't fault him for that despite that it clearly can't hold up to today's animation abilities. Though I can fault him for the many uses of fake backgrounds when the film was shot on location with plenty of real backgrounds to use. Both of these issues clearly date the movie, but even after putting these scenes aside, there are simply no scenes that are extremely visually interesting like there are in Hitchcock's other hits.<br/><br/>One last item of note is the sound. The lack of background music worked quite well in providing anticipatory tension during the calm scenes between attacks. On the contrary, it was a terrible decision to use the tape reel noises as bird calls. They sounded nothing like birds and they only served to distract the viewer and remove the tension from the attack scenes."

","One of two Hitchcock movies that will terrify you-the other is Psycho. The Big Year is a comedy about birds-this isn't. This movie is about bird attacks in the San Francisco area. Memorable scenes include the birds popping up, little by little, on the metal structure, the scene at the gas station, the gull attack on the lady, and the ""swarm"" at the end. Watch for Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning. This is one of his classics. I loved it. Prepared to be scared if you watch it-especially if birds terrify you!

","The master of suspense directed one of the most strangely terrifying films ever made. It revolves around random bird attacks on a bay near San Francisco when a woman decides to spend a few days there. The reason or motive behind these attacks is unknown but the birds show absolutely no remorse.<br/><br/>Hitchcock was always great at giving us incredible female leads, and Tippi Hedren's 'Melanie Daniels was no different. You don't even find out a lot about her character, only that she is determined to bring the two love birds to Mitch, a recently stranger turned friend. The film alludes to the fact that the attacks only begin once she arrives on site. But even then we don't truly know the motive behind it all. I didn't find the supporting performances to be all that great, in fact i found the mothers to be a bit revolting at times. The children were also at times obnoxious.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is very calm and reminiscent of a Hitchcock romance but when the attacks begin, they don't let up. The scene at the schoolhouse is iconic and is impossible to remove from your mind. The way Hitchcock shows Melanie's point of view all the way to the hundreds of crows just waiting to attack was marvelous. In what started as a soothing first hour, ends with a terrifying last 50 minutes. Much like every fantasy like story, most people don't believe the attacks are real until they eventually witness the downtown explosions with several people dying. It's then we see one of our favorite characters die and basically all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Hitchcock did a brilliant job directing the film but i can't quite grip my head around his choice for an ambiguous ending. Usually you take this time to offer either a twist or a huge reveal that alters the viewing experience and pieces the puzzle together. Instead we are left with no answers. Overall, there are several classic moments but the sum of it's parts didn't pay off as much as i would have liked.<br/><br/>+Strong Hitchcock female lead<br/><br/>+Frightening built up horror<br/><br/>+Iconic school scene<br/><br/>-Weak supporting characters<br/><br/>-Ending<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Alfred Hitchcock's nightmarish tale about the avian-world inflicting a terrible vengeance on their human tormentors.<br/><br/>Rod Taylor stars as Mitch Brenner, a bachelor lawyer. <br/><br/>The story begins with Brenner having a fractious encounter in a San Francisco pet shop with Melanie Daniels, a chic but haughty young woman, played by Tippi Hedren, Hitchcock's latest hunk of blonde ice. Clearly smitten by the handsome attorney, the woman follows him to his home in Bodega Bay, an idyllic fishing hamlet north of the city to give him a peace offering of two love birds. However, her arrival with the captive livestock in tow seems to trigger a hostile reaction from the local feathered population. Beginning with an odd, momentary assault on the mysterious visitor by a lone seagull, all hell eventually breaks loose when thousands of marauding birds of different species repeatedly attack the small community. <br/><br/>Jessica Tandy is Taylor's clinging and domineering mother with Veronica Cartwright as his sister and Suzanne Pleshette as his ex- girlfriend. Taylor, in his prime, looks good and makes a powerful and comforting protector in life-threatening circumstances.<br/><br/>Although the pedestrian script by Evan Hunter (based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier) doesn't provide any real scope for the cast, the performances are still excellent. And, in the end, Hitchcock's sheer mastery of suspense over rides any shortcomings. <br/><br/>""The Birds"" premiered in March, 1963 to somewhat mixed reviews. The public, however, showed no such ambivalence and (dare I say it ?), 'flocked' to cinemas across America to partake in the quirky horror that was on offer. <br/><br/>Obviously, it's an effects - driven movie and on that count it still packs a punch."

"MBunge","7","1","4","8 September 2010"," A bit dated in spots, but still better than 90% of movies made today.
","This is one of the best films from one of the greatest filmmakers in movie history. It's not a perfect movie and parts of it do show their age, but the countless inferior horror stories in the same vein that followed The Birds testify to its exceptional quality.<br/><br/>Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is like a Bizarro Paris Hilton. She's a rich man's daughter who doesn't think the rules of society apply to her. But unlike the debauchery and narcissistic self-promotion of Miss Hilton, Melanie Daniels is the sort of outrageous débutante that makes life more interesting. She's smart and bold and playful and uses her wealth and privilege to do things that normal people can't do, even though many of them wish they could. For example, after being taken to task one day by the charmingly arrogant Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), Melanie decides to take a day out of her life to drive up from San Francisco to tiny Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds, just to tweak this almost unknown man and let him know he didn't get one up on her.<br/><br/>Melanie doesn't get to have the last word and walk away, however. She meets Mitch's little sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) and his brittle mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy). Lydia clings to Mitch like her rock in a raging sea and sees Melanie as a hammer that might break that rock out from under her. Melanie also encounters Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), the local school teacher who views the rich, worldly and more liberated Melanie the way a fisherwoman might view a storm on the horizon. She's also a woman who was in love with Mitch, but their romance couldn't withstand the cold opposition of Lydia.<br/><br/>While The Birds is still unsettling and full of powerful images and sharp, intelligent dialog, the most striking thing about it is that the relationship between Mitch, Melanie, Annie and Lydia could have been the core of a completely different kind of movie. You can easily imagine Hitchcock plunging these characters into his more traditional tale of mystery and murder. That's not what happens, though. Mitch, Melanie, Annie and Lydia, along with the villagers of Bodega Bay, find themselves caught up in an insane rebellion of nature. Birds begin attacking the people of Bodega Bay. First one at a time, and then thousands of them descend on the town in waves of blood and terror until it's not clear is anyone at all will survive.<br/><br/>The Birds is a tremendous bit of work, but I don't think there's any need to pretend about it as a story and a film. Though Hitchcock uses real birds to eerie effect, the 1963 special effects don't hold up very well. It's also true that to an audience that grew up with Jaws, Alien and Jurassic Park, the idea of murderous flocks of birds isn't quite as shocking or scary as it once might have been. Though it still has powerful moments, most modern viewers are going to be a bit jaded to some of the thrills this movie throws at them.<br/><br/>Those little chinks in The Birds' armor can't detract from the otherwise superb writing, direction and performances in the film. Tippi Hedren is gorgeous and magnetic. Suzanne Pleshette is strong and sexy and actually speaks with a sultry female tone and not the sound of sandpaper on a wet possum. Rod Taylor carries off the less formed role of the slightly dickish Mitch Brenner with the verve of an old time movie star. Jessica Tandy takes a character that could have been hateful and barren and gives her human depth. And while I'm not sure pop culture remembers, there are scenes and moments in The Birds that are as visually compelling as anything Hitchcock ever did.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is one of those filmmakers you have to watch. The Birds is one of those Hitchcock films you have to see. Do yourself a favor and rent it."
"smellthecult-com-1","6","1","4","25 October 2009"," When birds attack!
","Outside of film geekdom, this is probably Hitchcock's most famous movie after Psycho, with the effective and chilling thought of birds going on the attack seeming to resonate with the Everyman. <br/><br/>Hedren plays Melanie Daniels, an 'It' girl of the 60's, who bumps into a lawyer, Mitch Brenner (Taylor), whilst in a pet shop purchasing a bird. The lawyer goads her for her lifestyle and, furious, she tracks him down to a small town called Bodega Bay where she intends to trick him, though it is clear that she is really romantically interested in the fellow, the sly old dog. Once there, suddenly, mysteriously, the birds begin to act aggressively, starting with a solo dive onto Miss Daniels, and culminating in a full scale assault on the town. The birds attack in waves, then retreat, regroup, before attacking again. <br/><br/>Will Miss Daniels and Co. get out alive? And has the behaviour spread across the country or even the world? And why does Mitch Brenner's mother look so much like his new girlfriend? You'll have to watch to find out. <br/><br/>Not as intelligent as Hitchcock's finest offerings, this is still an effective thriller cum horror. Ahead of its time in terms of ambition (i.e. the effects are not very convincing, though top marks for trying) this is still a taut affair, with some surprisingly savage bird attack scenes. It drags like a mother at times though, with the opening preamble seeming to go on for an eternity before the movies' main play kicks in.<br/><br/>Interesting, if not essential viewing."

Nothing too scary happens until a quarter the way through, but it's done so we can connect to the characters and grow to like them. The plot is pretty thin, but an original and memorable one.<br/><br/>Bottom line: technical aspects are terrible (compared to the stuff we have out now), plot is thin, but the ideas, script and execution are very original and clever! I was left on the edge of my seat in suspense at some parts- and that hardly ever happens to me.<br/><br/>It's hard to rate this because of the time it was made and the lack of re-watch value, but I'll go somewhere between 6-7."

"jem132","6","1","4","12 May 2006"," When birds go bad
","One of Hitchcock's favourite recurring motifs gets a thorough run-around here. Birds are a presence in many Hitchcock films, from 'Sabotage' to 'Psycho'. In his 1963 effort, Hitch went all out with his favourite species, and churned out an unusual and decidedly macabre product.<br/><br/>The whole film is unsettling, not just the bird attacks. The love story between Hedren and Taylor is generally not romantic, more strange than anything. His mother (another favourite Hitchcock theme) tends to dominate proceedings, and Hedren's own attachment to Taylor (following him to another town to deliver a pair of lovebirds?!) borders on obsession. The set-up is very flimsy, with the remarkable Jessica Tandy saving the production, acting-wise, in her scenes. Hedren marks a fall in the quality of Hitchcock's blondes; she is an actress of limited talent and unremarkable beauty. One wonders why Hitchcock became so obsessed with her.<br/><br/>However, despite the dodgy plot and wooden acting performances by the leads, there are some very, very good sequences here. The bird attacks are magnificently handled by Hitchcock, and they are disturbingly realistic (apparently Hedren herself was set upon by real-live birds in Hitch's effort for realism- then again, Hitchcoc's leading ladies often got the worst of it terms of violence and ill fate). One wonders at the reactions of a 60's audience towards scenes of a man pecked to death, his eye sockets empty and splattered with blood. The special effects were remarkable in their day, and they hold up pretty well, too. The electronic musical score (composed of bird noises) is chiefly memorable and effectively used here.<br/><br/>Many critics have noted that the sudden, and unwarranted, bird attacks seem to reflect the growing fear of nuclear warfare in the 1960's. Interesting theory.<br/><br/>A friend told me of a childhood memory involving a viewing of 'The Birds'. She was about 8 years old, living in Holland, and had just watched 'The Birds' on television for the first time. It scared her, most notably because great flocks of birds used to come right up to their windows at night, pecking on the glass, as they lived by the lakes. Her brother and herself both slept at the foot of their mother and father's bed that night. Yes, this film does give a person chills, and even made me (usually a cynic when it comes to horror) have a second look at the next crow that I came across. Birds have now been revealed to be a much more intelligent species than initially thought, so 'The Birds' has added significance.<br/><br/>One of Hitchcock's last genuinely good films.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I saw this movie last night during a midnight screening at the student theater. After all the wonderful things I had heard about it (Hitchcock's best!), I was extremely disappointed. This movie did not age well at all.<br/><br/>The story involves a capricious woman who apparently has played practical jokes following a man to Bodega Bay to deliver some lovebirds. We are not completely sure as to how or why they know each other, but we do know that there is a mutual attraction. Due to some strange attacks by birds, she stays with the man, the young sister, and the elderly, bizarre mother. The attacks become progressively worse, and we watch how they cope with it.<br/><br/>Not only are the special effects horrible, the acting was a completely different style as well. Many times the camera would focus on a character doing their best to put on an ""intense"" face. Throughout the movie, the whole audience was laughing almost hysterically. I can't recall a time when I laughed more in a movie theater. Not to mention the awkward laughter that came after the movie ended when people thought the reel had broken, or something along that line to explain the odd ending.<br/><br/>Obviously there were some elements that illustrate why some regard it as excellent. The fact that Hitchcock could create suspense with no score is mind-blowing. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I don't know if I would ever recommend this.<br/><br/>Bottom line - this movie does not translate well."

","This was basically a disaster film but instead of a Volcano or Tornado, it was killer birds. One thing i liked about it was that you got involved in these people's lives before they were attacked unlike today's disaster films. But what i didn't like about it was that i didn't care about the characters and i could of cared less about who died. I have never liked Rod Taylor and i think he was just wrong for this movie.

","""The Birds"" is one of the greatest classics in Alfred Hitchcock's career. Its story basically reports an attack of raging birds against a small village on the Californian coast. The movie has often been touted as overrated but I definitely disagree. It's true that this kind of situation is quite unusual and the reasons for the abnormal behavior of the birds is never properly explained to us. I also considered the way the main character behaves, practically chasing a man she is attracted to without knowing him, is illogical and, at least, strange. That's the biggest negative criticism I can make of this movie which, apart from that, is flawless. The script explores a ""nature vs. human"" situation quite well, doing it in a way that we actually see as threatening, dangerous and tense. The way the birds behave is highly intimidating, and I just hope no animal has been wounded during the shootings. Cinematography is very good as well as visual effects. Tippi Hedren gave life to the main character, Melanie Daniels, a young spoiled daughter of a big-shot, and Rod Taylor played Mitch Brenner, for whom she is romantically interested. Both actors went very well in their characters, counting on the collaboration of a very competent support cast."
"one-nine-eighty","6","1","5","6 April 2016"," Death from above
","A Hitchcock classic from 1963 featuring Tippi Hedren as Melanie Daniels who goes to Bodega Bay to surprise Rod Taylor's Mitch Brenner with a gift for his young sister. Almost at the same time as arriving flocks of birds begin attacking the townsfolk with deathly consequences. <br/><br/>Based very loosely on a Daphne du Maurier story by the same name (Hitchcock has used her material before), and also based on a real, but strange, incident in Monterey Bay (1961) where birds frenzied after eating toxic substances. The film shows the start of the attacks and how those affected cope with it and try to survive. The acting is great much like you'd expect from a Hitchcock film and the script allows them to come across as authentic and believable - albeit Melanie comes across as a bit of a stalker at the start of the film the way she hunts and follows Mitch. The cinematography is superb although there is a lot of studio filmed footage in the film which is noticeable by today's standards - this however doesn't detract from the film. Being the master of suspense Hitchcock decided to leave the films ending open to interpretation although 40+ years later people are still debating why the birds began attacking in the first place. Is Melanie's arrival with the caged love birds a catalyst? Is it a revenge for the treatment of birds in real life (as mentioned at various points in the film)? Is it (as mentioned a few times) the end of the world slowly unfolding? Whatever the reason behind it audiences who watch this today will be as baffled as audiences who watched this in the 60's. As a standalone film this is great, by today's standards of quality you may be disappointed by the CGI and fake blood, maybe even the naivety of some of the townsfolk too. If you forget those things and sit and watch the film for what it is you'll surely enjoy it. <br/><br/>I'm giving this 6 out 10. Having studied Hitchcock at college it still gives me a wry smile thinking about how he pitched to sell this to studio executive as a profitable venture. :)"
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","5","8 November 2015"," A stodgy first half enlivened by a great second
","Despite its classic status, it's fair to say that THE BIRDS isn't director Alfred Hitchcok's best film. It isn't even among his best work. When it finally gets going, delivering powerhouse shock after powerhouse shock with its endless sequences of bird attacks, it's a bloody good movie. But that impact is lessened by the lukewarm first hour, which adds absolutely nothing to the film as a whole other than introducing the characters and delivering a few eerie foreboding scenes.<br/><br/>Now, I understand all about exposition. I know how Hitchcock's intention was to build realism by portraying ordinary life before letting rip with the bird attacks. After all, they do benefit from the long build-up. But in this first hour, the smart dialogue is full of details which just don't add anything to the story. We learn stuff we don't need to know about the people involved, and more than once I looked at my watch as the time passed by slowly. Hitchcock was a visual master, and the film looks just fine visually. It's the script – by Ed McBain, no less – that doesn't deliver the requisite interest.<br/><br/>Still, once the birds DO attack, things really hot up. The shock scenes do just that – the bit with the chimney is an example of a good, solid cinematic moment. The attack on the children's party is another. Characters hole up in a bar, and things remain just fine until the end. Hitchcock choreographs an excellent 'out of control' set-piece as the town is destroyed, full of flames and broken glass and chaos. We get a mini siege scenario at the end, no doubt inspiring the likes of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and all that's come since. The special effects are still pretty good to this day and Hitchcock doesn't skimp on the sadism in the bloody attacks, either.<br/><br/>I was in two minds about the cast. Rod Taylor was always a very light actor, best at comedy or adventure films. He's a solid leading man presence here, nothing more. Jessica Tandy is excellent, playing a very irritating character and giving her some warmth and life despite her bad points. Veronica Cartwright is convincingly menaced, just as she was years later in ALIEN. But Tippi Hedren, the heroine, just didn't gel with me. I found her cold and unlikeable, and it got to the stage that I didn't care very much when she was attacked. So there you have it, the classic film of two halves: a rather dull first half and an excellent second."

James Rolfe said that The Birds is kind of like Jaws. It has the plot of a B movie but it was so good that's now a big budget ""A"" movie. The plot apart from the birds is that a young rich playgirl named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) follows a lawyer named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) to a remote town in California. The film at first takes awhile with delivering the bird attacks but I think it does a good job in keeping us on our toes. That's Alfred Hitchcock for you. The bird effects themselves are often quite cheesy looking but it still keeps up the suspense. Not my favorite Hitchcock film but it's good enough for an 8 star rating."

","A Hitchcockian epic! It's one of his big movies with sweeping location shooting and a major theme. Bodega Bay never looked so good, despite Susanne Pleshette's calling it a collection of shacks on a hillside. These shacks have character. They're all weathered from the salty fog and winter rain and, inside, you can practically smell the new paint. And the folks are right friendly too, willing to give you directions and make your phone calls for you. Oh, they may not be too sophisticated. Don't try to talk Robert Rauschenberg with them. But they're honest God-fearing sons of the soil and sea, so ordinary, so dull, that one day the tide may go out and never come back.<br/><br/>Well, come to think of it, you might mention some fancy artist's name to Rod Taylor, the guy who spends his weekends with his possessive mother and younger sister on the family chicken farm. He might be able to argue with you about the virtues and weaknesses of Paul De Man, but probably not. He's a successful lawyer who lives two hours south of Bodega Bay in San Francisco. And he's a no-nonsense kind of guy who enjoys roughing it on the chicken ranch. He's a prize hunk, too. I mean, a well-to-do lawyer who is grounded, playful and loving at the same time. Even his work clothes look as if they were designed by some Hollywood wardrobe mistress, which they were.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is a self-indulgent blond who takes a shine to Taylor and pursues him to Bodega Bay. In the village, she gets to meet and befriend Pleshette, an ex girl friend of Taylor's who is still hanging around town, working as the school teacher, though she knows it's all over between her and Taylor. Now, the savvy viewer, who knows that this movie is all about birds attacking and killing people, will recognize at once that Pleshette -- the despondent ex, the superfluous school marm -- doesn't have much of a future.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful-looking movie, as I say, exquisitely photographed by Robert Burks. It's classically structured, with increasingly ominous threats followed by increasingly violent attacks. Rod Taylor is a comforting masculine presence. Jessica Tandy, as Taylor's mother, handles a complex role well and still looks gorgeous despite her age.<br/><br/>Tippi Hedren is polished and glossy and clean to the point of sterility, looked at with the care an owner might lavish on his new Lamborghini. That's Hitchcock's doing.<br/><br/>The poor woman was miscast and misdirected. She smirks a good deal and has these slight but noticeable tics that some attractive women use on screen that draws attention to this or that view of her features. All of that is Hitch's doing.<br/><br/>Hitch ""discovered"" her in a TV commercial, the kind of thing for which she is aptly suited, and treated her as his personal possession, figuring she should be grateful to him for turning her into a major movie star, as his own creation. He even had a legal requirement that quotation marks be put around her Scandinavian nickname, ""Tippi"". But Hitch's judgment was falling off. (It didn't help that he was pounding a lot of booze by this time.) He was always quietly dominant with his leading ladies but this tendency became excessive with Tippi Hedren, to the point at which his demands became intolerably vulgar. Hedren rejected him and after that Hitch put her through hell. When she is attacked by the birds in the attic, it was deliberate torture.<br/><br/>The problem was all the more marked because, after all, Hedren is the central character and we witness events through her eyes. She has to carry the picture and she can't do it.<br/><br/>Aside from Hedren, Hitch's footing seems uncertain and he falls back on clichés that he probably wouldn't have used ten years earlier. It's bad enough that the birds attack people, but that's what the whole ambiguous story is about. But that they should concentrate their attacks on helpless children? TWICE? And with multiple close ups of birds pecking away at the faces of the screaming kids? Hitch was always fond of shots that were both innovative and graceful -- a camera swooping slowly down a staircase, nudging its way through a partying crowd, and focusing at length on someone's hand half-hiding a critical key. He tries something innovative here -- a series of shock jump cuts bringing us closer and closer to the bloody orbital sockets of a man whose eyes have been pecked out. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>In fact, the birds themselves don't work very well. I know sea gulls can bite. Their upper and lower bills each have two long rows of tiny saw-like teeth, as I know all too well. I don't know about crows. But I'm familiar with finches and sparrows. And they're harmless little seed eaters. When Taylor and his family are attacked by a horde of hundreds of fluttering sparrows and the viewer is supposed to feel the terror of the victims, I felt sorry for the poor birds.<br/><br/>I gave this a reasonably good rating because it evokes small-town atmosphere so well and the photography is luscious. It's exciting on first viewing too. It's only later, when you think about it, that you realize that Hitchcock is losing his touch here -- and that's sadder than anything in the film."

"lee_eisenberg","10","1","5","26 May 2005"," Hitchcock always knew how to make use of chaos, and he takes it to the extreme here
","Probably no motif appears in Alfred Hitchcock's movies more often than chaos. While it played a central role in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""Psycho"", ""The Birds"" is probably the ultimate chaos story, especially considering how Hitchcock plays with the audience.<br/><br/>It all begins when socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) enters a San Francisco pet shop and meets lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). While they at first seem to be a little displeased with each other, Melanie then buys some love birds to give Mitch. When she goes to his apartment and learns from a neighbor that he's in Bodega Bay for the weekend, she promptly drives up there. That's when things start to get strange. A seagull pecks Melanie on the forehead while she is on a boat, and then a bird crashes into a schoolteacher's door.<br/><br/>Finally, at a birthday party, a whole flock of birds attacks everyone. Then, a flock of birds gathers around a school and attacks the children as they're leaving. After a gas station explosion, it turns into full scale war; the chaos has irreversibly set in. Whereas in most movies, chaotic events get explained, they do not get explained in ""The Birds"", which adds to the terror.<br/><br/>What I mean by ""playing with the audience"" is this: for about the first half hour, the movie seems to be a romantic comedy. Then, once the birds attack at the birthday party, everything changes; there's nothing that's going to save anyone now.<br/><br/>A common theme in Hitchcock's movies is the guilty woman (think ""Blackmail"" and ""Psycho""). Clearly, Melanie is a guilty woman, but guilty of what? Maybe this: she walks around in a fur coat, which identifies a disdain for animals. Perhaps the birds see her as the incarnation of everything bad that humans have done to animals, and so they take revenge on her.<br/><br/>Nowadays when something bad happens in a movie, the solution is to have Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis kick ass. Not so in ""The Birds"". Rod Taylor, whose character could easily be a ""potent male adventurer"", is helpless; seeing that the birds have essentially taken over Bodega Bay, Mitch boards up his house and hopes that the killer avians don't enter.<br/><br/>The movie makes an interesting use of the color green. First and foremost are Melanie's clothes: her dress and blouse are lime-colored. Also, as she is driving to Bodega Bay, she drives through vast fields, meaning a lot of grass. What does this mean? Maybe that although Melanie is disconnected from nature, the latter is creeping up on her.<br/><br/>I guess that an obvious point is that Tippi Hedren was one of Hitchcock's icy blondes, following Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Eva Marie Saint and Janet Leigh. It's too bad that Tippi Hedren didn't do much after ""The Birds""; she was hot in this movie.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, the next time you see a bird, just remember this movie, and especially remember the song that the schoolchildren are singing right before an ornithological onslaught. It might save your life..."

","i only watched this film because i had heard so much about it and it was being shown on ITV new years day. I found the film to be good for the time it was made, and it had an interesting story... but i haven't been able to stop thinking about it since i watched it! the birds just cant attack for no reason, so i came up with the following conclusions: 1) in the bird shop at the beginning, mitch says to Melanie that the birds shouldn't be kept in captivity.. (i cant remember the exact words) but it made me think about whether the birds were attacking because they didn't like the lovebirds being in the cage, and as they were all different species of birds attacking, i thought whether they were sticking together and therefore making the people in the film feel like they are in captivity themselves. 2) the birds only seem to attack when there is fire/smoke. when Melanie is at the school, she lights a cigarette, the birds come. when the lady in the café towards the end is playing with the match to light her cigarette, the birds appear, and in the final bit in the house, the light a fire and Melanie gets attacked. <br/><br/>i am sure i will think of more, but please do post and tell me what you think of my theories!"

","While I found Hitchcock's films to be entertaining I wouldn't say that he is the master filmmaker that some claim him to be. He produced dozens of entertaining films, designed to turn on the reptile parts of the human brain, but nothing that I could call a work of art.<br/><br/>Here we have a typical case. A film about birds turning against humanity. The film relies on engaging the most primitive emotion of fear from the audience. Similar to modern blockbuster but without relying on special effects, instead focusing on more psychological methods of fear inducement.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film but nothing that I could call great or even excellent."

I was going to give this movie a one-star rating, but I almost forgot that no matter how much I hated this movie, I was still drawn into what was going to happen next and couldn't stop watching. One final point. The ending was the most abrupt ending possible. I thought that my DVD player was broken, but it wasn't. The ending did not give the sort of closing feeling to it.

","Birds, The (1963) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>OK, would a fan of this film please explain to me why they like it? I personally think this is Hitchcock's most overrated film and I also think it's pretty poorly written and the direction is a major drop of quality from the previous ten years of Hitchcock's career but I guess I should also say that I feel the director's films went down after Psycho. I'm not sure where to start but I guess I'll start off with the structure of the picture. I'm going to guess that Hitchcock was doing a Rear Window type of thing were he uses the first 75% of the film to let viewers get to know the characters and then switches gear the last 25% of goes for the suspense. While it works perfectly in the other film I think the idea falls flat on its ass here. I think Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor are very good in their roles but I didn't feel a thing for them. I certainly wanted them to live but I didn't care about him being burdened with his mother and I didn't care about her having a wild period in her life. I really didn't care for any of the supporting players and I think the bit with Jessica Tandy just went on and on and on. I also feel that the movie runs at least half an hour to long. Again, I guess Hitchcock wanted to save the suspense for last but the build up just bored me and when we finally get to the ending I was just wanting the film to end so there wasn't any suspense for me. I know this is a beloved Hitchcock film but I really can't see anything special here. There were several people in the crowd screaming and gasping so apparently it still packs a punch with several people but it's never worked with me and I think I disliked it more this time than any previous time. It's certainly too bad Hitch didn't get to film the ending he originally wanted because it would have been a lot better."

","3/4<br/><br/>The Birds is the subject of an age-old debate that cinephiles often engage in: is The Birds a good or an overrated film? I am one of a neutral party that agrees with both. To me, The Birds is everything that it promised to be, nothing more.<br/><br/>There is no debating this: it's not Hitchcock's masterpiece. The plot is this: A woman works a pet shop, she gets an order for love birds, she travels to a coastal town to get the love birds...Birds go wild and ravage the place while she falls in love with the town hunk. Why do these birds go mad? This is one of the many questions the movie will not answer. If you care enough to analyze it, be my guest. This movie does not challenge you to find answers, as it works perfectly fine if you suspend your disbelief.<br/><br/>However, the plot is not where the movie earns its merits at all. The film is very surreal, intense, and mildly frightening as Hitch's signature spice. If anything is to be said about this movie at all, the way Hitch shot the Birds was flawless as far as camera work. The way he captured their spirit of destruction through the rule of thirds is truly cinematography in Hitchcock tradition. To me, his portrayal and control of the Birds is what makes the film. <br/><br/>The cast (especially Tippi Hedren) are very vibrant characters full of life and genuine emotion. He was able to convey these characters without the use of a musical score was very adept, although it should not go unnoticed that in the school scene the children sing a rhyme to build up suspense. Every component compliments one another in The Birds. There is truly no wasted talent.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I find The Birds to be a good movie. Most of all, I find it to be an important milestone in cinematic history simply for the way the birds were captured on-screen. This does not have my vote for Hitchcock's best, or even his second or third best, but it's great for what it is: a landmark movie and a fun thriller."
"zianimustafa","7","0","1","19 January 2018"," The Birds
","One of the masterpieces of the brilliant director Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock has succeeded in making one of the creatures that are innocent into ferocious beings.
The film talks about a coastal city in San Francisco being attacked by swarms of birds for no apparent reason.
The film begins with a romantic character, with Tippi Hedren linking with Rod Taylor and Suzanne Pleshette in a triple love story.
Melanie meets Mitch at a bird shop where she makes a joke that led her to the Mitch family's home in the coastal city north of San Francisco to deliver gifts of love.
Then the film begins to gradually escalate, starting with the bird that attacked Melanie on her head to attack the birds for a children's party to quickly climb up to bloody attackers and the scene of the viewer in a state of panic and concern about the characters after being attached to them.
The cause of these attacks may not seem obvious but the bloody and frightening attacks, as well as the sound and visual effects, have raised fear and shock in the heart of the scenes, and this is certainly what Director Alfred Hitchcock wanted.
Despite writing a closing scene, I left the end open until interpreted by the viewer as much as he wanted. In addition to the cause of bird frenzy, which remains a question mark to this day, the film has become one of the most exciting films and mystery.
The Birds is Hitchcock's last best work (and hopefully not)."
"justinmethe","8","0","1","8 December 2017"," Alfred Hitchcock will forever be the master of suspense.
","A truly creepy thriller. I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a horror film but Hitchcock as he does in all his thrillers surely takes his time while slowly building up the suspense in this movie. Even when we arrive in Bodega Bay we don't get a sense that anything is wrong until many more scenes after our initial arrival, but what makes this movie so great is even if you don't see anything or if really you have no reason to be worried or feel nervous you do anyway throughout the entirety of the film. Hitchcock really does prove that he is the master of suspense in this film especially with some iconic scenes such as the one where Melanie Daniels played by Tippi Hedren is at the school and is leaning up against the fence as the birds quietly gather on the playground before she turns around. Although she remains calm you can just feel the intensity in that scene and it was almost like you were right their with her. Movies such as THE BIRDS will always keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire film."

","At first, this film didn't give me any shock, because characters merely talked each other and their speaking and subtitles speed was so fast that I couldn't understand substance in places.  However, the scene suddenly began to change from halfway.  A large number and many kinds of birds attacked on people. I think this film is a little different from other horror films, because even if some ghosts often appear, we might guess their mind by their background.  However, in this film, the birds don't speak anything so we don't be able to find the reason why the birds attack people to the end.  (But possibly, it'll be revenge on human or demand of releasing lovebird.)  So this point is weirdness and frightens us. One of the theme of this film is change of relationship between Melanie and Lydia.  Lydia felt suspicion about Melanie, because Lydia had strange feeling for his son.  In this point incest like ""Psycho"" was described in ""The Birds"".  I think there's consistency of theme of women in Hitchcock's film."

","Although I don't think that ""The Birds"" is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film, it's very humorous, and obviously Hitchcock wanted to have a lot of fun with his audience. I like the way the film looks at the reaction of people to bizarre events, especially as some of the townspeople connect the arrival of the birds with the arrival of Tippi Hedren as though she somehow brought this on them. I didn't even notice that there wasn't a musical soundtrack the first time I saw the film, because the sounds of the birds attacking amidst the silence is really effective. ""The Birds"" features some great cinematography, a nerve-wracking soundtrack, and some finely wrought performances. ""The Birds"" is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks. And finally there's Tippi Hedren, the beautiful blonde discovered by Hitchcock after viewing her in a toothpaste commercial while Hitch was watching the Today Show. Hedren was one of the cool sophisticated blondes loved by Hitchcock (and this eventually led to problems on their next film, Marnie.) Tippi is just so classy and beautiful to look at and gives a very nice performance considering the fact that she had almost no acting experience. The film also led her to suffer a mini-nervous breakdown after having to endure days of having birds thrown at her during the film's climactic bird attack. Tippi is absolutely wonderful and was even better in a difficult role in her next (and last) Hitchcock film, Marnie. The film is also loaded with many interesting character actors in small roles: Charles McGraw, Richard Deacon, Lonny Chapman, Karl Swenson, etc. all giving entertaining performances.<br/><br/>But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself. Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where ""The Birds"" is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps. It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film. This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole. Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one? Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room? Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be? Hitchcock knows how to build suspense and he does it quite convincingly with this movie. He casually starts off with what seems to be an average affair of two people and then those characters have sub plots that surround them and things get a little more tense until their ""normal"" world is thrown off balance by some thing that comes out of left field. This is great suspense film with a witty dialogue.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."

"asianlover-11927","Null","0","1","5 May 2016"," The Birds Film Review English 481
","To say The Birds is a pure artistic well constructed masterpiece is an understatement. Alfred Hitchcock created another suspenseful, thrilling work of art that became another cult classic after its release. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor fit together like glove to hand with dynamic chemistry and active dialogue. Tippi Hedren plays Melanie Daniels who arrives at Bodega Bay after meeting Mitch Brenner (Played by Rod Taylor) at a bird shop. Melanie's arrival sparks an unprecedented series of bird attacks amongst the locals. The attacks are minor at first but eventually become growingly aggressive and lead to a large amount of deaths until we see Melanie with Mitch and his family leave Bodega Bay. The scenes where the birds are orchestrating attacks are so concise and so realistic for the time period. Even today just watching I am still shocked by the eye gouge scene which will probably go down in history as the best constructed suspense scene of all time. I grew up watching all of the greatest films ever made and The Birds was no exception to that. The first time I saw the film I was 6! My parents did not think true artistry and creativity should be censored so watching graphic movies when I was young was a regular occurrence. I watched the film again since I had not seen it for a good 10 years and wanted to write a concise review and was absolutely blown away. I have a completely different perspective on Hitchcock. I always recognized him as a master of horror but now recognize him as the master of horror. One thing in particular I noticed that I had not noticed before is there is no score. No music at all for that matter. The only stark sounds you hear regularly is the squawking of the birds which in my opinion was exceptionally done. Growing up in rural Pennsylvanian I have only a vague idea of what a seagull sounds like but from what I do know the sounds of the birds sounded very accurate. The Birds is what nightmares are made of, and Hitchcock effectively made what most people see as gentle peaceful and stoic creatures into vicious predators that will forever make viewers of the film do a double glance when they see or hear a flock of birds, I know I still do!"
"quinimdb","9","0","1","30 March 2016"," My Favorite Hitchcock Film
","There is a famous quote from Hitchcock that goes something like this: ""Suppose two people are having a conversation at a dinner table and there is a bomb underneath this table. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, ""Boom!"" There is an explosion. The public is surprised, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene, of no special consequence. Now suppose that the audience knows there is a bomb underneath the table and they know when it will explode. That is suspense.""<br/><br/>Now I was paraphrasing that quote a bit, but my point is that of all of Hitchcock's films, this analogy applies best to ""The Birds"". Consider for instance the scene in which Melanie is waiting outside the school for Annie and the birds have already been established as a threat. It starts by Melanie sitting down on the bench, and in the background you can see a bird fly down onto a metal structure on the playground. She is waiting for the children to finish their song, but it keeps getting longer and longer, and it keeps cutting away to show birds coming down, one at a time, each time you think the song will be over. Eventually Melaniece notices a bird flying above her, and the shot of the bird flying is held for a while, so you begin to suspect something sinister about to happen. Then the bird comes down onto the metal structure, the camera still following it, to reveal the entire playground covered in a field of birds. <br/><br/>This isn't the only scene like this in the movie, however. In fact, practically the entire movie is like this. OK, yes, the special effects are a bit dated in some scenes, but that definitely doesn't take anything away from the overall terror of the birds. The thing that makes this film so suspenseful is the idea that the birds are constantly lurking over this town, and they can strike at any moment. This is thanks in no small part to the sound design. Even in the moments where you believe the characters are safe, you'll here a squawk or a flutter of Wings somewhere near them. And in the attack scenes, let's just say whatever the special effects lack in these scenes, the sound design makes up for. There is no non-diegetic music in this film, only the overwhelming squawking and screeching and scratching of hundreds of birds.<br/><br/>The fact that they never truly reveal why the birds are attacking people definitely adds to the suspense, but it really isn't relevant anyway. The birds are really a metaphor for the pressure the mother (and mothers in general) feel when the last person they truly understand is being taken away from them, and the pressure that Melanie (and Mitch to some extent) feels when the mother is trying to cling to Mitch and push Melaine away.<br/><br/>One interesting scene is the one that takes place in the diner. An old woman overhears Melanie talking on the phone about the birds, and decides to give them her two cents. She seems to empathize with them, saying they are misunderstood and mistreated by humans. A man comes in and says they are evil creatures and deserve to be killed. Then a mother who has heard the conversation from the beginning chimes in and says it doesn't matter, all she cares about is protecting her children. This scene adds to the metaphor by showing how other people view mothers and finally how a mother thinks. The old woman empathizes with the mothers.

","Melanie Daniels is a beautiful, spunky San Francisco socialite who meets handsome bachelor Mitch Brenner in a bird shop and pursues him to his home town of Bodega Bay, with the excuse of giving his little sister a pair of lovebirds for her birthday.<br/><br/>There, she meets the other women in Mitch's life; old flame, Annie Hayworth, his little sister Cathy and his emotionally fragile mother, Lydia who is immediately suspicious of her and her motivations.<br/><br/>The birds in Bodega Bay then start acting hostile, first towards Melanie then attacking the residents with increasing savagery until they are coming down chimneys and pecking their way through doors and windows, so not even staying indoors is safe.<br/><br/>The movie predates Jaws by over a decade but shares a similar 'nature hunts man' theme. Instead of coming up from the depths of the ocean, this threat swoops down from the skies, squawking and pecking.<br/><br/>No reason or motivation is given for the attacks, leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions, though some have speculated that Melanie is the catalyst as she is the symbolic 'cuckoo' that doesn't 'belong.' And it would certainly seem that the small town residents don't quite know what to make of her and her fancy clothes and makeup (my favourite reaction is the boatman's when she hands the love bird cage to him after she hires a small motor boat to cross the bay in order not to be seen driving up the road to Mitch's house), though various scenes in the movie point to there being attacks in other parts of the country which debunks this theory.<br/><br/>As this is a Hitchcock movie suspense and mystery is a given, though it is also one of his most graphic movies; where Psycho only implies penetration with a knife, The Birds blatantly shows the bloody sockets of a man with his eyes pecked out - quite a bold film-making choice at a time when graphic violence in movies wasn't 'the norm.'<br/><br/>Another unusual but effective creative choice was to not include a music score, giving the movie an eerily quiet feel.<br/><br/>While some say that The Birds doesn't have a 'proper' ending, as Hitchcock wanted to end the movie on an image of the Golden Gate Bridge covered in birds but it was too ambitious and expensive to accomplish at the time, his original vision is the ending I always picture in my head whenever I watch and would not be opposed to seeing this digitally realised in the future.<br/><br/>On a technical and intellectual level I know this isn't considered Hitchcock's best movie but it is a personal favourite of mine."

","... if you think about it. Total freedom due to their power of flight, eyesight many more times powerful than ours, little beady eyes ... well. I raised birds for decades and can say that without a doubt, the eyes are the first thing birds peck out, whether fatally as in this film, or to the point of blinding, as in how my chickens and finches attacked dying or simply ill birds in my flocks. It happened in my aviary.<br/><br/>But back to The Birds; I saw it again after some years and welcomed the buildup of suspense such as the gas station flameout, while having forgotten the love story. It's a usual love story, filled with stupid/silly things we do and say when that old attraction starts. In this case, attraction escalates to a life and death situation, with manly Taylor saving his entire family for as far as we can see. What happened on the way to Santa Rosa, we can only guess.<br/><br/>Effects were all right for the period, with visible lines about the birds' outlines, which now I realize were from green screen. As a kid, they looked weirdly ghostlike. What impressed more as a former aviary keeper was the incredible patience which the bird wranglers must have employed to keep those birds in position! As for the actors, I felt sorry for Pleshette and her devotion to Taylor which has shaped her life and death, Hedren whose lack of a reliable mother seems to be filled with Tandy's solid presence, and little Cartwright, whose 11 year old heart was made happy by lovebirds and whose party was ruined. And for critics, there was a 19 year spread between Big Brother Taylor and Little Sister Cartwright, sort of long but not unheard of. My mother had the same spread between us four kids."

","I think this film is good because it contains many ideas which make audience attract unconsciously. First, I think lovebirds are the symbols of weakness. In this film, both weakness and strength are compared in many scenes. Melanie looks like a tough woman. Her outlook is strong â€• her posture, she wears shoes with very high heels and her nail color is vivid red. When Mitch's sister is attacked by birds, Melanie helps her. But when Melanie is attacked, she could not avoid birds' attack by herself so she is helped by Mitch. In the last scene, although Melanie and Mitch's mother are not good at each other, when Melanie is injured, she is even helped by Mitch's mother. And also Mitch's sister helps lovebirds at the end of the film. It shows that people have to help a weak man and if they do not help him, he cannot live. For example, Mitch's ex-girlfriend is killed because she could be helped by no one.<br/><br/>Second is that there are some relationships between this film and other Hitchcock's films. For example, relationship between mother and son appear in all films. And always mother loves her son strongly and she feels jealousy for other women. In the birds, Mitch's mother loves Mitch strongly and she does not like Melanie but in this film, there is Mitch's sister too. His mother says ""if Mitch disappears, I will be alone."" But it is not true. If he disappears, there will be her daughter, she won't be alone. It means she cannot love her daughter really, only love Mitch. The role of Mitch's sister is to accentuate of the strength of mother's love to her son."

Its filled with absurd logic of Birds attacking humans for no reason which is so chaotic when you are in the middle of the movie. As the story progressed it had vivid touch of thrill and how nature as in mother nature termed as god can take decisions on its hands when it disapproves of a decision of a human. But why affect the whole Bodega Bay. A very different concept which opens up mind to possibilities which are still yet to be interpreted.

","In many ways, The Birds is quite a strange film. It's got a plot that is very different for the time period let alone now and flaws that would ruin most films. That said, it's still one the finest horror films around. It's 60's horror that still works.<br/><br/>Set in 1963, it has a simple plot involving an island plot getting attacked by killer birds. It was a highly anticipated film for Alfred Hitchcock as it was the next film after his massive hit, Psycho.<br/><br/>Even though common but always to me to be a flaw regardless of the director, is how Hitchcock creates suspense. Set through the first act, he creates an act that makes the film progressively slow and loses touch with these characters and the film is much longer because of this set-up. The leads of Rod Taylor and Jessica Tandy put out good performances that continues on through the later acts and it's career marks for both of them.<br/><br/>The film enters what I call it's ""legendary style"" in the birds scenes. The effects are no doubt showing age close to fifty years in but it is still groundbreaking. From the attacks at the school to it's ending, the horror here is revolutionary with a creepy vibe with 60's blood. These are the type of scenes that create inspiration to come and created one more of a mark in the film world for Hitchcock.<br/><br/>This is not my absolute favorite Hitchcock film nor my favorite horror film but it is still great for the nostalgia, it's purpose and to see one of the greatest filmmakers with another memorable highlight to his career"

","If you like suspenseful horror/thrillers with elements of drama and humour then you need to see Hitchcock's 1963 classic 'The Birds'. The most cunning mind in the history of cinema shows off his expertise here, so much that the film is just as eerie and chilling when the feathered antagonists aren't on the screen.<br/><br/>Just when you think you've got it all figured out, the story presents itself in an even more complicated fashion, making 'The Birds' not only twisted and scary, but also the timeless classic that it still is today. I'd say 'I'm still watching it in 2013' but I don't want to sound like a tool.<br/><br/>Maybe it says more about me and my twisted sense of humour, but watching school children get attacked by a mass flock of birds is just so enjoyable, I know it's not very technical of me but I just love it when you see one child lying down, getting repeatedly pecked by a bird. The darkness also continues into the film's ending, as it seems to be at its eeriest when the birds are at their calmest, concluding on a real question mark. (I hope this paragraph didn't make me look like a terrible person, believe me I wouldn't want that to happen in real life)<br/><br/>With no real need for an all-out score or soundtrack; this movie is at its scariest when it's at its quietest. Also notable is its formidable cast; including (and introducing) Tippi Hedren who not only served as a fine lead actress, but has also shown us people of the 21st century that socialites were seemingly a big more dignified back then than they are now, not that that's a complete compliment.<br/><br/>****"

The story was boring, but the movie was entertaining, to say the least.<br/><br/>Second, you could definitely tell it was made in the 1960s. Unlike The Exorcist, the special effects were...laughably bad. But I understand they didn't have much technology then, so it's OK. The ""disturbing"" sound the birds made sounded more like angry cat meows than birds. It made me laugh every time. The green screen effect was just ridiculous. Plus the blood you could tell wasn't real, especially when we see Annie's dead, bloody face. Also, the ""guy"" with his eyes pecked out looks like a wooden figure. It probably was.

","One of the reasons I like this film is because it takes place in my backyard, so to speak. I happen to live in the area where it was filmed and that's one of the reasons I enjoy watching it. Having said that, and being a Hitchcock fan, I definitely don't think this was anywhere up to his standards.<br/><br/>I don't expect there to be a reason given for the bird attacks. That's a mystery and will remain one. What I can't get behind are some of the incredibly cheesy situations and silly dialogue. The conversation between Melanie and Annie for instance, after Melanie returns from having dinner with Mitch and his family. Annie goes into this whole explanation of Lydia's character and why she behaves the way she does. Yet, she says, Lydia is not a jealous, possessive mother????? When she relates her own experiences with Mitch and Lydia, Melanie makes the comment 'that adds up to a jealous possessive mother', or something along those lines. 'No', says Annie, she's not afraid of losing Mitch, she's just afraid of being abandoned'. Did I miss something here? I can't believe that Hitchcock allowed such senseless, pointless dialogue between his characters.<br/><br/>Later Annie is found dead in front of her house, yet she manages to push Cathy inside, and Cathy doesn't have a scratch on her. Okay, maybe there is a way this could have happened but it does stretch the imagination a bit. Speaking of Cathy, I found the kid to be irritating beyond words. Fortunately for her, Veronica Cartwright's acting has greatly improved in the intervening years but she sure couldn't act in this film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I find this film to be enjoyable and I watch it time and again. Despite the cheesiness and frequently contrived situations and the less than stellar characters, I think it's very entertaining. I just find it hard to believe it's a Hitchcock film."

","1st watched 3/9/2007 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Strange yet hypnotic psychological horror movie from the never predictable Alfred Hitchcock. The movie starts out as the lead character, played by Tippi Hedren, meets the male lead in a pet store and then begins an almost stalker-like obsessive trek to find this man(ala. Jimmy Stewart going after Kim Novak in Vertigo except the sexes are reversed). Once she finds him in a small bay town and gives his sister a gift of two love-birds, the local birds start acting strange; first attacking her and then everyone and everything else. Along the way, we find out bits & pieces about many of the character's lives turning it into a bit of a drama until the final attacks of the birds in the last third of the movie. At this point it becomes more of a standard horror flick until the end. The question keeps coming up about why the birds are doing this and why now?? We never find this out and the movie ends extremely abruptly lending us to wonder what this was all about. Despite this, the movie does more than most movies these days -- it keeps your attention. Hitchcock seems to always be able to do this no matter what the subject is. This time it just happens to be birds and relationships in a small bay town, the next time maybe a weirdo in a hotel??"
"Cristiano-A","8","0","2","4 March 2007"," The frightening vengeance from Nature
","From the idea that common birds could attack people for no reason, the suspense master Hitchcock created a classic thriller. From ancient times, Men dominated birds, caged and embalmed them as trophies. What would happen if, suddenly, all the birds joined together and rebelled against us? The answer is given on the movie: we wouldn't have a chance of surviving. The movie is based on a story by Daphne Du Maurier. The difficulties of carrying out this task were enormous. The special effects were huge for that time, when there were no computers. Ubi Werk won a nomination to the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, but lost the prize to Cleopatra. Hitchcock used several kind of birds to simulate the attacks: real birds, trained birds, mechanical birds and even embalmed ones. In the beginning, The Birds is like a romantic movie, with the casual encounter of Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a pet store. But when Melanie travels to Bodega Bay to surprise him with two love-birds, the movie twist the mood. A seagull attacks Melanie and, suddenly, the birds start to attack people everywhere. The blood becomes visible, the destruction and the dead appear in all Bodega Bay area. Hitchcock appeals to successive and quick big plans to show the victims of this mysterious evil. The visual horror is combined with silence, only interrupted by the sound made by the birds. Robert Boyle, who was responsible for the scenarios, said that he was inspired by the painting The Scream by Edvard Munch, for the feeling of desolation and madness in a kind of inner solitude. One of the mythic scenes of the film is when, near the school, Tippi Hedren, dressed with the green tailleur she wore during the all film, is seated in a bench smoking a cigarette. We hear the children singing in school and, slowly, the crows begin to join behind her. A little later, there are hundreds of crows, quiet, waiting to attack. It's interesting that the director who always approached the theme of guilt, and how this guilt affected people, made a movie where the evil appears, in a pure state, and where the guilt isn't there."

","This is probably my least favorite Hitchcock film. Many of the reviewers seemed unnecessarily troubled by the lack of explanations in the plot. That ambiguity, of course, was part of the plot. Why did the birds suddenly organize and attack? We don't know. Not knowing why the threat exists is part of the terror. We take for granted that birds are just a non-threatening part of the scenery in our lives. What, says Hitchcock, would happen if birds, especially birds not particularly known as hunters like gulls and crows and ordinary starlings, suddenly and inexplicably appeared to start to prey on human beings. The birds are eco-terrorists, if you will. Clearly humanity has done something to ruffle the birds' tail-feathers. Caging them, as with the lovebirds, is perhaps the cause. Perhaps the cause is pesticide use or pollution. Whatever the cause, the birds are mad as hell and not going to take it any more. What that idea amounts to is a pretty good story line for for an installment of the Alfred Hitchcock Hour, but not quite enough meat for a feature film. Add to that some mediocre acting by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren in the lead roles (there was no chemistry between them whatsoever) and you have the recipe for a disappointing effort from Hitchcock. While I will admit that this movie scared the bejesus out of me when I first saw it on TV at age 8, it's really not all that frightening. It is ironic that in a film where birds are portrayed as apparently up in arms over their mistreatment by humans, in at least some scenes, Hitchcok had stage hands physically throwing live birds at Tippi Hedren to enhance the bird attack sequences. Overall, though, the bird attacks come off as pretty hokey. The general chaos scenes are pretty good, but the close ups are so obviously mechanical birds as to be laughable. I absolutely hate the sequence of shots where Hedren tracks the flow of the gas from the gas station to the man lighting his cigar -- the facial reactions are just a little too much, especially since all she's doing is watching the flow. This film is okay as a light diversion, but if you seek out the Hitchcock Hour on DVD, you will find many episodes that are more worthwhile than this mediocre movie."

","The film starts out interestingly enough with Mitch Brenner checking out Annie Hayworth in a bird store, claiming he would like to purchase a pair of love birds. Annie and Mitch end up knowing each other from a some sort of court dispute. Mitch needles Annie much to her disliking and promptly leaves the store. Annie manages to get his license plate number and decides to buy him some love birds, perhaps feeling she's misunderstood and this is a way to win him over. She drives the birds to the address she tracks down from his plate and drops off the birds. Mitch sees her and promptly catches up to her, asking her to stay for dinner. The birds in the area start to act a little aggressive and increasing in numbers. As usual, no one in the beginning believes the situation will get out of hand. I actually liked Jessica Tandy's character as Mitch's mother Lydia more often than I liked Mitch. Mitch convinces everyone to stay at the house and wait the attack out. Every good film has an antagonist and there are several in this film. The plot could have been developed more as far as how Annie and Mitch work out their differences. Lydia leaves the house one morning and we could swear Annie and Mitch hit the sheets during her absence, though nothing is shown except how affectionate and close they are when Lydia returns.<br/><br/>One minor note is that Mitch's younger sister looks more like she could be his daughter, but this doesn't detract from the film. I enjoyed Suzanne Pleshette's teacher character and found her to be the most engaging character in the whole film.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film with excellent directing, cinematography and film editing. The plot of how birds can increase in numbers and attack people is believable in my opinion, especially with today's bird flu epidemics and such. If you've ever eaten food on an East coast beach, some birds will swoop down at you with a few getting a little too close. I wasn't disappointed with the ending -- it leaves the idea of what happens next to both imagination and a possible sequence."

Those are my negatives, but otherwise the film was scary and vintage Hitch, always with the ""master's touch"". His humor is often not far below the surface.<br/><br/>The screenplay is superior to DeMaurier's short story in that it broadened the scope a bit and brought real people into the mix. The special effects were spectacular and the acting convincing. The town of Bodega Bay as presented by Hitchcock was in perfect bucolic juxtaposition to the terrifying concept of nature gone wrong.

I think Hitchcock built this film around the idea that the characters find themselves in an incomprehensible peril. After all, why do birds attack people? Why do people get attacked by birds? We find no motive; we don't understand. Besides the eye-gouging and attacks on children, the randomness of the attacks is the true horror."

","Ask different people what the best Alfred Hitchcock film is, and you will hear a variety of responses. Some will say Vertigo, some Rear Window, some Notorious, some Psycho, some North by Northwest.some may even go for his earlier works, like Shadow of a Doubt, The 39 Steps, or The Lady Vanishes.<br/><br/>One title you do not often hear is The Birds. Many regard it as an inferior film, because it does not have the character or plot complexities of any of the aforementioned films. There is a difference, however, between choosing a ""best"" film and a ""favorite"" one. It's easy to make a statement such as ""Citizen Kane is a better movie than Gigli"". As far as objective criteria go (if there really are such things in film), the disparity is obvious.<br/><br/>However, you cannot as easily make a statement like ""Citizen Kane is a better movie than Casablanca"". Where is the basis for calling one better than the other? In terms of character development, plot, theme, direction, and cinematography, both are superior films. Beyond that, there are too many intangibles and qualities left to subjective fancy. For that reason, it is much more sensible to say, ""I enjoy Citizen Kane more than Casablanca"", or vice versa.<br/><br/>By that token, I could easily argue that The Birds is inferior to many other Hitchcocks. However (and I'm sure this will outrage many Hitchcock cinéastes), no Hitchcock film I have seen thus far has entranced me and hit me at a gut level the way The Birds has.<br/><br/>Federico Fellini (who places The Birds among his top ten favorite films) dubbed it an ""apocalyptic poem""; an appropriate phrase, because the film has an uncanny ability to ostracize the normal world to which we are accustomed and eerily suggest the world's end. As soon as we follow Tippi Hedren (as Melanie Daniels) into the confines of Bodega Bay, we pass through a membrane into an alternate reality. There is something removed and quiet about this seaside town...too quiet.<br/><br/>As with Psycho, Hitchcock was less concerned with complex character and plot, and much more interested in brutally invading the viewer's consciousness. And as with Psycho, he starts with a seemingly innocent premise, drops in subtle, disquieting shards of foreboding, and takes things in shocking new directions.<br/><br/>I still remember the chills that went up my spine when I first saw Melanie, early in the film, alone in her boat, quietly paddling through the bay. The air was still, the breeze gentle...but I couldn't help feeling that this was a tranquility that was not meant to last.<br/><br/>As suspense goes, this is Hitchcock in top form. He foreshadows in small bits that make tiny increments as the film progresses, and each increment gives an air of impending doom, but also cinematic beauty.<br/><br/>At one point in the film, when a front door is opened to reveal a dead bird on the front porch (the result of a kamikaze flight), there is certainly a sense of dread, but also of a perverse aesthetic. We know this is a moment planted for the purpose of scaring us (and preparing us for greater terror), and yet remarkably, even this knowledge is useless in detaching ourselves from the raw power of the image.<br/><br/>The storyline and acting quality of the two leads are mediocre, but deliberately so. Tippi Hedren, whose Melanie opens the film as a spoiled, upper-class brat (complete with a history of capricious sojourns in Europe), engages in a pathetically adolescent game of one-upmanship with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), who begins by making a fool out of her in a bird shop. The so-called MacGuffin (a term coined by Hitchcock to describe a device for catalyzing plot advancement) is a cage of lovebirds, a seemingly innocent symbol at the center of Melanie's childish games, but one that will have surprising resonance by film's end.<br/><br/>The intonation of the dialogue between Melanie and Mitch is flat and dry, delivered with little dramatic impact, yet in its own quirky way, it is charming. It is interesting to ponder where this relationship will take us. Consider Jimmy Stewart's first encounter with Kim Novak in Vertigo, Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in Psycho, or Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotton in Shadow of a Doubt. When considering Hitchcock's repertoire, the initial tension between Melanie and Mitch suggests a relationship through which the story will weave its themes and plot twists.<br/><br/>Yet in true Hitchcock fashion, he is seducing us into following a certain path with the intention of yanking us in a completely different direction. Of course, this is partially due to the influence of Daphne Du Maurier's short story (of same title), but it is through Hitchcock's vision that events come to life in ways no written word could express.<br/><br/>The initial tension, the lovebirds, the flirty games are all tools used to the end of getting us (through Melanie) to Bodega Bay, where Mitch resides with his mother (Jessica Tandy) and child sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright, in one of her first film roles). Once there, we anticipate the expected plot advancement. Wait a minute...why is it so quiet? I haven't heard much dialogue. And where is the background score?<br/><br/>***Spoiler Point!! Do not read on if you haven't seen the film!!!!***<br/><br/>This is exactly where Hitchcock wants us to be. When we first see gulls appear (just a few, which are suddenly dropped into the frame), it feels unnatural, as if they are invading on the movie. And when a single gull swoops down and takes a chunk out of Melanie's head, it is like a sudden electric shock that tweaks us out of our comfortable premonitions.<br/><br/>From here on out, everyone is a victim of circumstance. The most important issue at hand is no longer the relationship between Melanie and Mitch, but the fight against a primal force of unimaginable horror.<br/><br/>While the two leading performances are not well-acted (again, deliberately so), the three most prominent supporting roles are intensely satisfying from a dramatic point of view.<br/><br/>Veronica Cartwright's initial acting presence seems forced, but one must keep in mind that Hitchcock is presenting her as a typical pre-teen. As such, the seemingly contrived nature of Cathy's initial dialogue deceives us. When Cartwright must transform Cathy into a girl suddenly in the midst of horrors that no child should have to witness, the result is frightening. Her terror and hysteria are completely convincing.<br/><br/>Jessica Tandy and Suzanne Pleshette (as Annie Hayworth, a former love interest of Mitch) add fascinating layers of depth to Bodega Bay and enhance the town's otherworldly ambience with details of their pasts. We initially attribute their struggles to Mitch, but as the film goes on, we see that the town itself has as much of a role as Mitch does.<br/><br/>I could talk about the cutting-edge special effects by which Hitchcock and his team created the illusion of several bird attacks (and the effects are indeed impressive), but I would be beating a dead horse, since this is the area of the film that draws repeated attention.<br/><br/>Instead, I'll refer to my favorite scene in the entire film, which ironically is one that does not feature a single bird. It is the diner scene in which all of the important characters gather in the midst of the frenzied bird attacks and attempt to deliberate as to what has happened and what action should be taken. This scene is remarkably trenchant and powerful in an almost allegorical fashion.<br/><br/>Among others, we have a blithering drunk who recites apocalyptic Biblical passages, an overly cerebral ornithologist who denies the attacks simply because they do not adhere to logic, an overprotective mother who demands silence because her children are getting scared (thus attempting to deny what is really happening and sheltering her feeble notion of a perfect world).<br/><br/>Later, after another attack transpires and denial is no longer an option, the mother panics and irrationally pins the blame Melanie, attacking her as a supernatural curse, a witch that has bedeviled the community. Melanie's immediate response constitutes one of my favorite moments in the film.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the terror that this film so poetically elicits can be attributed to the ornithologist's claim; in fact, on more than one occasion, someone mentions that the attacks just don't make ""logical sense"". The birds attack without reason. We are not enemies, aggressors, or threats of any kind. It does not seem to matter. We just know that they are killers, and they apparently have their sights set on us, releasing their fury in a primal catharsis of Freudian proportions.<br/><br/>When logic can no longer explain surrounding phenomenon, what does one turn to for explanation? There is no single right answer, but you will find an almost clinical depiction of human attempts at a right answer in that diner scene.<br/><br/>As a result, there is again a perverse beauty to our voyeuristic views of human struggle against the end of the world, which the uncontrollable bird attacks so blatantly suggest. We see the superficialities of day-to-day existence broken down, and when the veneer disappears, we are witness to the most instinctive, genuine facets of human nature."

","Hitchcock's 'The Birds', is not quite the masterpiece that ranks with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window', but it's still interesting. The film was probably quite influential in the movie trend of having animals of all types attack, and that may not be a good thing. Bees, ants, cats, dogs, spiders, bats, fish, bears and rats are some of the animals used in such films, and I'm sure that guinea pigs, harbor seals, and penguins are in the works by pioneering animal attack auteurs.<br/><br/>   The viewer has to suspend their disbelief that sparrows and sea gulls are deadly minions of human destruction, but the special effects and credibility gap make that kind of a stretch. People may think that with today's CGI effects that this film is perfect for a remake, and maybe so, but can't the movie viewing public encourage fresh ideas with our movie dollar votes? Hitchcock tried to cultivate a sense of uneasiness throughout the film, a creepiness and mystery that makes the viewer feel that weird things are possible, but I mostly felt that through Jessica Tandy's strange performance as the mother. <br/><br/>  All in all, not a terrible film, and fun as a Hitchcock time capsule sort of film, but not one of Hitchcock's best by a long shot."

","""The Birds"" might seem a little dated to many viewers of this generation, but do not be fooled,- this is a pure classic!!! Sure, the acting is typically a bit wooden at times, but remember,..this is 1963.Rod Taylor is great,and frankly the setting of Bodega Bay is just perfect.But really, the true stars of this little flick are none other then the Birds themselves.Squawking, pecking, biting, screeching menaces in the form of Seagulls and Crows.One of the more interesting aspects of this Hitchcock masterpiece is that what went wrong, and what caused the Birds to go homicidal and aggressive is never explained,exposed, or understood.Therefore, the viewer is left to his or her own conclusions on this matter.<br/><br/>It can be argued that The Birds is the movie that spawned so many of the later ""Nature-Goes- Beserk-and attacks- Man"" films.For starters,I can think of a number of plot devices and similiar scenes borrowed from The Birds in ""Squirm"", the 1976 Jeff Lieberman shocker about electrically charged bloodworms that terrify a small Georgia town.SPOILERS: Both films have a paranoid, emotionally unstable and elderly mother,..both films have a young,good-looking hero surrounded by 3 or more females,..and they also feature attack sequences in a darkened,isolated house with the use of a flashlight,and wooden boards to protect the windows and block the invading perps,..in this case vicious Bloodworms or Seagulls and Crows bent on malice.In both films the invading critters gain access into the home via the ceiling, in the case of The Birds this is the upstairs bedroom in which Ms. Daniels wanders foolishly into whilst all other parties are downstairs asleep.Again in both films we see close-ups of the critters mouths and/or beaks,..also there is a public attack scene revolving around a diner/pub.In The Birds, a Seagull makes an abnormal appearance by flying into the door,killing itself.In Squirm, a worm disgustingly shows up in a glass of chocolate milk.Both are chillingand  signs of what is to come....and in The Birds, we have a pair seagulls attatched to a poor gentleman's face, in Squirm, we have a repulsive scene in which the Bloodworms are literally eating their way into a guy's face.Last but not least, both movies offer scenes of gasoline and fire,which is kind of a vague paralell,but nonetheless a parelell.<br/><br/>Well, one difference is that what happened to The Birds is never explained, but what happened to the Worms is chalked up to electricity from fallen powerlines.Either way, The Birds is a darn good flick, and textbook Hitchcock.I give it a 7 out of 10."

","*Possible Spoilers* I have watched this movie many times now, and it seems to get better with each viewing. Admittedly, the FX now look very dated in this age of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord Of The Rings"" - but don´t the FX in ""Superman"" also look dated now?. All very well if the film were dependant on FX alone, but ""The Birds"" appears to operate on a much-more complicated level. It´s a movie ""about"" so many different things - it almost appears to be ""about"" whatever the viewer wants it to be ""about"". And just who are ""The Birds"" anyway?. To fend off unexplained attacks by our feathered friends, the main characters have to barricade themselves into their house, which almost literally becomes their cage. Caged in like lovebirds, in fact. Well, virtually. As for the celebrated attack by the birds on Tippi Hendron as she investigated noises in an upstairs bedroom. Was Tippi mad or what?. She had ""seen"" what these unusual birds could do, yet she chose to investigate rustlings that could only emenate from one source. Undaunted, she steps into the room with her flashlight - which attracts the attention of the birds. She is lucky she didn´t end up as dead as a dodo."

","This is a great horror film but a mediocre Hitchcock film.

The ending was abrupt and left me feeling very unfulfilled. However, don't let me discourage you from watching it...

"hveiti","6","0","2","28 November 2000"," Underrated script, overrated effects
","The thing that struck me the most about this film is its brilliant script. Funnily enough, this is in direct contradiction to a lot of people's perceptions of the film; most find the script to be nonsensical and the characters one-dimensional, citing the suspense and the special effects as the film's strongest points.  While I will admit that the characters (or, indeed, the performances) aren't exactly the greatest I've ever seen in a film, it's the advancement, the mechanics and the allegory of the plot that do it for me.  I hate to echo or copy others, but zetes's 'freudian analysis' of this film (found in the user comments section of this site) was totally spot-on.  The bird attacks were symbolic representations of Mitch's mother's antipathy towards her son's love interests, and seen from this perspective the whole movie makes perfect sense, particularly the ending.<br/><br/>Also great is the way the budding love affair between Melanie and Mitch is stripped of its childish veneer when they're faced with real danger. Their relationship never feels fake or contrived to me; even though they aren't the most realistic characters ever put to celluloid, it is clear that the movie is always to some extent a love story.  It's a far cry from the manufactured, crowd-pleasing ""love-interest"" aspects of today's thrillers, and added greatly to my enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are all good, as can be expected from a Hitchcock film.  The special effects were no doubt marvelous for their time, and the lack of a score gives a realistic atmosphere that adds to the effect nicely (hundreds of birds shrieking incessantly will chip away at anyone's composure).  However, despite being well made, the film didn't have quite the massive effect on me that I thought it would.  Maybe it's my ILM-addled sensibilities talking, or maybe my expectations were just a bit too high going in.  In any case, such gripes notwithstanding one thing is for certain: by any standards, today's or yesterday's, this is good cinema. 8/10"

","I've seen Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" several times, the last time perhaps 25 years or so ago.  Recently, my brother rented it on video and I decided to watch it again.  I have to say that this film has not worn well with time. The technical ineptitude of the special effects (especially the ever-obvious and oft-repeated still prop with a moving background behind it, as in the view out the rear window of a car as it's ""moving"") was a tremendous distraction.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by advances made in special effects, but this was just too distracting - I couldn't help it, I was ""pulled out of the story"" again and again by the old-style ""special effects.""  To put it mildly, they stink.  Also, the hitchcockian formula has been copied and copied and copied and copied again... so many times, that it ""feels like"" we're watching yet another copy, although it's not the case.  I found myself generally bored with ""The Birds,"" although I loved it as a child and young teenager.  It just has not stood the test of time well.  Hitchcock may be a true original, but his imitators have surpassed him at this point in almost every area.  Recognizing the original ""master of the scare,"" I gave this movie 7/10... but watching ""The Birds"" in the year 2000, not only was I not-scared, I was not even entertained."
"mezzb","Null","0","1","27 October 1999"," He's done better
","I think Mr. Hitchcock concentrated a bit too much on his experiments and too little on actual scares.  The choice to have no musical score was daring, but the inclusion of subtle musical cues would have only benefited the often flat suspense scenes.  The choice to have the movie end before real resolution did not I feel have the desired effect.  I understand what he was trying to do, but it felt more like they ran out of money or time and said, ""Why don't we just end it here.""  And the other guy says, ""Works for me. Bye.""<br/><br/>The other really annoying thing is that Tippi Hedron's character behaves in such an incredibly foolish manner near the end of the movie (spoilers until the end of this paragraph).  A. Why did she refuse to wake up Mitch, who'd been the absolute hero of the whole scenario and saved her butt a couple of times already, before going up the stairs.  B. Is her reaction upon seeing the birds in the attic realistic? She manages to lock ***herself*** in the room with the birds.  Pretty lame.  You can't chalk it up to shock because she'd been attacked by birds about 7 times that day already.  She should have been bird-savvy by then.  C. It's impossible to believe she had no chance to open the door behind her.  Impossible.  One more thing.  D.  I would have left that wacky maniac-bird infested town long before they went back to the house.  And E. Why did so many people consciously choose to go outside when the birds attacked.  I'll stop here, but I could continue right through ZZ.<br/><br/>All these gripes aside, it's still a decent movie.  The acting is pretty good.  And Hitchcock as usual gave us some 3 (or 2.5) dimensional characters to latch onto and a decent story before bringing the maniac birds on the scene.  It always helps when you care about the characters.  (note to modern genre directors: characters and story are what drive films, not special effects and cheap thrills.  Put together a movie with strong characters, strong story, then add the cheap thrills and effects; now you have good movie.)  And the attacking bird scenes were pretty effective and not as cheesey as you might think for a movie made in the early sixties.<br/><br/>Two and a half stars (out of four).<br/><br/>Take care, Mike"
"luckyhorshues","Null","0","1","28 April 2003"," One of Hitchcock's Finest
","Possible Spoilers Ahead!!<br/><br/>The theme of a movie is the subject of artistic representation; the subject matter which is dealt with through various aspects dictated by the director and enhanced by the actors, editing, lighting, music, and camera techniques. This film's theme, in Hitchcock's own words, is complacency.  Expanding upon that briefly, I would suggest that this film's theme focuses on human relationships and their ultimate instability, regardless of how much we may believe they are secure.  I feel that this is the complacency that Hitchcock refers to; the complacency that comes when humans begin to take things for granted.  Throughout this film we continually see relationship issues surface, predominantly in terms of fear, loneliness and abandonment. While many people think that the first forty or so minutes of the film amount to a slow, boring romantic comedy, these scenes are necessary to establish a pattern of behavior for the actors.  We see how Melanie flits around from one pursuit to another, always keeping a safe emotional distance between herself and the rest of the world (helping to fund a foreign child's education) indicating her emotional detachment and lack of depth and purpose as a person.  Mitch is a well-to-do playboy who still spends weekends with his sister and mother on the lake.  Lydia is Mitch's possessive mother who is absolutely terrified of losing him to another woman.  We see the characters toy with one another's emotions, treat relationships as though they were jokes and refuse to take others' feelings seriously.  If we consider the bird attacks we can see a kind of pattern develop.  The first bird hits Melanie in the head as she is coyly toying with Mitch from the boat, the second crashes into Annie's door as she discusses her own loneliness and dismay over losing Mitch herself, and the third attack, which occurs at Cathy's birthday party, immediately succeeds a conversation between Mitch and Melanie regarding her abandonment as a child and subsequent emotional pain.  Many people are quick to question the attacks on the innocent school children, at a loss any reason why they were ambushed. However, Donald Spotto suggests in his book, The Art of Alfred Hitchcock, that it is a reflection of Lydia's fear that she will lose her own children, particularly Mitch, and wind up all alone.  Lydia's anguish and distress is also emphasized when the birds attack and kill her dear friend Dan Fawcett.<br/><br/>Comparisons are frequently made to other Hitchcock films, particularly Psycho.  Obviously, an evident bird motif is present throughout much of the film.  Anthony Perkins's hobby is taxidermy and the Bates Motel is littered with his work; the beady-eyed creatures constantly peering down on him and Marion.  Such a motif is used as a type of foreshadowing, with Anthony Perkins himself playing a kind of bird of prey.  Many also feel that Janet Leigh had many bird-like qualities and behaviors herself and Marion's last name was `Crane,' a type of bird.  Some even liken Melanie's ascent up the stairs and near death after the bird attack to the legendary shower sequence in Psycho. The Birds is considered one of Hitchcock's finest masterpieces and an example of his great plot/dialogue techniques are best displayed in the opening sequence as Melanie enters the bird shop.  A man whistles at her as she crosses the street and she looks back with a satisfied little grin, illustrating her need for outside approval and the pleasure she receives from a vain little ego boost.  She then glances at the sky and comments on the dark mass of birds gathering - a foreshadowing of events to come. From there, she immediately enters the store, where all the birds are safely locked in their cages, posing no threat at all to human civilization and accomplishment.  In another presage, one of the birds escapes its cage briefly, wrecking momentary havoc in the artificial human world.  This masterfully sets up the basic plot for the entire movie in a single opening sequence. A second example of Hitchcock's dexterity can be seen in his camera angle technique, particularly in relation to Melanie. The angle is continuously changing throughout the film, at times making the audience feel as though they are Melanie, and at other times that they are watching her.  The sequence where Melanie is delivering the birds to Mitch's house is a prime example of the change in camera angle.  As Melanie boats out to his house the audience looks at Melanie, just as they do when she takes the boat and heads back. We see her spying on Mitch, monitoring his reaction, yet we are not spying with her, but watching her spy.  Conversely, as she writes the birthday note to Cathy explaining the love birds, a subjective shot is used and it seems as though it is our hands doing the writing.  The variation in shots prevents us from completely identifying with her, which ultimately builds tension in us.  We expect her to be attacked suddenly every time she is in a vulnerable spot, yet she doesn't have any idea of her vulnerability. If we were to identify with her, we would similarly have no idea what was coming.  That would certainly make for a scarier movie when the birds ambushed, but it would come nowhere near the suspense we feel waiting nervously for Melanie to be assailed. Hitchcock is one of the world's greatest directors and The Birds has long been considered one of his greatest films.  Using what at the time were state-of-the-art special effects, he created a suspenseful thriller which is still winning audiences over today."

","The mastery Alfred Hitchcock displays in the Birds has no comparison to any other horror movie ever. First of all, the characters are perfectly described and no mere cliches that nobody cares for (very usual in this movie genre). I wouldn't like to point any of them, but I think Melanie (portrayed by the beautiful Tippi Hedren stands above the rest). Also Jessica Tandy as Rod Taylor's mother is equally standout. That's important, very important in this type of movie, cause when they face danger, we CARE about their fate. Second, the birds. I think the most frightening scene ever seen on the silver screen, is that of the siege of the Breener's house (Rod Taylor's family). We see nothing,..but we HEAR ,thus allowing our imagination to think freely. And most important of all, Hitch does not give us an explanation on the subject, nor does he gives us a happy ending. It's pure horror. A masterpiece"
