"Ronin47","9","92","107","4 July 2004"," A blast (***1/2)
","Talk about an appropriate title. <br/><br/>This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch (""Strangers in Paradise"", ""Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai"") that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. <br/><br/>In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. <br/><br/>Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. <br/><br/>Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway.<br/><br/>
For the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like ""Strangers In Paradise"". But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. <br/><br/>The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct ""Waiting For Godot"" feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness.<br/><br/>
It was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. <br/><br/>And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray?"
"danielhsf","6","66","84","11 February 2005"," Breezy absurdist comedy
","--Mild spoilers-- <br/><br/>I haven't seen a single Jarmusch before this and have no knowledge or his style whatsoever, nor have I smoked a cigarette while drinking coffee, but I enjoyed this film immensely.<br/><br/>It doesn't purport to speak of grandiose themes and epic emotions, nor does it go out of its way to be deliberately offbeat and quirky; the audience has no emotional attachment to the characters and there is no plot in most of the vignettes. So what puts this film above all the pretentiously shot black-and-white art-house crap that is slugged out every year? For one thing, it is really funny. From its expressionistic colors to the dialog that proudly smacks of absurdist humor, this film is like a breeze of cool air, utterly enjoyable from the first reel to the last that does not cloy on to the heart, but is very unforgettable.<br/><br/>Ultimately, its unobtrusive absurdist humor, which provokes chuckles instead of heartily laughs, serves to prove the Pinter-esquire themes of the futility of communication. We get a sense that the characters are isolated and desperately trying to touch each other through their speech but ultimately failing to do so; and yet, through their manic speech patterns and delirious pauses, what is unsaid speaks more than what is said itself. While this unconventional style of humor is often difficult to pull off as it might fast become monotonous (as evident in a recent stage production of The Caretaker that I saw), Jarmusch's deft direction with his actors (from their gestures to the way they hold their coffee cups) pushes forth the humor and carries it on steadily throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>It is hard to say much about a film who has nothing much to say. As in my favorite segment, 'No Problem', the one with the two French black guys, their dialog only serves to underscore the meaningless and nothingness of communication. What is scary about it is that it is so accurate, that these type of conversations, however ridiculous and absurd when portrayed on screen, often typifies our daily conversations. It depresses me sometimes that human communication can be easily reduced to all these, and this film makes the point entirely clear.<br/><br/>So it definitely comes as a relief, that as a conclusion, the relatively more heart-warming vignette with the two old guys (Champagne) was chosen. Not only does it touches lightly on the recurring 'acoustic resonance' theme, it also hints that we may in fact touch each other, through common music or through a common idea. And it just happens that that common song was 'I have Lost Track of the World' by Gustav Mahler, an amazing piece by an amazing composer that I have just recently began to love, a delightful moment which shows that although we are as disconnected at the different vignettes in the movie, it is comforting to know that we are still united in some weird cosmic way, like this forum here. And like the two old guys, after our coffee and cigarette break in which we step into an odd world that is not really unfamiliar, we would have to step back in to the real world again. But it doesn't hurt to have a little nap in between and pretend bad coffee is champagne."
"stensson","8","82","109","10 July 2004"," No tea and biscuits
","Short films with nonsense dialogue of shifting dignity. Lots of self irony or even self sarcasm. Tom Waits is mocking with Iggy Pop in a way that it's hard to believe they ever can talk to each other again. Bill Murray is pulling the leg of the hip hop movement and the movement finds that funny. Cate Blanchett is on a genial level playing the double part of the filmstar and her jealous cousin.<br/><br/>Jim Jarmusch can't be beaten. The dialogue seems to be mostly improvised, but the concept is not. Every short chapter here has a meaning and gives us something to think about. The films are in black and white, like coffee and cigarettes and that still is, and will always be, a way of pushing things harder. This is very much comedy and very much serious."
"dawn440","7","33","43","19 March 2006"," It's easy to dip into coffee and cigarettes and meet all the characters but you might get a bit bored by some of their conversations.
","In all honesty I just wanted to watch this movie to see Iggy Pop, Tom Waites, The White stripes and Bill Murray. I was tempted to fast forward all the other vignettes to get to the ones with these characters in but thankfully I never or I would never have seen 'cousins?' -- Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan playing themselves in an absolutely perfect portrayal of the shallow, sickening and repellent nature that comes with fame. Coogan takes the word 'scumbag' to new heights, and Molina's keenness and almost innocence which slowly turns sour is perfectly pitched. Jarmusch has managed to capture the minutia of the trappings of fame so succinctly that sometimes it's difficult to watch. It's excruciatingly embarrassing but just gorgeous and has to be seen -- several times. <br/><br/>Likewise with 'somewhere in California'. Iggy and Tom play themselves but you can call Iggy Jim or Jimmy or Iggy or Jiggy if you like! Tom initially opts to call him Iggy but proceeds to refer to him as Jim throughout, and so the off-kilter banter begins. It's an hilarious portrayal of two guys who obviously have a mutual respect for each other's work but don't actually know each other that well. A series of ridiculous conversations and awkward silences ensue with Iggy becoming more and more animated and expressive to over-compensate for Tom's laidback yet defensive attitude. There are some excellent one-liners and it's just great watching these two giants chew the fat, fighting their different corners and trying to keep their cool. <br/><br/>I also thought Cate Blanchett shone in 'cousins', playing both roles as bitter cousin/ insipid famous cousin. It's another awkward, horrible meeting between two people -- one has made it, the other hasn't, and It's plain to see there isn't much love between them. We witness a series of underhand, loaded and nasty comments all in the guise of friendship, a friendship that only exists due to family ties. <br/><br/>Coffee and cigarettes the movie is a bit like coffee and cigarettes the vice: you'll get a buzz that's for sure. It's is an easy watch and each vignette has its qualities but as a whole it's a bit of a cheeky movie. It gets off on the fact that it has all these fab artists starring in it which goes a long way but not far enough. But I can't stress enough that it really is worth getting this movie out for the Coogan/Molina and Pop/Waites vignettes. Both priceless and essential viewing."
"G-Jax","8","37","50","25 October 2004"," Odd concept works wonders.
","An odd concept for a film, Coffee and Cigarettes can be seen as either one of two ways. On one hand a dark, clever, ingenious piece of cinema, or on the other hand a dark, clever, ingenious piece of cinema. Jarmusch has succeeded in gathering as diverse a cast as you're ever likely to see, the site of GZA, RZA, and Bill Murray waxing intellectual over smokers cough and herbal medicines is enough to interest even the most fervent sceptic of such work. Even the Cate Blanchett (whom i'm not a huge fan of) scene was so well set up and written (or improvised, who knows) that you find your self unable to turn away, so intent are you on what she has to say next. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan are so wonderful as over blown versions of themselves, Coogan as a super arrogant celebrity and Molina as a bumbling, sweet, excitable actor. Together they form what would be the best scene of the whole film, that is if it wasn't for Iggy and Tom. Ah Iggy and Tom, such characters, such dialogue, such a beautifully surreal piece. Iggy (or Jim to his friends) is more like an over nervous school boy than an ageing rock star, and Tom is strong as the defensive perfectionist. All in all this film succeeds in what it tries to do, if you like dark surreal comedy then you'll like this. Be warned though it will give you a craving for Coffee and Cigarettes."

","I loved this movie. Okay, I loved about 75% of it. But I'm glad I saw all of it. I don't smoke, I only drink coffee when it's dressed up in a frilly disguise, and I didn't recognize everyone in the film, nor did I much care about that. I didn't recognize the writer/director's name, though I really enjoyed Night on Earth and Dead Man, and now I know his name. It was just so good to see this parade of tense interaction, waiting on or predicting what would come next. I loved how some of the moments in the first vignette were mimicked in a later one by an entirely ""different"" set of people. <br/><br/>I loved the stark interruptions of uncomfortableness, loved watching all the people pour their coffee or tea, loved the hilarious facial expressions of Molina and Coogan--it seemed to me they were portraying the two most extreme British stereotypes interacting with each other, and it was clearly fun for them. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the cheap, gritty sets, the introductions and goodbyes. I am not sure who the movie would best play for; as I sat and thought about who to share it with, only members of my own family came to mind. We're all a bit quirky, so the best way I can put it is that maybe if you like the ""mockumentaries"" of Christopher Guest, but can appreciate an even darker twist, you'll have a laugh at this. <br/><br/>The boring parts were the shortest, and the vignettes I liked best were so much fun it was worth the whole picture to see them."

","This movie is better than the first reviewer claims. The context of the movie is definitely social, but the humor is only superficially based on the character's real-life celebrity. True, the background music is interesting if you are a film buff. But, take my advice, watch this movies after a couple drinks, at a social gathering, to really enjoy it. The humor is better than in most full length feature comedies. I laughed loud and hard and had a lot of fun when I caught this at the university of Chicago's student movie theater. <br/><br/>the real interest in this film is the social awkwardness created when people meet under false pretense or forced circumstance, versus the natural comfort that is obvious between longtime friends who enjoy each others company.. The gestures and facial expressions by these great actors more than make up for the weaknesses of the film. The brother/sister pairs show boredom and typical familial nit-picking. Iggy and Tom waits are brilliant. buschemi is a little misplaced in the scene where he shows up. my 2 favorite scenes, that i feel show the real genius of jarmusch, are 1.) the moment when molina's gestures have revealed that he is not, as indicated in the first review, a sycophant, but simply an honest and interested human being who is higher up in the scheme of things than the pretentious jerk he tries to befriend; and 2.)the scene where the old guy falls asleep and the camera zooms in on him for a moment, revealing a great moment of humanity."

","""Coffee and Cigarettes"" (2004) written and directed by Jim Jarmush is a very simple movie shot in B/W, a typical in the good sense independent movie. It is a collection of eleven shorts where famous actors, comedians, rock-stars, and musicians played themselves. They drink coffee (lots of it), smoke, and talk. While each segment is short, we still can learn a lot about human nature.<br/><br/>I read some comments and was surprised that there are so many negative opinions. Some users think that the movie was slow - I did not even notice how the time flew. Of eleven shorts, six were wonderful, and the rest - quite watchable. After I finished watching it, I started all over and watched the ones that I loved for a second time. The best, IMO are ""Somewhere in California"" with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, ""Cousins"" - (Cate Blanchette plays a dual role - herself and her not so successful cousin, and she is as good as ever in the dual performance); ""These Things Will Kill You"" (Joe Rigano, Vinny Vella, and Vinny Vella, Jr), ""Cousins?""  easily the best in the bunch (Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan), ""Delirious""  the funniest (RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray), and the final one, the elegiac ""Champagne""  (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead)."
"flickershows","7","30","46","5 July 2004"," Java & Smokes, Bizarre Little Jokes
","Finally, a movie my sister can get behind! With a title like 'Coffee And Cigarettes', health nuts must be having a collective heart attack. And the title isn't ironic. Every single episode in this string-of-vignettes movie has enough java and smokes to murder a truck driver. Bizarro writer/director Jim Jarmusch shot the flick over many years, gathering a wildly disparate cast to co-star in his black and white art film. No scenes are connected (except by the ever-present cigs & a cup o' joe) and each quirky sequence functions as its own self-contained act.<br/><br/>Most of the character's names are just the actor's names, but that doesn't mean they're playing themselves. In reality, Bill Murray might moonlight as a waiter and hang out with the Wu-Tang Clan (who always refer to him as ""billmurray"", one word). Jack & Meg White from the White Stripes might have a remarkable interest in science. And Cate Blachett might have a resentful, rebellious cousin who looks exactly like her (because she's playing both of them). But I doubt it. Those are just a few of the oddball sketches in this movie. In fact, I mentioned those ones first because, of the scenes with the big-name celebrities, they're probably the weakest.<br/><br/>Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan work together in the longest sequence. Molina is courteous and affable, Coogan aloof and mildly interested in why Doc Ock has asked for this meeting. In a gem of warp-speed character development, Molina goes from shy to eager to crushed to bitter. Both men are excellent. Also, musicians Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have similar oil/water chemistry, which is what makes their culture-clash one-upsmanship memorable. Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright set the tone with their jittery, nonsensical opening scene. There's more, but I've forgotten the rest already.<br/><br/>So I didn't reveal much plot. What's there to tell, though? The terrific Molina/Coogan sequence could be lengthened into its own movie, but the rest of this picture wouldn't work if the short scenes played any longer. 'Coffee And Cigarettes' isn't really even about smoke rings or the caffeine rush. Jarmusch and the cast use those as props to create some zany bits with an ""opposites attract...or not"" motif. The flick is funny, a bit too long, and light years away from the mainstream. I enjoyed myself, found my interest bobbing & weaving, then left the theatre. That's okay. Even art films are allowed to be fast food."
"kegl9113","3","6","7","11 February 2008"," One more review for the pile
","I read a whole host of reviews on this site before renting this film, and despite all the warnings, I gave it a chance. Hell, I gave this film more than a chance. I had low expectations but this collection still failed to impress. First of all, I can't even believe some of the reviewers on here had to point out that the shorts are, in fact, connected. Wow, really? With every sketch featuring coffee and cigarettes, dialogue that is reiterated in a number of sketches, and every single damn sketch dealing with a part of the spectrum of social awkwardness; interpreting the themes in this film and making your own connections does not make you an appreciator of finer things, no it merely confirms that you aren't completely retarded.<br/><br/>So let's get off our high horse and stop using the words ""metaphysical"", ""surreal"", and ""existential"" for a moment, and look at what this film does have to offer. Yes, the Molina/Coogan sketch is absolutely brilliant and hilarious. Had this been the only short released to the public, then I never would have anything bad to say about Jarmusch. The Iggy Pop/Tom Waits meeting comes in a close second comedy-wise. Not just a piece of great casting, Waits gives such a natural performance that takes dry humor to a whole new level. Cate Blanchett's dual role is pretty cool and fun to watch, but compared to Nic Cage's dual role in Adaptation (which also came out in 03), this doesn't even come close.<br/><br/>Beyond those three sketches, I don't know what to say. Bill Murray gives a great performance that is ruined by two rappers who clearly needed better direction, there's a sketch titled ""Renee"" that sets up a character who is almost OCD about her coffee and then goes nowhere with it, ""Those Things'll Kill Ya"" plays like a scrapped Seinfeld sketch, ""Twins"" features more bickering that is clearly meant to be comical but never works because there is no chemistry between the actors (who are twins for Christ's sake). I could go on but its a waste of time. The problem is that Jarmusch keeps trying to tell a joke, gets halfway there, and then abandons the punchline because he's trying to paint a bigger picture. It's like sitting through 90 minutes of someone saying, ""Knock knock, who's there? We all get defensive when we're uncomfortable"". And there is the biggest problem. This was never meant to be released as a movie. There's a lot to like about these sketches individually. Lots of tiny little nuances in the acting and very subtle humor that works for the short film format. But these should have been released on Youtube for people to discover on their own, not as a film that has a character deliver a nice hamfisted epiphany at the end."
"aptpupil79","Null","32","53","12 September 2004"," jarmusch not trying=still better than most
","my impression of the film is that jarmusch wasn't really trying very hard. perhaps i'll be proven wrong and this film will one day be shown to have an understated genius about it, but i doubt it. the film is merely a collection of shorts that jarmusch has been putting together since 1986. the first one was the first one shot and the later ones seem to be filmed more recently (judging by the age of bill murray, and inclusion of alfred molina or meg/jack white, for example), but i can't verify that it was presented in the chronological filming order. at any rate, the film revolves around various people discussing various things over coffee (or tea) and cigarettes. more than anything the film made me want to go to a diner and have a coffee with some apple pie a la mode. unlike 'stranger than paradise' or 'down by law' this film had very little lasting effect on me. i had fun while i was watching it - jarmusch always has a quiet humor to his films, producing more chuckles than outright laughs - but it didn't leave me thinking like some of his others have. i like the molina/coogan and rza/gza/murray shorts the most. i don't mean to give the impression that the film is bad or that i don't like jarmusch because both are incorrect, it's just that jarmusch has done better and the film was mostly good fluff.

"vivatunataco","1","23","39","17 May 2004"," Worthless, pretentious, and over-rated
","Coffee and Cigarettes was worthless, which is why I'm glad someone else  paid for me to see it. If you actually liked this movie, I would love  to talk to you, because you are just kidding yourself. You think it's  cool to like movies that you don't understand, when really you don't  understand them because they are crap and there's nothing there to  understand.  Here is a summary of Coffee and Cigarettes:  The movie opens and it is shot in that terrible teen angst black and  white that kids who can't take pictures like to photoshop their digital  photos into because they think it will salvage an otherwise crappy  color photo. It doesn't salvage s***, and it just made me realize that  the movie was going to be pretentious crap, just like all those  pretentious look-at-me-I- develop-my-own-pictures-in-black-and-white  kids' pictures of kids playing in playgrounds photographed through the  chain-links of the fence, with the links in focus.  The movie is filled with a bunch of mini-scenes of mediocre B-list  celebrities/actors having coffee and smoking cigarettes and talking  about coffee and cigarettes and occasionally making a comment about how  coffee and cigarettes isn't a very healthy lunch. It's artsy how they  keep repeating the title. Oh, and it's artsy how all the tables are  black and white checkered. 'Cause the movie is in black and white, get  it?  But wait. It's even more artsy to change the whole premise of the movie  halfway through when the tables stop having black and white checkers  and the coffee turns into tea and the cigarettes turn into one person  smoking and the other commenting on how cigarettes are terrible. Oh,  and I bet it would be artsy if we insert a scene where Jack and Meg  White (they're hot right now - they have that hit new album that in  retrospect no one really liked that much, but they wanted to like it to  be alternative and artsy - oh, there's that artsy thing again) are  playing with a Tesla Coil. Then, Jack should quote Tesla about the  world being a conductor of audiophonic harmony because  he's a musician. Then Meg white repeats the quote and hits a spoon on a  coffee cup and it makes an annoying ringing noise and then she  does it again and everyone is like ""stop it.""  The movie carries on like this. The final scene is two old guys, both  of which you've seen before but you're not quite sure where, talking  about some piece of classical music. This is the scene where the movie  tries to redeem itself by having some deeper underlying meaning. The  one old guy says he wants to take a nap, then he just dies. The  classical music plays, obviously, and the movie ends. Maybe he died  from lung cancer, or caffeine overdose, is that the point?  Pathetic.  The only redeeming scenes in the movie are the scenes with Steve Coogan  and Alfred Molina and Rza, Gza, and Bill Murray. But they are bookended  by the most worthless, pretentious, art-rock, deeper-meaning,  repetitive, awkward crap I've seen in a long time."
"raresbunea","10","6","9","9 May 2006"," Coffee and cigarettes for breakfast, lunch and dinner
","Jim Jarmusch's 2003 Coffee and Cigarettes is a pastiche of habits, stereotypes, monotypes and common sense. It's black and white and it is like a chess table with 11 sugar cubes. Each sugar cube is an individual, totally independent vignette featuring actors caring their own names. Roberto Benigni is Roberto, Steven Wright is Steven, Cate Blanchett is Cate and her cousin in the same time, Bill Murray is billmurray (one word) in a secret life as a bartender. Yes, characters are talking about coffee and cigarettes, most likely and in rest about nothing. Could be Jarmusch a big Seinfeld fan? Roberto meets Steven and keeps calling him Steve. He ends up taking his appointment to the dentist and leaves. Steven is perplex. Buscemi babbles with the Lee twins about Elvis's secret evil twin. Iggy Pop and Tom Waits they both have quit smoking. Therefore they can handle just one more cigarette happening to be on the table. Vinny and Rigano have a energetic argument about how damaging smoking is. Both have a rusty gruff voice. E J Rodriguez, as a waiter, tries to hit on Renee French. He fails sumptuously. Alex Descas and Isaach de Bankole, Frenchmen and good old friends meet after a long time and it seems that they don't have a problem. Or do they? Cate Blanchett plays herself magnificently. Make he any hair-style and will look good on her. She is also her hippy cousin. Meg and Jack White, the White Stripes ""brothers"" (quotes because they're not brothers, or are they?) have a conversation, after 80 seconds of silence, about his tesla coil, an air transformer device. Meg turns out to be a co-star to Jack's genius. Than we have Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan as possible cousins based on Molina's genealogic investigations. Alfred is extremely deferential. Steve hides his condescending propensity. Steve thinks Alfred wants to take advantage of him. But Alfred is honest. But there is catch. In the end the two reverse positions. How about the Wu-Tang Clan? GZA and RZA talk about alternative medicine and how to perform a surgical procedure using an electric drill-gun. Tom Waits became a doctor too. Coffee cause serious delirium. Billmurray (one word) doesn't think so and drinks from the jar. RZA explains how nicotine interferes with the central nervous system. That's paralysis. And last but not least Taylor Mead, in the final scene lost his touch with the world. Bill Rice, his partner is concerned. They listen to an imaginary Mahler, in some backyard armory. Coffee is becoming champagne, Nikola Tesla pops out in the conversation again, and they ignore their age or their Parkinson and toast for the Moulin Rouge.<br/><br/>Coffee and cigarettes, that such an unhealthy combination! They all agree. We all agree. Jim Jarmusch's colorful interpretation is a celebration of life!"

","This movie starts out promising with a piece of absurd comedy that actually works. Though you really can't do anything wrong when Steven Wright is in your scene, I had high hopes. I mean you have everything, a good setting, bizarre dialogues and the complimentary clever twist. However, the movie pretty much goes downhill from that scene on. Jim Jarmusch tried to make art people would speak of in every lounge bar from Europe to Eastern Europe but he just comes of as lazy. He had an insane amount of time to figure how he would bring it, and then he comes up with this. It doesn't even seem like he did any writing or anything, all he did was set up the camera and hope Iggy Pop and Tom Waits would say cool lines because they're Iggy Pop and Tom Waits. Most of the material carries that bothersome ""almost funny""-label. Steve Buscemi's theory on Elvis and his twin brother is almost funny, but then again no. Teaming up a near-insane Bill Murray with guys from the Wu-Tang Clan, well that was funny. Both The White Stripes and Alfred Molina have a pretty good segment too but all in all I just felt bored with the whole thing. I like the idea, but some good writing wouldn't have hurt."

","Jim Jarmusch used to be one of the coolest directors around. Down by Law and the excellent Dead Man, among other films showed this; but his latest crop of movies have been far more down to earth, and less cool than his other films. Ghost Dog, while not bad, felt as if the cast and crew couldn't really be bothered - and that is true of this film also. Coffee and Cigarettes is basically eleven stories revolving around people drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. As with all films that have different parts, the stories vary in quality; but unfortunately, there's more bad ones than there are good. Jarmusch has managed to collect a good variety of different actors (and popstars) to star in the film, and this is one of the film's best points. As mentioned, there is more disappointment than good stuff in this movie; but the highlights of the movie include the section with The White Stripes' duo of Meg and Jack, a discussion between Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina, Steve Buscemi's Elvis theory and an odd little sketch where Cate Blanchett plays both parts.<br/><br/>Jarmusch has opted to film this movie in black and white, much like he's done with many of his earlier works, and it does serve in giving the film a sense of cool. The film is very relaxed throughout, and the two indulgences of the title give you an impression of this. However, the relaxed nature of the film is also it's main drawback, as throughout the movie we are given the impression that it is half-assed. The fact that it's just a series of sketches, loosely tied together also gives this impression, as it much easier to write a few conversations than it is to make a proper film. Like Quentin Tarantino has done with all of his movies, Jarmusch has dressed this shallow movie up in a whole host of talent; and it does make the end result more enjoyable. Jarmusch regular Roberto Benigni appears in a forgettable short at the start of the film, and after that we see the likes of Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Alfred Molina, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchette and Steve Coogan, among other. Seeing all these guys in a movie together is nice for a movie fan like myselfbut I just cant help thinking that the movie doesn't seem to have any actual effort put into it; hence the low rating."

","Not since Alex Cox's ""Straight to Hell"" have I had such a shoddy, amateurish work put before me by a director whose work I otherwise like.<br/><br/>I'm a believer that there are no bad concepts, just bad execution, so while it may have been possible to make a good movie using Jarmusch's structure and theme, this is not that movie. Two minutes' worth of concept was regularly dragged out to ten minutes. The dialogue was half-considered, if that. Vignettes ground painfully away towards some ill-conceived, inane ""punchline"". The performers, even granted that they had little to work with, were visibly floundering; given that they were for the most part playing themselves, they never came across as people who actually existed, or that they had any reason to talk to the people playing opposite them; most often, they couldn't even convince me that they had ever actually drank coffee before. Only Cate Blanchett walks away from this car-wreck with any dignity intact.<br/><br/>I'm normally quite generous in my ratings, but this movie was simply insultingly bad. Jarmusch should have kept the only print locked away in a vault, with instructions that it be burnt following his death.<br/><br/>2/10, and that's only because I smiled when Bill Murray drank straight from the pot."

","In hundreds of diners each day, people meet up for a chat, a cup of coffee and perhaps a cigarette. In this film we see a handful of such meetings involving all sorts  famous singers, cousins, twins, strangers or even just people by themselves. As in real life, the moods, aims and directions of each meeting are different and end different ways for the characters involved and, well, that's about as close to a ""plot"" summary as I can get! As a lover of short films I was looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed to be a collection of shorts made over quite a period, rather than being a collection of vignettes as in, say, Blue in the Face. However it quickly became evident that these segments would mostly not stand up on their own in the way a good short film would and they are much more just like sketches rather than shorts. Anyway, aside from the issue of definitions, this is still a very hit and miss affair with the majority being near-misses of half-hits, only a couple of them would I watch again on their own. Strange to Meet You is not that good; Twins is interesting and was a curiosity to me for having two of Spike Lee's siblings in it; Renee didn't do anything for me; No Problem was cool but pretty empty. However I did think that Somewhere in California was strong; Those Things Will Kill Ya was obvious but quite enjoyable; Cousins was interesting and engaging; Cousins? was sharp and enjoyable while Delirium was strangely comical although I probably enjoyed it more for the people than the content.<br/><br/>The cast do reasonably well within the material but I think some are better than others; as you might expect, I was more impressed with the acting in the shorts that I found most interesting  although I recognise that that is probably an unfair judgement of the performances. The direction is fairly static but also quite stylish and with a nice sense of place in each location; the black and white perhaps adds it more credibility but other than that I didn't see the reason other than maybe adding a consistency in colour that the material didn't provide.<br/><br/>Overall this is not as good as I had hoped but in fairness maybe I had my hopes unreasonably high. It does do what it claims to do by being a mixed collection of sketches; all of them are good enough to fill their short running times but not all of them are worth seeing. The weak ones and the good ones come pretty much 50/50 and you need to decide for yourself whether or not those odds make it worth your while. Fans of Jarmusch and ""offbeat"" films will likely enjoy it but I reckon the casual viewer may end up left a bit cold and unimpressed by it."

","Jarmusch's approach to film  and presumably to life  works for me in the large but not the small. I'm sure you encounter this in lots of places as well: situations, people and philosophies.<br/><br/>He attempts highly engineered ordinary events that have no content. That aimlessness is the point. His art is in designing the lack of ordinary film order in such an extreme but directed way so that we get the message by its omission. This technique allows him to come down on the side of characters rather than composition.<br/><br/>Its an old contest, usually between the orchestration of the filmmaker and the instrument of the actor. But he completely reframes the question. That's why he is important and his films, and particularly his ""book"" film: ""Ghost Dog,"" should be watched.<br/><br/>Along the way, he's discovered that all situations are conversations and no matter how complex things get, the conversation is always between just two people. To prime his pump, he sketches, just like most artists. You have to take such sketches on their own terms, as ancillary to stuff with substance (even if with him, substance is subtraction).<br/><br/>Others have already told you that these sketches are uneven. There is no consistency of tone among them, in fact they are so disconnected we infer what you likely have already read: these were done across huge chasms of time, philosophy and technique, sliding into the notion of encounters and communication as resonance.<br/><br/>My own favorite by itself makes this worth watching. Cate Blanchett is our most accomplished ""folded"" actor, meaning she can convey two characters in one performance. Here, she literally plays two characters, conversing with one another. She obviously wrote the dialogue because each phase slips under the one from the companion. It is her interpretation of a Jarmusch situation: an emotional encounter drained of all the theatrical conventions of emotion.

It is also funny, and ""cool"" in the Tom Waits/Michael Madsen sort of way.<br/><br/>It's about nothing in particular, a collection of short films all involving two or three people, sitting in a diner somewhere at lunch time, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee, and conversing over banalities. Each segment lasts about ten minutes or so, and is so interesting because they grab us with some really intriguing characters, people, and performances - and sometimes all three.<br/><br/>It's got one of the most diverse casts I've ever seen (Steve Coogan, Steve Buscemi, Bill Murray, Alfred Molina, Iggy Pop, Cate Blanchett, Meg White, Jack White, RZA, GZA, Tom Waits, Roberto Begnini and others still) but it's not uneven; we don't feel like we're jumping from one genre to the next, maybe because it feels a little like Jarmusch has sucked the life out of these genres. Each segment is very laid back, the characters either nonchalant or trying to appear that way, with some exceptions.<br/><br/>The opening segment has Steven Wright and Roberto Begnini, both equally incomprehensible. Then Steve Buscemi explaining conspiracy theories to Cinque and Joie Lee (the guy can play anyone). Then Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, who seem to only be visiting each other to have a contest in condescending (Waits wins). And so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Some astounding performances can be spotted, astounding because they're so understated. Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin, and deserved an Oscar nomination. Steve Coogan plays himself with Alfred Molina, and it's fun to see how Coogan tries to control the conversation, then gets thrown for a loop. Bill Murray is, naturally, gut-busting funny.<br/><br/>Behind it all we sense the artist's hand, lathering on layer after enigmatic layer.

","I was hopeful that this film that was billed as a series of dark quirky comedic vignettes would be enjoyable. The all-star cast which included Steve Busceme and Tom Waites was impressive. Unfortunately the writing and directing failed to tap this talent. Scene after scene elapsed and I kept asking ""Am I missing something?"" Is there a hidden point? Is the lack of any coherent dialog the point? Was this merely a collection of gritty images from which the viewer was to impart his/her own point in a Rorschachian fashion? Consider the scene in which a young woman smokes, drinks coffee, and thumbs through a gun magazine. A waiter periodically comes by and anxiously (after an initial error in filling her cup) attempts to attend to her lack of needs. Where does this go? Nowhere. Does it foreshadow subsequent events? Not to my viewing. I was so baffled by the lack of entertainment in this film that I began looking for geometric designs on the table (there were many gratuitous overhead shots that added nothing to the film) that might give clues to the over-ridding theme, message, anything. I finally gave up after an hour. I'm sorry to say that I'm either a shallow cad for missing what must be obvious to an artist somewhere, but this rates as the worst film I've seen this year."

Improvising dialogue about nothing. And it shows. I cringed when I saw Wright and Roberto try to humor us by changing seats. This is why I went to acting class, so I wouldn't look this inept on the stage or on film.<br/><br/>With two or three exceptions, the rest of the vignettes in this 90-minute-or-so film are like watching paint dry.<br/><br/>I was particularly looking forward to Bill Murray's bit, but there wasn't very much for him to work with. Even a talented woman like Cate Blanchett can't do anything with her scene. It's overlong and loses interest a few minutes in.<br/><br/>Only two vignettes were worth watching: Iggy Pop and Tom Waits; and the best of the bunch: Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan. Molina runs away with the movie, (if it can even called that since it's basically a cadre of unrelated skits stringed together).<br/><br/>I think the idea for this film was a good one. But unfortunately, the conversation pieces in the skits are boring, consisting mostly of actors staring at each other while smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee and desperately trying to think of something meaningful or funny to say.<br/><br/>At one point, two men with French accents are having coffee and one is trying to extract information from the other. ""What's wrong?"" man #2 asked. ""Nothing is wrong,"" replies man #1. And they go on like this for something like 10 minutes. You can tell Jarmusch didn't give any other direction except to tell man #2, ""Try to find out what's wrong."" and then tell man #1, ""Don't tell him what's wrong. No matter what."" These are like lessons in Acting 101.<br/><br/>It's more like a student film than something you should pay $20 or so to buy on DVD. If you rent it, I suggest watching the Iggy-Waits scene and the Molina-Coogan scene. Sure, give the movie a shot, but if you get up in arms, look for Iggy and Molina.

Even through all of this, he manages to net a cult following and is able to assemble all-star ensembles, such as with this film, ""Coffee and Cigarettes."" What started as a sub-par, decidedly ""who cares"" short film skit in the eighties, has ballooned into a much-too-lengthy farce on social interactions in diners and bars, featuring a handful of similar and droning bits all revolving around one topic: What you talk about over coffee and cigarettes. After the first bit, you get a feel for the rest of the film quickly: Awkward, dry banter full of esoteric references and cute statistics. After the third and fourth, you get that the interactions are awkward and playing off of the actors' real-life personas in an ironic way. It's like a knock-knock joke; Yes, Jim. We get it, but we're only laughing because of who's telling the joke--not who wrote it, and certainly not because of the joke itself. My recommendation for you, the potential viewer, is this: If you're a rabid fan of anyone appearing in the film, then go for it.

","A slight film by anyone's standards. It's not terrible, though. I liked about as much as I didn't like. There was nothing here to love. The film consists of eleven conversations over the title substances, and the characters are real people more or less playing themselves, for the most part. Sometimes it's about two (or more) celebrities meeting each other randomly, sometimes there's a little skit. Some of these people aren't really celebrities, but most seem to belong to the film industry in one capacity or another. For example, in one of the more forgettable sequences, a girl named Renee is bothered by a waiter. Renee is Renee French, who has worked on a show, Fishing with John, on which Jim Jarmusch appeared in the past. The waiter is played by E.J. Rodriguez, who was a musician on Jarmusch's Down by Law. There are other bigger celebrities, like Bill Murray, and Cate Blanchett, who has one of the best scenes playing herself as well as her less famous, lookalike cousin, Shelly. The best scene is probably the one between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan. Molina, yet to hit it big with Spider-Man 2, sucks up to Coogan, a celebrity more in Britain than in the U.S., as he excitedly reveals that he discovered through geneological research that they are distant cousins. I also liked the sequences with Iggy Pop & Tom Waits, Joseph Rigano & Vinny Vella (and Vinny Jr.), and the final sequence with William Rice & Taylor Mead. The first two sequences are horrible, especially the second, starring Spike Lee's siblings Cinqué and Joie, as well as Steve Buscemi. Buscemi's never been nearly this awful, here playing a Memphis waiter who theorizes that all the bad things Elvis Presley did were actually perpetrated by his evil twin. Buscemi would be wise never to attempt a Southern accent again. And I found out after writing the rest of this that this film was made over a 17 year period. Wow, what a waste of 17 years! 5/10."

There isn't really a plot nor themes to connect any of the conversations, but each of the segments are short and allows its viewer to peer into the minds of different individuals.

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","1","1","27 December 2014"," This movie is as addictive as the vices of the characters
","I can't remember why I bought Coffee and Cigarettes; I think it was when I had an obsession with the Cigarette-Smoking Man from The X-Files. Anyway, I watched it with my sister, who immediately got bored of it because it was filmed in black and white (she's a texting nut and cellphone zombie). I loved this movie though, it introduces you to an average variety of people from different walks of life, different genders, classes, races, but they each share one thing in common: they all visit a small city coffee shop, dingy and unpopular, and most of the characters have an addiction to either coffee, cigarettes or both.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on, the characters complain about the small problems in their lives, indulging in their addictions and sort of looking down on one another unkindly, though other characters hit it off with each other. Still, despite these characters having next to nothing in common, many of their complaints and problems in life are similar, and they aren't alone in these issues. This movie doesn't really have much of a beginning, middle or end, it's more like an artistic view of how much we take the little things in life for granted, little things like friendly service in a diner, a nice compliment, the smell of freshly-brewed coffee and lit cigarettes, so many small things we often forget and overlook.<br/><br/>Though I'm not entirely certain, I think it may take place in the late Fifties to early Sixties, the music style, scenery and fashion shown in the movie would point in that direction. The acting was outstanding and the soundtrack was nostalgic; the black and white film choice really puts more focus on the characters than the scenery so to fully enjoy this movie, you have to focus more on the script and what is being said, as well as the facial expressions and actions of the characters, to put the movie all together. I really loved this movie and I think it definitely deserves 10/10 stars, it's nice to avoid the melodrama of romance movies, cheap jump scares of horror movies and bad effects of sci-fi movies and just watch something simple yet so complex sometimes. In the end, it leaves a lingering depression and a new view on life that maybe in the fast-paced world of the city we often forget how much life is a gift and human kindness is worth a lot more than you'd think."
"nini_ten","Null","1","1","23 June 2004"," 3 strikes out of 11, maybe 4 strikes
","The 3 greatest segments of the movie were 1.""Cousins?"",2.""Cousins"", and 3. the last one with the 2 old men. The Roberto Benigni one had a nothingness charm, but it doesn't compare to those 3. The other segments were ruined either by obvious,half baked writing or unskilled acting, even for people as cool as those musicians, and even the Bill Murray one didn't work because the jokes got stale very quickly. Now, the best ones: ""Cousins?"" worked geniusly and beatifully mainly because of Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, without their acting Jarmusch's writing would only be good, but they made it great, and the fact is their charcters really matched up with what they were saying, like when Coogan says he loves Spike Jonze, that just sounds like something he would say even if you don't know him. Alfred Molina's acting lets you inside the character and entertains satisfyingly. ""Cousins?"" is the most carefully crafted piece in the movie, or at least it seemed like it, it was also the most enjoyable and exciting one. the whole development of the conversation was very believable,hilarious, brilliant, and sweetly resonant. ""Cousins"" had an unusually awesome quality also because of the acting, by the Cate Blanchett, it's considered a great achievement in her acting because of the timing between the 2 characters she played, to think that she held full control over a relationship between 2 people not only makes her a great actress, playing each one eloquently and colorfully, but it also makes her a director of this segment. This segment is all in all really, really enjoyable because these character's identities have such an incredible clarity to us it makes what happens between them come alive very strikingly, and the shortness of their interaction makes the segment quite disorienting alas enchanting. I wouldn't need to explain why the last segment was so good except I thought Jarmusch's writing was at his best in this one. Everything he communicated in this segment was things he cared most about. In this he really stuck it through with his best, he stopped trying to be quirky but really became quirky, man A: The world is conducted by acoustic resonance. man B: I have no idea what you're talking about, could you explain it to me? man A: No, not really. In this segement he transcended his creativeness into something magical and subtle, providing a good end to the film. The credits are incredibly enjoyable which makes you automatically like the whole thing, yet it is what it is, though if anything you should really see it for those 3 segments."

","I guess it's indie nihilist self-indulgence, if anything. At best, the film is a series of dialogs between two or more people who have little or nothing to say to each other. The presence of coffee and cigarettes is the only unifying element, and perhaps that is what the film aspires to say: that coffee and cigarettes provide a minimalist social adhesive that binds together for a short time persons who otherwise have no basis for connection.<br/><br/>The black and white cinematography, the sets, and the lighting are great. The human interaction portrayed on film is tolerable at times, but often not. The weakness of the film is most clearly perceived when you consider that were it not for the celebrity status of the actors portraying most of the characters, the film would be thoroughly unwatchable and would be hooted out of the art houses.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch this, I suggest you do so in the presence of an abundance of coffee and cigarettes."

","The problem with Jim Jarmusch is that, amidst the horrible tedious undrama that makes up the bulk of his work there are those occasional bits that are great. This keeps causing me to give his movies a try when they come to TV. Sometimes you get something cool, like Masatoshi Nagase's performance in Mystery Train or Roberto Benigni as a crazy cabbie in Night on Earth, but other times it's just a horrible waste of one's life. So it is with Coffee & Cigarettes, a series of painfully dull vignettes. Many of these look as though Jarmusch got two actors and told them, sit there, work coffee and cigarettes into the conversation and try not to say anything too interesting. If those were the instructions than the film is pretty successful. After the first few vignettes I just fast forwarded after a few minutes of each, trying to find something worthwhile. Cousins was interesting in a low-key way, the thing with The White Strips was most interesting because they were such abysmal actors, but was otherwise worthless, but the final sequence, Champagne, was actually sort of interesting, simply because of the low key but assured presence of the two actors.<br/><br/>If you're a Jim Jarmusch fan I suppose you'll like this, for whatever mysterious reason people like his stuff, but this is for hardcore Jarmusch fans only."
"rbverhoef","7","3","6","18 April 2005"," Talking over coffee and cigarettes
","'Coffee and Cigarettes' is the project director Jim Jarmusch started back in 1986 with a short film starring Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright. The premise is as simple as it is brilliant. Put some people in a room and let them talk over coffee and cigarettes, most of the time also about coffee and cigarettes. Let some elements return in every single segment you make (there is a toast in every segment) and see where it goes. You film a couple of these episodes in black and white, puts them together and you have a nice film.<br/><br/>Of course some segments are better than others. I liked the one with Steve Buscemi (""Twins""), Tom Waits (""Somewhere in California""), Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina (""Cousins?"") and Bill Murray (""Delirium"") the most. The one with Cate Blanchett (""Cousins"") is not the best but since she plays both characters it is quite interesting. I guess every segment has at least one interesting aspect. ""Strange to Meet You"", the first one made back in 1986, is interesting since it stars the director and star of 'La Vita è Bella' long before that film made him famous; ""Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil"" is interesting because The White Stripes (Meg & Jack White) have the weirdest conversation in a way I believed they really have conversations like this; ""Cousins?"" gives us the hardest laughs with the perfect dialog and timing of that dialog; ""Delirium"" if fun simply because Bill Murray is in it.<br/><br/>What is good about a lot of the segments is that the more famous people are not afraid to portray a weak person, even when they are playing themselves. Iggy Pop has a very hard time with Tom Waits, Cate Blanchet has a very hard time with herself, Alfred Molina is embarrassed by Steve Coogan and even one of Coogan's fans. The film has some minor points. Although it is a real comedy there are no real laughs. There are many smiles, but laughing out loud only happens once or twice. The final moments from most segments could cause the real laughs. Another problem is the fact that you are basically watching a lot of short films. Since you watch them without taking a moment to think about them it is possible you have forgotten the first while the last one is playing. For me it is the same with feature films; after I have seen one I need a moment to think it over before starting the next one."

And more importantly, it's a complete waste of potential.<br/><br/>There is so much talent and potential in the artists involved. The Mollina-Coogan scene was one of the better efforts but didn't live up to what it could have been, the Waites-Iggy Pop vignette was so bad I could have cried (those two real life 'characters' in one scene thrown away, how did they do that?), the final line of which was agonising. Bill Murray was a beacon but only because he's quite an off-the-wall guy anyway.<br/><br/>Art? It is unpleasantly obvious, unsubtle at every turn, I would say self-consciously cool except it isn't cool. It certainly is self-consciously trying to be cool. I would have walked out if it wasn't so entertainingly bad.<br/><br/>The only saving grace is the last scene which is actually hilarious and hauntingly tragically sad at the same time. That part, at least, is written, acted and filmed perfectly. As for the rest? What a waste.<br/><br/>I have no respect for a film which tries so hard to be respected, and yet simultaneously reverts to a base humour whereby the biggest gag was 'Jack shows Meg his Tesla Coil'.

It's a total waste in my humble opinion. It is a waste of time, precious actors and actresses and 17 years of the director too. Now that you may like ""art films"" but this one's not even that. While we watch it we thought even we could make a better one in the family. Don't get me wrong, but only a bright idea or a fine cast cannot guarantee a movie to be an unforgettable one. I'll go for other movies of the director, perhaps he's got a better one with his reputation. 5 over 10 won't be unfair.<br/><br/>At least a link between all stories other than coffee and cigarettes would be great.

I know, I shouldn't go there if I despise it so much, but this was the only place showing the film.<br/><br/>Anyways, I was interested to see Jarmusch's C&C trilogy put together into one lump. The film consists of pretty much the usual pointless conversations you would have with a friend or someone you had to meet for some reason in a coffee shop.<br/><br/>Things I liked: Dialogue repeated by different actors in different stories, the link with the checkered coffee table in each story, the interesting paradox with Molina/Coogan discussing making a movie, ""Those Thingsll Kill Ya"", ""Delerium"", Steve Buscemi and Bill Murray. I also enjoyed this idea of letting us be a part of these conversations - to take us into the world we already know albeit through film.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: ""Renee"" - a boring, unfunny and pointless waste of eye strain (maybe it wasn't supposed to be funny, but even so I couldn't bring myself to like it), the length of some of the stories (eg. ""Cousins?""), the general pointlessness of most of it and the irritating film students.<br/><br/>Good to see all these famous actors in such a low-key film, and an interesting way to pass some time, but it was in the end a hit and miss affair in this reviewer's opinion."

The best stories come last. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan are just hysterical, as two English actors working in Hollywood who might be related. And of course, the last tale with the amazing Bill Murray is excellent. The invaluable contribution of RZA and GZA to the vignette is amazing.<br/><br/>

","I have no idea why Jarmusch would take this kind of premise and make it this pointless and dull. But let's look at the movie, segment by segment: Segment 1: Benigni and Wright seem to be too embarrassed to speak openly, to go beyond the casual small-talk which is DULL. Hence, this segment is dull.<br/><br/>Segment 2: The black twins get harassed by Buscemi who starts talking about Elvis. Forgettable.<br/><br/>Segment 3: Iggy Pop and Waits do the same shtick as Benigni and Wright: another celebrity pairing where the dialogue can't go beyond small-talk (because both are embarrassed - for some reason). When it does, to a small extent, Waits get somewhat insulted and Pop gives up and leaves. Average stuff, but better than the previous 2 and the following 3 segments, i.e. the only half-decent ""story"" in the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>Segment 4: Two mob guys do a scene right out of ""The Sopranos"" or a Scorsese film. Neither here nor there. Average.<br/><br/>Now the movie really starts to suck: Segment 5: A woman stares at a gun magazine, while a waiter tries to befriend her. Maybe 6-7 lines of dialogue. A totally plot less, pointless and dull segment. Any moron could have ""written"" this kind of crap. I think Bergman, that overrated charlatan, has done quite enough in the silent-scenes drama sub-genre. Do we need any more silence in movies? No. We need IDEAS. This segment is not based on one.<br/><br/>Segment 6: The two French black guys. The whole encounter is about ""why? do you have something to tell me?"" and this ""theme"" goes on and on. Utter nonsense. I could barely concentrate on what they were saying. Yawn Segment 7: Kate Blanchett plays dual roles, twins. Again, a barrier between two parties cannot be broken, only subtle hints of animosity that is being carefully hidden from the other person. But so what? This sort of situation might be interesting as a mini-play to a stoned audience of 12 in some seedy NY art-club, but for a movie this isn't good enough, sorry. And if anyone out there still gets excited over someone doing multiple roles in a movie  wow!!!!  then have a ball with this mediocrity.<br/><br/>But just as I was about to doze off, the movie got better: Segment 8: Funnily enough, Jack and Meg from that awful ""band"", The White Stripes, end up being more interesting than professional actors and personalities such as Iggy Pop or Tom Waits. Meg can't act to save her life, but Jack is solid, and the segment is interesting in a strange sort of way.<br/><br/>Segment 9: Hands down the best segment. Molina and Coogan are excellent as yet another celebrity pairing that is trying to break the wall of perpetual small-talk between them. Being a fan of Coogan's humour, it is obvious to me that he had a hand in improvising/writing the dialogue, and that is why this segment has a point. It has a beginning, middle, and end, and it's quite amusing. Very subtle, but clever. Very English. I think it's the longest segment  probably because Coogan actually has the talent and had made the effort to make something out of it, whereas the other actors and celebs in this movie weren't up to the task to the most part.<br/><br/>Segment 10: Bill Murray and the members of the brain-dead Wu-Tang Clan (or ""Klan"", with a ""k""? Actually, who gives a s***?) engage in some more of this movie's trademark pointless dialogue, but at least neither side is shy so they talk relatively openly. (A shy Rza would have been TOO much to bear.) Mildly interesting and average.<br/><br/>Segment 11: Two old geezers talk during a break at work. OK.<br/><br/>All in all, only one segment is excellent, and another 3-4 solid. The rest are dull or forgettable. Is Jarmusch getting fat and lazy? Or is his stupidity finally coming to the forefront? ""I think next up will be a movie where everyone sips coffee and puffs away. I'll just get a bunch of my friends to improvise some dialogue. I mean, they're all celebs so they should be smart enough to come up with stuff. The stories need not be connected. In fact, they don't even need to be interesting. You see, I've finally realized that it's best to bore people. That way they think that there is some DEEP message hidden in the movie somewhere. That should shut up both the critics and the fans. No-one will dare say they didn't like the movie, for fear of being accused of being too dull-witted to fully appreciate it."" Or perhaps I give him too much credit for ""slyness""; he IS a moron, after all.<br/><br/>Jarmusch isn't the interesting director he once was. Or perhaps it's the fact that I don't do either: drink coffee or smoke cigarettes, so I can't appreciate the full depth of this smoky, caffeine-induced movie.<br/><br/>Jarmusch's recent ""Broken Flowers"" isn't much better. ""Ghost Dog"" was also average, apart from the good ending. ""C&C"" has good photography and an interesting cast, but that's just not enough. A self-indulging mediocrity similar to ""Blue In The Face"", which was shot in 4 days or something. (That may work in punk music, but in films)"

","Watching 'Coffee and Cigarettes' is analogous to sitting through 96 minutes of teeth pulling. 11 vignettes specifically designed to highlight the general public's inability to indulge in meaningful conversation (or basic communication for that matter), the dialogue is little more than moronic jabbering.

It was so bad that I was compelled to stay until the end to get my sadomasochistic fill - constantly asking myself: how bad can this thing get?

Robert Altman's 1993 Shortcuts was an amazing work. The famous cast was a nice touch, but the film would have been great anyway because the stories were all so strong.

Their conversations are dismal and uninteresting. Worse, all conversations must contain the actual words ""coffee and cigarettes"" in them. At best the faux world weariness of these situations and characters seems forced, at worst they are clichéd and stupid.<br/><br/>Jim Jarmusch is an enormously talented director.

There were only two scenes that held my attention the whole way through. The first was with Cate Blanchett playing herself and her cousin (with a voice very much like that of sexy New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark). The other, also on the cousin theme, starred Steve Coogan; and he made himself out to be a very shallow man, it was quite funny. Other than that though it was a yawn-fest. (It was interesting to note that in the scene with Steve Coogan and some other English man, they drank tea not coffee). The other scenes may be slightly amusing if watched by themselves but strung together they are just tedious. What is worse is the themes and topics of conversation tend to repeat (how many times one of them says ""Coffee and cigarettes? That's not a very healthy lunch."" I don't care to know). This makes it feel like you are watching the whole thing twice. Once is quite enough thank you.

"FilmOtaku","7","2","4","20 December 2004"," A good conversation piece
","Jim Jarmusch, one of the most innovative directors of the late 20th century, brings us ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", another addition to his long line of minimalist comedies/dramas that include ""Dead Man"", ""Ghost Dog"" and ""Mystery Train"". ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", a film 17 years in the making, is broken down into 5-7 minute short stories that involve both iconic and eclectic musicians and actors having conversations over cups of coffee while smoking cigarettes. The only static factors throughout these segments are the cigarettes, the coffee (though in a couple of cases, it is tea), and a checkered tablecloth/table top. The conversations in each segment are as random and eccentric as some of the stars having them. In one segment, RZA and GZA are having tea in a diner when their waiter turns up and it's Bill Murray. Only, it's actually Bill Murray, and it is completely unexplained as to why he would be waiting on them. Meg and Jack White appear in another, with Jack showing off his Tesla Coil to Meg, only to be bested by her in scientific knowledge. In my personal favorite segment, Cate Blanchett plays herself while having a conversation with her slightly trashy, certainly envious cousin Shelly (also played by Blanchett).<br/><br/>Filmed in gorgeous black and white, Jarmusch filmed these vignettes over the last 17 years, beginning with the opening scene between Steven Wright and Roberto Benigni in 1987. Some segments work better than others (a couple of them were merely aesthetically interesting as opposed to intellectually compelling) but overall, the film really is quite good. It is probably a hard sell to a mainstream audience because nothing really ""happens"", but this dialogue-driven film is so intelligent and at times so hilarious that there wasn't an occasion where I was concerned about the pacing. I wish that Jarmusch made films with more frequency than he does, but if the time he spends on the production of a film is a factor, then I'll look forward to films like this sometime in the next ten years. 7/10 --Shelly"

","Jim Jarmusch's loving look at situations involving cigarettes and coffee. Imagine Paul Merton's improve program where that was the theme and add a succession of top actors in assorted coffee bars. The series of humorous vignettes, all shot in black and white and over a 17 year period, is an affectionate homage to two social drugs and the situations that can be derived around them. Will mostly appeal to those who love Jim Jarmusch's quirky work. The cameos are appealing and well crafted, but the overall feel is one of art for artists. Interesting cinema rather than an entertaining nights out, Coffee and Cigarettes is an experiment in humour and perhaps audience tolerance."
"Steve_Baldwin","10","2","4","19 November 2004"," Wonderful
","Jarmusch is one of my favorite directors and Coffee and Cigarettes, which I saw last night on a recently released DVD, does not disappoint. Jarmusch has a keen eye for the moments that other filmmakers would consign to the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>Life - revealed ""between the lines"" of dialogue, is joyously revealed in C&G's 11 short set pieces. The acting - and one has a firm sense that this is acting from the heart, not play-acting, is dead-on delicious. Music (and music people) is a very important, subtle element in each of Jarmusch's films and C&G uses this element masterfully. One can quibble that some skits are better than others, but the unevenness makes sense once you see how it builds to a quiet crescendo of longing and emotion. This movie has heart, soul, emotion, humor, and it goes down like a double-shot of the best, most invigorating espresso in town.<br/><br/>Those who don't ""get"" what he's doing, and there seems to be a fair share of them on the Web, might look inward toward their own inner coarseness before so boldly flinging epithets at Jarmusch accusing him of undue dwelling in enigmaticism. These are the same people who decry film's creeping meatballism while lapping up the dross that supports the blind and deaf machine of Hollywood."

","One of the most amusing thing about watching this in the cinema was the number of people who got up and left the cinema during the movie. I guess they saw a couple of big names and went on spec - bad mistake.<br/><br/>Having said that, there were ups and downs. Highlights for me were the first scene with Steven and Roberto was just surreal - dunno if it was the bizarre 'plot' or the fact that Roberto had so much coffee he couldn't sit still... I loved Steve Buscemi's Elvis theory... Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina's cousin's segment was one of the few laugh out loud bits of the movie. Bill Murray's scene was hilarious too. And for some reason the final scene gave me a warm fuzzy feeling - dunno why...<br/><br/>The photography was wonderful - black for coffee and white for cigarettes. The silence in some parts (that some people found tedious) allowed you to take in the whole scene and if you looked in the background there were a lot of little details that pulled the different scenes together. For example all the tables had chessboard patterns - except the one with Steve Coogan - which is the only scene where nobody drinks coffee. I guess I need to see it a few times to catch them all.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people were disappointed, but I guess that's down to expectations. I brought my girlfriend and warned her that it may not be her cup of tea (we're going to see Bridget Jones next week) but she loved it as much as I did. I guess if you're looking for a laugh a minute film that doesn't involve any thinking then it isn't for you. If you are looking for something a bit quirky even if not perfect, then it's worth a look."

This is a movie I would highly recommend for most people who enjoy slower, more dialogue heavy films, because I'm sure they'll get quite a few laughs out of this little movie. Some of the best segments are ""Strange to Meet You"" starring Steven Wright and Roberto Benigni, which is sort of odd and also hilarious, ""Cousins"" starring Cate Blanchett (who is great and brilliantly plays two very different characters at once), ""Cousins?"" (different than ""Cousins"", note the QUESTION MARK), starring Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina, which provides a wonderfully subtle sense of humor to the film, ""Delirium"" starring musicians GZA and RZA, as well as comedian/actor Bill Murray, which admittedly could have been a little better but is still great and funny as hell, and the final segment, which is ""Champagne, starring William Rice and Andy Warhol superstar Taylor Mead, who does a brilliantly strange job at , basically, playing himself, which is the most odd, poetic little scene in the whole movie."

","Coffee, and Cigarettes is composed of several conversations that are split up into acts which are linked by the smoking of cigarettes, and the drinking of coffee by the awkward conversing characters. Which brings up the most uncomfortable yet excellent thing about the movie: the cringe inducing pauses between conversation. Whether a seemingly natural pause between topics, or something offensive is said you have to watch the excruciating awkwardness ensue. The characters typically end up insulting each other in some form, and then you get to watch them attempt to coax themselves out of the corner they've backed up into. I found these moments to be the most entertaining(especially between Coogan & Molina), but of course the banter is entertaining as well. I believe for some this movie runs the risk of being horribly boring, but to those who enjoy banter, and cringe comedy it scarcely falls short."

","Jarmusch's 'Coffee and Cigarettes' features a series of vignettes that revolve around conversations between people while they have coffee and cigarettes. The film is black and white and the dialogues seem improvised but they're not nonsensical or irrelevant. There is an absurd, dry and wicked sense of humour and the performances are very natural. Many of the actors play 'themselves' but with a level of sarcasm and self (or other) mocking. Checkered design adds to the black and white contrast. While 'Coffee and Cigarettes' is primarily a conversation driven film, the quiet moments are just as great especially the reactions of the actors and the lingering tension. The versatile camera-work also deserves credit and it just proves how images can be captured effectively without the need for tricks or even movement.

Unfortunately, as one can see in ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" things are not that easy. An event that is supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable may turn into a stressful and intense conversation between two people. In all of the eleven scenes of Jim Jarmusch masterpiece, people are dragged into a conversation that makes them nervous, irritable, and uncomfortable. I am not sure if Jarmusch aimed to convey a message about difficulty and mystery of human interaction in his movie, but clearly he is looking forward to a day when he can enjoy his 10 min break without any resentment conversation or constant disturbing from others. <br/><br/>Different people who appear in front of the camera are symbols of different class of our society but all of them share something, drinking coffee, smoking and repeated, uncomfortable old conversations."

","One could and should expect a lot out of a movie with a title like ""Coffee and Cigarettes"". Personally, I thought it would be a series of scenes in which profound ideas were discussed and were later intertwined in a mind-blowing way. Not getting this from the movie was slightly disappointing. Very slightly. ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" consists of a bunch of random vignettes with random characters discussing really random rubbish. The scenes don't really go anywhere. At all. But that's okay. It's perfect. Because as soon as the movie starts and Roberto Benini says his first line, you know exactly what the movie's going to be like. And you want that. You want to see what happens when Roberto Benini drinks four cups of espresso in a row, you want to hear Steve Buscemi talk about Elvis' twin brother, or Iggy Pop justify how now that he's quit smoking he can smoke as much as he wants, or the Italian men talk about Japanese pepper beans, or Meg and Jack white talk about Telsa, or WuTang talk about holistic medicine. And the last scene is so intensely poignant that it makes you realize just how sad the movie actually was. It was brilliant. However, I only recommend this movie if you are either addicted to caffeine or nicotine. Preferably both. Because you will be the people in the audience who eat up the subtle humour of the film. Otherwise, you will be just like the people who sat in front of us, walked out during Cate Blanchet's profoundly sad scene and thanked us for being obnoxious. Because, I suppose, you will find all of the caffeine-addicts and smokers who laugh at every line and actually get the movie very annoying. So, to sum it up, ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" is the most random movie I've seen in a very long time, and the best (film of the ""random"" genre, not in general). If you smoke and drink coffee, go see it as soon as humanly possible."

And true, some of the sequences in Coffe and Cigarettes are funny, and sometimes interesting (the Jack/Meg White thing was amusing), but overall, no one talks about anything remotely interesting.<br/><br/>While I thought the cinematography was done quite nicely, this kinds of subject matter things worked well in the 60s simply because they were something different, but have little effect today because everyone just thinks they're being profound for the sake of profound when, in reality, it is nothing more than nonsense. I don't care about one sequence after another of people in coffeeshops yabbering on about coffee and cigarettes and any other meaningless bits of conversation (I know, that's the point). And, after recently watching 'Slacker,' I'm not sure I can take much more of it.

","Jim Jarmush must have a lot of friends in the film business, at least I think that is the point he tries to make in this movie, one of the most boring I've ever seen. <br/><br/>I do not want to sound like a critic, because it's always easier to criticize than to create. Nevertheless Jarmush, clearly aiming for the art-house audience is unable to convince me that he put any soul at all in this production. It seems he just called a bunch of famous actors, asking them to be part of his low budget production whenever they had an afternoon off.<br/><br/>Black and white checked tablecloths, cold coffee, puffing cigarettes and shallow conversations sums it all up for me. Pretentious European and not an art film at all, I just want to add.<br/><br/>The exception I make is for Cate Blanchette in a great double roll as Cate and Shelly. However the discontinuity in that scene proofs that Jarmush even has the ability to rescind that. Shelly puts out her cigarette on the plate Cate gets with her tea, later the camera shows the table from above, No cigarette on the plate.<br/><br/>Also very poorly done is the change of film in the middle of ""Cousins?"" with Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan. From a brown tinted film Jarmush changes to a green tinted one. The fact that this cut is not made in the beginning of te chapter gives me the impression that this movie was not very carefully planned either.<br/><br/>However look on the bright side.

"Quinoa1984","9","2","5","7 June 2004"," 3/4 of a masterpiece- some scenes sparkle with laughs and interest, some don't, still worth it
","Jim Jarmusch's latest film, Coffee and Cigarettes, plays like one of those albums by a band you really like, even though some tracks disappoint or overshadow others. I lost count by the time the film finished as to how many vignettes there were, with cups being filled and sipped and factory-made and hand-rolled cigs being put out one after another. But from what I saw, I could tell that the film's greatest asset was that each vignette carried a quirky, unique quality to it. There's something about the way Jarmusch writes dialog (unless some of this was improvised, which is a good guess from Benigni/Wright's scene and Waits/Pop's scene) and uses authentic B&W film stock that creates such a mood that's in-escapable. Love, like, or hate the film, Jarmusch is a pro at his own brand of film-making. <br/><br/>Among the highlights, at least for me, were the RZA/GZA & Mill Murray vignette 'Delirium'; The Lee twins with Steve Buscemi in a Memphis diner; both of the Cousin's vignettes (though, personally, Molina just slightly ruled over Blanchett's great double-turn); Benigni/Wright and Waits/Pop were very strong. The other ones varied from being so-so (i.e. the White's vignette) to downright boring (or perhaps not so much as boring as pointless). The running theme keeps every vignette interesting, even when certain laughs don't work and the people, celebrities or not, are left wondering what they're doing there. So, Coffee and Cigarettes is a watchable little independent treat, though one almost wishes there was one more outstanding vignette to attach on."

","There comes a point when watching some films when you have to make a choice: which would be more interesting, this film or real life? In the case of Coffee and Cigarettes, a movie containing various small vignettes involving two or more actors and coffee and cigarettes, real life wins. <br/><br/>I've had bad first dates that were more interesting than the conversations I witnessed in this movie. Which is too bad, really, because the premise seemed promising enough: pick a universal theme (in this case coffee and cigarettes) and then have different actors sit down in a diner/coffee shop and make that theme the link. See what they discover. I'm all for plot-free, slice-of-life films, and Jarmusch is the undisputed master of letting life reveal itself in the little moments lived out in the forgotten parts of dying Americana (like a squalid diner). In the past, his movies and their characters try to make sense of their squalid lives as they inhabit some mythic, urban space leftover from the earlier part of the 20th century. In his movies there are no strip malls, fast food chains, mass market food, or corporate takeovers. No Taco Bells or paint by the numbers plots. In the past, his films all ended up effortlessly revealing something small but vital about the characters or life itself. Even in his comedies, Jarmusch took his characters seriously, and as a result we cared about them. <br/><br/>But not this time. The situations and the acting in this film are so contrived, stilted, and uneven that they reveal nothing. Mercifully, none of the segments is too long, but if none of the segments really works, that's cold comfort. Now, I don't know how much of this movie was improv or how much was scripted, but I don't think that really matters. It just doesn't work. <br/><br/>This film was like bad modern art: it claims to deserve our attention merely because it's there.<br/><br/>Some who watch this movie may be tempted to convince themselves that they liked it because it is cool to like everything Jim Jarmusch.

","The world said you can't make a movie with no plot, character story arcs, or a variety of set pieces. Jim Jarmush said nay. And so he did it, and he did it well. Coffee and Cigarettes is a very bizarre film. All it is, is a collection of vignettes that each take place in a diner, usually only have two characters conversing with one another, and coffee and cigarettes comes up in the conversation somewhere. Looking at a synopsis like this you would have to stand up, point a critical finger, and shout, ""No! You can't do that!"" But Jarmush proves any naysayers wrong and pulls it off extremely well.<br/><br/>There is one basic principle that carries the entire movie and that is the diner setting with the overall coffee and cigarettes based theme. But the series of characters and scenes have such a great variety to them that it makes each separate segment enjoyable in its own off kilter way. We have all kinds of different scenes ranging from Cate Blanchett having a conversation with herself playing her cousin to Bill Murray hanging out with RZA and GZA from the Wu-Tang Clan talking about alternative medicines and the uses of nicotine. In once scene Jack and Meg White of the alternative rock band The White Stripes (one of my favorite bands of all time) stop for some coffee and a couple cigarettes while Jack shows off his tesla coil machine. We move along to Alfred Molina meeting with Steve Coogan to tell him that they're cousins. Later on we watch Iggy Pop and Tom Waits sarcastically and solemnly insult each other without even noticing it. Coffee and Cigarettes has a little bit for everyone and a whole lot to enjoy.<br/><br/>The film may not seem like much on the surface, but underneath there is a lot of great cinematic artistry being achieved. The film can be interpreted as pointless, but in many ways that is the point. It's the paradoxical nature of this film that makes it out to be much more than it could have and even should have been. Coffee and Cigarettes shows us the mundaneness of your typical diner conversation and then gives it a lot of heart and a lot of life. It goes to show just how interesting your typical day to day conversation can be if you take a moment to slow down and have look. This idea is even eluded to in some of the dialouge. There are two instances of characters talking about their lives or their dreams whizzing by them like they are the camera of a race car driving down the Indy 500. In fact there are a lot of aspects that carry over from one segment to the next. You notice these things in retrospect, and it really binds the film together. The segments are different in subject matter but very similar in themes and subtextual meaning.<br/><br/>There's a lot more than meets the eye when it comes to Coffee and Cigarettes and you really have to put some thought into the film to notice everything about it. But on the surface there is also a lot of good going on. For one, the film is extremely funny. It has some moments that are absolutely hysterical because of the complete oddness of what is happening and the diverse characters it is happening to. You would never expect to see RZA and GZA sit down with Bill Murray and have a conversation, but here you see it and its hilarious just to think about the idea of these three talking with each other, and then the actual dialouge which transpires during their segment is hilarious. Jim Jarmush also shoots the film very well for what it's worth. There's only so much you can do when your set pieces are all small diners and camera focuses on two to three people at a time, sitting at one table. But Jarmush makes sure to keep his direction interesting without being distracting. He doesn't over direct at all and he keeps the focus solely on the actors.<br/><br/>Coffee and Cigarettes is a fantastic film and it is unlike anything you will ever see in your life. Filmmakers don't take these kinds of risks very often so it's nice that we can find strange films that break all the rules of conventional storytelling and filmmaking. This film works on a lot of levels and is also a lot of fun to watch."

","It is cinema or art? No, its Coffee & Cigarettes. <br/><br/>Like all great art, Coffee and Cigarettes is a deeply personal statement, and we feel privileged to share Jim Jarmusch's lens on the world.<br/><br/>We eavesdrop over 13 seemingly ordinary and unconnected conversations over coffee and cigarettes which start to get eerily jagged and surreal as we are drawn in.<br/><br/>The movie is a visual treat and its striking black and white images and stylized depictions of gritty diners linger in the mind long after the movie is over.<br/><br/>I love this movie for many things: the strange and sometimes bizarre characters, its quirky sense of humor, the pop culture references, the continuing obsession with Nikola Tesla, and its ability to make the twin vices of coffee and cigarettes seem sexy.<br/><br/>But, most of all, I love Coffee and Cigarettes because it forces the viewer to re-examine the regular and the ordinary and discover the irregular and the surreal.<br/><br/>If this is cinema, I could get easily addicted..."
"benjamin_lappin","6","1","2","3 July 2008"," A Fine Cigarette That Burns Out Too Often
","The creation of Jim Jarmusch ""Coffee and Cigarettes"", is an amalgamation of eleven varying in length vignettes that detail interactions between various characters in random places as they sit around a table somewhere and do as the title would suggest, drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. It follows a numerous number of celebrities and in a manner not often seen before in film, they play themselves in bizarre and sometimes improvised little pieces, that have no precise theme linking them but address varying aspects of human interaction.<br/><br/>Coffee and Cigarettes looks at the niche side of human engagement, in detail the director focuses on the little nuances of social etiquette and attitudes. We've all experienced one of the scenes in some form or another, the ""No Problem"" segment being the obvious one whereby we have all spoken with someone who has something they want to say but do not wish to reveal it. The ""No Problem"" vignette as a prime example though of how the directors wishes do not always work. It attempts to highlight how frustrating this arduous process of extracting information can be by trying to enforce a naturalistic dialogue through its improvised means, which we can relate to, but from a viewing perspective the tedium grows rapidly. <br/><br/>Jarmusch successfully highlights moments of awkwardness and aspects of life, but often due to the improvised nature of the piece finds that its execution lets it down in a couple of weaker segments. The Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet, mirrored with the Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan section highlight the best in cringe worthy social awkwardness, where good gestures are misinterpreted and to not risk a silence you often find yourself saying something which is taken out of context. Bill Murray and his Wu Tang compatriots are engaging in their genial comedic slot although the particular sketch, while enjoyable, feels out of line with the trend. Renee French provides the perfect acting lesson in sensuality and solemn dignity, a woman wishing to be left alone bu continually pestered by the waiter that obviously fancies her physical exterior yet cannot express so in words. In contrast, Benigni and Wright provide us with a lesson in surrealism which says less about meeting a stranger than it does suggesting that they are border line schizophrenic through their coffee taking habits, while Buscemi feels completely misused and out of place as he rants about Elvis conspiracies in the ""Twins"" encounter. My major irking stems from the Cate Blanchett sequence which is undeniably well edited, yet despite opinion that her ""cousin"" (played by herself) is a tag along annoying draggy little waste I find the opposite. I realise it's self-parody and that Jarmusch is showing that both are at fault for their pseudo-relationship, but I find myself bemused by the insistence that Cate as Cate is the set upon. Each mini-film, each story presents something new about humanity, reflects something different about a situation we may have been in, reflects something different about how we go about talking with people, but not all are enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>So why the six out of ten mark? Suffice to say when this film hits, it certainly hits its mark. I realise it's been a somewhat overly negative review, but only because there is so much promise in roughly half the segments, that the other half seem such let down as it slows the middle portion of the film to sluggish proportions and has you questioning the improvised nature of some segments. I realise the impromptu nature of the pieces highlights the impromptu nature of civil interaction with a friend, a colleague, a sister or a stranger but had the dialogue been sharper in a handful more scenes this could be a blistering film of severely addictive proportions. It is comedic as we see ourselves fumbling around in the situations are screen counterparts do. When the realism lands its mark its purposeful black and white filming counterbalances the coffee and cigarette pastiche and is an acutely accurate and painfully amusing lesson in the potentials and pitfalls of simple chit- chat. When it fails, it becomes more like a wet cigarette, losing its light and heat, leaving you scrambling for a lighter that turns out to be a remote control fast forwarding to the next scene. It's addictive, and yet leaves you often wanting to quit when it loses its buzz."
"Tom Murray","6","1","2","25 August 2006"," Mostly not good, but some parts are great.
","I loved four of the eleven vignettes: ""Cousins"", ""Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil"", ""Cousins?"" and ""Champagne"". I got nothing from the other seven vignettes. I feel that the film would have been splendid if those seven had been deleted. I would rate the whole movie at 60% but those four vignettes, alone, at 90%.<br/><br/>The best vignette, in my opinion, is ""Cousins""; Cate and her cousin Shelley have nothing in common but, since they are cousins, they try to make meaningful conversation. It is a great study in motivation; each time I see it, I understand more about why the characters do and say what they do and say, as well as how they do and say it.<br/><br/>""Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil"" portrays a naive, almost childlike, young man who believes that he is very knowledgeable about technical matters, but everyone else seems to know more than he does. He cannot even keep his wagon wheels from squeaking.<br/><br/>""Cousins?"" shows two semi-famous men, one of whom is very excited about his discovery that they are cousins; the other could not care less but tries, very ineptly, not to show it. His sleaziness and vanity create an ironic twist at the end.<br/><br/>""Champagne"" is simply a delightful, rambling, sometimes surreal conversation about many topics, one of those topics being my own personal favourite song. It is a perfect ending for a very unique film. <br/><br/>The acting and scripts for these four vignettes are brilliant and subtle. I would recommend that you rent the movie and watch just those four vignettes first, to guarantee a very positive experience. Then watch the whole movie to see if there are any other parts that you enjoy and to see the four great vignettes again; I believe that you will see greater depths in them on the second viewing."

","This is quite an interesting view. With a series of short films that are linked by the act of drinking coffee and smoking, its quite original. Though this is abit of a mixed affair. Some of the films are quite slow or not very engaging, while the other are brilliant and so funny and totally engaging. But that can happen when you don't have a straight forward story.<br/><br/>The stand outs are Some where in California with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits; with them talking about quitting smoking while they're smoking. Cousins; where Cate Blanchett plays both roles. Cousins?; where Alfred Molina tells Steven Coogan that they are relate and should make a movie about this. And Delirum where Bill Murray is hiding as a waiter and serving GZA and RZA from the Wu-Tang clan.<br/><br/>If you know Jim Jarmusch's film Dead Man, you know how well he handles the Black and White medium. The black and white is actually symbolising the subject of this films, Coffee and Cigarettes - Black and White. The direction is striped to bare essentials. Shots are kept simple and is very affective; enhancing the mood, it kinda feels your there in these conversations.<br/><br/>If your looking for something different, and want to listen to some very out there conversations, this is a great watch."
"Monica4937","7","1","2","5 June 2005"," ""Coffee and cigarettes? Is that all you're having for lunch?""
","I think what is most fascinating about this movie is that it was shot in the span of 17 yrs! According to IMDb trivia, the first short we are given, between Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright, was filmed in 1987. I sort of wonder why Jim Barusch took so long to make it. Granted I don't know anything at all about him and his work, so I'm sure someone else that actually is a big fan would be able to explain this to me. Indeed this is a unique piece that really doesn't have any plot what so ever, other than the fact that all of these stories are tied together by coffee and cigarettes. I also find it funny that in every short someone eventually makes the comment ""Coffee and cigarettes for lunch? Is that all you're having? That's not very healthy."" Perhaps Jim was trying to send out a message that those who enjoy coffee and cigarettes should try and have something a bit more substantial. Yet we are then given the response ""I ate something earlier, remember?"" Ah well...there is no arguing with these sort of people I suppose. Overall this movie really isn't for everyone because it's not a film with any plot, point or conclusion... and also Steve Buscemi's role was very minor...disappointing indeed. :P 7/10"
"mcshortfilm","8","1","2","1 June 2005"," coffee talk without the dogs or daughters
","Many years in the making, it is great to see Jarmusch finally release these shorts and turn them into a feature. His cool minimal style allows viewers to enjoy these odd and amusing conversations. What's more interesting , (that is if you take film seriously) you will notice certain patterns between the shorts. It is nothing too deep or profound but simply an existential approach between habits and thoughts. Certain dialog's or topics are repeated in other stories and at one point we hear Meg of the White Stripes contemplate that the world is a collection of ""acoustical resonance"". The characters and their environments seem somewhat flat and two dimensional as if they came out of a comic strip. Throughout the film, we also see Aeriel shots of checkered coffee tables with cups clanking and butts smoking which seems to symbolize communication as a game of chess. That was my impression anyway. It flows in a very awkward experimental way where some conversations are lively and others are just dead. Iggy and Waits are an odd combination but the more I watched this scene, the funnier it gets. Everyone loves the Molina and Coogan scene probably because it has a very overt ending to it. My personal favorite was with Cate Blanchett. I never paid much attention to her as an actress but now I see how appealing she can be especially since she is talking to herself. Steven Wright and Begnini are hilarious in their strange miscommunication.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a film that takes chances, does'nt try too hard and certainly doesn't try to blend in with typical Hollywood films. Jarmusch still stands out as one of America's most original modern directors."

","I watched this recently having had it recommended by several friends and people I work with. I was uplifted in a strange way, cause it was very entertaining.<br/><br/>The film in itself contains on 8 or 9 short films with people just talking, and while that may sound kind of boring, it actually is far from just that. Some bits are clearly better than others, but my favorite is especially Iggy Pop talking to Tom Waits - THAT is so funny seeing these two legendary musicians not really being able to communicate and misunderstand each other all the time.<br/><br/>Other bits vary, some are directly boring, others are quite amusing as well and even though this is about 90 minutes of pure talk person to person about the topic - coffee and cigarettes - I recommend it. It's quite amusing, but probably not for the kids, cause they will find it boring.<br/><br/>7/10"

Quite honestly, it's amazing, those dialoges are amazing, so real, so empty but so full of life at the same time.<br/><br/>With black & white image, Jim Jarmusch truly found a tone for his movie. Black & White image for grey conversation who last only for the time of coffee & cigarettes. Intriguing portrait of a substance who plays the role of a social tie in occident. It bounds people together and it even gives em' something to talk about.<br/><br/>This movie is an apology of simplicity, of the beauty of being together. Jim Jarmusch scores again with a very low profile movie who expresses things that words alone can't do. It's like backwards expressionism. Truly enthralling"
"cultfilmfan","7","1","2","19 February 2005"," Coffee And Cigarettes
","Coffee And Cigarettes, is a film with several different segments of people talking which has been filmed over a period of 17 years. Some of the segments include two twins in a cafe while a waiter thinks that one of them is a good twin and one of them is bad, two older men while one tells the other the dangers of smoking, a woman who will not be left alone by her waiter and my favourite of all is when actor Alfred Molina meets up with actor Steve Coogan for drinks and Alfred tells them that they are related. Coffee And Cigarettes, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good black and white cinematography, good film editing and good production design. Writer and director Jim Jarmusch, really shows us his talent for writing very unique characters and giving them great dialogue and things to talk about in this movie. Also a lot of the actors play themselves in the movie and make pop culture references to one another and it is always sharp and right on the dot. Coffee And Cigarettes, is smart, charming, humorous, offbeat and very unique and unusual, engaging, entertaining, thought provoking and is very well crafted and put together and finely acted and made. Coffee And Cigarettes, will certainly not be for everyone because the film is all talking and some may not understand the characters or their conversations and some skits are better than others but I did quite like this film. It shows it's characters for who they are. Sometimes they are funny, sometimes they are weird but always they are simply human and the film shows that. A smart and compelling talking movie that you might even want to discuss later with your own friends over a cup of coffee."
"meeza","8","1","2","30 January 2005"," Gabbby Smoking!!!!!!
","In our history, there have been numerous humanoids who probably had too much coffee in their lifetime: Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Benny Hill, Kathy Griffin, myself for that matter, and Dick Vitale. Moreover, there have been some that have smoked too many cigarettes: Johnny Carson, The Marlboro Man, Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jim Leyland, Smokey the Bear (oops! that's the antithesis), and The Camel Dude. However, there have been many which have had perceptive and didactic conversations having ""Coffee & Cigarettes"". Ironically enough, that is the main premise of Jim Jarmusch's film ""Coffee & Cigarettes"". You have heard that coffee & cigarettes definitely does cause harmful health situations, but le flick ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" definitely does cause exceptional intellectual stimulations. The film is comprised of several chatty coffee & cigarettes vignettes. They are embodied by such Hollywood cafeinados & nicoaddictos as: Bill Murray, Tom Waits, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Jack & Meg White, Alfred Molina, Steven Coogan, Steven Wright, Roberto Benigni, and Cate Blanchett. The film's ""crème"" a la crop vignettes which ""lit"" it up were: Molina & Coogan's ""Distant Cousins"", Blanchett's own ""Cousins"", Buscemi's ""Elvis' Brother"", and Pop & Waits' ""Jukebox"". The ones that probably had too much ""black"" on them and included no ""matches"" in cinema superiority were: the White Stripes machine bit, the waiter & hot chic bit, and Benigni & Wright's ""Strange to Meet You"". The top acting nods that stirred up the pot accordingly was Molina's searching cousin, Blanchett's dual cousin, and Murray's cofffe mug chugger. Jarmusch's screenplay was wistful, realistic, and variable. ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" has the perfect combination to make it one of the most insightful films of the year. **** Good"

","Anything with as much variation and as many stories as this is bound to be uneven. This film is no exception. There were, for me rare moments of humor, poignancy, character development but not enough to warrant the time investment until....<br/><br/>The last story, ""Champagne"" with Taylor Mead and William Rice. This was a little jewel and I don't understand how everybody doesn't agree that it was head, shoulders, hell the whole body above any of the other stories. Someone commented ""I didn't understand the last one."" Well, you looked for too much meaning in the dialogue my friend and not enough meaning in the nuance.<br/><br/>""Champagne"" was about human frailty, how we connect (and fail to) with each other and the fragile nature of one's imago.

"movieguy1021","7","1","2","12 November 2004"," Coffee and Cigarettes: 7/10
","Movies almost always follow a three act structure. Any that don't are usually considered avante-garde, and fail to get a receiving audience. Art house favorite Jim Jarmusch's latest film Coffee and Cigarettes doesn't follow that three act structure, but it's not as if people would flock to it anyway. And since Coffee and Cigarettes isn't linear, neither will this review. The movie's composed of 11 short sketches, all having to do with coffee and cigarettes. No other characters besides the main ones are seen (an aspect I liked), and the movie's filmed in some ultra-cool black and white.<br/><br/>In ""Strange to Meet You"", Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright randomly meet up in a coffee shop. Steven talks about how he drinks coffee before he sleeps, and they both are on obvious addictions to the title things. Steven mentions that he doesn't want to go to his dentist appointment, something that Roberto gladly does for him. This sketch is just kind of random (as all of them are)-they seem to have agreed to meet, yet don't know each other and have no purpose for meeting. The stuff discussed here will be discussed later, and as cool as Benigni is, there's just not really much of interest in this one.<br/><br/>Joie Lee, Cinqué Lee, and Steve Buscemi, in ""Twins"", are all great. Lee and Lee, twins, drink their coffee and chatterbox waiter Buscemi comes up to talk to them about how Elvis isn't actually dead-it's his twin. It's funny, it's entertaining, and it has Steve Buscemi in it. The Lees are also quite good for people I had never heard of. I think the key to this one was the coordination of the three of them, and it worked perfectly. One of my favorites from Coffee and Cigarettes.<br/><br/>Tom Waits and Iggy Pop talk about smoking, IHOP and Taco Bell, and various other things in ""Somewhere in California"". Some of the dialogue sounds almost like something Larry David would say (""Do I look like a Taco Bell kind of guy?""), and it's also quite funny. The last line is a great line, and the battling egos are fun to watch. It's probably the one with the least substance in it, but I liked it nonetheless.<br/><br/>""Those Things'll Kill Ya""-Joe Rigano and Vinny Vella talk about the addiction of cigarettes, when Vinny, Jr. comes in and asks for money. It's not interesting, is filled with no-names, and has no real purpose of existing. It's not witty, it's not observant, it's just there. It's like some other of the middle sketches-it's just bland, no distinctive characteristics to them.<br/><br/>In ""Reneé"", Renee French is a tomboyish kind of woman, reading about gun racks and such. She also is a perfectionist, and when the waiter (E.J. Rodriguez) pours her more coffee, she becomes belligerent. See comments about ""Those Things'll Kill Ya"".<br/><br/>Alex (Alex Descas) and Isaach (Isaach De Bankolé) meet in a restaurant after Alex calls Isaach. Isaach thinks something's wrong with Alex, but really Alex just wants to talk. Yet another of the ""middle"" sketches. Although you could say there's no point to the movie in general, there's especially no point in this one. Is it to show the paranoia of America? Or to outline the distrust we have in each other? Or is there just no reason for it at all?<br/><br/>In ""Cousins"", Cate Blanchett plays both a successful publicist and her estranged cousin, who meet for coffee. The rifts between the two are evident, as one is successful and one isn't. The more I think about it, the more I like it, although at the time it seems unimpressive. Everything that's said in that one is true, too, once you think about it. Might not be the most entertaining of the 11, but still a worthwhile one.<br/><br/>Jack and Meg White of The White Stripes talk about Tesla coils. Yawn.<br/><br/>Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan meet in ""Cousins?"", where Alfred brings up the point that they're distantly related. It's the longest out of all of them, for good reason, as it's fun to watch, and is probably second in the humor scale (next to ""Delirium""). The way the tables turn at the end is a great twist, and actually shows the way of life in some Hollywood celebrities. It strays off of the topic, but it goes into interesting sidetracks. (""I love going to LA. I love leaving it even more."") The one you're probably expecting to be the best, and you may think so.<br/><br/>In ""Delirium"", the craziest out of all of them, GZA and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, after swearing off caffeine, meet Bill Murray (as a waiter, no less) at a cafè. They talk about how bad caffeine is, and how GZA is into alternative medicine, which culminates the skit in a morbidly hilarious way. It's easily the funniest of the 11, with all three of them being the stars. The way that GZA and RZA idolize Murray, and the complete absurdity of Murray being a waiter are comic genius. For me, the best one by far.<br/><br/>Lastly, in ""Champagne"", Bill Rice and Taylor Mead talk about imagining that their coffee is champagne. The sappiest of the 11, it's okay, but not really akin to my liking. Still, it's some people's favorite.<br/><br/>Overall, some of the parts of Coffee and Cigarettes are pure genius, whether hilarious or not. However, the other part of the time it just fizzles out to mediocrity. Still, I'd recommend watching at least a few of these segments, but maybe not in a row. There's no need to watch all of them.<br/><br/>My rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language."

The waiter intermittently returns with the coffee pot, awkwardly, and tries to start up a conversation. In between the patron thumbs the magazine or looks out the window. Yikes!

","It is one of the dilemmas of the cinema and of course of novel writing as well to achieve the right balance between plausibility and entertainment, i.e. the art of making scenes from ordinary life credible without their appearing to be boring, in contrast to much of real life.<br/><br/>In most Hollywood films, even those with an absorbing plot, intelligent direction and accomplished actors in good form, I can't be the only one who thinks, ""well, not a bad way of spending two hours but somehow nothing like life as I know it"". We find the other extreme in the type of films  many of the hand-held camera school  which try so hard to be naturalistic that they lack any kind of polish or entertainment value. Whatever the problems shown, my reaction to them is, ""who cares?""<br/><br/>So what triggered this off?  some of you will already have guessed that it was seeing Jim Jarmusch's latest film to be shown in Munich. ""Coffee and Cigarettes  somewhere in California"" is a series of episodes, each one lasting up to around 10 minutes (far too long in some cases) and showing two or three people in each case chatting, drinking coffee and, of course, smoking. (In most cases far more effective anti-smoking propaganda than the ""smoking kills"" warnings.) Of all the episodes only two in my opinion showed any kind of wit or aroused any kind of interest in the characters portrayed. (However I must confess I missed the first two.) What happened to the talent so evident in ""Down by Law"" and ""Night On Earth""?<br/><br/>In the first a celebrity, played by Cate Blanchette, is having a cup of coffee in a hotel lounge with her obviously far less successful cousin from back home in Australia, before going back to her suite to be interviewed. This scene does work for me because the celebrity is obviously trying hard to be friendly and relaxed and to show a genuine empathy for the ""poor relation"" but not quite succeeding. And the cousin trying hard to give the impression that they really are good friends having one of their regular get-togethers and that their relationship is far more important than any differences in life-style.<br/><br/>Even better, again with embarrassment just below the surface, was the meeting of two British actors (somewhere in California). One has been in the States some time but, as is indicated in the conversation, has definitely passed the peak of his career. The other, younger man, however is definitely on the way up. As with the celebrity in the other episode, this actor tries to be relaxed the whole time, in spite of suspecting that the other man wants some kind of favour from him, as turns out to be the case. My favourite line in the whole film was the young actor's, ""you know, I don't think I shall give you it"", or words to that effect, when asked for his private telephone number. <br/><br/>Of all the episodes, this was the only one in my opinion to have a genuine denouement, which I shall not give away. In all the other cases the episodes came to an end more or less arbitrarily or at least without any interesting twist. Returning to my opening thoughts, this is of course true to life, but somehow rather unsatisfactory. <br/><br/>Apart from Cate Blanchette, Bill Murray and one or two other stars appear in the film. I wonder if they're friends of Jarmusch, who agreed to appear in an episode ""just for a laugh"". Whatever their motivation  or the director's  my rating is just * from 5. <br/><br/>Any comments welcome"

Begun in 1986 as a TV piece for Saturday Night Live, director Jim Jarmusch has stitched together a fabric of inter-related stories; remarkably coherent snippets as if Woody Allen has filmed Seinfeld episodes. <br/><br/>	Shot entirely in black and white, there could be no other way to get the gritty feel of most of the locations in color.  Since we intend to listen, the wardrobe doesn't particularly interest us, and what better way to envision a coffee shop than in B&W?  Thinking of it in reverse fashion, what would have been gained in filming in color?<br/><br/>	""Ghost Dog; The Way Of The Samurai"" has probably been the only movie that Jim Jarmusch has made that most might have heard of, but the current offering is more his trademark.  He certainly likes to use musicians as actors, for example; the cast of this film continues this tendency.  And certainly the use of black and white, as in Dead Man, seems an awfully comfortable medium for him as well. <br/><br/>	There are a total of eleven vignettes in the movie.  Each has its own title, and of course each has its own plot.  The best of the lot include Somewhere in California (starring Tom Waits and Iggy Pop), where these professed non-smokers sit in a booth and drink coffee, smoke and shoot the breeze.  The best idea in the entire film can be attributed to Steven Wright (Strange To Meet You) as he describes to Roberto Benigni why he likes to drink coffee before he goes to bed.<br/><br/>	Perhaps watching Renée French (in Renée) reading magazines would be the hippest thing in the entire movie.  We need no explanation (and none is offered) why such a knockout would be casually thumbing through gun mags, but we love the notion that there might be a girl out there that does that.<br/><br/>	The best faces in all the vignettes (No Problem) belong to Alex Descas and Isaach de Bankolé.  Their expressions are terrific as these friends wrestle with suspicion and disbelief, just as they might in real life.  Lastly, Steve Buscemi (Twins) apprises us of his suspicions about an unknown brother of Elvis and the real impact that purported surrogate had on myth surrounding the King.   <br/><br/>	Rating: Three Stars."

","if you can't write clever dialogue but only meaningless and boring droning from empty people, then dress it up as an art film, maybe no one will notice or, better still, they'll read some ""cool"" cachet into the dreck that will give it meaning.  there is simply not one person in this film that you would listen to for more than 40 seconds if you were trapped bedside them in a bar.do we need a film on the emptiness of human communication when we can experience it firsthand everyday?  so why pay money for it? I would see only if they paid a standard therapy fee to me ( about $135.00 per hour).Jim Jarmisch should have quit after Down by Law, his only good film. Quentin Tarantino, pay attention, here lies your future and it ain't pretty."
"onepotato2","Null","1","2","29 May 2004"," Aren't coffee and cigarettes stimulants?
","This movie is a feature length riff on a trifling idea that can't withstand it. I have no problem that Jarmusch works at the quiet end of the spectrum, and I welcome ambiguous alternatives to Hollywoods brainless output, but this derails pretty rapidly. Initially it feels like a Marx Bros. routine or an Ionesco theater of the absurd skit, but it never goes deeper, or makes a point. No matter how many vignettes of people meeting for coffee and cigarettes, and what order J.J. strung them together, Jarmusch just flashes a bunch of cool earmarks at the audience hoping they'll overlook that he has made an uninvolving and easily abandoned film - Simply being cute doesn't sustain a viewers interest. His script reaches a tiresome, suffocating pattern before ever drawing you in. Although the movie starts provocatively and recovers a bit by the end, the middle provides films most desperate definition of tedium and wasted celluloid. <br/><br/>Remember Stranger than Paradise, and it's self-concious pauses? Jarmusch is still noodling with that idea, still attempting to make a cool product that urban hipsters will align themselves with. It's really pathetic that the deepest he will ever go is to continue playing to an audience whose coolness was defined by 1983! You could skip every movie he's made since then and jump right to this movie and there it is; Jarmusch's signature style sitting there unaffected and uncomplicated by a fresh development after 20 years.<br/><br/>
Not since Book of Life have I seen such a tragic, posturing self-admiring blob of hipster excresence. Aren't you tired of hipsters? I have friends who still think Bauhaus are music's finest moment. They haven't grown since 1983 either. Life has moved on Jim."

While some parts were very,very funny. Iggy pop,the twins and the RZA-Bill Murry part. the rest was just so boring I could hardly stand it.<br/><br/>I give Jim J. credit for trying something different but I pretty bummed I spent a evening walking to the theater,shelled out $10 dollars(more than a hours work) to pay to sit in a film that is better off being on IFC. Of course then you would be able to flip your remote control on to something less boring like Macguyer re-runs on TV land or even maybe a Saved by the bell re-runs."
"DannyBoy-17","Null","1","2","23 May 2004"," Not original, but offbeat fun
","Jim Jarmusch movies, as a rule, need to be viewed late in the evening. The man's sense of humor and timing is not like your usual comedy: it fits that the first of these was made for Saturday Night Live, because these sketches need a late-night crowd.<br/><br/>
    None of these sketches are amazing, though almost all of them have a certain kind of funky humor that it's enjoyable IF YOU LET THEM BE.  There is a giggle to be found in watching the gorgeous Renee French leaf through a guide to knives and semi-automatics over her coffee and cigarettes, the White Stripes' demonstration of a Tesla coil in a coffee shop, RZA's and GZA's health warnings to Bill Murray, Vinnie Vella's ""silent type"" kid, and Isaach de Bankole's uncomfortable reunion with his moody friend Alex.  All of these and the better ones, Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan and Cate Blanchett, have some dose of humor, or at least appreciation of the art of people watching.<br/><br/>
    The line that may define the Jarmusch style is his first line to Steve Buscemi in ""In The Soup.""  As an independent television director, Jarmusch interviews Steve for a part, and the first thing he says is ""You're reading my dog's mind, aren't you?""  Now, in most circumstances, this would not be funny, but if you're in JUST the right mood, something good starts bubbling up inside of you.  That's a lot like what this movie does, over the course of 12 short sketches, percolate a sense of the bizarre.  Just go and see the damn thing, and you'll have your own thoughts."

They're just in their complete natural human role.

This is very special movie (like Dead Man and Ghost Dog I think) and it is not possible to easily compare it with another movies, especially of Hollywood production. Fot the first sight it is mixture of 11 stories, which are not related of something more than coffee (or tea) and cigarettes, but it is not true. These stories as a whole makes a movie together - it has atmosphere, poetic of its kind and some sense of Sense.

"kergillian","7","1","3","25 March 2005"," More complex than it's given credit for...
","This film has been too easily dismissed as a 'silly film', a 'boring film', a film that is 'lean on plot'...I think that many of the critics of this film have simply missed the point. This film is NOT about plot, action, slapstick or any of the other mainstream, blockbuster ideas that have filtered into our minds as the 'right' way to shoot a film. Have we become so Pavlovian that our films must hit every clichéd moment and provide us with frenzied pacing, and non-stop action, sight gags and toilet humour?<br/><br/>This film is filled with layers - complex ideas and connections between the vignettes that are masked by a surface that SEEMS shallow, but when you look at it a bit, LISTEN to the dialogue and think about what the actors are saying (or not saying) you'll realize that the characters, and the vignettes, are offering a little more than banal coffee-talk.<br/><br/>This isn't Jarmusch's best film, but it's certainly one of his most interesting, and the film's layers of complexity began to hit me as I had a post-film conversation.<br/><br/>Two simple rules before you see this film:<br/><br/>1) Don't expect a fast-moving, action-filled film. This film will seem agonizing to anyone who has no patience for quality, dialogue-heavy films that are about what's being said rather than what's being blown-up.<br/><br/>2) Don't go see this if you don't like Jim Jarmusch, Hal Hartley, Richard Linklater, Allison Anders, Audrey Wells, Atom Egoyan - or any filmmaker who focuses on complex ideas, ignore Hollywood mainstream, and doesn't often concern themselves with 'plot' or 'story' as much as 'idea' and 'film'<br/><br/>There is a high level of irony in Coffee and Cigarettes, a message apparent within the vignettes that one should dig deeply beyond the surface of things and into what someone or something is really saying. Looking at the Steve Coogan/Alfred Molina vignette, the double-Cate vignette, and the Renée vignette, this message is abundantly clear. As well, there is a deep connection between many of the vignettes - bits of dialogue, and of event, that are drawn together through the philosophy of Tesla (whom Jarmusch adores) and through the final, touching 'Champagne' vignette.<br/><br/>Some of the vignettes are a little rough - the original Benigni/Wright SNL vignette for example, and the Twins vignette as well. But they hold up as a nice and light introduction to the film, which beings to get much more complex as more and more is said to us. This allows the viewer to ease into the film more capably, than if we were forced into the more poignant scenes from the beginning.<br/><br/>In the end, there are some flaws in this film; and not every vignette is superb, but viewers who take the time to look past the surface should truly enjoy the experience. 7.5/10."

","With the exception of two of the stories, I thought the characterizations were fantastic and the stark black and white visual representation of a stark coffee and cigarettes existence between characters equally as contrasting is brilliance at its best. Of course, there will be a number of people who ""don't get it"" because it is not formulaic Hollywood, but for those of us who have tired of the mundane entertainment of a money-hungry Hollywood, this film is a treasure to be treasured. Bill Murray is at his best, as is Steve Coogan. Iggy and Cate also give interesting performances. For those of us who are looking for something different and don't mind giving up plot for an interesting array of characterizations, this is a film definitely worth checking out."

","I am sure Jarmusch intended Coffee and Cigarettes to be better than the ordure that poured forth endlessly onto the screen before me - perhaps that was the realisation of the concept! I admired the attempt at something different, but frankly the result was eye wateringly awful with a bitter aftertaste. When even Steve Wright and Roberto Benigni can do no better than college level falseness and over acting you just know something ain't right. The African 'No Problem' sketch with the Dice Man undertones? Please tell me Jarmusch was being blackmailed by one of those two guys into including that stilted and inept nonsense into the final cut! Coogan and Molina, and Blanchet are the few that emerge from this execrable disaster with reputations intact. And Iggy, you just died, mate.The Passenger will never sound the same again.<br/><br/>This film will be called wonderful by many, simply because of the cast, because of the Jarmusch reputation, and because love is blind. This was seen as a seriously off day for Jim by those of us that don't wear rose tinted or sun glasses in cinemas. The funniest line in all of this was actually posted right here on IMDb, with a poster explaining that Tarantino can't do great films like Coffee and Cigarettes because "" Tarantino is a cinematographer not a writer (for film)"".

I have to say that the best part of this film is the scene with Alfred Molina. It was so representative and indicative of how social situations work, that was just beautiful. Everything else just wasn't my bag. It had this feeling to it, this tempo that drove me a bit crazy, drove me to sleep. It was like the jazz of cinema--always playing behind, over, under, but never with the beat. But I did get to see it with foreign subtitles, which made even the dull scenes hilarious at times.

","This is a film that the proletariat will not get. It's themes are deeper and more complex than the average person will be able to grasp. Its depth can be measured only by comparing it the Marianas Trench. And in deference to the film, I think every DVD or VHS of this film should be dropped down there.<br/><br/>Robert Benigni and Steven Wright's opening number will tickle your funny bone and make you shake your head in delightful confusion and sympathy for these seemingly talented performers. It may confound you and make you think that it's an unintelligible, self-referential piece of tripe, but YOU would be wrong. Then there's Jack and Meg White's tip of the hat to Nikola Tesla. This is heart-wrenching stuff. Those of you who aren't knocked to the floor with the dramatic weight of this scene must have ice-water in your veins. Yes, the Whites are musicians, but here they'll play your heartstrings like some sort of woodwind instrument. An emotional triumph.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't write enough about the fecundity of this feature. Jim Jarmusch is an auteur. He must of had one heck of a pitch to get financing for this picture, because on the surface it has no redeeming qualities. But if you dare to look a little deeper and spend some more time with it, you might just find that your initial interpretation was correct."

Molina discovered a long lost distant family connection but Coogan could not care less. Coogan is good at playing irreverent comedy which he turns douchy here. The writing could be a lot tighter. This is a good starting point.<br/><br/>The rest range from slightly interesting to bland forgettable. Wu-Tang Clan with Bill Murray could have been funnier.

My favorite was ""Twins"" which, besides being a funny segment, has a hilarious performance by Steve Buscemi. ""Those Things'll Kill Ya"" is also amusing, though it goes on a little long. ""Strange to Meet You"" stars Robert Begnini and was the first of these vignettes, filmed in 1986, and it's fun - strange, but fun.<br/><br/>""Cousins"" stars the chameleon Cate Blanchett as a well-known personality who visits with her not famous and jealous cousin, also played by Cate Blanchett. This was an interesting personality study of both women, the famous one very sweet and shy, and the not famous one more out there and vocal. It's a real tour de force.<br/><br/>Jarmusch really goes back to his student film roots here, with the black and white, simple, low class sets, and his subtle humor. For me some of the vignettes just seemed to have no point, but I think that was the point.

","Jim Jarmusch's ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" is a black & white series of vignettes between people meeting for caffeine & nicotine. And that's exactly how the movie plays... like an afternoon spent with a friend yakking about nothing... or everything. And just like those afternoons, some segments are better than others.<br/><br/>The shorts are a mix of styles... some are more glossy Hollywood with a scripted narrative, some feel more improvised or indie-style, and some have a distinctly New York vibe. I'm not sure the film hangs together... I'm not sure it's supposed to. Other reviewers here seem to dislike the movie for not being uniform in tone or coalescing into a grand theme or plot line. But be fair: Jarmusch never promised a wrapped package with interweaving story lines... this isn't a ""Seinfeld."" The joy of an anthology like this is that one chapter can be broad and comedic, and the next can go in a completely different direction. Perhaps some folks would have liked to see a cliff-hanging, on-again/off-again, will-they-or-won't-they love triangle, or maybe even a talking dog with a gangster attitude. They're in the wrong theater.<br/><br/>This is a movie I could picture adding to my DVD collection and enjoying in a different way every time I watch it... one day I might love one segment, a year later it's my least favorite. Contemplation is not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Neither is black & white... it helps to set the movie's tone of honesty, but unfortunately most people associate B&W with film noir- they think it means a movie is ""dark."" I think it just makes a movie more visceral... the tragedy is more heart-breaking, the comedy more crisp. In the oddball scene featuring Iggy Pop & Tom Waits I just enjoyed watching these two men sitting still in relative quiet in shades of black & white... it emphasizes the lines on Iggy's face from a lifetime of rock living and the furrowed brow on Tom Waits from his years of music/medicine. The slow pace also lets the actors b r e a t h e, so their dialogue is conversation, not characters spitting out exposition to set up the next plot point.<br/><br/>My highlights:<br/><br/>Strange To Meet You: Steven Wright's deadpan genius meets Roberto Benigni's electric comedian. One of the best in the film.<br/><br/>Somewhere In California: Tom Waits and Iggy Pop as unlikely ""chums"" who fail to hit it off...<br/><br/>Cousins: Cate Blanchett in a dual role as herself and her bitter Australian cousin. Brilliant...<br/><br/>Cousins?: Watching the worm turn can be so satisfying...<br/><br/>In conclusion I would not recommend this if you don't like offbeat films. But if you are feeling adventurous this is the perfect film to sample... especially on DVD. You can try a chapter, and if it doesn't engage you, CLICK- you can move directly to the next. You'll find something worth watching, at least...<br/><br/>Now where is that damn waiter with my coffee? GRADE: B"
"Cosmoeticadotcom","6","0","1","10 September 2008"," Solid but varied
","If John Sayles is the Stanley Kubrick of the American Independent film scene, able to get his sundry, tightly wrought, but distinct films to reach a sizable market, then Jim Jarmusch is its Martin Scorsese- whose restive films ever seem to probe the boundaries of form. Or, at least in Scorsese's case, up until his last few attempts at blockbuster melodrama. The latest Jarmuschian experiment is a series of eleven black and white short films that spanned a seventeen year range. Coffee And Cigarettes started out as a small black and white short that aired in 1986, on Saturday Night Live, and featured Steven Wright and Roberto Benigni in a rather pointless, unfunny, and forced piece in a shitty café. In this compilation, which takes its name from that original short, the first piece is retitled Strange To Meet You. Regardless, it is no better nor funnier under the new title. Luckily, Jarmusch decided to work on variations of the theme. His next attempt, and the next filmlet, is 1989's Twins (originally Coffee And Cigarettes, Memphis Version), which is a marginal improvement. Here, the real life siblings of filmmaker Spike Lee, Joie and Cinqué Lee, are arrogant pricks who are annoyed by and at waiter Steve Buscemi, who give a rambling defense of Elvis Presley against charges of racism by propounding an evil twin theory. The third entry is 1993's Coffee And Cigarettes- Somewhere In California, now just Somewhere In California. It's the first of the pieces that moves beyond mere gimmickry, as rockers Iggy Pop and Tom waits play themselves in a sly game of one-upsmanship at a café dive. It's the first of the films where the actors are actually playing themselves. OK, critics either loved or hated this film, and the truth is it's not as bad nor good as either side says, because there is a great deal of amateurism involved, as well as daring. as I said, when really good actors and situations are put forth, there are gems of moments, such as in Cousins?, where Molina's slight shift of tone after Coogan's rebuff of his seeming sycophancy perfectly illustrates the fact that he knows he's higher in the Hollywood pecking order than his distant cousin. In Somewhere in California a similar moment is reached when Iggy Pop first tries to tell Tom Waits to call him Iggy and Waits, without missing a beat, calls him Jim- his real name. When not there is nothing distinct; its plotlessness really shows- as in Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil. Yet, there are segments like Those Things'll Kill Ya and No Problem where the utter barrenness of diurnal existence are both emulated and satirized by the aging mooks and the none-too-bright Jamaicans, whose conversations are so painfully weak, awkward, yet real, that the film-goer attuned to even the slight falsehoods of the minimally enlightened dialogue of Hollywood tripe can feel it, and wince. This film, at its best, avoids the needs to be boring to convey the power of boringness trope that affects much modern art, but its very hit and miss nature also undermines the cumulative effect that the best of it has to offer. In short, the film may be said to recapitulate Jarmusch's whole career.interesting; which is just the term I most often use when a work hits that middling ground that knows no name. There may be something to it, after all."

","Simply put, this is one of the most original and entertaining films I have ever seen. All actors involved in this creative project do not play characters, but actually portray themselves. For example, Bill Murray plays the role of Bill Murray, but does follow a written script. The movie consists of several unrelated skits involving various celebrities and/or personalities that should be recognized by movie watchers. The interactions and dialog between this star-studded cast is absolutely hilarious. It is a dry, clever type of humor that is nothing like typical one-liner cop-outs. Any segment that does not tickle the funny bone always ends up being very interesting and sometimes even moving. This may be the best movie you never heard of..."

","Jim Jarmusch's star-studded, black & white 'Coffee and Cigarettes', is a series of short films that study human interaction. The film literally involves nothing more than a string of celebrities, sitting down (generally at cafés), drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes and making conversation.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen anything from Jim Jarmusch will be well aware of the unconventional and quirky style that he uses. It may put some viewers off, but there are always audiences that relish when a director steps outside of the mainstream and does something completely different. The films may not make it big at the box-office, but they are a testament to the directors love for art.<br/><br/>From the above description, it's pretty clear that this will not be a film that everybody will embrace. As with most indie and art house films, it will mostly appeal to a specialised audience. Some viewers will certainly be put off by the lengthy sequences of dialogue, and the occasional aimless feel that the film has. This does, however, seem to be the point. The film is purely an observation of life.<br/><br/>Even though not all of the films sequences are on the same level, it doesn't affect the film too much overall. All scenes are punctuated with amusing moments and humour, and the black & white cinematography looks and feels great. Jim Jarmusch has captured the quiet, aimless and sometimes awkward moments that occur in peoples daily lives wonderfully. The cast (including Cate Blanchett, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Bill Murray and Alfred Molina) are all great, and the acting (needless to say) is of a high standard. The film is certainly worth viewing, but will unfortunately never have mass appeal."
"Grant_Price","8","0","1","11 December 2007"," A coffee pot of ideas. Like a melting pot but with a crappy pun.
","Having only seen one other Jim Jarmusch film, the understated 'Broken Flowers' (2005), I was not entirely sure what to expect from Coffee and Cigarettes. Composed over nearly a twenty year period, Jarmusch offers eleven captivating snapshots into the lives of a multitude of quirky characters connected only by the leitmotif of the eponymous title. Unique for C&C is that every character is referred to by their real-life name, with most playing exaggerated versions of themselves (Bill Murray, Meg and Jack White, Steve Coogan, Alfred Molina, RZA, GZA, Iggy Pop, Tom Waits) and others (Cate Blanchett, Isaach de Bankolé, Alex Descas, Renee French, William Rice, Roberto Bengini, Steven Wright) bringing to life intriguing individuals that you actually want to find out more about. This is where the appeal in C&C lies, in that the audience can use the segments to speculate on why these people are meeting for coffee (or, in two exceptions, tea), what has happened beforehand and what will happen to them once they leave. For example, why is Renee French, in the segment 'Renee' sitting on her own drinking coffee whilst reading a catalogue about handguns and hunting knifes? Perhaps she is an assassin, enjoying a moment of peace and clarity before she murders somebody across the street. What is left unsaid between Alex Descas and Isaach de Bankolé in 'No Problem?' Why, as best friends, have they not seen each other for two years? Why is Bill Murray hiding in a coffeehouse? For what reason are Iggy Pop and Tom Waits meeting each other 'Somewhere in California?' Does William Rice seem to pass away at the end, or merely fall asleep? Questions like these are purposely raised throughout C&C but are never answered. It's rather scintillating stuff, and much has to be left to the imagination. <br/><br/>It is also rather amusing stuff. There is always an underlying sense of awkwardness between the characters in each segment which constantly threatens to boil over, leading to both parties usually unintentionally insulting the other and one making an excuse to leave. The best example of this is in the aforementioned 'Somewhere in California' segment, where Iggy Pop seems to constantly fall foul of a laconic Tom Waits (""You think I need a drummer? What, so I'm not good enough to do it myself?"") Another good example is in the segment 'Cousins', where two polar opposite cousins, one a successful film star, the other a free spirit and both played exceptionally well by Cate Blanchett, share an uncomfortable ten minutes envying each others' lifestyles before the movie star cousin is summoned away (""Maybe I'll get to meet Lou next time!"" ""His name is Lee."") A final highlight (there are many to choose from) is the representation of Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan as two extremely English stereotypes, with Molina as the gracious, polite and slightly bumbling gentleman and Coogan as the sarcastic, uninterested fop (""He's a very committed environmentalist."" ""Spike Jonze is a tree hugger? Jesus, I never would've had him down as that."" ""Well... I think he prefers the term 'leaf people.'"") There are only a couple of misfires in C&C and these lie in the ostentatious 'Jack shows Meg his Tesla Coil' and 'Delirium' segments. They do not seem to fit with the other stories. There is no intrigue or wonder. Whereas the other segments had an element of realism about them, these two feel overtly artificial and forced. It does not help that for 'Jack Shows Meg...', neither Meg nor Jack White can act. They should have just played a song for five minutes instead. Also, in Delirium, despite having one of the greatest living actors, Bill Murray, his setup is so far removed from the other shorts that it seems like some kind of Saturday Night Live sketch (No way! Bill Murray talking to the Wu-Tang Clan dressed as a waiter and drinking straight from the pot. Mental!) It's a shame because 'Broken Flowers' shows how well Jarmusch employed Murray to give a fantastic, yet modest performance. <br/><br/>To conclude, Coffee and Cigarettes is a veritable treasure trove of characters, ideas and implications which should find resonance in some form or another with anybody, but if you're reading this and shaking your head don't worry; you're probably just a Taco Bell kind of guy."
"Autlan","8","0","1","9 November 2007"," Masterful character study. Hard to criticise effectively.
","I start off by noting that this was not nearly as gratifying as its influence, Port and Cigars. Though masterful in its own light and very difficult to criticise effectively, it's always important to spotlight chronology as THE base element of ALL things.<br/><br/>It's a solid character study. A lot of the interactions are complex, stuttering and uncomfortable. Edgy enough that you'll have to pay attention to draw any actual meanings out of the experience. Others are whimsical to the point of comic relief. What Tarantino wants to do, but can't, because he's a cinematographer and not a writer.<br/><br/>Though the conversations are loosely connected -- by minute references or the oft-repeated surgeon general's warning -- the film flows smoothly from scene to scene. None of the well known names disrupt the blend and yet the spread is wide enough to grant a few glowing crests and assign a couple of dragging troughs to everyone. It's hard not to be pulled into the settings; you forget you're watching a film until that rude vignette knocks you out of your seat and forces you to resettle. The times that you do find yourself lapsing out, there are always interesting props or perspectives to focus on. The alternative, skipping scenes, on the DVD, will, I think, detract from the viewing experience and it's not the sort of film you could watch too often either; predictability, like the title, will kill."

Alas, Tex didn't see the witch hunt coming. Just today I saw a flock of smokers caged in a tiny glass box at the airport. In a world where health nuts make the rules and smoking is the new manslaughter, this gem of a movie comes just in time. It's an unbridled tribute to addiction and a celebration of the otherworldly peace afforded by a cup of coffee and a smoke, the ultimate guilty pleasures drinkers of fruit juice and herbal tea will never know. That being said, it's easy to hate Roberto Benigni, even for coffee addicts and lovers of tobacco, but you've got to pay the man some respect for his pre-dental appointment espresso routine. He's only outdone by Bill Murray, old school lover of all things black. In the ""Delirium"" episode, Murray takes it straight from the mug and fights his cough with oven cleaner from an unseen gallon jug. He is the man.

","The premise of this experiment from Jim Jarmusch conditions the final results: a series of couple (of celebrities) talking about nothing in particular, apparently they're improvising. So, some of the scenes are really stupid, such as the first one with Roberto Benigni or that one with the White brothers. Some others are really brilliant, especially that one in which Cate Blanchett splits into two characters and makes a parody of herself (great editing work and great performance of Miss Blanchett), it is also a nice self-parody the scene with Scott Coogan and Alfred Molina. As for the one with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits it's rather silly as well, but it's worth watching these two legends face to face.<br/><br/>The final balance is irregular, but since the stories are very short is not a a boring movie.<br/><br/>*My rate: 5'5/10"

","Now, I am a big Jarmusch fan, owning many of his movies, with the aspiration to own them all, and I have been looking forward to this movie for a long time, having seen the trailer, and being a big fan of many of the actors and artists in it.<br/><br/>However, I have to admit that I am disappointed, and not just a little disappointed. I felt myself getting impatient with it, getting a little annoyed even, although that did go away. The whole movie was just... awkward. The ""coffee and cigarettes"" of the title, well... the only thing they seem to have added to this movie is to prolong the very long awkward moments in the movie. If there had been no cigarettes, no coffee, then the movie would have been mercifully shorter.<br/><br/>There were a few good moments, a few chuckles, and perhaps even a good laugh or two, and a nice moment, but really, I could only recommend this movie to hard-core Jarmusch fans, if at all. It has the feel of second-rate actors having learned their lines, and only barely, in perhaps 10 minutes between more important things. The actors and the artists in this movie are not second-rate by any stretch of the imagination, so it really is a disservice to them.<br/><br/>I only hope that I will one day watch it again, and find redemption in either my opinion of this movie, or in my general opinion of Jarmusch."

","I didn't expect an enthralling action movie or drama upon finally deciding to watch, 'Coffee and Cigarettes'. In fact, I thought I'd never watch 'this kind of film'. Feeling slightly depressed one evening however, I just wanted to lay back to something intelligent with a unique perspective. As it turns out, I was quite pleased. And it's not because I'm some kind of artsy film student. That couldn't be further from the truth. People simply tend to have interesting conversations over drinks. Even more, intelligent people tend to speak their mind over drinks, or at least show it in their facial expressions. Some of the sketches captured precisely what I hoped to see (e.g. between Iggy Pop and Tom Waits) while others were rather boring (e.g. Renee). Some just didn't quite fit in with the rest (e.g. Vinny Vella). This movie isn't about humor or drama but rather just a slice of life at the pace it should be. I don't smoke or drink much coffee but it made me feel like having evening tea more often, with intelligent company to boot. There really isn't much more to life than savoring such moments."
"deadmanjones","8","0","1","2 September 2006"," Hilarious
","This is probably the most successful of Jarmusch's long series of one-take conversation pieces. As usual the themes are of permanent vacations, of being a stranger at home, of the chess game of social niceties, and of the unity of triviality. Here though each conversation has a series of motifs that underpin the whole, aide de memoires not readily found in Jarmusch's other non-narrative pieces. More importantly most of the vignettes here are hugely entertaining, usually playing on perceived images of the actors themselves (Cate Blanchett playing dual roles as movie star and overly down to earth jealous cousin; Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan playing tag team Englishness on the Hollywood ladder; Jack White showing Meg White his Tesla coil...). It's a great conversation starter of a film."

","After seeing Broken Flowers the other day, I had great expectations for this Jarmusch film. I must say that I was disappointed. It was funny at times (especially the part with Molina and the one called No Problem). But it got pretty repetitive at the end. The RZA/GZA/MURRAY story had some lines and ideas from the one with Iggy Pop, and the last story had some lines and ideas from the one about the Tesla coil thing (with the White Stripes duo - a really lame casting choice).<br/><br/>Cate Blanchet was really good, playing both characters of her story (which seemed kinda odd, since she was playing two cousins. Now how come cousins look the same just like twins?). <br/><br/>The worst thing was the song playing during the end credits.

"mojojobob","Null","0","1","4 April 2006"," Life's a Gas: Jarmusch on Zen and the Art of Black Comedy
","The second wave of graduates from New York University's film program yielded the likes of the Cohen brothers and Spike Lee, independent virtuosos well versed in the history of cinema. This immense knowledge of the medium's stylistic repertoire gave way to a synergy of past avant gardes, mutating into a new dialect of film that would be eventually accepted by mainstream audiences. Then there's Jim Jarmusch. A punk with a camera, concerned more with the expression of realism then the limits of narrative. Jamusch's affinity for visual simplicity lead to his unmistakable cinematography, series of still shots closely framed to his actors. The sound and story elements of his movies also follow this pattern, while straightforward, engaging the viewer with a complex versatility of the non-chalant. Jim Jarmusch's films bleed the sense that he himself doesn't care whether or not you love them, its not up to him to explain his genius, but genius it is all the same. Deadman is a perfect film, and a befitting masterwork for the apprentice of the western pioneer Nicholas Ray. While his style can be exhausted upon watching his films back to back, it is an originality unequaled in his approach and in the movie's thematics. While Jarmusch's films hearken back to french cinema of the 50's and 60's, they completely break away from their foundations and Coffee and Cigarettes is the perfect example of the difference between great films derived of previous auteur's and true creativity that resembles past conventions. It looks like Shadows or Don't look back, it focuses upon open-ended conversations between a small cast of characters, the movement of the film's pace relies almost solely upon the performances of his actors, and it focuses upon the realistic relationships established by the characters/surroundings. Yet, it feels vastly different then the humble beginnings of the independent film. Jarmusch is the master of making the audience assimilate the humor, profoundness, and the idea of life's unequivocal nature of matter-of-factness. Each character represents the foreigner in all of us, how we are aware of ourselves, but still unsure of our place within our surroundings. We are ourselves flummoxed by our own sensibilities, even when just sharing a smoke and a cup of black coffee with another stranger who wears the same shoes. And like every good punk rocker, Jarmusch is self-indulgent and pretentious, but never does he try to hide these imperfections, his aim is true. 100% genuine New York cool, abstracted to perfection, like Basquiat and Warhol before him."

","This movie was my first exposure to the work of Jim Jarmusch. If his other films are as interesting as this, I will be collecting the rest of them for sure. People who are thinking of watching this movie must realize one thing: it is definitely not for everyone. A lot of people I have spoken to can't stand movies that don't have an relatively easy storyline and a ""twist"" ending. This movie is nothing like the mainstream films released on a weekly basis in your local cineplex.<br/><br/>There is no singular storyline leading up to some great climax. This film is a collection of eleven shorts featuring celebrities sitting down over a pot of coffee (or tea, in some cases) and chatting. While it doesn't sound like much, this movie is actually more fun than it seems. Jarmusch paired together some celebrities that feel almost like exact opposites. For instance, the slow-speaking, soft-spoken comedian Steven Wright and the hyped-up exuberant Robert Benigni. It did drag during some segments, but never enough for me to lose interest.<br/><br/>Everyone is bound to find a segment that they really love in this movie. My personal favorite was the scene between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, where Molina gushes like an obsessive fanboy to an indifferent Coogan before the tables are turned. I am sure there is something for everyone in this movie. Unfortunately, I think most people will pass by this movie feeling that it has no point or meaning. The fun of this movie is merely watching the interactions between the people, whether they be amusing, uncomfortable, etc."

I also want to understand why the words in this scene get repeated in another scene with Bill Murray and the Wu Tang clan guys.

Being a set of vignettes I was able to last to the end of any sketch I didn't like in the knowledge that next one promised something even if occasionally it didn't deliver. The highlights featured some unlikely but successful combinations as the RZA and the GZA with Bill Murray and Roberto Benigni with Steven Wright (how's that for contrast?). Other sketches featuring Cate Blanchett as cousins and Steve Coogan with Alfred Molina could have done with editing. The sketches ""No Problem"" and ""Champagne"" should have been consigned to the ashtray! <br/><br/>A bit of fun, don't allocate too much time for it.

Like in Pulp Fiction there was the conversation on foot massages, R.Dogs the conversation on what Madonna meant by for the song 'Like a virgin', and in Kill Bill the speech about Superman<br/><br/>Its a beautiful black and white film, shot in different locations, but all with the same running feature.

They accuse each other of taking clothes, then Steve Buscemi comes over to serve them coffee and he discussing whether they're twins and they discuss Elvis<br/><br/>Segment Cousins Cate Blanchet- Shelly Cate Blanchet- Cate (playing her self and both roles)<br/><br/>This one is about Cate playing her self and her cousin. I actually had to double check quite a few times to see if it really was her playing her self, and it was. Excellent stuff right here<br/><br/>Segment Cousins? Alfred Molina- Alfred Steve Coogan- Steve<br/><br/>This one is called cousins again, this stars 2 UK actors, one was Dr. Ock from Spiderman 2 (Molina) and the other was in numerous other things. But this maybe the funniest in the sense of dry humour. Steve is basically a top joint actor, and Alfred is a small time actor. When Alfred wants to meet with Steve, Steve doesn't really pay him enough attention, Alfred even tells him they're they are biological cousins, and Steve takes no notice. Alfred then asked Steve for his number, but gets rejected. Until Alfred goes to take a call, from someone called 'Spike'...When Alfred sits down, Steve is laughing away wondering who it is, then Alfred says its Spike Jonze..In return Steve asks to give his number to Alfred, and he is obviously denied..<br/><br/>Perfect British dry sarcastic humour in this chapter<br/><br/>Segment Those things a kill 'ya Joseph Rigano- Joe Vinny Vella- Vinny Vinny Vella Jr.- Vinny Jr. <br/><br/>2 Italian mobsters just talking on the effects of cigarettes and the fact that tobacco companies make money off killing people everyday. Also stars A mute young actor, who begs his pops for some money, very classy, funny and concise chapter here<br/><br/>Segment Delirium (all playing their selves) Rza Gza Bill Murry<br/><br/>This is the reason why I got the film, Gza and Rza waiting on Ghostface in a restaurant, and they are approached by a waiter with a coffee pot. Rza previously was talking down on the effects of coffee, and said that herbal remedies was much better. Bill sat down with them and and told them he is hiding out (dudes a f****** legend, i don't care!!)..<br/><br/>He told them he was having some throat troubles, he said he had a smokers cough, Rza directed him to gargle some special remedy, Gza told him to gargle some oven cleaner. When Rza and Gza had finished, Bill went to the kitchen and you can hear him gargling, in which Rza and Gza quickly left<br/><br/>Over-all its a brilliant movie/film/someones thoughts on camera.

You probably won't rave about every scene, but you will probably find at least a few sketches that you love. Everyone I know who has seen it enjoys retelling their their favorite moments. I particularly enjoyed the brother and sister discussing the homemade Tesla coil. This is one of the more subtle scenes, but it is priceless when the seemingly ditsy sister calmly explains, in specific technical language, why the Tesla coil broke down. The movie is about stereotypes and obsessions, and breaking out of stereotypes and obsessions. Or maybe it is about not much at all, just like the kind of talk that goes on while drinking coffee and lighting up a cigarette."

I'm neither a cigarette smoker nor a coffee drinker, but now I find myself yelling at the screen ""I totally relate!"" And that's the beauty of this film told in 11 short (5-10 min) segments. You will relate to at least one--perhaps all--of the characters.<br/><br/>The key to understanding the whole movie (don't worry... no spoilrs) is in a subtle metaphor repeated twice: philosopher/inventor Nikola Tesla suggested that the Earth is a conductor of acoustical resonance. Simply put, an acoustical conductor is something that vibrates in sympathy with all sound waves, like a tuning fork. Then if the Earth is a conductor, the ""sound waves"" are us. People. In this case: coffee house people. Director Jarmusch takes us on a tour of coffee houses all over the world and lets us listen in on conversations, the way the Earth hears them.<br/><br/>From there, you may draw your own philosophical conclusions.

I loved his work in Sideways, here in American Splendor he's a little bit too histrionic. The way he grunts or scratches his head seem a little bit forced to me.

Jim Jarmush started doing this movie 17 years ago when he did the first scene and did it one in couple of years ever since.<br/><br/>It's not long, only about 90 minutes and it's also very light, for me that is. One of my friends who came with me said that he was bored to death. I guess that it was too clever for him... :) The movie is in black and white which suits it very well because it looks exactly like it should. The colours would have ruined it.<br/><br/>Now when I think of it, I think that the movie got kind of Seinfield humor. Very recommended if it sounds like the movie for you."

","The 11 comic conversations over coffee and cancer sticks comprising Jim Jarmusch's latest are shot in beautiful monochrome with great incidental music but prove disappointingly uneven.<br/><br/>Made piecemeal since 1986, they put together combinations such as Jack and Meg White, Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, Steve Wright and Roberto Benigni, but too often feel contrived and flat when they should have buzzed with banter.<br/><br/>That said, when they work they really motor. Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina share a deliciously uncomfortable and perfectly played encounter when the latter finds they're related, Cate Blanchett is funny as herself and her cousin in a discussion about the nature of celebrity while Bill Murray goes on a wry caffeine binge with Wu Tang Clanners RZA and GZA."
"certainty_in_nothing","8","0","1","21 February 2005"," An elegant portrayal of the mundane.
","This movie is more of a quirky comedy than a laugh-out-loud comedy. The very fact that it is so mundane and has so many awkward silences make it very purely human. This is the sort of realism that most mainstream movies avoid like the plague. Jim Jarmusche uses it, on the other hand, to create wonderfully relatable encounters that emphasize that we are all human, and we all share universal cultural references. The interweaving of dialogue and character backgrounds and actions give a sense of continuity with enough variation to exercise your memory- but not overexert it- both for earlier dialogues and for that leftover trivia from highschool science classes. If nothing else, its a real treat to see pop icons sitting around like the rest of us, and evoking the same delightful chit chat that we get with friends. Its nothing brilliant, but its positively priceless."

","Having heard of Jim Jarmusch but not seen any of his films I thought I'd give him a go. If this was representative of his work I wont see any more.<br/><br/>Films structured around vignettes can be engaging with the right material: ordinary people - real life, slices of the drama of the ordinary. This was not that; it was just a sequence of Jim's famous mates expanding on some less than engaging and theme-less theme of coffee and cigarettes.<br/><br/>I didn't get it and I don't think there was anything *to* get. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogans skit was funny; the only highpoint in a flat film.<br/><br/>Don't bother. Spend the ticket price on beer."
"max-crack","5","0","1","24 January 2005"," Good soundtrack and nice looking images, but not much else
","""Coffee and Cigarettes"" is a series of a dozen or so vignettes of varying length, spliced together to form one whole movie. The plot, such as it is, involves various characters of varying likability holding conversations in various locations over, you guessed it, exactly those two stimulants. Might sound vague, but er, that's about it. As might be expected, some of the sequences work better than others. Some are quirky and interesting (Iggy Pop and Tom Waits as two prickly rock stars; Cate Blanchett playing two sparring cousins, with a body double and lots of over-the-shoulder shots) and some are just plain annoying (Bill Murray and two rappers = bathroom break for me and quite a few others in the auditorium).<br/><br/>The film is shot in high contrast black-and-white and uses consistently interesting locations throughout, plus there is great music playing in the background of each sequence; this means you can just enjoy looking at this film even if you're not really following the rambling dialogue. And you can stay for the credits and wonder how come so many people worked on the project when there's not really a whole lot to show for their efforts. Worth seeing, but probably not so interesting on DVD as on the big screen, and if you're expecting plot line or action, or even some laughs, you'll be disappointed."

","This film is a marvelous selection of short movies. With a superb cast. Everybody will recognize him or herself in this picture, even if you don't smoke. You should take your time for this movie. It's almost a film noir if you like, happily the last scene makes everybody feel good. Steve Buscemi tells an Elvis fantasy in his Buscemi supreme acting fashion. The story with the female movie star is really touching, how jealous can women be! However the male wannabe actor out-acted the male movie star, good play in both scenes. I don't understand why some of the figures drank tea, what's the underline in the tea-drinking? For tea contains caffeine as well..."
"guyfromjerzee","5","0","1","11 January 2005"," Not Jarmusch's best work
","Jim Jarmusch is the kind of director you can either love or hate. I'm sure there are people who find his films incredibly boring and pointless. I happen to enjoy most of his work. He really knows how to write characters and dialogue, and somehow make mundane situations interesting. ""Stranger Than Paradise"" is a prime example of that. But ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" doesn't quite work. It has those Jarmusch-esquire qualities that I've enjoyed in his past films, but this film just didn't click with me. I think part of the reason may be that rather than Jarmusch separating his film into one-act story lines, he separates it into tiny sketches. 6 minutes doesn't give me enough time to connect with each character. And when I see these characters I barely know stuck in these humdrum situations, it comes off as more boring than amusing. ""C and C"" isn't all that bad. Some of the vignettes actually work. I like the scene between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan. The scene with Bill Murray is OK, but considering his talents, Jarmusch surely could've used him better. I felt the same way about the scene between Steven Wright and Roberto Benigni--both highly talented comedians. If you want to check out Jarmusch's work, I better suggest you see ""Mystery Train,"" ""Stranger Than Paradise,"" ""Night on Earth"" or ""Ghost Dog."" But as a final positive note, I did like the rendition of ""Louie Louie"" played over the credits."

","Maybe it was the fact I went for a few pints before seeing the film, but I did find my attention wandering at points. Some of the conversations just seemed too long - you wanted them to just be over, or the punchline was glaringly obvious before we got to it. The themes that Jarmusch comes back to again and again were I think better explored elsewhere (esp Night on Earth, a wonderful film). The contrasts of black and white were neatly handled however, and Cate's section really came alive. And then there was the final sequence - elegiac and haunting, it cast a different light over the whole film, and made me want to watch it again, thinking about how death is so close and all we have is these absurd moments really...Yes, don't watch this film if these kind of thoughts are not your thing! (And incidentally I went to see it in the same 'university cinema' as Bungle-9 and can report some audience laughter, but does not seem a crime to either a)study film or b)enjoy it)."
"lladon","Null","0","1","6 November 2004"," Brilliant!
","A series of short films produced over the last decade by Jim Jarmusch on the subject of Coffee and Cigarettes. Filmed entirely in black and white of varying qualities, it features a varied cast of Roberto Benigni, Steve Buscemi, Iggy Pop, Tom Waits, Cate Blanchett, Bill 'Bill Murray' Murray, Steve Coogan, Alfred Molina, and The White Stripes. Them among others, are featured in multiple conversations over coffee and cigarettes, often resulting in a casual conversation that is often hilarious simply because its repetitive and mild. Often what a conversation is. The conversation between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan is especially good, because of their talents with making the most boring script seem a lot more exciting. Their on-screen presence is carried with them through their films, and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>My friends are often critical of my film preferences, but this is one where I will protest. The theater was filled with people coughing, because they had all come to see something full of punchlines, in-your-face humour, and a blockbuster budget. These people obviously didn't read any reviews of this film, in its separate parts, over the past decade. Its not that kind of film, not in the least.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Jarmusch's films, and if I am, I'm currently un-aware of it. This didn't stop me from laughing outloud through most of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can put this film on the top of my B&W favorites, along with The Man Who Wasn't There, Clerks, King Kong, and The Third Man."

","If you don't love Jim Jarmusch's films... intensely love them... then stay away. If you are interested in seeing some of the great character actors of Jarmusch's films interact in a quasi-scripted manner, you will do no harm by watching Coffee & Cigarettes. Frankly, this film should only be watched by Jarmusch aficionados, as there are subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) jokes associated with the films that have spanned his career. It's a great companion piece for any Jarmusch fan. I refused to rate this movie simply because you cannot rightly compare it to anything. What is comforting is that at the time of this posting, it has achieved over a 6.0 rating, which even some ""real"" movies barely aspire to. If you saw this film and enjoyed pieces, I recommend watching ""Ghost Dog"" and watching his films in reverse order."

","I thought 8 out of 10 vignettes were HIGHLY ENTERTAINING. Esp. the ""Bill Murray"" scene w/ the Wu Tang guys and the Alfred Molina/Steve Cougan scene. I've been suspect of this film for a couple of years...thinking it would be another self-indulgent ""art film director"" tome that amuses three people. I was wrong. Not sure whether to credit the actors w/ their narrow, quirky delves into minutia ... or Jarmusch for his creative concept and directing approach. Wonder what his directing approach was anyway? How much was scripted vs. improv? The outtakes were--were there many?<br/><br/>In any case, ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" is the rare instance where I found a Jarmusch film nearly 100% engrossing. It's one of my favs."

","A series of vignettes featuring famous or semi-famous people drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes (you got that much from the title, right?).<br/><br/>In each scene the people are somewhat uneasy with each other.  Tom Waits makes a lot of barbed comments to Iggy Pop.  Steve Coogan snubs Alfred Molina.  Cate Blanchett has a mildly unpleasant visit with herself playing her cousin.<br/><br/>The movie is ok, not much better than that. It's an interesting idea, but it comes across a little slow and no motivation is ever explained. It's one of those movies you can watch once, but will never watch again.

"PulpFiction1987","8","0","1","29 July 2004"," 11 intricate conversations that are mostly successful *** out of ****
","Eleven conversations over coffee and cigarettes sums up the plot of this extremely original film but that does not do it justice. All but 2 of the conversations are compelling and interesting. With a huge cast that goes from Iggy Pop to Bill Murray its performances are flawless especially Cate Blanchettes characters in her segment ""Cousins"". The black and white filming make the look of the film more interesting and the conversations are all stringed along with great dialog which I believe is heavily improved. This is an incredibly interesting and great dialog film. The stories are all intricate (except the two that I mentioned) It's is fun to watch and the black and white add a touch a style to the film.. It is very, very well done and very very unconventional."
"Bob Pr.","7","0","1","1 August 2004"," Interesting; different; somewhat worthwhile
","This collection of eleven pieces is related primarily in that cigarettes and coffee are involved in each more or less prominently. <br/><br/>
The pieces all have the quality of being improvisations (although certainly the one in which Cate Blanchett plays the 2 characters must've been more fully scripted).  <br/><br/>The significance of the pieces, IMO, is in showing that within the smallest and most conventional of circumstances, sometimes profound truths, expositions of human traits, (or tantalizing mysteries) can be revealed or evoked.<br/><br/>They strike me as a series of études or experiments by the director and actors in reaching for those effects.  Some, of course, succeed more than others and we viewers will not always agree on which ones are the winners.<br/><br/>I found it very interesting to see how much can be accomplished with such minimums of plot or preceding build up.  I suspect the more you are a student of movies, especially their plots and narrative qualities (as well as acting to bring it to life), the more you'll find this of interest."
"Eyeball_Kid","Null","0","1","23 July 2004"," This movie is needed.
","In the modern day film making arena, few movies can make a true impact. The formulaic plots, the predictable character development, and the often stunning amount of money poured into one movie can sometimes overwhelm someone into thinking that it's good, when in actuality, it's merely a shiny piece of dreck. Coffee and Cigarettes is like a breath of fresh air because it has none of the aforementioned qualities. It is what it is, and nothing more. It's not glitzy, show-offy, grandiose crap. If you want to see a movie with huge budgets but lousy substance, go ahead. You can have your thoughts provoked or special effects.

"hrivnak","Null","0","1","16 June 2004"," Hit and miss, but ulimately rewarding
","Take this movie as what it is -- really just a series of short films about people's conversations over coffee and cigarettes.<br/><br/>In that regard, some of the shorts were more rewarding than others, with the highlights being Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, Bill Murray with RZA and GZA and Alfred Molina and Steve Coogans. The Tesla Coil episode with the White Stripes was pretty funny, but I don't think Meg White can act very well. Steve Buscemi was hilarious in his short, but I didn't like the point of the story. Cate Blanchette's dual role was interesting, but got boring after a while.<br/><br/>But really, these are just conversations and I think that's what makes this film original. There's no plot to speak of, just snapshots of life as it is. In fact, the one that hit home the most for me was the two friends who didn't talk about anything. It shows how the art of conversation has been lost... one friend just wants to see his old buddy, but the other friend thinks there has to be an ulterior motive. It's a great statement on the nature of society, and overall a great snap shot of what ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" is all about, the lost art of conversation."

","Jim Jarmusch's ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" is a collection of spare, comic vignettes that feature the beloved vices of the title. As with any film of this kind, some segments outshine others. However, ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" has a nice effect as a whole, with repeated bits of dialogue and visual motifs helping to tie it all together. <br/><br/>The cast is eclectic and appealing. The inimitable Steve Buscemi is funny as a waiter with unique theories about Elvis, Iggy Pop and Tom Waits share an amusingly passive-aggressive conversation, and Cate Blanchett is quite good in a dual role as both herself and her cousin. Jack and Meg White make a lovably surreal appearance, with Jack in particular proving himself a strong screen presence. The two comic highs of the film are one bit featuring Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan and another with Bill Murray opposite RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. A final segment featuring William Rice and Taylor Mead closes the proceedings on a strange, dreamy note.<br/><br/>And all of this adds up to...? A unique, droll little movie for those in search of a change of pace."
