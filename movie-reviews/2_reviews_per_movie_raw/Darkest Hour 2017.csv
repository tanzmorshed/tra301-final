"MartinHafer","10","342","429","24 October 2017"," Well worth seeing just to watch Oldman's performance.
","At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.<br/><br/>Now I must point out that I am a retired history teacher and I consider Winston Churchill to be perhaps the greatest politician of the century. So, I clearly have a bias and predisposition towards liking the movie...especially if it's done well. Is it a crowd pleaser? Maybe not, as the average movie-goer (especially teens) might not enjoy this or care a lick about the film.<br/><br/>The story covers only a portion of the month of May, 1940...just before the fall of France during WWII. Prime Minster Chamberlain is about to be tossed out of office, as his appeasement strategy with Hitler has turned out to be completely stupid. In his place, some hope for Churchill to be the next Prime Minister...though some forces are working to depose him as soon as he comes to power. At the same time, the war is going as badly as it possibly can. Can Churchill survive this? Well, of course...duh, it's HISTORY!<br/><br/>The reasons to see this are two big ones....the film has achieved the look of 1940 beautifully and Gary Oldman provides an Oscar- winning performance in the lead. If he is not at least nominated for this top award, I will be completely shocked...and he really managed (along with ample prosthetics) to LOOK and SOUND like the great man. Great job all around...and a perfect film."
"normando40","8","204","257","13 December 2017"," Another Gary Oldman Triumph
","It's a one man show about one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and what a show it is. Gary Oldman has been able to be Sid Vicious in ""Sid And Nancy"" with the same outstanding commitment and extraordinary results. Joe Wright, the gifted director of ""Atonement"" presents us with an irresistible version of Churchill through the magic powers of Oldman but sometimes he doesn't seem to trust the power of what he has in his hand. Eccentric cuts in the middle of a famous speech for instance and other stylistic distractions arrive with irritating frequency but that doesn't spoil. too much, the joy and fun of seeing Gary Olman in action. Also interesting to notice, Dunkirk provides a very moving moment for the second time this year."
"RNMorton","10","191","248","23 December 2017"," Outstanding even with some minor flaws
","I cannot remember the last time I was in a movie and I said, gee I wish this movie would keep going because it's just so damn good. I don't really have to say anything more about Oldman beyond what's already been said, that was brilliant Academy Award work. Despite being a literalist on history and not enjoying Hollywood embellishments/contrivances that didn't really happen, I will repeat something I said on another movie (Patton): I am okay where a fictional event is one that could have happened (or maybe happened out of time sequence) where it is used more to show the persona of the character than to establish an historical fact. Notwithstanding this, the subway scene may have been a little much. Strong cast throughout, including the portrayers of King George VI, Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill's lovely secretary (James). A must see for WW II buffs and appreciators of good cinema everywhere."
"ferdinand1932","6","220","290","11 February 2018"," Almost history
","As a film this is quite good; it's not dull, the performances are good, the production design is excellent, the script is a professional piece of work and even Oldman's make-up is not too distracting. <br/><br/>However, something is not right. If most people get their history from movies, this is concerning. It's obvious that actual events occurred with real people and what they did and said but in a movie this gets pasteurized into what smart people believe will be more thrilling, more sympathetic, more emotional. That process necessarily alters things into something that is even anachronistically rendered and therefore not in the record.<br/><br/>This defect occurs frequently in this movie , so it's not history but myth making. A good example is Churchill's dive into the Underground to meet the common person to steel his resolve. Now Churchill had a mixed view of the average voter, and he was a patrician, but even that aside, he did not need to take a Tube train survey to gauge opinion. <br/><br/>This scene is poached from Shakespeare's Henry V where the king goes among his soldiers the night before battle to hear them and take courage from their strength. Steal from the best is a good policy, but it's not history. It's Shakespearean history and that trades effect for accuracy too.<br/><br/>The audience is given this scene to present Churchill as an instrument of democracy; he's acting for what the people want, therefore he's doing the right thing. It's called pandering.<br/><br/>Well, it is just a movie."
"michaeljtrubic","8","129","177","25 September 2017"," Wonderfully refreshing look at Churchill
","I'm sure I am not alone in having seen everything ever filmed about the man.<br/><br/>But this is nothing like I have seen before. He is so funny.<br/><br/>We see his ability to make jokes like never before and there is more here than just dry sarcastic references. <br/><br/>He keeps us in stitches. He must have told 25 jokes.<br/><br/>This film starts in the days when Chamberlain knows he cannot continue as prime minister, alongside the crippling uncertainty of his cabinet meetings, and through to when the entire country, as a result of his speeches, stands firmly behind Churchill as war leader.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most was how large a role the opposition party played in Churchill's rise to power.<br/><br/>Excellent supporting cast from those distinguished actors we have seen in many BBC productions and ""Game of Thrones"".<br/><br/>Ben Mendelsohn's portrayal of King George VI was stunningly well done.<br/><br/>A real delight at Tiff - too bad no Q&A for my screening."

","At just under 1000 votes so far, I am stunned at the number of ""1"" votes. On the other hand, the 2nd-highest number of votes is for ""10"", so there is very much a love-it-or-hate-it quality to the voters.<br/><br/>It would be helpful if some of the ""1"" voters explained why they hated the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is about British backroom parliamentary politics, in the 1st month of Winston Churchill's prime ministership. With the war going badly, a rearguard of peaceniks is still trying to get a peace deal with Hitler, despite having been pushed out of power.<br/><br/>It certainly worked for me, a political junkie.

","This film is absolutely brilliant from the acting to the sets..the editing is tight. Thrilling. It took me about 1 minute to accept Gary Oldham as Churchill...after that I was sold.<br/><br/>Probably my favorite film of 2017 so far. Pacing is superb.

"themadmovieman","9","99","147","3 December 2017"," Historically fascinating, but most importantly filled with exhilarating energy, humour and passion throughout
","Not only is this a riveting account of one of the most important moments of the Second World War, but it's also an exhilarating drama that goes beyond being a simple biography by bringing humour, energy and passion to every moment. With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.<br/><br/>When telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.<br/><br/>Yes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.<br/><br/>That's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.<br/><br/>Above all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.<br/><br/>While the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.<br/><br/>As well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.<br/><br/>This is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.<br/><br/>Finally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare."
"MOscarbradley","5","93","138","10 February 2018"," Oldman's great; pity about the film.
","When Meryl Streep won her third Oscar for playing Margaret Thatcher in ""The Iron Lady"" it was as much for her make-up as it was for her acting, (it's actually one of her least interesting performances; more mimicry than anything else). The same can't be said of Gary Oldman's turn as Winston Churchill in Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"". It's a phenomenal performance that demolishes all previous Churchills. Yes, he looks the part thanks again to his hugely talented make-up artists and he has the voice off pat, but more importantly he gets inside Churchill's heart and head which is, perhaps, something of a surprise considering the material he's been given to work with is really rather third-rate.<br/><br/>Wright's film, which simply covers the month of May 1940 when Churchill was elected Prime Minister and saw the evacuation at Dunkirk has every cliche in the book including a disasterous scene when Winston decides to ride the Underground for the first time in order to gauge public opinion. This sequence is positively embarrasing though Oldman just about manages to carry it off. Elsewhere the film is very unevenly acted. The men have the best of it with both Ben Mendelsohn and Ronald Pickup impressing as the King and Neville Chamberlin respectively. On the other hand, Kristin Scott Thomas isn't given enough to do as a rather genteel Clemmie and Lily James makes for a very dull secretary. So then, very much a hit and miss affair worth seeing for Oldman's Oscar-winning performance, (they may as well put his name on it now), providing you are prepared for another lame history movie and Wright's poorest picture to date."
"davidink","2","133","208","20 February 2018"," I feel cheated
","I really enjoyed the movie and am a big Oldman fan. But got sad and even angry when I read about how every event that cought your attention is not true. Never took place. Pure fiction. Like the train ride, or the verbal battles about peace negotiations, or who initiated Operation Dynamo, or peoples reactions to his speeches. <br/><br/>I can accept when movie makers make 5 things happen in one day that actually took place on different days or merge 5 peripheral persons into one, as they so often do, to give it better momentum. But to take liberties with historical facts, the ones that make the foundation of the movie. Stop doing that... It should be illegal.<br/><br/>And for those in a bad mood now: Check out ""Young Winston"" from 1972. AFAIK depicts truth well, and at least I was surprised to know about his youth."
"jacksoncb-34205","3","36","51","1 February 2018"," A complete butchering of history - a great dissapointment
","For a film that is supposed to be based on a true story, this film represents a complete butchering of history for it is - at many points - factually and historically incorrect. Every inch was covered with falsehoods. All the official papers, minutes and biographies from those who worked with him at that time make clear that at no point did he consider entering into peace talks, even if the BEF at Dunkirk was destroyed he was determined that the country should fight on. He did not ride the tube asking the public for their opinions on continuing the fight; he did take the argument to continue the struggle to the Cabinet after pressure from Halifax and Chamberlain to enter talks with Hitler and received great support. It was not a gathering of MPs in Parliament. Oldman and the film failed miserably to catch the power and oratory of Winston's wartime speeches, please listen to the originals. Operation Dynamo was not conceived at the last minute as portrayed. There is not much in the film that is factually correct and there is too much to write about the inaccuracies in my review. All those who worked with Winston Churchill including those from the military always spoke of his great energy, presence, incredible workrate and ability to fit 2 days worth of work into a single day, they knew they were working with a political and oratorical goliath in history. None of this was portrayed or came across in the film.<br/><br/>Bottom line is it is a shame that many of those who watch this movie will come away thinking this was what Churchill was like and this was how history unfolded, which could not be further from the truth. Take it all with a fistful of salt. The film diminshes the man and his record in saving Britain and most likely the world from Nazi domination.<br/><br/>Equally, the Director and Producers have presented Winston Churchill - the greatest Briton of all time - as a bumbling, mumbling, indecisive, drunkard and in the process have sullied his name and done the great man a terrible disservice. The greates Briton of all time willbe spinning in his grave as I am after watching this trash. How dare they...."
"ozjosh03","4","46","67","14 January 2018"," A pile of old tosh
","I've grudgingly allotted four stars for three of the leading performances. Gary Oldman certainly pulls out all the stops to deliver a performance that is convincing, colourful and entirely unsurprising. Yet he's also acted off the screen by Ben Mendelsohn every time Winston meets King George, for Mendelsohn gives a performance that is more under-stated, more human and less obviously manipulative. Oldman is also out-charisma'd whenever Kristin Scott Thomas glides into view as Clemmie. So for all its earnest Oscar-worthiness, Oldman's performance isn't even the best in the film. Acting aside, there is almost nothing to recommend Darkest Hour. It's burdened with clumsy plot exposition that sounds precisely like it's been cut and pasted from a history book. It's undercut by cheap, unconvincing special effects. And, most remarkably of all - even if you've somehow been sucked in by the amateur dramatics - it has one spectacularly ill-judged scene that instantly sinks the entire enterprise. You won't have any trouble spotting which scene I mean. You'll probably be laughing out loud or reaching for something to hurl at the screen. It's when poor anguished Winston takes the advice of the King and determines to ask the British people what to do. So he heads for the London Underground and - travelling just one stop east on the District Line! - chats with a cross-section of plucky Brits who all urge him to fight on. It couldn't be more ridiculous if one said ""fight them on the beaches"", the next said ""fight them on the landing fields"" , and the next ""fight them in the fields"". It actually couldn't be more ridiculous if they all then simultaneously broke into a song titled ""We Shall Never Surrender"" and Winston danced merrily with a couple of pearly kings and queens. It's a scene so mind-bogglingly awful that any respect you might have had for the film drains completely away and you spend the rest of the running time pondering just how something so awful was ever contemplated, much less actually staged and shot."
"mark-russell43","4","117","183","15 January 2018"," A historical travesty
","This film covers a period of real tension and drama. So why does the film have to invent fiction to tell the story? Perhaps modern film making prioritizes a flowing narrative over the truth, but to misrepresent so many people telling the story accurately would have provided more than sufficient content staggers me.
Oldman plays his part as written well. Chamberlain and Halifax are quite unconvincing though and many of the scenes are so unrepresentative of what would have happened in the Britain of 1940 ruins the fictitious plot line. 
The number of historical inaccuracies are currently beyond counting, and many unecessary, for example Chamberlain was in pain in May 1940, but had yet to be diagnosed with cancer, and when he was he remained ignorant of the fact because his doctors elected not to tell him. Overall a huge let down."
"shanx24","6","122","203","12 September 2017"," Riveting production despite its pat view of history
","We go to the movies to be gripped by powerful narratives presented with good scripts and moving imagery. This film has all of it, most especially a riveting performance by Gary Oldman. <br/><br/>The subject matter will clearly divide audiences thanks to its pat view of history: UK as the righteous hero and everyone else as inept -- Italians and French losers, Germans the evil fascists, US completely unmentioned, Canada the quiet prairie for monarchs to escape to -- in the still-somewhat- mysterious Dunkirk incident where Hitler could easily have tightened the noose and pushed UK over the edge of what was evidently a crushing defeat, but somehow allowed them the leeway to escape by civilian boats. There's next to no mention of the French army that stood its ground and valiantly sacrificed itself to win a couple of days for the Brits on the beach. <br/><br/>All that said, as a film, this is a gripping narrative with just the kind of insouciant wit you'd expect from Churchill. While movies such as ""The Gathering Storm"" with Albert Finney were more considered, Darkest Hour is the kind of production that wows awards juries and audiences. Worthy watch when it comes to a theater near you. I feel Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" would be richer if you saw it *after* Darkest Hour."
"ian-whitehouse-1","1","112","188","26 January 2018"," Very Disappointing
","I expected so much more from this film but was totally disappointed. I didn't expect a documentary and any film has to enjoy some literary license but this is a work of sickly perfumed fiction which completely misrepresents the man to the point of unrecognizability. If the film is a portrayal of a man, then it is certainly not Churchill.<br/><br/>Churchill has to be understood in the light of his heritage and class. If a peripheral player initially, he was born into the ruling class. Like many only begrudgingly accepted into its ranks, he was therefore one of its strongest proponents. He believed he was born to rule just as much as commoners were born to die in the service of empire. The class system meant that he would never, ever have confided in someone he regarded as a commoner and the notion of him even addressing a black man is ludicrous. He was a committed racist firmly believing it to be the natural order of things. This is the man who, as a boy, simply wrote ""Marlborough"" on his entrance exam to Harrow believing this was enough to gain entry. It was.<br/><br/>Churchill was well known for summoning servants and government employees to action while he was toileting or in the bath. This was not because he was accessible, charismatic or comfortable with his body as portrayed in the film. Rather this was a man who simply didn't simply care what they thought because he was Churchill and they weren't.<br/><br/>The film quotes Churchill as supporting the marriage of Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson. In actuality Churchill was a pivotal character in opposing the marriage of Edward VIII to Wallis Simpson. Not because she was a divorcee and he was morally outraged (Churchill's father died of syphilis after a lifetime of philandering and his mother used sex as a social tool) but because he knew Edward would resign over it and he vehemently opposed Edwards desire to be an involved monarch. Simpson was widely believed to be having an affair with Von Ribbentrop (Hitlers foreign minister) and Churchill knew Hitler would use this to his benefit against a weak and easily influenced king. Churchill would never have been familiar with George VI and probably privately despised him as a weak and unprepared monarch. The royal family and many of their closest allies were closet supporters of Hitler believing him to be far preferable to the Communists who were a substantially more concrete threat. Churchill was utterly loyal to the throne and monarchy but George VI was only the current incumbent just as Edward VIII before him, had been.<br/><br/>The film portrays Halifax and Chamberlain as weak appeasers when in actuality their fears were the loss of a complete generation of men like that experienced in WWI. Horror was embedded deep within many politicians who had seen/survived active service during WWI and were desperate to not revisit that period. Chamberlain is recorded as believing Hitler would most likely break his word but knew he had no choice but to try and gain time for rearmament despite the cost to his own career and legacy.<br/><br/>It might not be a convenient truth but, successful evacuation of the troops at Dunkirk was solely because of 'Churchills' flotilla but probably because of Hitlers stated reluctance for a massacre. Hitler did not feel the British were the natural enemy (that was the communists) and that a massacre would negate the possibility of a agreement.<br/><br/>If Gary Oldham wanted to be Churchill, then he failed. Churchill was much more imposing, had a deeper voice with substantially more gravitas. Oldhams voice is thin and reedy and, at one point, he even adopts a regional accent. Churchill was a war monger, rude, inconsiderate, terribly ill mannered and selfish but would sacrifice himself in a second for the notion of service and empire. He was not your irascible but charming uncle as portrayed in this film."

","At the Paris Theater premiere in NYC last night, Joe Wright concluded his introduction by saying, ""This is a film about resistance."" That brought immediate and enthusiastic response from the crowd. Oldman gives a stunning performance, but the entire ensemble is clearly caught up in the relevance of the work, not a false note anywhere. Powerful film celebrating Churchill as in touch with the resilience and grit of working class commoners. The villains here are the snobbish pacifist appeasers. Hard to say what American audiences will make of this. It could go either way. There's enough populist ammunition here to leave a huge chunk of the American political landscape as devastated as the castle in Calais."

"magnuslhad","3","42","68","14 March 2018"," shallow myth-making
","There is a lightness of touch to Joe Wright, a frivolity, that invades the tone of this film and sets it off-kilter. Any biopic takes on the challenge of creating drama and tension from events we may already be familiar with. This is perhaps more pronounced when it comes to such a titanic historical figure as Churchill. The film rightly invests its time in showing just how fraught the political struggle Churchill faced to fight rather than negotiate was. Unfortunately, Darkest Hour lacks complexity in its portrayal. Churchill shouts at a secretary, who becomes a cheer-leading personal assistant. His wife is similarly one note, admonishing him while managing to steadfastly encourage him at the same time. Halifax and Chamberlain are reduced to vaudeville villainy, while the king is a pompous buffoon. There are some clunky set pieces, most notably a cringe-worthy outing by Churchill on a Tube train to engage with the good folk of Britain. These include a black man, the only black man on the train, and possibly in the whole film, and the most earnest child in the history of Albion. Stalinist propaganda filmmakers would blush at such tokenism. Oldman opts for acting as impersonation rather than interpretation. It's a convincing impersonation, but still mimicry rather than artistry. Wright's depiction of Dunkirk in 'Atonement' had the showmanship of the circus ring, and has been devalued by Nolan's recent more authentic portrayal. Churchill's darkest hour will no doubt be re-visited and re-evaluated in the future when a filmmaker more in tune with the material takes it on."

Hearing that the subway scene wasn't true did inevitably diminish its greatness for me, but that horrible ending! Out of nowhere! Left the movie on such a weird note."
"FlossieCat","3","13","18","9 April 2018"," When in doubt, print the legend
","This period of British and European history has been dealt with before and with a far better script.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this film along with Nolan's Dunkirk, have both been released as Britain prepares to leave the European Union and, according to some Brexiteers, once again plans to become a ""global power"". The rose-tinted approach to Britain's ""Finest Hour"" were once again very much on display here and the entire confection has clearly been aimed at an audience either too young or too uninformed to know anything about the reality.<br/><br/>Mr Wright does like his aerial shots, doesn't he? They were in danger of becoming somewhat tedious in this little piece we saw them so often.<br/><br/>And who wrote the script? We have Churchill and George VI having lunch with virtually no formality. Quite unlike the deference we know Churchill exhibited towards the monarchy. Then later we have George VI ""popping round"" to see Churchill at Number Ten and being received by Winston, who is in a slight state of deshabille, in what appears to his day bedroom (toffs have those apparently). Nor am I entirely sure Churchill would have kissed the King's hand after being invited to become PM, although such an action reeks of medieval ""homage"" ""liege lord/man"" and such like which will surely go down well with an American audience.<br/><br/>The history leaves much to be desired. There was no intent by the opposition (Labour and Liberals) to make Churchill PM and nor did Churchill abstain from the 8 May 1940 debate as the opening parliamentary scene shows. Likewise it was Chamberlain who suggested a coalition government, to which Churchill was opposed. Nor do I imagine Attlee was quite so bellicose in debate.<br/><br/>Then we have the ""flotilla of little ships"" scenario - where were the British and French navies? Anyone who has no knowledge of the events of late May 1940 will be left with the impression that the allied forces were rescued entirely by a motley collection of yachts and pleasure cruisers.<br/><br/>And it was not the entire British Army marooned in Dunkirk. Britain had its armed forces and its navy positioned across its Empire. This is another incidental that is forgotten in the starry-eyed ""Little England"" myth. Britain had a huge Empire that stretched around the globe. The forces at Dunkirk were the remnants of the BEF sent in 1939.<br/><br/>In the references to Nicholson at Calais, where were the the French and Belgian forces also fighting alongside the British? They never get mentioned.<br/><br/>The cherry on the cake for ludicrous nonsense was Churchill's trip on the tube. Where was his bodyguard? And what would Special Branch have had to say about his taking an impromptu ride on public transport?<br/><br/>The forelock tugging ""salt of the earth"" types including a Black Briton who quoted Macaulay were nauseating for both, hagiography and inaccuracy. I half expected them all to break into a chorus of ""Land of Hope and Glory"".<br/><br/>Contrary to such propaganda, Britain was far from united in its resolve to fight Hitler in 1940, as various historians, along with the contemporary Mass Observation accounts, have demonstrated. <br/><br/>The British government was seriously concerned about how the civilian population would react to, and cope with, total war, and there was a fear of what may ensue from the collapse of public morale.<br/><br/>The historical context of this film would have been far better served if such silly scenes had been omitted and we had been given insights into the American, French, and German viewpoints , in particular, Hitler's known ambivalence towards Britain.<br/><br/>Regrettably it seems that a fine actor like Gary Oldman, who was excellent in the part, has received his Oscar for one of his least memorable films, as unfortunately, did Al Pacino."

It is simply an utter shame that while this is very far from the worst film of the year, it's undoubtedly the most disappointing one.<br/><br/>The film's narrative takes place during May 1940. The Nazis are beginning to take control of much of western Europe, and Winston Churchill is named Prime Minister after a dissatisfied government in Parliament convinces Neville Chamberlain to resign. Much has been said in the press about Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill. While he does a fine job, the somewhat overdone nature of his performance makes clear that it is unfortunately not the Oscar slam-dunk performance we were all hoping for. The film's supporting cast, however, is quite good--as is the rapid but engaging pacing of the story's narrative.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what makes ""Darkest Hour"" a miss is the sad truth that the film's script is a disaster. The film exhausts itself with virtually every clichÃ© in the biopic/historical costume drama genres, such as: young female characters that basically do nothing except help the male protagonist, a large group of strangers introducing themselves to the protagonist after recognizing him, a sentimental climax meant to simply 'tie everything up' rather than make the audience reflect critically on the subject of the biopic, etc. The writing fails to address the points that made Churchill such an effective leader. All in all, while not terrible, this is a very bland biopic that was a huge letdown for me. 4.5/10"

Hoskins was both brooding and triumphant, as Winston was. And he genuinely fit (physically and emotionally) into the man he was portraying.

Sure, his acting was great, but I believe it to be an 'overplay'. Instead of capturing the essence of Churchill he sensationalized him, making him excited and over agitated far too often. Having seen many portrayals of Churchill, and reading quite a lot about him over my life, this version seemed entirely too....fictional. I think they could have done better."

","Garry Oldman first came to my notice as Sid. He now steps into Albert Finney's gigantic shoes, and does not disappoint. But a note of disapproval- it was not the Labour Party which brought down Chamberlain in 1940, it was Leo Amery, single handed, with the greatest, most passionate Cri de Coeur ever heard in a parliament until the Man himself unleashed the 18"" guns of the English Language.
 P.S. I should have mentioned Sir Roger Keyes turning up to the debate in Full Dress. A bit of Drang for Amery's Sturm. But it was Chamberlain's own party that delivered the Coup de Gras: Greenwood just sank the boot into the corpse."

","Historical drama in modern day Hollywood is in a dead end that seems endless at this moment. There are just not some decent scripts left, even if they are depicting some of the most fascinating characters and events of our civilization.
Yes, not even the rise of Winston Churchill can give us a non-sweetened and real story without much distortion of historical facts. No, ''Darkest hour'' can even grant us with some decent acting, and if Gary Oldman receives the ''Golden boy'' for his somewhat caricaturel portrayal of the greatest British politician of this century, it will represent a injustice, both to his impeccable career and his opponents in ''Kodak theater''. 
On the other hand, not everything will be dark in ''Darkest hour'', since Joe Wright will give us some really great focusing, light and overhead cuts, making it deservedly to all the major directing nominations.

","This biopic of a very narrow period in Winston Churchill's life - May 1940 to be exact - was probably made to earn British actor Gary Oldman the academy award, but man, did he ever earn it! This film won Oscars for Best Actor for Oldman and for makeup, and I'd say they definitely earned that. Great trouble is taken to make sure you believe you are looking right at Sir Winston. Oldman literally disappears into the part.<br/><br/>The film opens with Parliament in open rebellion over Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's failure to deal with Hitler and the opposition party demanding his resignation. Chamberlain wants Halifax to replace him, another appeasement advocate cut from the same cloth as he, but Halifax refuses saying his ""time has not yet come"". So Winston's party picks him literally - while holding their noses - because nobody else wants the job. And for good reason. Hitler is knocking over European countries with the ease of dominoes and the entire British army is trapped at Dunkirk, with so many damaged ships blocking the harbor that no other ship can get into it to rescue them.<br/><br/>Next we meet Oldman's portrayal of Sir Winston. He is a man of enormous appetites - food, drink, cigars - and sometimes tremendous temper. His spending brings him to the brink of bankruptcy multiple times. His party doesn't like him. The king resents him for how he advised his brother when he was planning to marry Wallis Simpson. And Chamberlain and Halifax STILL want to appease Hitler and because Churchill does not, they are working to undermine him, particularly with the king. <br/><br/>The film uses two obvious plot devices that are probably not based in fact. One is Churchill's young secretary who at first he scares to death with his tantrums, but later the two become close as he softens his approach with her . The other is a trip into a subway to get ""the man on the street's opinion"" about Hitler that just seems eye-rollingly over the top. There is a baby that the mother oddly says looks like Churchill, what seems like an interracial couple in 1940, and a woman who, from the way she is dressed, appears to be a socialist. Yet they to a man, to a woman, to a child, encourage Churchill to fight Hitler to the end. This fictitious event seems to be stolen from Shakespeare, but if you must steal, then steal from the best.<br/><br/>Honorable mention has to go to Kristen Scott Thomas as Clementine, Winston's supportive wife who is often overlooked by history. Also deserving mention is Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, who is portraying a man much more comfortable as monarch than he was portrayed in Then King's Speech, but then this is not his story. <br/><br/>Yes, it is not historically accurate, but if Churchill did confront the situations and people he confronted in this film, he probably would have acted exactly as he was portrayed here. <br/><br/>I knock off one star for not at least TRYING to explain to the audience WHY - with Hitler obviously not trustworthy - members of Parliament would not realize the choice was between slavery and war. The answer is that WWI cost Britain a generation of young men. Literally every British young man who went to war either died or was maimed. And in the end the entire conflict seemed like it had been for nothing. And so many of the British - and more of the Americans - did not want to go through this a second time with the exact same country, not realizing until it was almost too late that the Kaiser was no Hitler."

It drips with history.<br/><br/>The underground railway scene in which Churchill decides to fight on is totally fictitious. It is very unlikely that Churchill ever rode the London 'tube' in his life.<br/><br/>He was born into the aristocracy: his grandfather was the Duke of Marlborough. These people do not listen to people who travel on the tube! They are servants at best and cannon fodder at worst. The notion of people on the tube and Churchill quoting 'Horatio on the Bridge' at each other is laughable.<br/><br/>I am left wondering why the film's producers would go to great lengths to show historical accuracy for most of the film and then let it down with complete rubbish at the end.<br/><br/>This inevitably raises the question 'if this scene is fictitious, what else is?'"
"claudio_carvalho","8","35","61","1 February 2018"," Fantastic Performance
","It is impressive how The World War II can still produce great films after almost eighty year. ""Darkest Hour"" is an example, showing the biography of Winston Churchill in 1940 when Hitler was invading and dominating the Western Europe. But the film works mainly because of the fantastic performance of Gary Oldman. It is amazing how this actor incorporates the image we have of the great British leader in archival footages. Gary Oldman really deserves the Oscar! Kristin Scott Thomas is also impressive in the role of Churchill's beloved wife Clemmie. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Destino de uma Nação"" (""The Fate of a Nation"")"
"theta30","4","15","23","8 March 2018"," darkest hour
","Am I the only one not impressed by Gary Oldman's performance? Half the time I did not understand what he says as he mumbles or whispers. And I understand the other actors, so it is not a sounding issue. The portrayal of Churchill is as feeble and old, which I don't think he was since it takes strength to carry on what he did. The make up is almost as thick as Bram Stoker's Dracula.
We know Churchill was spiritual and cantankerous, but during the entire movie I only hear one or two real spiritual sayings. 
A more authentic, lively and better performance is given by Brian Cox in the movie ""Churchill"".<br/><br/>Other aspects: cinematography is quite good ( due also to the hefty budget).
Music is also top notch. An emotional crescendo is built up by the director up to the final, strings attached, and I recognize I was carried out by it myself.
A common gimmick nowadays is to introduce the perspective of a ""common people"", in this case, the typist girl. Another is (due to political correctness)
to introduce a non-white person, so a black man has the longest frame time in the underground scene.
Some scenes are weird( eg the prime minister searching for a reference from Cicero-and we never find out what the quotation was; He sends a telegram to an officer in Calais,but the officer stares at German airplanes, we don't know his reaction)"
"bell-jam","3","15","23","15 January 2018"," Poorly executed
","The history of Churchill at the onset of WWII does not need amateur like melodrama and exccessive artistic licence to become a deep and gripping story on the screen. 
Gary Oldman's attempt while noble fell short of a potrayal true to the mark. Again this may have beed due to script and direction more than personnal talent. However, there were a few hints of what he is capable of. It seemed that the director would be better suited to overseeing romance and old time feel good stories converted to the big screen."

"derbocholter","6","20","33","28 February 2018"," The Underground scene ruined the movie!
","Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill does a fine job, there is no doubt about it. The plot itself is okay, but lacks a clear climax, which is not altogether negative because this lack of a real climax lends itself well to the partial realism of the movie. The movie also does a fine job of showing the importance of Churchill's attitude when it comes to Hitler: No surrender, and you can't reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth. If Churchill had continued the disastrous appeasement policy the world would probably look very different today. <br/><br/>But the scene that ruined the movie for me is the Underground scene. First off, any viewer can guess that this scene never happened whereas all the other scenes that are fictitious at least seem plausible and possible. But the Underground scene is just too much. I imagine the English people to have been very divided at the time about the question whether it made sense to negotiate with Hitler or not. But the director here is adamant about showing us that the English people as a whole were unified in their will to fight fascism. He represents a cross section of the English people, with minorities represented as well, and all of them show support for Churchill's resolve. This scene, to me at least, is pure populism. I belive that Churchill made the right call and that it doesn't matter whether the English people were behind him or not, because history showed that he was right. There's no need for additional pathos here and there is also no need to make the audience believe that politicians are in touch with the common people or take the people's view into account. <br/><br/>If the director had decided to drop this scene I probably wold have rated the movie 8 out of 10."
"trpnallday","1","80","158","28 December 2017"," Utterly pointless
","This movie provides no information about Winston Churchill that isn't already in the high school curriculum and it provides no new insight into the man given what the public generally knows about him.<br/><br/>The film suggests a lot of topics, but doesn't seem to take a stance on any of them. It doesn't even give a comprehensive account of either Winston Churchill or what England was like during World War 2. Rather, the film focuses on Churchill sitting in a few meetings and then giving a couple of speeches over the course of about a month leading up to England's official entry into the second world war. This is a terribly boring subject and I can't picture ANYONE having wanted to see a LONG, LONG, LONG movie about this very insignificant part of history.<br/><br/>Worse yet is that the movie had so very, many moments of promise, but failed to make good on any of them. For example, Churchill's wife said something which suggested that the rest of the family hated Winston because he had sacrificed his family for his career. The movie could have explored this and other issues that he had with his family, but it doesn't. Why bring it up at all if the matter will never be mentioned again? The movie sets up the comparison between Churchill, Hitler, and Trump, but never discusses the matter. Churchill's massive political and military failures were hinted at, but never discussed. Possibly even more irritating is the fact that the film never mentions how Churchill rose to power on a single-minded policy of military action despite the public and the British Government knowing of his MASSIVE bungling of several military campaigns in the past.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie fails to mention various critical and/or interesting things about Winston Churchill such as how he had a strange and extremely deep connection with a Mr. Lindemann whose counsel he sought daily and whose words he heeded without question. The movie also portrays Churchill as a man of the people when, in fact, he hated nearly everyone and especially the common people and non-Caucasians. He was a massive bigot whose bigotry and blind faith in his friend's advice led to the death of tens of millions of British subjects and yet none of it is mentioned in a biopic about him!<br/><br/>Lastly, the film doesn't even bother to explain the few things that it does bring up. For example, it is never explained why the two main parties in Parliament chose him. It is not explained why the plot to remove him never happens. It is not explained why the king suddenly changes from actively despising and distrusting Churchill to blindly supporting him. It is not explained why Parliament is bored by Churchill's first speech but goes frat party crazy throwing paper everywhere and shouting approval after Churchill's second speech despite it being almost the same as his first speech!"
"kaaber-2","3","15","24","26 March 2018"," Darkest Hour - not a bright film
","The film gets a lot of things right. It is peppered with authentic Churchill quotes, and if they didn't shoot some of the scenes in the actual War Rooms in Westminster, they had built a pretty convincing set. But, sadly, as a drama the film reminded me of Peter Richardson's old comedy, ""The Strike"" (1988) in which the 1984 miners' strike was ludicrously distorted in elaborate attempts to turn a political crisis into a touching sob story (of the kind in which the actors sob far more than the audience), complete with historically unwarranted motorcycle chases, courtroom drama, ""Daddy, look, I can walk again!"" and whatnot. However, ""The Strike"" was an intentional parody on a melodrama, ""Darkest Hour"" is altogether unintentional. 
The film is not at all concerned with showing the real Churchill; it has pulled out all the stops to move us rather than enlighten us, and, as a consequence, we have Churchill, initially (and briefly) presented as an old, cranky and alcoholised curmudgeon, turn into a charming old Scrooge-after-his-conversion who blubbers out Macauley verse on the tube to a girl aged seven (this film's version of Tiny Tim, I suppose) and he is amply rewarded even by his opponents in Parliament with something resembling a ticker-tape parade at the end of the film. Extra drama is supplied by the lousiest secretary in the world (who should have been sacked three minutes into the film) with snippets of ""my-brother-died-in-Calais"", her bolstering a disheartened Prime Minister and prompting him in his speeches by mouthing his next line from the gallery. This secretary also corrects Churchill when he gets the V-sign wrong because the silly man is too removed from the real world to know that with the palm facing inward, it means ""up yours"". The film studiously forgets that Churchill was an expert historian.
I suspect the people behind the film wished to present Clem Churchill as the strong and independent woman she was, but instead ""Darkest Hour"" includes a most unfortunate scene which reduces her to an idiot housewife grumbling about household accounts while Europe is being run over by Hitler, thus forcing her husband to reassure her that he has always loved her - which apparently makes everything right again, although the household finances are still a shambles and Europe is still falling under the Third Reich at 200 mph. To me, that scene makes Clem look like a sentimental cow of small intellect.
In short, I was disappointed."

","This is an attempt to look at Winston Churchill in the same way that a few back movie makers looked at Lincoln. The problem is that Lincoln was well written and Darkest Hour is a script nightmare. Lincoln looked at one aspect of his presidency and we were shown the trials and tribulations of working towards that one goal. Darkest Hour has a script that is all over the place. It would have worked better had it focused on one aspect of Churchill, but it doesn't. <br/><br/>We see him become Prime Minister, but nothing is really given credence on why he was so targeted by politic rivals or why the King was so hesitant to trust him. If you are going to mention those aspects, it would help to identify and explain them in more detail.<br/><br/>While the advertisement shows a lot about Dunkirk - Dunkirk is just a blurb in the film. I was looking for more information about Dunkirk, but it is just one of many background items that are superficial to this script.<br/><br/>45 minutes into the film I looked at my watch and was shocked that it was only 45 minutes since it had felt like it was two hours into the film.

","In Darkest Hour, Gary Oldman shines as Winston Churchill. But history takes a hit.
Darkest Hour, like many historical films, invents some of its story - but in this case, it's a problem
That Underground scene, as it turns out, is both heartwarming and totally fabricated. Watching it, it's hard not to feel your heart swell with courage. Yes! We must stand against the fascists, and it's the ordinary people who must hold their leaders accountable. There's no more 2017-appropriate inspirational theme than that.
And yet that encounter on the carriage never happened. Does that mean Darkest Hour is spreading misinformation? Not exactly. Churchill did go on to stand his ground, and we know how that decision played out. That the Underground scene (and some others like it, which historians will surely spot) was imagined in order to make the story work on screen doesn't change what happened in history.
But it still made me feel a little queasy. Throughout the film, Churchill and a few others struggle with whether it's okay to fudge the truth in order to bolster
Churchill might have become a man we remember a little differently. If you look past his witticisms and the war effort, you're left with a man with deeply troubling views-who might not be the hero we imagine.
That's the same question Their Finest approaches - and both films ultimately skirt the issue. But Darkest Hour goes one step further and embraces what it explores, becoming a movie that fiddles with the truth."

Gary Oldman is no Robert Hardy, even with maximum prosthetics. The film shows Churchill travelling on the underground and speaking to the people but this has not been documented in the history books and as it was only one stop to Westminster the scene was farcical in the length of time it took and how many people he managed to speak to in that time.

They have made Churchill look like an indecisive wimp and had him speaking in a manner that is not found in any historical footage of the great man. He came across as a repulsive bully who only stopped drinking when he went to sleep. Although he did self medicate his manic depression with alcohol he certainly did not drink to the level portrayed in this piece of trash. The inaccuracies of his efforts and of the times are far too numerous to list, I stopped counting after about the first ten minutes. The movie itself was disjointed, poorly made and reflected a lack of effort on the part of both the production team and the actors. How cheap did they want to make this movie, toy boats in a tub with a back drop of the white cliffs of dover, totally ridiculous. The scene of him on the underground station and on the train were beyond belief, neither he or the general population ever behaved like that, it may be movie material but it is definitely not historically accurate.<br/><br/>All the people involved in this movie would have needed to do was watch any of three movies, Churchill, Their Finest or Dunkirk; to have gained a much better grasp of the times, the people and indeed of Churchill himself and those close to him. If anyone involved in this movie had watched these other movies than made this tragic excuse for a film, than, I think they best find a new profession.<br/><br/>I really regret paying the price of admission for this and it certainly shows how little an oscar nomination is worth , if this pre school effort has received seven nominations.

Nevertheless, the realisator shows Churchill as a hero and there are no moments in the movie where the REAL Churchill is shown to the public. I am talking about Churchill as a villain. Indeed, Churchill was not that much against the Nazis' dictator, they even had the same ideas about people with mental illinesses, homosexuals and racism. As a matter of fact, Churchill was a white supremacist and racist. My point of view is that I find it disappointing to show all the good qualities and some superficial negative aspects of him. People need to know that he was not as good as they thought.. But it is still a really good movie with good main actors, good sets with a lots of details.

Next we have Chamberlain at dinner with party friends saying he'll resign, everyone suggests Halifax, he declines ??? Reality - Chamberlain asked Churchill if he saw any reason why a Lord could not lead the house of commons, Churchill silently kept staring out the window, his time had come. He was a great inspirational leader, but Brookes his CIGS ( head of General staff ) was a real hero just reigning in Churchill's wild ideas. Churchill was responsible for the Gallipoli landings in WW1, the fiasco of Norway in WW2, and the soft underbelly which became the tough old gut - Italy. He was a great man as leader at that time, but we all have flaws.

","2017 saw cinema give us the complete Dunkirk experience: first with Christopher Nolan's ground-level, soldiers-eye view of one of the main turning points of World War II, and later with this, Joe Wright's Darkest Hour, told from the point-of-view of the stuffy politicians back at home shouting at each other in dark rooms. While over 300,000 brave men waited for evacuation as the German army closed in around them, Winston Churchill had just been sworn in as prime minister and was left with the unenvious task of dealing with Adolf Hitler, a man Churchill's predecessor Neville Chamberlain had been hoping to strike a peace deal with. As history tells it, Churchill knew the futility of trying to reason with a murderous tyrant and that the only outcome was war, but he had to rally his cabinet and deal with the Dunkirk situation at the same time.<br/><br/>Simply put, Darkest Hour is pure Oscar-bait. Ignoring the question of why yet another biopic of one of Britain's most iconic historic figures is needed in a year that had already seen the Brian Cox-starring Churchill, this is another shameless entry into the ongoing series of middlebrow British period dramas which also include fellow awards-favourites The Queen and The King's Speech. Sparing us the full biopic treatment, Darkest Hour starts in 1940 just as Churchill is chosen to lead the country in the wake of Chamberlain's ousting. Played by Gary Oldman in heavy prosthetics, the man who enjoys champagne with his breakfast and dictates his letters still dressed in his pyjamas charges into the situation like a bull in a china shop, out-shouting those who attempt to fast-track peace talks or undermine him. It's a good performance, and one that will almost definitely win Oldman an overdue Best Actor award. But it still feels like an impression, and despite some attempts to humanise the man with moments of self-doubt, we never break the tough, saggy surface.<br/><br/>Joe Wright has touched on the events of Dunkirk before with 2007's Atonement, a surprisingly moving and powerful love story that featured an impressive tracking shot along the battered beach. Atonement felt like it was created by a film-maker, while Darkest Hour feels like it was sculpted by a committee hoping to overcrowd their posters with lists of their awards nominations. It feels artificial to the point of patronising, with long shots of the smiling working class going about their business as Churchill cruises by trying to get a feel of the public's mood. This is later taken even further he ventures into the London underground on his own to chat with the common folk in a scene that is so out of place it feels like nails down a blackboard. Even worse are the brief moments of battle. CGI bombs are dropped and followed by the camera in a scene that harks back to Pearl Harbor. Impressive supporting turns by Ben Mendelsohn as King George IV and Ronald Pickip as a sympathetic, terminally-ill Chamberlain lighten the mood, while Kristen Scott Thomas, Lily James and Stephen Dillane do the most with what they are given as supportive wife, framing device and sneering villain, respectively. In these times of political uncertainty, Darkest Hour should have had me waving my fist with patriotic pride, but I could barely muster a twitch of the eyebrow."

The movie portrays the struggle of Churchill who favours going to war against Nazi-Germany and Halifax, who is favoured by the conservatives to become prime minister and wants a peace treaty with the Germans (which is in line with the politics of the now ill-favoured conservative Chamberlain). 
In the movie Churchill finally wins both the support of his own conservative party as the support in parliament to go to war. This only after Churchill, on his way to address parliament, (a) loses all doubts he has as the common people on his spontaneous subway trip to parliament make clear that they expect England to fight Nazi-Germany and (b) after a subsequent pre-assembly with some MPs wins them over to favour the go-to-war option.
Out of the blue, after Churchill's speech, also most of the Conservatives have become pro-Churchill/pro-War.
Churchill is portrait as a eccentric, feeble person without much self confidence. For those who read some of biographic works on Churchill, or who can imagine what it may take to win and hold leadership in the political arena, Churchill is portrayed as a caricature more than a person. A shame as Oldman is a fine actor who deserved a better script.
A better script might also have lead to a more intriguing and exiting insight into political gameplay. Especially in the case of British politics between september 1939 and may 1940. Instead of attending the Oscar ceremony it might be a good idea for the script writers to go and watch movies like The Ides of March or series like House of Cards (English or US version)."
"maximusj-12538","2","11","18","8 March 2018"," Never Knew Churchill was a Borderline Dimwit
","You need only watch 30 minutes of this movie before you can be assured Churchill was incompetent in all things prior to his WWII role as PM, and then only bright enough to barely get by. He struggles to put together complete sentences at times and has the respect of very few. It takes his wife to rally him out of bed and tell him how to act to his transition to PM. Wow, what a terrible portrayal. Yes, he had his flaws but exhibited a greater strength of purpose and character in real life. In trying to humanize him this movie has downplayed his enormous contribution and his example of what it really takes to stand up to tyranny. Of course the weight of historical evidence forces the director to eventually portray him in a more favorable light. This movie lacked anything compelling and was the equivalence of an average to mediocre History Channel presentation."
"anthonymcdonald150","4","26","50","12 January 2018"," Awful tripe
","I knew from the moment the forming of the British Govt. was being called New Administration we where in trouble here. Old man has a really hard act to follow but he can't even get Churchill's voice right. I found myself drifting back to the glorious Albert Finney, Vanessa Redgrave and the peerless Ronnie Barker. What a version of a slightly later story that is. Here the King was even badly played, didn't Joe Wright have a quick look back a ""His Speech"". The history is dodgy throughout. I know WWII movies are Oscar folder and actor's line up to be in them but has English film making got only 2 topics this and cockney wide boys. Where are the young film makers that will tackle modern subjects, Britain's relationship with Europe is this century for one might be a start."

","Winston Churchill was a total hawk and not a hero as many people believe. Most of the things he did killed innocent soldiers with ill-advised war strategies. He was also a pompous git. He never asked ordinary people what they thought on the 'tube' during the war, he was an elitist buffoon. He simply got lucky and was by chance the right man at the time during the early 1940's.<br/><br/>Also Gary Oldman is not a genius actor, Churchill is about the easiest person to play in the world, be grumpy, grunt and smoke cigars, almost anyone could have done it. The makeup was competent but nothing special.<br/><br/>All in all this wasn't even a patch on the also massively overrated Dunkirk. Darkest Hour was boring, nationalistic history rewrite of history. If you have any dignity avoid at all costs. If you are some Brexit loving gibbon this film might appeal to your jingoistic stupidity."
"mike3386","6","28","55","7 January 2018"," Churchill, Mumbling Savior of World Order
","Oscar season brings out the good stuff, but this 2+ hour soliloquy, by arguably one of the most momentous figures in the 20th Century, will leave even ardent history buffs gasping for one action scene, one cutaway from makeup, cigars, and prosthetics, no matter how effectively applied. This movie will serve a niche audience, a very special type of moviegoer who already knows and loves Winston Churchill; in fact, those relatively new to Churchill might come away thinking him a mumbling drinker, a joke cracking W.C. Fields, unsure of his place in the English government and timid regarding his approaching role in world history. <br/><br/>It would be an understatement to say this movie starts slowly, and at its best falls way short of anything remotely riveting. Combining the best of this plodding, myopic movie with the superficial ""Dunkirk"" (2017) might produce one watchable - and slightly believable - look back at World War II. Political junkies will take solace in the endless backroom machinations of Parliament, leaving the rest of us to enjoy the handkerchief waving chamber room antics. For the more discerning movie fan, it will be a leap of faith to imagine Churchill phoning Roosevelt for armaments while in the restroom, or conducting war strategy from a basement not wholly unlike ""Wayne's World"". <br/><br/>Oldman's Churchill looks like Churchill, even walks like Churchill, but perish the thought, he did not sound like Churchill. Most noticeable was the missing cadence of those wonderful words of Churchill, delivered in a now-slow, hesitating, even plodding at times, pace. While the oration style clung unerringly to the ""Darkest Hour"" title, just once I wanted to hear Oldman break into that famous full-throated drumbeat pace of, ""Let us therefore brace ourselves for our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.' ""<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD . . . or just watch clips at this year's Academy Awards Ceremony, where Oldman's Churchill will be on parade."

","This was Gary Oldman'e finest hour. To play Winston Churchill was probably the most difficult role any actor had to endure. Since the early years of war films there were hardly any references as to who Churchill really was. Most times it was by way of radio broadcasts that the people heard him speak against Hitler and his regime from trying to conquer Britian during WWII. How sad it was that the war commission wanted to negotiate peace rather than to fight against tyranny.<br/><br/>This was why Churchill was so loved by the people because he was as real as they were. With problems or obstacles barring freedom or discontent from rising opposition within the war department. It was wonderful to see Gray Oldman release emotions on screen so that the viewer could feel what Churchill felt. Stuck between a rock, and a hard place with no exit in sight. Yet as with all seasoned men who has seen war themselves know clearly well that surrender is never an option.<br/><br/>With the Axis agreement both Japan, and Italy blindly signed the pact so that Hitler could rise to the top as the most supreme chancellor but on the sidelines stood Churchill. Watching unsuspecting nations become puppets to a madman. Gary pulled it off brilliantly as the most outspoken political leader in history, which is probably why he was ousted out of office for his efforts. How cruel that his own people stepped on his neck just out of spite. Britains leaders didn't want to win the war... they wanted the perks that accompany power to drive their fellow man into the ground while the rich looked down smiling greedily.<br/><br/>It was a great story showing us a historical view of why Winston dared not surrender to the enemy, and rightly so because as soon as the rescue operation Dynamo succeeded, the US and their allies helped stop Hitler in his tracks winning the war. However sweet victory was why Winston Churchill would never see it first hand because of the extreme betrayal of his own government provided. I think this is a wonderful movie for its bleak with gritty undertone scenes of dark forces lurking in shadows such as the war department as well as sudden appearances who helped brighten Churchill's day with a friendly face such as his wife Clementine Churchill (Kristin Scott Thomas) to Elizabeth Layton his personal secretary, (Lily James) who helped him keep his sanity among the vultures intact.<br/><br/>There were many different forks to take in the road, but when Churchill decided that the people should fight against incredible odds... it was no wonder that Britain remains as one of the most enduring countries through such suffering, and turmoil. Director Joe Wright did a fantastic job displaying each character with various emotional degrees. Or how he made Churchill look like the odd man out or just someone indelibly crazy for standing up against a powerful foe like Hitler. Whatever the case was that the British government wanted peace for it was certainly not enough for Winston, and his people.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for all audiences alike for its strong viewpoints on a needless war as well as demonstrating fine directing of cast, crew, and extras. The music fit the era, as did the radio broadcasts with its scratchy sounding noise that all war survivors have come to know, and dread. As I mentioned before above I really hope that Gary Oldman receives an award for his timeless portrayal of the most hip man of his time... Winston Churchill."

","THE DARKEST HOUR: France has fallen, the Nazi invasion of Britain is eminent, the bulk of the British forces is stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk with no way out, current PM, Chamberlain, is considered too weak to lead and rather than entering a war members of Parliament feel they cannot win, they vote to negotiate a peace settlement with Germany, with Italy acting as a mediator. After Chamberlain's ouster, Winston Churchill is appointed the new PM, and backed by the voice of the people, vows to never surrender. He firmly believes negotiation equals capitulation. I don't know how historically accurate the rest of the movie is (except for some of his speeches, I imagine), or if some of the conversations depicted ever took place, but they reveal a stunning picture of the temperament, power, character, oratory skill and will of Churchill to never accept defeat. Gary Oldman, as Churchill, brings all of that and more to his riveting portrayal - the voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the tilt of his head. His months of research and preparation have paid off. Oldman just may be the greatest, and most under appreciated actor of his generation. (The male equivalent of Streep, to my mind.) This is his movie and any superlative you can think of applies to his performance. There is no question as to his Oscar nomination for best actor, just as there is no question of Joe Wright's nom for direction. Wright has chosen some unusual, innovative and interesting camera placements - in particular, the shot of James as she types, taken from underneath the typewriter shooting through the keyboard up to her face. I mean how creative is that? Wright maintains the tension and immediacy of the situation, yet manages to throw in some moments of tenderness and humor - a really masterful job. Also no question as to the noms for best picture, the brilliant screenplay, cinematography, costume and makeup design. I would pay to see the process of transforming Oldman into Churchill. Kristin Scott Thomas has been getting the accolades for her performance as Churchill's wife, Clementine, but the real supporting nom should go to Lily James' beautifully sublime performance, as Winston's secretary. Score: 9.5. GO!"
"hond-92064","4","13","23","13 January 2018"," A wasted opportunity
","Just about everything is wrong with this effort which in the end retains one's attention mainly because one has seen Christopher Nolan's excellent Dunkirk. 
This is supposed to be the political story behind Dunkirk. Winston Churchill was prime minister barely a month before Dunkirk happened. 
And there probably still is a great story to tell there because Darkest Hour merely throws up what is well known in an almost comic book fashion. (For a far deeper look at it - and told by people who was in the British parliament then - see the appropriate episode of the documentary World At War.) 
This movie starts out as a political biopic but halfway through loses focus and seems to become a C grade art movie with the Churchill character nervously ""losing it"" in the toilet and such other silly scenes. 
Then the fibbing also starts. It has the main character doing ""symbolic"" deeds rooted in the artistic pretensions of the movie - unfortunately things that never actually happened (the train).
Joe Wright here had one of the most dramatic set of happenings in British history for probably a century or more.... why not stick to it? 
Another matter that bothered one were the special effects like when the air journey to France was undertaken. Are the shots from the plane artistic shots that flopped or was is merely very badly made miniature props? It is unclear.
Gary Oldman plays Churchill and he makes a bit of a mess of it. Unfortunately for him one can go to YouTube and listen to Churchill's actual speeches. Oldman does not nearly get it right. Where the real Churchill sounds confident and calm Oldman's Churchill sounds scared and hysterical. 
A movie that failed because the script was second grade and it started with history and then frantically seemed to want to become an art movie of sorts."

","I tried, I really did. In the end (not of the movie), I just couldn't go on watching the bloated, besotted stumblebum that was ""Churchill"". Almost as bad as Lithgow's portrayal in ""The Crown"" of Churchill as some sort of second rate Marvel Universe creature. If this was England's leadership in WW2, they should surely have been vanquished.
This miserable film is fraught with error (as well documented by other reviewers here) and brutally monotonous: here's a closeup of Winston's ugly mug, then cut to closeup of his beautiful young assistant, who by contrast appears downright otherworldly, again and again and again. The film is also 100% Godless: apparently, England's leadership during their ""darkest hour"" never once thought of turning to God, and Churchill must have been as much an atheist as Hitler and Mussolini.
I'm thankful Joe Wright was arrogant enough to brag right off that this piffle is ""A Joe Wright Film"". I am forever forewarned."

"rraiah","5","8","13","14 March 2018"," A ""flat"" movie
","Hello everyone , I went to see this movie 2 weeks ago with my schools and I found it very average! It was desperately lacking in action. For me, it was pretty flat and boring.
In my opinion, the only key point of this film was the game of the characters. Especially Gary Oldman who very well made his job!
This film takes place in May 1940, when Churchill is named prime minister (of England) and when the English troops are stuck at Dunkirk. He then has to find a solution to free them.
First of all, at the beginning of the movie I do not hide you that I was very interested but it became more and more boring! I would have preferred to see a talking film of the living conditions during the Blitz which would have been much more interesting.
Secondly, I also found it a bit repetitive. It was always Churchill and this famous question:to capitulate or to fight? And, I think we were all sure, even if we are not all history teachers, that Churchill would choose the second option.
In short, for me it was a huge disappointment"
"VikiLauda","5","6","9","3 March 2019"," Darkest Hour.
","I must start by saying I am absolutely love Gary Oldman, & have seen all his films at some point, & I do really like his effort here, however, there is one problem....<br/><br/>Mr Oldman's lovely Tenor voice, is several pitches too high for Churchill. (GO is actually a very good singer!) Even my mother who was a child during WW2 commented on his voice, saying ""Churchill had a deep raspy low voice"" But I must say this is the only thing wrong with Oldman's performance, because he is an awesomely skilled, classically trained character actor & does give a solid performance.<br/><br/>Now onto the movie it's self. Well to put it bluntly, British History should NEVER be messed with for Hollywood liberal agenda! The screenplay here makes Churchill look weak & bumbling, & while some see Churchill as a war time hero, others maybe not, he was certainly NOT a bumbling drunken idiot. Churchill was an ""Elite"" he was born in Blenheim Palace, & like most of the ""Elite"" he did truly believe he was ""born to rule the little man"". He never used public transport, so I am really not sure what the bit on the tube was about? The tube scene is not correct as Churchill never rode the tube or buses. This scene was inserted into the movie for a feel good, unicorns & rainbows, cinematic safe space! Also Churchill was fiercely against the marriage of Edward & Wallis. This movie would have been beautiful if someone on the writing team had actually read a history book & stood by on historical facts. This could have been a masterpiece! I almost feel like Oldman's wonderful, unique talent was somewhat wasted.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am just so glad Mr Oldman finally received an Oscar for this, because he certainly deserved it!

"david-meldrum","6","2","2","4 May 2020"," Some Good Aspects Do Not Make Up For A Collection Of Lies And Half-Truths
","Myths don't have to be factually truthful; that's the whole point. At their best, myths take us to truths that are deeper than mere facts. At their worst, they sell us lies about ourselves; and lies are shifting sands to build a foundation on. In defence of myths, people will do the outrageous and the marvellous; and those who question myths often find themselves shouted down or, at the worst, dead.<br/><br/>So to The Darkest Hour, Joe Wright's account of the short period of Churchill's premiership at the outset, through to Dunkirk (when, not coincidentally, the Brexit referendum was reaching fever pitch). Made around the same time as Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, it's a very different film. Largely conventional, not without merit, but in many senses lazy and deceptive.<br/><br/>Let's be clear. Gary Oldman is remarkable in the lead role; worthily recognised in awards, as with the remarkable prosthetic and make-up work that enabled him to be physically transformed. Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife is criminally underused, but still turns in a lovely performance, as she so often does. It's also moves along at a brisk and engaging pace, and is never dull despite the well-won paths of this slice of history.<br/><br/>But it stops there. The film buys in to the Churchillian myth from the beginning - the divinely appointed (no, I'm not exaggerating; I've heard that said many a time) strong leader who led Britian, standing alone, to heroic victory. Churchill is often bathed in almost god-like light, especially when speaking in Parliament; his alcoholic drinking habits are largely passed off as eccentric indulgences; his near-bullying treatment of his secretary is mostly played for gentle laughs (especially empahsised by the none-too-subtle score). This is a Churchill who mostly brooks no dissenting voices despite appointing opposition politicians to his War Cabinet; who mocks the King behind his back (with whom he becomes friends at the convenient moment). Many shots are framed and lit as if they were historical portraits. It's all about the myth.<br/><br/>The myth of British exceptionalism, which will like Churchill himself, remain unchallenged. There is no hint of irony when Churchill says that countries that fight on, rise strong; Britain spiralled in to decline for decades after the 2nd World War. At one point, a telegram sent by Churchill to an officer in the field is portrayed as worryingly close to the voice of God; and we all know you can't talk back to God (spoiler: you can, actually; but I hope I've read too much into that scene).<br/><br/>As decision time to surrender or fight on approaches, Churchill takes a ride on the London Underground to gauge the will of the people. This never happened; but that's not necessarily a problem. Shakespeare makes it work, after all. But not here; it becomes an absurd process of Churchill asking blindingly obvious leading questions to a convenient cross-section of British society (in the space of one train stop), and everyone looks very happy and confident. Churchill then stretches the truth of that encounter to breaking point both with his own Cabinet and the House of Commons, in a moment of falsehood that would be enough for a vote of no confidence if any of it actually happened.<br/><br/>And thus the Churchillian myth, embraced by Johnson and Trump alike, is bolstered one again; his racism not mentioned, his choices and character uncritiqued. Not to deny his great wartime achievement, of course; but this story needs better. For from this myth of Churchill summoning innate British independence and strength comes nationalistic isolationism, airbrushing of prejudice, and the excusing of anything as long as the ends serve the greater good (read: support the myth).<br/><br/>It's not a bad film; it's decently entertaining and passed an afternoon in Covid Lockdown. It is, however, a film in service of a grandiose lie. And over-praised in service of lies can dangerous in times of crisis."

There are undeniable moments of cinematic power, but I'm sure it over simplifies things. Much has been made of the train scene for one and yes it's a bit sappy, needless and completely out of step with the rest of the film. There's a great deal of humour and even whimsy, a story of the stuffiness of politics and the strategy of, rather than the war itself and overall it's style is it's own undoing. Although Oldman predictably is the centrepiece, it's Kristen Scott Thomas that excels for me, she's fantastic and even Stephen Dillane as the villain of the piece Halifax is exceptional (he's great in The Tunnel TV series too), but it does all feel like a 90 plus minute build up to that speech and although it is rousing when it arrives, it's too little too late... for the film, thankfully not for actual events."

","In May of 1940, the Wehrmacht continues to encroach across Western Europe causing the British Parliament to lose faith in the leadership of Neville Chamberlain. The search for a successor begins, but the only candidate that opposing parties will accept is the cantankerous, hard-drinking, cigar smoking Winston Churchill-a polarizing figure who is without principle and insufferable to some (including his wife Clemmie), and a tough, uncompromising leader to others. Tension becomes especially high amongst government officials as they try to resolve the conflict at Dunkirk. Director Wright plunges viewers right into the heart of old English politics with crucial decision-making, volatile character interactions, and an imminent threat of annihilation, but without a doubt the real highlight is an electrifying Oldman who embodies the many shades of Churchill, from surly and stubborn, to doubtful and ultimately good-hearted. The anticlimactic finale is a bit of a letdown, but the acting alone makes it worth the viewing experience. ***"

","Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"" poses a problem for me. The subject is interesting and important, but the film, following Winston Churchill's early days as Prime Minister of Britain during World War II, never rises above the average. Worse: one could also say that -- in the fictitious sequence, about 2/3rds of the way through, when Churchill rides the tube to talk person-to-person with average British citizens riding the train -- it comes to life precisely at the same moment it sinks into clichÃ©, and credulity is strained past the breaking point. Ultimately, Oldman playing Churchill is the only thing that makes this movie experience worthwhile. (But Joe Wright has seen better days -- especially in his 2007 masterpiece, ""Atonement"", the extraordinary film that incidentally introduced 12-year-old Saoirse Ronan to the world.) Not much better than a BBC-TV movie of the week."

Why let truth get in the way when you have a product (film) to sell?<br/><br/>Having watched Darkest Hour, I'm none the wiser (my history is poor). As is often the case with these sorts of biopic films, I found myself wanting to watch a documentary.<br/><br/>The main body of the film was okay. But I found it annoying - why did Churchill have to make the privy joke, for example.... ""I can only take one s**t at a time."" This was one of quite a few examples which I felt was overly contrived, perhaps to make the film more accessible. I could accept that if it was a totally fictional story, but it wasn't..<br/><br/>But worse - a LOT worse was to come. Why did Churchill get the tube? I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure that didn't happen. Regardless, he says when on the train ""have you never seen a prime minister on the underground before""? He then suddenly becomes humble and a 'man of the people' - so out of context and character to what the man was all about. Why? He then asks his adoring fellow travellers about the prospective peace deal with Hitler..... They reply ""Never! Never!"" Not a single descenter (no pacifists allowed on the train clearly). So he takes zero notice of his advisers, and 100% notice of the people on the train who apparently support his view - including a token black man he pats on the hand (I understand he was a known racist - if so, why change history?) AND THEN HE CRIED. WTF? He gets off at Westminster (a long time for one stop) and not a single person on the train gets off at that stop. Have you ever known a packed train and no-one gets off? Social realism it is not.<br/><br/>The film brought contrivance to a whole new level. I hated it - but I can't take anything away from Gary Oldman who was brilliant throughout, hence a score of 3 rather than the minimum, which the film (if not Oldman) deserved."

","DARKEST HOUR is little more than a middling biopic of Britain's most famous historical figure, one of those films that the critics and award-givers rave about but I watch wondering what all the fuss is about. Made on exactly the same template as THE KING'S SPEECH - except nowhere near as involving - this focuses on Churchill's life at the outset of the WW2, in particular his desperate organisation of the Dunkirk landings. It's a film which makes a great deal out of very little, presenting our hero with an hour-long dilemma about whether he should seek peace with Hitler, although as the story is already well known to most viewers this doesn't really impact on the audience much. Gary Oldman won rave reviews for his turn as the big man, but for me he was simply Gary Oldman in a fat suit and not very convincing. The supporting cast are better, with Stephen Dillane and Ben Mendelsohn in particular standing out. The film has its moments, but is overlong and it does feel padded and particularly slow in the second half."

","I am somewhat confused with all this WWII heroism of late in cinema. I wrote Dunkirk down as a solid ego booster for Brits who cannot get over the fact that Britain didn't win WWII but this movie is a bit of an overkill. I do not wish to analyze what most already did in these comments, the only thing I want to add that although Gary Oldman is a great actor, his portrayal of Winston Churchill isn't convincing, certainly not to glorify him for it as most people do here. Overall, the movies comes through as a cheesy propaganda movie, the underground scene being the prelude to the climax at the end where we are pretty much informed that 'Winston' won WWII and brought 'all our boys back' from Dunkirk despite the grim 10% prediction. Never mind the French help and never mind the Allies who actually won that war. Never mind all the 'loser' states who have fallen to the Nazis, like Belgium and that ungrateful Roosevelt.

","It should embarrass the academy that films can so easily follow a formula to get one of their little statues. This is not a bad film, it is merely not that good. The character of Churchill is always going to attract a bravura performance, and like many of his predecessors... Gary Oldman is more than up to the task. This however does not make it a 10/10 film.<br/><br/>Considering that 10/10 has to represent a mark indicating that no better film has ever been made. It must be so excellent, that it towers above all other cinematic achievements other than comparable woks of genius.<br/><br/>Historically. this is about as accurate as Spartacus, or Jason and the Argonauts. As a reading of the titular character... it offers nothing new at all. In fact... it is a series of not very well constructed cliches. This doesn't mean that Gary Oldman didn't deserve his little statue, it merely means that the standard for such an award... is lower than it should be. Let's face it... W.C.Fields might have been a nominee had he been around to audition.<br/><br/>I might have managed a 6/10 but for the dreadful 'underground' scene. The 'chirpy' British, salt of the earth Londoners were a dreadful hodge-podge of extras that didn't make the final cut of Mary Poppins. Trying to make the truth fit a fiction only ever achieves irritating and patronising falsehood.

","It's the early days of WWII. The Germans are on the march and the Allies are retreating. Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) is not yet Prime Minister but is in line for the job. Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas) is his long-suffering supportive wife. Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) is his new secretary. He faces uncertainty from King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) and dying Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) while Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane ) pushes for peace negotiations.<br/><br/>This is a compelling historical character-study drama. The most intriguing aspect is that it depicts Churchill as a man slowly overwhelmed by the failing campaign and even considers a peace with Hitler. In many ways, it is a more human portrait and a much more dramatic character study. Historical accuracy is a little questionable especially the subway ride. I understand the premise but it feels manufactured. I don't know if there was ever such a note with all those regular people names and that speech to rally his supporters. If such an event happened, I would think he goes into the subway with his mind already set. He wouldn't need these regular folks to give him his direction. The climatic change in him is the meeting with the King. While I understand the idea that the normal people give him the strength to make the iconic speech, it feels fake. It's small bump in an otherwise beautiful, epic, thrilling road."

","That Gary Oldman is one the greatest living actors in the planet is a known fact to all cine-buffs around the world, but with 'Darkest Hour', Oldman has put himself in a place of the all-time heavyweights in Acting. As Winston Churchill, Oldman is a veritable delight & shows us what an actor can do when he sinks his teeth into the part. Oldman is PURE, unfiltered Acting Greatness. And Yes, the movie is good too!<br/><br/>'Darkest Hour' follows Winston Churchill (Oldman), and follows his early days as Prime Minister while Hitler closes in on Britain during World War II.<br/><br/>Writer Anthony McCarten & Director Joe Wright deliver 'Darkest Hour' with great success. While its ambitious to a fault (the film particularly lags in its initial reels), its overall a great story of a leader, who's over-the-top & risky decisions led him to create history of its own. This is a personal story about a man in great power & how his courage & at times, humor, led him to become a leader to follow. Churchill is not a perfect man, he's always in need for a drink or smoking up a cigar with less regard to polluting a room, but he's a determind man with a vision of a true Prime Minister, that knew how to deal with the forces when the world was at War. McCarten's Screenplay is engrossing & despite some flaws for its initial tepid start, make up for a well-written Screenplay. Wright's Direction is commanding & powerful. Bruno Delbonnel's Cinematography & Valerio Bonelli's Editing are fantastic. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention. Dario Marianelli's Score, also, is good.<br/><br/>But the reason to really watch 'Darkest Hour' is, of course, Gary Oldman. With his perfect body-language, to his impeccable dialogue delivery to the fierceness in his eyes, Oldman is truly remarkable. This has to be his finest performance ever after his mesmerizing turn in 'Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy'. With Golden-Globe & SAG Nominations already in, Oscar Calling is meant to happen. <br/><br/>Of the rest of the cast, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn & Lily James, are in top-form.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Darkest Hour' is a Gary Oldman showcase. And it helps that the showcase is also a pretty good period piece. Watch It."

"TheLittleSongbird","8","8","17","13 January 2018"," Far from film's darkest hour, and Oldman's finest hour
","Have a real fondness for biopics, regardless of the treatment of history and their subjects for some. Consider Winston Churchill one of the most interesting and extraordinary 20th century, and history in general, figures and Gary Oldman one of the best actors working today that in recent years deserved more roles more worthy of his talents. The rest of the cast are also talented and while Joe Wright is hit and miss for me a few of his films are good to outstanding. <br/><br/>'Darkest Hour' was to me a very good film (the best of Joe Wright's films post-'Hanna'), and there is much more to it than the ""Oscar bait"" that a lot of films and performances getting multiple award attention get untruly and unfairly dismissed and what 'Darkest Hour' is likely to be dismissed as in the future. There is also much more to it than the universally acclaimed, and more than deservedly so, lead performance. Sure, its approach to history is dodgy to say the least (true of quite a number of biopics), but as a film on its own there are a lot of great qualities.<br/><br/>By all means 'Darkest Hour' is not perfect. The effects do look fake and personally really do wish that the female roles were as strongly written as the male ones. The male characters have a lot of meat to them, while Lily James especially has a role that's underwritten and almost thankless. <br/><br/>There are a couple of instances where the narrative isn't so strong. The phone conversation with Churchill and Roosevelt does contradict and distort Roosevelt himself and the relationship between the two. More problematic was the much criticised London-tube scene, feels like it goes on forever and takes the meaning of farcical too far.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman, nearly unrecognisable, is just extraordinary as Churchill and, although he is one of the best, most underrated and most versatile actors today with many great performances under his belt, this is his finest hour, a performance not just deserving of multiple awards but it is one deserving of an award sweep if it's not too late to be considered for an Oscar nomination (if so, he's been completely robbed). He makes Churchill a compellingly real figure, one that has struggles with his fame and power and not just a powerful figure important for his decisions, and not an impersonation or caricature. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast support him beautifully, Kristin Scott Thomas is affectingly elegant and stately, and her chemistry with Oldman is suitably tender. Ben Mendelssohn and Ronald Pickup (as a more conflicted Chamberlain as usually painted) are particularly good of the male support. Despite her charm, James doesn't have enough to her role to shine properly. <br/><br/>Visually, 'Darkest Hour' looks great. The period detail is both beautiful and atmospheric, the detail gotten spot on. The photography is inventive and striking. Wright's direction is not subtle (pretty bullish actually), Wright has never been known for subtlety, but it is a confident, playful and passionate directing job, with some emphasis on seriousness but not overly-so, some of his best since 'Atonement'. The music is stirring but at other times lyrically soothing and suitably sombre on occasions.<br/><br/>Furthermore, 'Darkest Hour' is thoughtfully and confidently scripted, while there are playful elements the darker and murkier side is emphasised more. Churchill's speeches have the inspiring power that they should do and the historical events that should wrench the gut do so but in a relatively restrained way. The story is compelling, what could have been stuffy and dull is actually lively and with a dark bullish and bold approach that still takes it seriously. It is very familiar and there is not much new to what we already know, but the approach 'Darkest Hour' takes is very much different to what one expects.<br/><br/>Overall, very good film with a few drawbacks but also an extraordinary performance from Oldman. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

The rest seemed to me to be the stuff of caricature and sentimentalism, to the extent that I wondered whether or not I was watching a Spielberg movie, in moments such as the underground scene, and the one in which Churchill takes his secretary to the map room to explain the dire situation in the continent. It is entirely unjustifiable that the movie have spent so many minutes with kitsch sentimental scenes with Churchill's secretary, in the sense of their trivial purpose in the movie. The underground scene is a blow to the suspension of disbelief. It is obvious at several points that the movie wants to pay homage to our current Zeitgeist of equality.

There's very little else to keep you in your seat though, unless you happen to drift off when the picture gets its dullest. Besides the fact that it is genuinely well-made on almost all counts, it is also frightfully drab for most of its run-time and I was honestly quite bored for a large majority. The story seems slightly pointless too because, other than informing us of some homegrown heroics (which are themselves interesting and important) in history-book fashion, the talking-heads just go back-and-forth about things that even the least historically knowledgeable audience members should already know the ending to.

The dialogue is riveting as you are drawn into a very complex dance of war or peace.

It is the right mix of actor, script, director and role combining all of these factors perfectly to bring you a portrayal of a character that is insightful and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Based on a script by Anthony McCarten (THEORY OF EVERYTHING), DARKEST HOURS chronicles the events behind the scenes in England in May, 1940 - the time where Churchill was named Prime Minister and immediately had to deal with the rising Nazi threat as well as the fact that almost the entire British Army - 300,000 troops - are trapped on the coast of a place called Dunkirk.<br/><br/>This behind-the-scenes drama is the perfect kind of film for Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT, PRIDE & PREJUDICE) and he excels here.

Besides Oldman, Lilly James, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn and Stephen Dillane all give strong, refined performances understanding the tone of the film and their place in it. These are all strong supporting turns in a film with a hurricane at the center that could have easily blown these supporting players away. But it doesn't, thanks to Wright's direction of these fine supporting actors and (especially) Oldman's captivating and generous performance.<br/><br/>I was pulled into this film from the start and was never pulled out. The spaces and the silence between words and gestures were filled with raw emotion (some will think it is slow and boring, but I couldn't disagree more). In this day of quick cuts and fast, CGI-Laden special effects, it is nice to watch a slower moving (but not slow moving) drama with interesting characters unfold before you to tell a real - and necessary - story.<br/><br/>This film will garner quite a few deserved Oscar nominations this year, but there is one shoo-in. Bet the mortgage on Gary Oldman taking home the Oscar for Best Actor this February.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","I was curious about how Churchill behaved during the tough war time, and how he got things done without necessary support.<br/><br/>One observation which is useful to me. That's everyone will have fear at some moment. No matter he is a prime minister, or a king. Beyond the titles, they are ordinary human. They also need support from their loved ones, and the people surround them to conquer the fear, to gain the confidence.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing I learned from the movie is that Churchill was elected as the prime minister not because he is the perfect one, but because he is the only option for his party. All the PMs/Presidents are the results of compromise among involved stakeholders. <br/><br/>I also came to a more proper understanding about Chamberlain by this movie. In the history class, I didn't quite understand the word of ""appeasement"". Just simply thought that means Chamberlain was a traitor of his country. In this movie, I got another understanding about Chamberlain's appeasement policy. He just wanted to protect his country and people with the approach which seems making sense at that war time.<br/><br/>The words of ""you can not reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth"" seems quite obvious, but why Chamberlain's appeasement policy got supported at the beginning? I need to google it."

","Overacting.....Some roles require overly-exaggerated character acting, particularly those in comedy films. For example
Overacting may be used to portray an outlandish character, or to stress the evil characteristics of a villain. Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman was almost immediately typecast as a criminal in his film career, and the necessity to express villainous characters in an overtly physical manner led to the cultivation of his 'big' acting style, which hearkened back to his classical theatre training and would become his trademark. This encompassed ""playing everything"" via layered performances that vividly express each character's emotions and internal conflicts. Oldman has conceded that he often overacts on screen, and said: ""t's my influence on those roles that probably they feel bigger than life and a little over-the-top.

","NOTES
Welcome to the Gary Oldman show, and you Mr. Oldman, you sir, get an A. What a performance! Gary Oldman is an actor I always thoroughly enjoy watching because he completely transforms into his role. This, however, this is a step above and beyond even for him. The performances are superb, the writing is tight, and the pacing is perfect. Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" from earlier this year approaches the same event in history that ""Darkest Hour"" does, but from the perspective of the soldiers.
REVIEW
""Darkest Hour"" starts out describing the dire situation in which England has found itself in the thick of World War II. England is in need of some new leadership and is desperately close to surrendering to Hitler and the Germans. Enter Winston Churchill, the quirky man whom no one seems to like in the House of Commons, but somehow has ended up on the shortlist of those who can replace the sitting prime minister. Finally, after some deliberation, it is decided that he will be asked to be prime minister only because he is someone who both parties in parliament can tolerate. ""Darkest Hour"" only covers a few weeks in time, and the story is told appropriately like there's not much sand left in the hourglass. Churchill steps into the position of prime minister with his country losing the war, his colleagues scrutinizing his every move strategizing how quickly they can boot him out of office, and a king who is decisively less than thrilled with his appointment. Somehow he must get the edge on Hitler, convince his colleagues they made the right choice, win over the king, and the make a decision that will affect human life for the rest of history - continue to fight or surrender. No pressure! Fortunately, Churchill is a man of cunning, clever wit, and a master of words. He gets the nation on its feet, gains the approval of his colleagues, garners the support of the king, and somehow manages to get England out of the biggest pickle that perhaps has ever been recorded in the history books.
 Joe Wright as director makes some excellent decisions here; he doesn't bite off more than he could chew. Although it does seem like a biopic, it isn't, it focuses on a very specific time frame and does so with Churchill as the main focus. The film's pacing is absolute perfection - it feels like a thriller. I'm not a historian, but I'm familiar with the fact that England did not surrender, and that Hitler was eventually defeated, and despite this basic knowledge I still found the movie beautifully suspenseful in a taut, fuse-burning kind of way.
Let me comment on perhaps the single aspect that I didn't like, that some critics are going out of their way to praise - the score. At times I felt myself being taken out of the movie because the score was so overt, really obviously telling me how to feel. It wasn't constantly overbearing though, sometimes it was wonderful, but it noticeably took over center stage at times. 
Lily James as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's personal secretary is a treat. I adored her performance. She presents a young woman who is completely taken aback by the monstrosity that is Churchill, yet after time warms to him, becomes loyal to him, and appreciates his quirks. The elegant Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's patient wife had less screen time than I'd hoped, but made her scenes count, contributing to the tone, and the overall character of Churchill. Ben Mendelsohn plays King George VI with grace and draws the audience to sympathize with him as an honest man who is uncertain about where and in whom to place his faith.
Gary Oldman as Churchill might be the most convincing performance I've seen since Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in ""Lincoln"" (2012). There are many aspects to his Churchill that are downright genius. First and foremost is the makeup. Kazuhiro Tsuji has perfected his craft and his masterpiece is Oldman as Churchill. I honestly could not tell where Churchill ended and Oldman began. Not once, and I was looking. It is astounding. Beyond appearance, Oldman inhabits Churchill as a slightly edgy, maybe crude, eccentric, and very intelligent man with numerous quirks and flaws. I'm no expert on Churchill, but I've seen various portrayals and there is something in Oldman's eyes that sets his interpretation apart, that captures the wildness Churchill seemed to possess - a man on the edge of something brilliant or something disastrous, and either way wreckless to some degree. The most interesting relationship is between King George VI and Churchill. Articulate and eloquent people seem to hold a power over others, and Churchill was one of those people, so he must've been intimidating, even to a king, especially one who stammers. The tension between the two is palpable on screen and the power dynamic offsetting each other is captivating.
Churchill is written with great attention to detail and nuance. None of his famous speeches are overblown or Hollywoodized such as Bill Pullman's ""We will not go quietly into the night!"" speech from ""Independence Day"" (1996), which I love and gets me in the feels every time, but I recognize is Hollywoodized in every sense of the word (come on, aliens are taking over the world and the U.S. president is on the front lines of a last ditch effort hyping up the pilots who will most likely face certain death....can you imagine our current president doing something like that? Yeah, me neither). No, Churchill isn't one who'd confidently grab the mic, puff out his chest, and deliver. He is one who would methodically go over every word and punctuation mark, every pause and change of pitch in his voice. Oldman brings that contemplative, intellectual Churchill to the screen with crisp tenderness. We see Churchill as of course, the boisterous, sarcastic, quick-witted silver tongue he's become notoriously known for, but we also see him as a man crumbling under the weight of an impossible task, under the weight of a nation losing the largest war in the history of the world.
I walked away relieved that Churchill had done what he'd done, and that the nation of England had exhibited a fighting spirit during the most difficult time in its history, but I also walked away questioning every move he'd made much like I would after a truly inspiring lecture in a college classroom. I was informed enough to involuntarily place myself in Churchill's shoes and identify with the weight his decisions carried. Should we stand and fight or should we try to reason with the enemy and seek peace. Can you reason with a madman? Should you stand and fight a tiger? 
Also, if I were to buy this movie I would definitely purchase it along with ""Dunkirk."" The two films tell the story of the same event in history from totally different perspectives, and I think complement each other so well, it's almost as if it had been planned."

","When I was in middle school one of my favorite guilty pleasures was a film called Small Soldiers (1998). In it, the late Phil Hartman sits in his living room, enjoying his new satellite TV while watching a WWII documentary. Tanks thundering, bombs bursting, Hartman looks up from his barcalounger and makes the comment, ""You know, I think WWII was my favorite war."" For some reason while watching Darkest Hour, I thought a little about that brief cutaway in that one mediocre kids' film. It sounds silly but with that in my mind, I thought more about our constant media exposure to the subject and how even today a lot of the stories we tell (and still the majority of our war stories) are about WWII. Seems not since the second Punic Wars has there been another moment in history where people lineup slack-jawed and stargazing at big men, doing big things. Heroes, villains, world-shaking stakes and potentially world ending weaponry, these are the things we remember.<br/><br/>And arguably the biggest hero we remember of that time was Winston Churchill; the vigorous wartime British Prime Minister who, in the words of a visiting American reporter, ""was the right man in the right job at the right time."" Yet Darkest Hour has the man intermittently questioning his own resolve. Set between May 10, 1940 and June 4, 1940 the Churchill (Oldman) who stands with heavy prospects and even heavier makeup is one who just saw his worst fears become reality and is now unsure of what to do next. A great man? The film seems to be suggesting not yet.<br/><br/>Now, lest you believe this film is a war drama in the truest sense of the word, know that much of the plot hinges on Churchill's precarious political position and the machinations of his dysfunctional basement war room. Viscount Halifax (Dillane), former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Pickup), the generals and even the King (Mendelsohn) himself all seem to be pulling at different threads to see what unravels out of the pugnacious statesman. They don't know what to make of the cigar smoking, brandy swilling neophyte, which complicates an already dire situation on the European mainland.<br/><br/>Despite the makeup and prosthetics, Gary Oldman turns in a stellar performance as Churchill. While so much of the film wallows in the character's uncertainty, the flame of defiance is ever present in the veteran actor's eyes. You also have to admire the man's dedication to the role. He walks like Churchill, jokes like Churchill, chomps on cigars like Churchill and at times he mumbles incomprehensively like Churchill - which brings me to the biggest problem with Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>The film has a very inconsistent approach to history. Oldman no doubt studied the role as if it were the acting challenge of a lifetime; which is great if one were to compare footage of Oldman and Churchill reading the ""We shall fight them on the beaches"" speech side by side. But as a function of storytelling the accuracy of Churchill's speech patterns comes at the expense of communicating information. This becomes especially distracting when Oldman is throwing taunts and tirades at Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas while sounding like a broken muffler. It also doesn't help that depending on the light he either looks like a Bob from Office Space (1999) or a Muppet.<br/><br/>On the other side of things, nearly everything meant to heighten the tension (except, you know, the war) is either fictional or highly suspect. I'm not an expert historian by any means but even I know Churchill's war room couldn't have been that duplicitous and aggressively petty. Much ado is made about the new Prime Minister's defiant stance against Hitler, which I'm sure wasn't as resolute as we all think but certainly not as wishy-washy as this movie make it become. There's also a scene on the London tube that has the double problem of being historically false and incredibly trite.<br/><br/>But even if you're not a student of history and are just looking for a good yarn – even then, Darkest Hour falters. Director Joe Wright's consistent approach towards his films is one of close angular shots, studious symmetry and a flare for the frontloaded metaphor. It works in Atonement (2007) and Hanna (2011) but not here.Here it feels more like they were making a made-for-TV movie in all honesty.<br/><br/>This is a very small film; so small that it's trying to fit into the mind of a single man. Yet that single man is a towering figure in a crucial moment in history we're already incredibly familiar with. Churchill deserves a Patton (1970) not a Hyde Park on Hudson (2012); a movie that greets the greatness of the man on equal footing instead of trying to reel him in like a whale on a rusty fishing trawler. Given Gary Oldman's performance, Darkest Hour could have been something special. Instead it's just the third film released this year centered on the evacuation of Dunkirk. As far as smaller movies go, watch Their Finest (2016) instead."

","With hindsight, it was absolutely a good thing that Britain was led by the unlikely figure of Winston Churchill during World War Two. The politics around Churchill's ascension to power are very interesting, from the desperate desire of many to avoid war at all costs, to the major role of Churchill's own incompetence during the Norway campaign in the fall of Chamberlain's government. There's lots of good material for a film here, but unfortunately 'Darkest Hour' isn't that movie, preferring to exaggerate both Churchill's heroism and buffoonishness, while painting his political opponents as virtual traitors to the country. Meanwhile, the dramatization of the story reduces it to the banal narrative of a Hollywood biopic, with the premier granted an unlikely epiphany on the London Underground. Gary Oldman buries himself in the character, but it's in the service of myth more then history."

","There seem to be many divided opinions on whether Mr Churchill was good or bad, certainly his opinions on gender, race and sexuality seem to differ greatly from my own, however this film is not about that. It is a snap shot of what happened during the month of May in 1940, but I'm still not sure I necessarily agree with his actions, although I was not there at the time and didn't feel what the people were feeling. One would have thought that we have now evolved passed this mentality of war, but it has just become more technical and statistical in today's age, so a lot of it is unknown to us and especially to me as I try to avoid the news to hold my depression at bay, but perhaps if I had been on the tube and the PM had come and talked to me, I would have chanted that I would fight for my freedom on my home soil, but for me right now I just don't can't see that fighting is a solution.
In this film, I think it would have helped if there had been more of a build up of things to show the feeling of the people and the events surrounding it, maybe more shots of soldiers or the everyday man at home, but it focussed purely on the man himself.
This film and its cast may have made a great tv series if it could have been spread out to include more of his years in service and if it had been shot with a view that he wasn't perfect, but he did do bad things as well as good, I think it could have been very good in that format, similar to Wolf Hall, which helped me to understand Henry VIII a lot better.<br/><br/>As a millennial I wasn't taught a lot about Churchill at school and haven't come across him much except in Doctor Who (Matt Smith) so a more in depth look at him, rather than a look at his quirky personality, in less than two hours, would have suited me better.<br/><br/>Mentions have to go to Gary Oldman, who did perform well and I have found a new appreciation for Kristin Scott-Thomas lately, having seen her in Nowhere Boy (2009) the other day, she doesn't have a massive part in this, but it seems almost effortless.<br/><br/>Enjoyable if you know enough about what was happening back then I'm sure, but not one I'd personally hurry to watch again."

","I didn't just so I can make sure I never watch this tripe again. It's awful. It's historically inaccurate, mythological and mawkishly triumphalist. The scene with the ""little ships"" was appalling and again inaccurate. Most of the troops rescued at Dunkirk were evacuated by Royal Navy capital ships not by the ""little boats""<br/><br/>The part played by others in the national government are ignored as is the Norway Debate that caused Chamberlain to stand down.<br/><br/>This is whitewash history seen through rose coloured spectacles the way that people wish it was. The acting is mostly fine and Oldman is a good Churchill but as a film it stands with Birth of a Nation for its distortion of history."
"ethanbresnett","9","1","1","6 April 2020"," Gary Oldman at his best!
","Darkest Hour shines a light on a crucial moment in British and world history - the initial month of Churchill's term as he stand resolutely in the face of Hitler's advance while his peers wish to sue for peace.<br/><br/>The standout in this film really is Gary Oldman, who is as deserving of an Oscar for this performance as any actor ever has been. He toed the line perfectly, giving a powerful and accurate portrayal of Churchill without it every feeling like a gimmick or impression. He quite simply was Churchill. The physical transformation was a part of this, and the costume and makeup departments should be extraordinarily proud of what they achieved, but the majority of the credit goes to Oldman himself. The task at hand for was not an easy one. Churchill's speeches that he tackled perhaps go down as some of the finest in the English language, being so recognisable and quotable, and he delivered them flawlessly. Simply tremendous from Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>What I also thoroughly enjoyed about Darkest Hour was its attention to detail in bringing to life the period. The costumes, sets, score and supporting cast all blended together perfectly to recreate May 1940 so finely. With this alongside Oldman's performance you will get completely lost in this film and the era, perfectly capturing the spirit of the British people at the time. This was demonstrated particularly well during a spectacular scene on the underground, which was a real highlight for the film.<br/><br/>The camera work in Darkest Hour also stands out as we navigate the murky and claustrophobic tunnels of the Cabinet War Rooms, which adds to the sense of the British having their backs against the wall, trapped by the Germans.<br/><br/>If you love history, fine acting, and accomplished cinema, look no further than Darkest Hour."

There was not a lot of action in this movie, but more of a focus on Winston's mannerisms, humour, temper and overall demeanor. There were some very touching scenes, such as when he took a moment to be with his wife when she fretted about their finances. A big part of this movie that some people will not have known, is that in 1940, England was considering ""surrendering"" to Hitler. Could you imagine? I hope that everybody goes to see this movie.

","Someday, there might be a better movie made about Winston Churchill. But, for now, this is the finest effort to date! It is outstanding. Gary Oldman should hand's down win the Academy Award. If not for the credits, one wouldn't know Churchill was being played by Oldman, and perhaps that's the greatest indication of how well an actor is portraying a character.<br/><br/>In terms of history, this movie essentially shows the turning point of World War II in Europe. This is the moment where Great Britain, and by extension the British Empire, was alone against the Nazis and their Axis allies. The closing speech and scene of this movie is where Hitler truly lost his opportunity to turn continental Europe into a Nazi sphere of conquest.<br/><br/>The senior level conflict between Lord Halifax, colluding with a recently defeated Neville Chamberlain, while shocking to modern day senses fully educated on the true depth of evil Hitler represented, was portrayed quite accurately in this movie. So, while shocking, it is quite accurate history!<br/><br/>It is widely documented that Adolph Hitler fully believed he could sue for peace with Great Britain immediately after defeating France, and firmly believed it was Winston Churchill who kept that from happening. Hitler was correct! There were a number of well known Britons who openly sympathized with the Nazis, and others who simply believed it was necessary to avoid calamity on the British Isle.<br/><br/>It is difficult to project the vast changes in human history had the Nazis been able to secure a peace treaty with Britain after the fall of France, and then turned its full might against the Soviet Union. One must wonder, without even the material assistance of the United States, could Russia had singlehandedly defeated the Nazi invasion?<br/><br/>Russian people would unanimously claim they would have still defeated Germany, and perhaps they would have. But, without question, the absence of a second and third front would have assisted Germany greatly.<br/><br/>Britain's Finest Hour would never have even happened, had not Operation Dynamo succeeded, and had Winston Churchill not rallied the British people to persevere. One can make a salient argument that a Nazi Third Reich would have become a reality, and not simply a near ten year blight upon human civilization!<br/><br/>This movie beautifully and faithfully portrays these critical events, centered on a single man, who amid horrible threat and limited options for survival, summoned up a will to inspire a miracle at Dunkirk followed by one of humanity's greatest examples of defeating evil against vast odds."

","Darkest Hour is about one of the toughest crossroads the British Commonwealth and Winston Churchill went through: the former having to choose whether to negotiate with a rising dictator to let them keep their independence and in exchange support Hitler as he rules all over Europe, or to be the lone resistance against the tyrant where many of its other comrades has easily fallen to; the latter alone in wanting to fight the Germans until the very end, in a sea of voices favoring negotiated peace talks. The build-up and tension are palpable and there were crucial moments where you can really feel that the end is near such as the Royal Family being asked to escape to Canada and rule in exile and whether it was better to sacrifice 4,000 men in the Siege of Calais in order to save 300,000 in Dunkirk (whose adaptation is in contention for Best Picture this year.)<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's nomination for Best Actor for portraying Churchill is well-deserved. I have seen a couple of Churchills before (most recently John Lithgow in The Crown) and Gary's showed the most resemblance. You can barely make out his face except for his eyes which is still an enigma as when he played Sirius Black in the HP movies. Other notable performances include Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie (my aesthetic if I ever decide to grow old), Ben Mendelsohn as the embattled but still calm King George VI, and Stephen Dillane who you may miss as Stannis in GOT.<br/><br/>On a side note, I am fortunate to have come across and fell in love (okay somewhat obsessed) with Netflix's 'The Crown' that it felt like a reunion of sorts when I saw Clemmie, Eden and Bertie, which helped as I am usually averse towards war-themed movies. Also, was it too much to ask for to have shown a little Elizabeth running around Windsor Castle? Missed out on a golden opportunity there.<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie has stirred up a debate as to whether Churchill is deserving of such commemoration, owing to his views on superiority of Whites over other races (which some say was very common back in the day) and how he handled the Indian independence among others. It's true he was great in some aspects and the worst in others, but it does hold true of one of the many attributable quotes to Churchill: History is written by the victors.<br/><br/>Favorite quote (there's too many but this one sums up the movie):
""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle."""

"dokrauss","10","4","11","2 January 2018"," The Darkest Hour. The Brightest Hour
","A hero arises at a critical moment and changes history...I think that's a fairly decent summary of the Great Man Theory (spare me, feminists. That's what it's called). Either God raises a Great Man or society produces a person with the necessary characteristics, whichever, to save the day. I don't see how one of those excludes the other so I shall add a corollary: at the right moment in history, someone nuts enough to take on everything shows up.<br/><br/>That's the movie Darkest Hour: at what has got to be the worst possible moment in history, Churchill becomes Prime Minister of England. The government is dithering, Hitler is burning Europe, and no one in their right mind wants the job. It is the darkest moment; it becomes the brightest as we all with the benefit of hindsight now know and accept because Churchill saved civilization. Well, okay, the Americans helped but, if he hadn't been nuts enough to take the job, there'd have been no England for us TO help. We take this on faith. But if the movie is halfway accurate (and, apparently it is), it wasn't all that cut and dried. Indeed, it was a Very Near Thing.<br/><br/>For a movie with little action, it's incredibly tense. The five or six seconds here and there of bombs falling and things blowing up are actually a relief because, hoo boy, all the polite mannerly English drawing room talk which takes up about 95% of the movie has the atmosphere of a knife fight. That's because Churchill was no one's choice. For reasons not made clear, he is the only person acceptable to the political opposition when Chamberlain's incompetence finally causes the just-as-incompetent Parliament to give Nev the boot. The king doesn't want Churchill. His own party doesn't want Churchill. Turns out he gets picked because the ever-so-smart sophisticates need someone to blame when Hitler invades England. Yes, WHEN Hitler invades. The sophisticates have already given up. It's a complicated, nuanced world you see, and we betters intend to negotiate a peace with Hitler after he destroys our army of commoners (poor blighters) on the beaches of Dunkirk because then the Fuhrer will be reasonable.<br/><br/>Yikes.<br/><br/>So, essentially, Churchill is set up to fail. His own cabinet, including Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, are conspiring behind his back to bring him down and force peace negotiations. And he's the perfect fall guy. The son of scandalous parents, he's broke and drunk all the time, incredibly difficult to work with, only his wife able to talk any sense into him (and she's a piece of work herself),hated by his kids, laughed at by everyone from butlers to kings, and a colossal failure in his last wartime post (guy's responsible for Gallipoli).If everything goes TU, then it's obviously this guy's fault. Except...<br/><br/>Except.<br/><br/>Churchill shares the one trait uniting all the other Great Men (and women. I'm looking at you, Margaret Thatcher) of history: he believes in doing the right thing. Oh, he shares some other unfortunate traits of Great Men and Women (still looking at Margaret): a jackass easy to dislike; not someone you want over to the house for Sunday dinner; loud and obnoxious and annoying and your opinion of him is shared universally with all the other Best People who are just simply appalled, but he's going to do the right thing. He does not believe in a negotiated peace with Hitler. Oh no. We're going to fight. On the beaches, in the streets, wherever, but we fight. We are going to get our boys off the beach at Dunkirk and we are going to defy the tyrant and remain England because that is the right thing to do.<br/><br/>He stands alone, is ridiculed, opposed by everyone. Even his faithful war minister turns his back. And he begins to waver, until that marvelous scene when Churchill rides the underground and asks the commoners, the serfs, if he should negotiate. Resoundingly, to a man, to a woman, to even a child, they say no. We fight.<br/><br/>Now, I could talk about production values and acting and writing and direction and lighting (and I gotta say, this is one of the most brilliantly lighted movies I've seen in years) like you're supposed to do when reviewing a movie and yes, yes, all of that was great, but it's not the point. It's that the right thing is a function of the powerless, whose whole life consists of doing the right thing and who are not cynical nor jaded enough to accept fashionable opinions because, as Orwell said, there are ideas so stupid that only an intellectual could believe them. The powerless, the Great Unwashed, are laughed at and patronized and crushed by the sophisticates until events become critical and we're all going to die and then the Great Man shows up and does the right thing, their right thing, which is counterintuitive, is always unpopular, and takes a man of great strength to stay on its course. I don't think I could have, especially when such brilliant intellectual thinkers like oh, well, everybody else says how wrong you are. But Churchill did. And we're not all speaking German today unless we want to.<br/><br/>Imagine. A leader arises who, despite the concerted and almost unanimous opposition of the elite and intellectual classes, does what the people want him to do.<br/><br/>Sounds vaguely familiar."

"deepblue501","5","2","4","7 October 2018"," An average biopic that never really takes off
","Apart from the obvious falsification of history (with the Tube ride being complete fabrication) this movie never really gets going. The political battles ""behind the scenes"" (apart from also being historically untrue) never really captured my attention. <br/><br/>Yes, this is quite a good character study, but the movie is slow and not propelled forward with sufficient drama and plot. It remains on a quite superficial level of political debates, a bit of Oldman showing off his skills and that's really it. Very little is said about the man himself, about his depression even about his family and wife. All characters surrounding Churchill are flat. <br/><br/>And even if we focus on arguably the best aspect of the movie, which is Oldman's interpretation of Churchill, I have to confess that I didn't like it as much as many others. Oldman has a tendency to portray Churchill as an old man with a slow rhythm of speech, a voice sounding like a man close to his grave, weighing every word and honestly, this becomes irritating after an hour or so. In fact, I don't believe it is even particularly true to the original - Churchill was quite a vigorous man in spite of his age. <br/><br/>The cinematography is sufficient but not spectacular. The music likewise. Nothing really stands out in this movie. It's not bad, but it is a far cry from a movie that should win an Oscar. Average at best."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour is a historical movie set in Britain during World War 2. The movie follows Winston Churchill as he becomes Prime Minister of the British Empire as it faces its biggest crisis in its history. The events that the movie covers are: Nevill Chamberlain's resignation, Churchill's ascent to prime minister, the battle of France, the surrender of France, and the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces. Gary Oldman portrays the lead character bringing the historical figure to life.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour is a great period movie for any audiences that are interested in the era. Gary Oldman and the rest of the cast does an excellent job bringing the dark times of the British Empire alive on the screen. Every scene feels authentic with performances and history being doled out in small amounts. The history can be dry and uninteresting for some, but for anyone looking for a good historical movie can do no wrong with Darkest Hour. Although I cannot comment on the historical accuracy, the movie has the authenticity one would expect from a high budget movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend Darkest Hour to any audience interested in the politics and social situation of the British Empire at the start of World War 2. It features a dazzling performance from Gary Oldman and authentic sets.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"tonypeacock-1","8","0","0","9 May 2020"," Good performances even if the facts are not wholly accurate
","I went into this viewing with an appreciation of Winston Churchill as a great WWII Prime Minister. However at times I was frankly bored with the Westminster Houses of Parliament scenes that reminded me of BBC Parliament.<br/><br/>
Churchill himself is played by Gary Oldman. Oldman is transformed into the rather portly Churchill by great prosthetic make up that reminded me of the transformation of the late Robin Williams into Mrs. Doubtfire.<br/><br/>
On a serious note, Oldman gives a great performance as Churchill. Showing his rather scary demeanour mixed with a hidden humour.<br/><br/>I can't vouch for the historical facts of some scenes. I particularly draw attention to one scene where a bewildered Churchill finds inspiration not from his fellow Cabinet members, Royalty or Parliamentarians but by ordinary 'Londoners' on a tube train.
The tube train takes about five minutes to travel one stop on the District Line. Really!<br/><br/>As I have alluded to my historical knowledge of Churchill is limited but he comes across in the film as a great orator. A leader of men whilst some others dither with appeasement and talks.<br/><br/>A decent film for Oldman's performance if anything."
"PyroSikTh","7","0","0","9 May 2020"," Entertaining Propaganda
","Darkest Hour follows the polarising figure for his first month in office, taking over from the recently ousted Neville Chamberlain (a figure I feel history will forever be unkind to), through the evacuation of Dunkirk. Much like many biopics of figures in positions of authority, Darkest Hour absolutely takes historic liberties in order to tell an engaging story worthy of a movie. Churchill is only ever painted as a likeable and sympathetic figure, full of rousing speeches, and moments of self-doubt in the most troubling of times, glossing over his more questionable ethics in regards to race, eugenics, and the British Empire. In fact the film flirts with pure fantasy in order to cover up these more detestable aspects of his character, at one point having him talk to a black man, something that he would never have done, nor would he have taken political advice from a number of women and children. So in many ways, Darkest Hour reads like revisionist propaganda, propping up a man already revered by the right-wing as a wartime hero.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is tightly written and directed, really only losing steam in its final act. The sheer desperation and darkness endured by Britain at that time is palpable as we get a privy look into the War Chamber. Churchill was against the odds in trying to bring back British soldiers from Dunkirk, not appear weak or appease the Germans, keep his position of leadership intact against his own party, and stay financially afloat without the aristocracy of his peers. There's one particularly telling moment when Churchill contacts Roosevelt hoping to get an assistance from our American allies, to the point of near begging, only be told the most that can be done is to retrieve planes by dragging them across the Canadian border by horseback. ""Late in more ways than you can possibly know.""<br/><br/>However the final act loses its way with Churchill going AWOL to talk to the British public on the London Tube. Churchill was known for going AWOL and gauging public opinion by talking directly to them on the streets of London, but this scene is entirely fictionalised and takes gross liberties with Churchill's character. But above all it ruins the film's pacing, slowing it down to a near halt for an overlong sequence full of cheesy dialogue and inspirational solidarity that plays off as pure propaganda. There were much better, cleaner ways of tying up this particular plot point, without resorting to something so painfully cringeworthy it almost ruins the entire movie.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's performance as Churchill was really good though, there's no doubt about that. Between the extensive make-up work and the complete adoption of Churchill's mannerisms, Oldman gets lost in the role entirely. I'm not entirely convinced it was an award-winning performance, but there's no doubt that the dude has an unmatched talent in playing real-life figures. Kristin Scott Thomas was also really good as Churchill's wife, posing as the emotional backbone to their family dynamic, and emphasising how difficult he was to work with. Lily James was unfortunately misused as his secretary though. She lacks any kind of character or personality, and instead just acts as a walking receptor for Churchill's more sympathetic and brooding moments. Ben Mendelsohn was really good as King George VI, and it was great seeing him in the role of a good guy for once, proving that he has an untapped acting range, beyond always just being the slimy antagonist. The scenes he and Oldman share together are some of the film's greatest highlights.<br/><br/>On a more technical level, the film was also a success. The music by Dario Marianelli is unsurprisingly on point. It's a fairly typical orchestral score you'd expect to hear in a biopic, but it evokes the kind of music that works for these kinds of stories, ramping up the tension with beating drums, and the emotional stakes with sweeping strings, tied together with ever arpeggiating piano lines. The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel was also fantastic as well, offering more creative camerawork than I'd expected. The washed-out House of Commons was a nice touch bringing the film close to its black-and-white era, while imaginative shots like a POV shot from a child looking through his fingers like a telescope, German bombing of French lands seamlessly transitioning into the face of a corpse, and Churchill traveling in his elevator surrounded by a void of black space to show his isolation in his own cabinet, were enough to set the film apart from its contemporaries.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour was the perfect choice for VE Day celebrations, but I have to question it's unrelentingly positive portrayal of Churchill. He's hailed as a British hero, and this film only exemplifies that by ignoring his more unsavoury characteristics. He was the perfect leader for wartime, but fairly diabolical as a democratic leader of a peacetime society. The film doesn't care about that, and honestly I can't blame it because that's not the point of the movie. This is about the beginning of his tenure and his successful evacuation of Dunkirk, no more, no less. The acting talent is great, but the whole thing is just a vehicle for Oldman to get his long-awaited Oscar, and the visuals were definitely a pleasant surprise. I give Darkest Hour a respectable 7/10. Just skip the god-awful Tube scene."

The speeches are delivered magnificently; but there are too many speculative machinations going on - not least those involving King George VI - that do bring the credibility of this into question. There was plenty of accurately documented reportage from this time to enable Anthony McCarten to pen an entertaining script based more on the facts of this unsteady period of Churchill's premiership; Dunkirk; his relationship with Halifax & Roosevelt etc. rather than invent storylines. The attention to detail is superb and well deserved the second Oscar."

","The year is 1940, war is raging all over Europe. Poland is occupied, Holland and Belgium surrendered and France is undergoing the Nazi rollercoaster. All democracies are defeated.... All of them? No, an isle commanded by a stubborn Prime Minster won't stop to put up resistance. Yes, I'm an Asterix fan, in case you haven't noticed... and not much a fan of Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"", a movie whose very merit draws an interesting parallel with Churchill himself, a man whose heroism could only be unveiled by a dramatic opportunity, a matter of timing. Churchill was overdue a biopic and Gary Oldman an Oscar, and that's that.<br/><br/>There's nothing more satisfying than a movie tailor-made to win Oscars and that fail... it's fun to see them stumble and fall and remind a few producers that having movies based on true stories, involving a real-life larger-than-it figure, slightly more eccentric than the average schmuck, with actors who've proved to be bankable, isn't a guarantee for gold. In the same vein, there's nothing more frustrating than seeing the Academy biting the bait. By no means, am I implying that ""The Darkest Hour"" is a bad film, but is it anything new after ""The King's Speech"" or ""Lincoln"". Again, we have a historical figure facing a moral dilemma in the midst of a war on which the future of a country hinges, countless discussions between Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and Hallifax (Stephen Dilane) to decide if one should discuss peace and two patriotic and rousing speeches that seal the country's fate. On the paper, it's terrific but on the screen, it doesn't demand more than what a simple play could have provided.<br/><br/>Indeed, having Gary Oldman, the actor who made a specialty out of playing original and/or slightly disturbed characters, play the most iconic British figure was an offer fans and movie lovers couldn't refuse but how on Earth did the film, good but never great, garner six nominations including Best Picture. The film isn't a war movie but a huis-clos centering on the month of May 1940 where Europe surrendered to the Blitzkrieg and the British isle became the next target. The conflict is simple: should Britain listen to the terms of Hitler or fight... we all know surrendering won't be an option (so much for the suspense) but the thrills rely on the way Churchill is never totally approved even after his nomination at the head of the country, it's as if he was embodying the country's own insulation. In a way, it's a good premise for a film but I suspect its existence was to be more of a vehicle for Oldman than any attempt to inspire a new interest on the British Bulldog.<br/><br/>If you're going to have a movie about Churchill, why not go straight ahead with it, and call it the ""Darkest Hours"", why making it on the cheap and not have anything about the Blitz attacks and the magnificent way the Royal Air Force counterattacked... the film only exists to show the way Churchill win the battle of opinions, while real battles are either won and lost, having glimpses of hesitation at times and be the histrionic chap we expect. On that level, Oldman never disappoints but don't count on me to consider his performance deserving, here's why: Churchill is a living icon, he's hot-heated, hot-tempered, gross and vulgar in a sophisticated way, all you've got to do is chomp on your cigar and chew the scenery anyone would get away with it. A character like Churchill provides so many constraints that it's easier for an actor to depend on them and then let the inspiration take a life of its own. That's why I believe it's easier to play characters like Stephen Hawkins than the role that earned Casey Affleck his much deserved Oscar the year before.<br/><br/>Speaking of Hawkins, I called ""The Theory of Everything"" one of the most Oscar-baity films I've seen and ""The Darkest Hour"" reminded me of it, I didn't expect there would be a connection. Screenwriter Anthony MCarten seems to adore crowd-pleasing tear-jerking Oscar darlings, he's not a bad writer but I'm afraid he's diluting his talents in heavy-handed projects that might sometimes end with failed melodramas and he won't make quite a name for himself following that trend, though he did better with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", a film with a greater scope than Wright's war drama. Now, I didn't want to enter that turf about bait or not bait but when I got to the tube scene, I couldn't help but feel that the film was trying too hard, much to hard to pay tribute to a certain vision of London that would appeal to a 2010's audience and give Churchill a sort of sacred halo Ã  la Gandhi (a man he despised by the way) watching that scene, I thought the real Churchill would roll over his grave.<br/><br/>There were enough good biopics lately and it's unfair to make critics on the basis of comparisons but I wish we could have more movies like ""Patton"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" making biopic rhyming with epic, and not limiting itself to a timeline where FDR is inexistent and De Gaulle not a name yet, there's a lot of talk in ""The Darkest Hour"", I just wished the film could walk the walk. Rumor has it they're planning a sequel, maybe it's a recognition of how limited for such a grand figure the original was."

","The premise of the film is only focused on Winston Churchill in the months of May and early June 1940. This is why the film doesn't address the more controversial times of his career such as the Bengal Famine. This film is about his early time as PM and his decisions at the beginning of World War II. There were certainly more than a few artistic licenses taken such as the underground scene that didn't happen, his conversing with commoners as he despised everyone who was not part of the elite and his especially racist views about non-whites, the blatant ignoring of the fact that the Labour Party played a huge role in steering the British Parliament to war with the Nazi's rather than taking the diplomatic route that Lord Halifax wanted which would have surely failed as Hitler was bent on world domination.

","We saw the movie early as part of the Mill Valley Film Festival. I was somewhat apprehensive going in as though I've been a fan of Gary Oldman I just didn't see him as Churchill. I suspect others didn't as well and just couldn't get over their preconceived bias and consequently, we have a love or hate (1 or 10) review of the movie. I gave it a 8, as I thought it captured the building tension in London as well as the political tension but, and I think this should be a bigger but, if you listen to Churchill's speech as broadcast, he delivered it with a sing-song, almost ""who cares"" cadence in his voice whereas Oldman delivered it as everyone thought Churchill should have, and WC didn't, which made him one of the greatest speech writers and worst orators of the era."

"gortx","Null","3","8","1 December 2017"," Oldman's performance carries this historical drama
","Gary Oldman IS Winston Churchill. That seems to have been the selling point for DARKEST HOUR since it went into production. Premiering at Telluride, the word was that this could finally be the one that brings Oldman an Oscar. That is to be seen.<br/><br/>It's not all Oldman, of course. Director Joe Wrigth seems to have an affinity for period pictures, so one would think that this WWII drama would fit well. Unfortunately, it's a bit of an unsteady ride - much like Churchill's term as Prime Minister. Beginning just before Churchill's rise to power, DARKEST HOUR trains its focus on how he manages a thicket of opposition - from ousted P.M. Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), from much of his own party (chiefly Viscount Halifax; Stephen Dillane) to even King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) while trying to stave off what seems like the imminent Nazi conquest of England.<br/><br/>Anthony McCarten's screenplay certainly stacks the deck in making it appear as though it was Churchill versus everybody else (and fudges other significant facts). Everybody else but his loyal, but strong wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) and his loyal secretary (Hannah Steele). Fortunately, Oldman is up to the task of carrying the burden. It's a big blustery scene-chewing performance just set on a tee for awards consideration. Oldman mostly carries it off under all the makeup, even, if some of the supposedly 'amusing' backstage scenes come off as a drunken Alfred Hitchcock performing on Monty Python. When he's allowed to play it straight, he dominates the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Director Wright seemed to have a bit different idea of doing a historical drama. Instead of remaining largely invisible in his direction, we get swirling stylistic 'touches' that detract, more than engage. Sometimes it seems as if Wright instructed Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel to make his camera into a giant wind-up toy and let it roam free. Dario Marinelli's score is perfunctory.<br/><br/>DARKEST HOUR is modestly effective for Oldman's performance. It's a rousing old fashioned tale, even if it isn't perfectly told."
"LogicIsEverything","Null","4","13","14 January 2018"," Enough is enough
","Let's call every historical figure off the big screen or TV monitor, please. Why we have to watch these guys past again and again? Why the British and U.S. movie industries would repeatedly to praise or despise these guys again and again? Every of these guys' life stories in different angles, at different points of views were told again and again, facts and truth about these guys would have become more fictitious and away from their true selves. <br/><br/>Let truth being told, without subtly lured America into the WWII in time, England, no matter how this guy gave so many 'Attaboy!', 'Let's hang-on', 'We'll not be defeated', 'We shall fight them in the air, on the sea, on the land...', all would be lost. Those words would be just like farts without any practical purpose. And every word spoke in this guy's bedroom or at the table with his wife could only be treated as fictitious made-up. Nobody really knew what this guy really did when he was alone or with his wife. Everything in this film, just like other films about this guy or those other historical figures were just fictionalized to fool the readers or the movie-goers, don't be fooled by those so-called bio-writers, novelists, screenplay writers, movie producers, because the more you try to describe a historical person, how great or how bad they were, less and less facts you will get, you will end up being a fool.<br/><br/>The darkest hour of this guy's life or the darkest hour of all the British citizens was when they were holding their breaths to see if America would have thrown themselves into the WWII. It got nothing to do with what this guy said to his people. If the 'What if' scenario realized in the end, the British or the Allies lost the war, this guy's speeches or other known figures's big words would have become totally meaningless. When Hitler could use his own bullshit to fool 95% of his German citizens, every word he said to the Germans was nectar and honey, and if he won the War, all the speeches he gave to his people of the Third Reich would become the 2nd Bible or the new edition of a New World Order. But he lost, so he became the crazy monster and Churchill became one of the greatest and most memorable figures in human history. Winner takes all, that's not just an iron-clad rule in today's political, financial, or any form of competition. If Hitler won the War, everybody would have said 'See, I told you he's right, he's the true leader of the world.' and his speeches, his words and his biography would have become the textbooks that every student, every citizen had to study, Hitler would just become the 2nd Messiah, Chairman Mao or Stalin would only qualified to be his little brothers, even his fart would be smelled so good and so refreshing.<br/><br/>So folks, don't be so stupid to watch all the re-runs of these political figures, winner or loser won't change anything, because no matter how they had either won or lost, the world would still become so f@@ked-up. <br/><br/>I didn't learn or know anything new from this dramatized film, only thought Gary Oldman, who used to play bad guy in most of his movies, now finally got a chance to play an overly praised historical good guy and won a lot of trophies and awards, good for him and, that's all."

","As Doctor Who repeatedly points out, time is most definitely a tricksy thing. As I think I've commented on before, the events of 1940-45 are not in my lifetime but were sufficiently fresh to my parents that they were still actively talked about... so they still appear ""current"" to me. But I find it astonishing to realize that to a teen viewer this film is equivalent in timeframe to the sinking of the Titanic! #ancienthistory! So I suspect your connection to this film will be strongly affected by your age, and that was definitely reflected in the average age at my showing which must have been at least 60.<br/><br/>It's 1940 and Western Europe is under siege. Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup, ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") is the Conservative Prime Minister but is voted out of office in an attempt to form a grand coalition government with Labour leader Clement Atlee (David Schofield). Despite appearing a shoe-in for the role, Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) turns it down, thinking that his alternative (and bête noire) would drink from the poisoned chalice and be quickly be out of his (and Chamberlain's) hair. For that alternative choice is the volatile and unpredictable Churchill (Gary Oldman), grudgingly invited into the job by King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Rogue One""). With the Nazi's bearing down on the 300,000 encircled troops at Dunkirk, and with calls from his war cabinet to capitulate and seek terms of settlement, this is indeed both Churchill's, and the country's, 'darkest hour'.<br/><br/>Despite the woeful lack of historical knowledge among today's youngsters, most will be at least aware of the story of Dunkirk, with many having absorbed Christopher Nolan's film of last summer. This film is almost the matching bookend to that film, showing the terrifying behind-closed-door events that led up to that miracle. For it was terrifying seeing how close Britain came to the brink, and I'm not sure even I really appreciated that before. While this might have been a ""thriller"" if it had been a fictional story, we well know the outcome of the story: but even with this knowledge I still found the film to be extremely tense and claustrophobic as the net draws in around Churchill's firmly-held beliefs.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman's performance is extraordinary, and his award nominations are well-deserved. We have grown so used to some of his more over-the-top Russian portrayals in films like ""Air Force One"" and last year's (pretty poor) ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" that it is easy to forget what a nuanced and flexible actor he is. Ever since that ""No, surely not!"" moment of that first glimpse of the film's trailer, it has almost been impossible to 'see' Oldman behind the brilliant make-up of the character (Kazuhiro Tsuji gets a special credit for it). But his eyes are in there, and there are some extreme close-ups (for example, during a bizarre and tense phone call with Roosevelt (David Strathairn)) when you suddenly see ""There you are!"". <br/><br/>While I have nothing against Brian Cox as an actor, I far prefer the portrayal of Churchill on show here compared to last year's ""Churchill"": true that that film was set three or four stressful years later, but Cox's Churchill was portrayed as an incompetent fool, an embarrassment to the establishment that have to work around him. Oldman's Churchill is irascible, unreasonable, but undeniably a leader and a great orator.<br/><br/>Mirroring ""Churchill"" though, the action is seen through the eyes of Churchill's put-upon secretary, here played delightfully by Lily James (""Downton Abbey"", ""Baby Driver"") who perfectly looks and sounds the part. The character is more successful than that of Ella Purnell's Garrett in that she is given more room to develop her character and for the audience to warm to her. Oldman is getting all the kudos, but Lily James really deserves some for her touching and engaging performance here.<br/><br/>Also in Oldman's shadow is the always marvelous Kristin Scott Thomas (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The English Patient"") as Clemmie Churchill, expressing all the love and frustration associated with being a long-suffering wife to an over-worked husband in the public service.<br/><br/>At the pen is ""The Theory of Everything"" writer Anthony McCarten, and I'd like to say its a great script but with most of the best lines (""a sheep in sheep's clothing"" - LoL) coming from Winston himself it's difficult to tell. Some of the scenes can get a bit laborious and at 125 minutes - though not long by any means - the script could still perhaps have had a nip and tuck here and there.<br/><br/>Where some of this time is well spent though is in some sedate shots of London street life, across two separate scenes panning across everyday folk as the stresses of war start to become more evident. This is just one of the areas where director Joe Wright (""Atonement"", ""Pride and Prejudice"") shows considerable panache, ably assisted by the cinematography of Bruno Delbonnel (""Inside Llewyn Davis""): a boy closes his telescope-fingers around Churchill's plane; a bomb's eye-view of the beleaguered Brigadier Nicholson in Calais; and - very impressively - the smoky imperiousness of the House of Commons set.<br/><br/>And most-importantly Wright delivers what Christopher Nolan couldn't deliver in ""Dunkirk"": a properly CGI'd vista of hundred of small boats crossing the channel to Dunkirk. Now THAT is a scene that Kenneth Branagh could justly have looked in awe at!!! <br/><br/>There are a number of scenes that require disbelief to be suspended though: the biggest one being a tube train ride - very moving and effective I must say - but one that features the longest journey between any two stations on the District Line than has ever been experienced! <br/><br/>So this is a great film for really reliving a knife-edge moment in British history, and is highly recommended particularly for older viewers. If I'm honest though, between ""Darkest Hour"", ""Churchill"" and John Lithgow's excellent portrayal in ""The Crown"" I'm all over portrayals of the great man for a few years. Can we please move on now Hollywood?<br/><br/>(For the full graphical review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)"

","Just got back from seeing Darkest Hour. I will give it 5 stars out of 5 stars. As you know I am not part of the CGI movie generation, I will not go to movies that are manufactured and have little dialogue and take time to review them, I will seriously only review movies that are either Historically accurate or Movies that do not rely on special effects. Given that...
Because I was raised with a World War 2 Family, I will say from the acting standpoint, this is Gary Oldmans' finest. Those of you who know me I am a Gary Oldman fan, going back at least 15 years to his roll in Tip Toes. Gary Oldman is an actor who transforms himself to the point you do not realize its him until you look closely. Not only did he absorb the roll of Churchill, he became Churchill. The aspects of Left/Right and Politics of World War 2 played out and for the uneducated or those who are not WW2 buffs, will be reminded of the politics surrounding WW2. 
The story was simple, there were no flying ships or space oddities and the special effects of transforming Oldman into ""the oldman"" were nothing but amazing. 
Please bring your parents, grandparents or whom ever you are blessed enough to still have in your life that remember World War 2, and let it be a reminder to those who have no idea that really the world has not changed much politically in over 70 years. 
Entertainment meets history, and the tie in to previous years movies of Dunkirk, and The Kings Speech will help tie it all together for you.

","King George VI to Churchill on the phone ""The public need to be lead, not mislead, not left to work it out for themselves!""<br/><br/>I must start by saying I am absolutely love Gary Oldman, & have seen all his films at some point, & I do really like his effort here, however, there is one problem....<br/><br/>Mr Oldman's absolutely divine Tenor voice, is several pitches too high for Churchill. (GO is actually a very good singer!) Even my mother who was a child during WW2 commented on his voice, saying ""Churchill had a deep raspy low voice"" But I must say this is the only thing wrong with Oldman's performance, because he is an awesomely skilled, classically trained character actor & does give a solid performance.<br/><br/>Now onto the movie it's self. Well to put it bluntly, British History should NEVER be messed with for Hollywood liberal agenda! The screenplay here makes Churchill look weak & bumbling, & while some see Churchill as a war time hero, others maybe not, he was certainly NOT a bumbling drunken idiot. Churchill was an ""Elite"" he was born in Blenheim Palace, & like most of the ""Elite"" he did truly believe he was ""born to rule the little man"". He never used public transport, so I am really not sure what the bit on the tube was about? The tube scene is FAKE as Churchill never rode the tube or buses. This scene was inserted into the movie for a feel good, unicorns & rainbows, cinematic safe space! Also Churchill was fiercely against the marriage of Edward & Wallis. This movie would have been beautiful if someone on the writing team had actually read a history book & stood by on historical facts. This could have been a masterpiece! I almost feel like Oldman's wonderful, unique talent was somewhat wasted.<br/><br/>Anyway, I am just so glad Mr Oldman finally received an Oscar for this, because he certainly deserved it!

However, this movie captivated my mind, since it is about the uprising from the impending threat to freedom to the Great Britain where people have lost faith with the current leader and they needed someone of relentless nature who could bring the dying spirits to life.<br/><br/>Even though the entire cabinet ministry was against the wish of his leadership including the King himself, the unanimous support comes from the very own former Prime Minister who believed him as a person who could withstand the Greatest Dictator the world has ever known. Imperfections always makes a person strong and he is an imperfect leader with a bulldog spirit to fight like a warrior to any imperial conflicts that he endured in his life, exhibiting his instinctual behavior.<br/><br/>This movie is all about this great leader who is none other than
""Sir Winston Churchill"" and I was swayed by the first speech in his cabinet as Prime Minister of The Great Britain, which goes as, ""To wage war until victory is won, and never to surrender ourselves to servitude and shame. Whatever the cost and the agony may be, conquer we must, as conquer we shall.""<br/><br/>My final verdict is we don't get to know the depth of war, but we get to learn how revolutions emerged, how great decisions were made, and how people of those days chose wisely who their leader needs to be, which we current generation have to learn a lot and this movie is an exceptional one to give such inspiration."

These aren't confined to one season, however, and there are numerous biopics coming out all the time. Not all of these are a hit, many being critically panned. However some biopics lauded, both by critics and audiences alike; Darkest Hour is one of these films, instantly becoming an example for the biopic genre in general, largely due to its focus, managing to mix story, struggles, history and personality seamlessly.<br/><br/>While many biopics try (often in vain) to chart the life of a great figure from birth to death, Darkest Hour instead narrows its scope to a crucial, captivating month in the life of its protagonist. Churchill is a fascinating character and to tell the whole story of his life in just one film is too big a challenge to really do the man justice. Instead we go on an often intimate journey with him and his early struggles, many of which a great deal of the audience will not be aware of. Personally I had no idea that Churchill experience so much criticism and doubt even by members of his own party. Since there's a lot of history to learn as we watch, heavy expositionary dialogue is almost inevitable. At times such intense and heavy conversations packed full of information can become exhausting and one might find their mind wondering slightly, in need of some light relief. This relief isn't provided often, but that's not to say the film is devoid of comedy. In fact, Oldman's performance of Churchill himself gives us a great deal of comedy to lighten the tone and really improve the overall personality of the film. Still, even when there's a lot of serious discussions going on, it's never dull and always well-written, not getting too bogged down in the dreary and unnecessary details. The moments when we see the full personality of Churchill come through is when the film shines and Anthony McCarten's script perfectly captures the image of the man about whom we hear so many stories. However this is mostly down to Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>Oldman is certainly the heart and soul of Darkest Hour. Even if we were to forget the make-up, his performance is outstanding; but with the Academy Award-winning make-up it's incredible how he is transformed and how successfully he embodies Churchill and brings him to life before our very eyes. This is all best seen in a scene that probably never happened in real life - Churchill heads on into the London Underground by himself, astonishing the passengers and chatting with them all. This is Oldman's Oscar-winning performance at its finest; story is temporarily forgotten, and it's an absolute to joy to watch him just be that character, disbelief absolutely suspended, either willingly or unwillingly. Though Gary Oldman certainly seizes the film, the supporting cast support very well. Mendelsohn takes a different approach to King George than Colin Firth, making this character seem more his own, and Pickup and Dillane are perfect as stuffy politicians. Yet it's Scott Thomas and James that are the strongest in the supporting cast, giving both Churchill and the film a strong, kind and womanly touch that the overly male-dominated film needs.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright and director of photography Bruno Delbonnel also include gorgeous aesthetics. The set decoration is sublime, fully immersing us into a WWII London and letting it come to life. More than this, it's all shot beautifully and sometimes theatrically, with some of its cinematography inspiring. These all come together to strongly emphasise either the isolation or the triumph Churchill feels at different points throughout his story.<br/><br/>It's obvious from all the talk and even the poster that this is Gary Oldman's film. It's important to remember though that there's so much more to enjoy and applaud. With excellent writing, directing and cinematography, an emotional and realistic WWII London is brought to life, supported by an excellent cast. This is all topped off by an incredibly transformed Gary Oldman, fully evoking Churchill and giving us the performance of a lifetime. A big V for Victory!"

Gary Oldman as Wiston Churchill act amazingly the strong will of the Prime Minister. 
According to me this movie is exelent. The way of filming is really pleasant and the photos are beautiful. This is a fresh way to show the British side during the war. But I have to confess that I am a bit disappointed. I expected the movie to talk about a longer part of the WWII, but it shows only the beginning.

While the film details the events of Churchill's rise to power, the entertainment value comes largely from learning about the man himself.<br/><br/>Credit must go to the brilliant Gary Oldman who captures Churchill's character to a tee. Everything from his voice and body language to his subtle mannerisms is perfect, and it's easy to forget that you're not watching the man himself.

"ilin_ilya","8","3","10","16 January 2018"," Joe Wright's Darkest Hour
","Last year ended with a number of good-quality political thrillers. However, for some reasons nobody considered Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"" as a formidable rival to Spielberg's ""The Post"". Theaters were almost empty during it's performances and the movie hardly covered the production budget. This represents a rare case when cinema-fans made a serious mistake creating their expectations. Monumental biopic about the life of Winston Churchill appeared to be not another British fake, but rather quite strong masterpiece with impressive cast and great director's work.<br/><br/>Movie takes us back to May, 1940. Nazi Germany is about to invade Belgium. British Parliament demands the resignation of Neville Chamberlain from the role of Prime Minister due to his incapability of leading the nation during the war time. The only man whom both party will support happens to be Winston Churchill, then-First Lord of the Admiralty. Although, Churchill was right about the nature of Adolf Hitler, he has a poor reputation in Parliament and a very few supporters. The world is on the edge of terrible events. With the completely unprepared public, with weak king George VI who is not ready to unite the nation, with his own party plotting against him, Mr. Churchill must boldly face his life's darkest hour and make right choice which will finally put his name in the list of the greatest politicians in humans history.<br/><br/>Today, politics is considered as something extremely boring. It is hard to imagine exciting movie about, say, Merkel or Obama. However, it was not always like this. End of 19th and first half on 20th century was era of truly great politicians. Some of them were pure evil, some of them were synonyms of goodness. But majority were rather controversial figures. Churchill stands apart all of them. He was a man comprised of contradictions. Perhaps the greatest of all these contradictions was Churchill's dichotomy between public and private life. In the world history, he definitely stands as a bulldog-politician, who became the international symbol of resistance to Nazi far before USSR and USA appeared on the scene. His power as a politician helped to united the British nation during the hardest time in it's history. But not all people know that historical Churchill was also a worldly man. In private life Churchill was insecure, suffered the periods of deep depressions and uncertainty about his own actions. Director Joe Wright tries and explores in full exactly this dichotomy between public and private Churchill.<br/><br/>And he succeeded... with the help of splendid work of Gary Oldman. From the creative introductory scene to the very end of the movie, Oldman step by step introduces us to the true nature of Winston Churchill. The way how he walks, moves and speaks are so good that probably now the name ""Churchill"" would be associated in our minds firstly with famous ""V-for-victory"" picture and then immediately with Gary Oldman's tremendous role.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is no good counterpart to Oldman's character. King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) is quite good but toneless and uncharismatic comparing to the variation which we saw in ""King's Speech. Churchill's wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), with whom Churchill had loving but uneasy relationships played a nice but unremarkable part. Moreover, it is very hard to justify the inclusion the character of Churchill's personal secretary Elizabeth Layton (Lily Jamesthe) into the movie. All what she does is shedding from time to time unnatural tiers and distorting us from contemplation over truly important characters.<br/><br/>In short, the movie deserves to enter the grand series of historical biopics about Second World War era and take place among such ingenuous pictures as Imitation Game, Dunkirk and King's Speech. Despite the lack of critical approach to history and overburden patriotism, the movie is definitely a piece of high-quality art.<br/><br/>And in the end, good quote from the movie.<br/><br/>Winston Churchill: Will you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!"

(it wasn't!).<br/><br/>Also, Gary Oldman is stuttering every word he utters, making Churchill's character in the film seem like a stammering old fool (he wasn't and could speak very cleary, as is evident from original video footage and interviews).<br/><br/>On the positive side, nice costumes and a bit of history.

","Last year the film Dunkirk told the story of Great Britain's most anxious moments
from the point of view of various British soldiers, sailors, and civilians helping to
get the British Expeditionary Force off the beaches to fight another day. Had these people not done their job on those beaches Winston Churchill's moments 
here would either have never happened or would have been an empty gesture
of defiance. No doubt had the Wehrmacht successfully invaded and occupied
the United KIngdom, Winston Churchill would have been shot post haste by
the Nazi occupiers.<br/><br/>But because the job was done at Dunkirk Winston Churchill got to do his. After the Nazi invasions of Denmark and Norway, Neville Chamberlain's wartime government was ready to go, but the only Tory that the Labour Party
would serve under was Winston Churchill who had been consigned to the
back benches for most of the 30s. Labour itself was tinged with pacifism early
on and Churchill was the one who had consistently warned of the danger's
Hitler's rearmed Germany posed.<br/><br/>Nevertheless events made it a 'close run thing' as another British prime minister of another century described a crisis he faced. In Churchill's cabinet
were a number of potential appeasers and their choice for prime minister was
Chamberlain's former Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax played by Stephen Dillane. If the members of that cabinet had their way Halifax would have been
prime minister and would have sought a negotiated peace.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman has Churchill down perfect with all the bulldog defiance that comes through in those old WW2 era newsreels I well remember. No one else
in Great Britain would have pursued the policies he did at that time. He gave
the British people the blood, toil, tears, and sweat he promised and Great Britain and its Commonwealth partners carried on alone until the following
year Hitler attacked the Soviet Union and the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.
Oldman got a well deserved Best Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Best scene in the film is when the aristocratic Churchill goes into the London
Underground for a sampling of public opinion. Even with the memories of
the stalemate in the trenches of WW1 still in their memories as they are in the
various Cabinet members like Lord Halifax they don't want to give up. <br/><br/>The next chapter of the saga is contained in the all star epic The Battle Of 
Britain which tells of the Royal Air Force beating back the German Luftwaffe
while the bombs rained on British cities.<br/><br/>That's not to be missed either."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","6","27 February 2018"," Delivers everything you want from a prestige historical biopic
","As prestige pictures go, they don't get more prestigious than ""Darkest Hour,"" a British historical World War II biopic about one of the most frequently quoted and depicted figures in history with a transformative performance at its center. If you want the antithesis of independent filmmaking, here it is - the steak and potatoes of dramatic cinema. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the steak is a perfect medium and the potatoes are well-seasoned under the watch of director Joe Wright (""Atonement,"" ""Anna Karenina""). Wright is known for being a bit artistically aggressive rather than subtle, but that style complements the highly intellectual, conversational and strategy-focused script from Anthony McCarten (""The Theory of Everything""). He takes a film that could've been utterly boring and gives it movement and vibrancy. <br/><br/>""Darkest Hour"" depicts the events of May 1940, starting with the stepping down of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and the appointment of Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), the only member of his party whom the opposition would support. The move comes as British forces are surrounded by the Nazis in Dunkirk, France and the war seems just about lost. Although Churchill stands resolute against his party's wishes to entered peace negotiations with Hitler, the situation grows more dire by the day, and the pressure mounts for him to cave.<br/><br/>An almost unrecognizable Oldman is the film's centerpiece and lynchpin all in one. Unlike many prosthetics-laden performances, the makeup is so painstakingly and precisely applied that it never calls attention to itself and allows Oldman to full realize his interpretation of Churchill. Oldman gives us both the bold and bullish, cigar-smoking and liquor-swilling orator of historic lore, and also a man with doubts. The script definitely casts Churchill in a favorable light, and perhaps historians will take issue with it, but there's plenty of room for nuance and Oldman really revels in those moments as much if not more than the big speeches.<br/><br/>Oldman's performance is the sun, but some of the other supporting players in his orbit leave memorable impressions, including Stephen Dillane (""Game of Thrones"") as Viscount Halifax, Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie and Ben Mendelsohn (""Rogue One"") as King George VI. Still, without shoehorning in Churchill's typist (Lily James) whom he technically did not employ until 1941, ""Darkest Hour"" would be a lot of white men talking.<br/><br/>Wright does a lot to keep ""Darkest Hour"" visually engaging, be it through use of camera dollies in tight spaces or CGI aerial views of cities and towns to convey a sense of place when talk of strategy desensitizes us from the actual stakes. Still, the film is meant to explore the behind-the-scenes conversations in places of power and convey the extent to which Great Britain nearly gave up. While the whole country was swept up in rhetoric of hope, the film makes us privy to the fear and weakness behind the curtain.<br/><br/>""Darkest Hour"" as a film caves a bit too - to storytelling devices all too familiar in prestige pictures. The script contrives unlikely scenarios, such as a scene when Churchill rides the Underground, and even attempts to conclude on an inspirational high note with a sweeping speech. The film is better than those crutches, yet nevertheless it uses them. <br/><br/>Yet ""Darkest Hour"" can also hang its top hat on incredible production design (Sarah Greenwood, Katie Spencer) and cinematography (Bruno Delbonnel). These aesthetics alone, especially as they bolster Oldman's unforgettable performance, imbue the film with an energy that commands our attention. For an old-fashioned historical biopic, ""Darkest Hour"" checks all the right boxes and flat-out delivers on that esteemed, high-brow entertainment.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"jboothmillard","8","2","6","21 January 2018"," Darkest Hour
","I watched the trailer for this movie, not recognising the leading actor playing the iconic British statesman, I was shocked when I realised who it was, you can only recognise him by the eyes and voice, and then it got attention during Awards Season, so I was highly excited to watch it, directed by Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, Hanna). Basically in 1940, during World War II, Britain and France are Allies fighting against Nazi Germany, the Germans have invaded Belgium and the Netherlands, leading to the Opposition Labour Party in Parliament demanding the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), having lost faith in his leadership and weak protection of the peace. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party advisors that he wants Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane) to be his successor, but Halifax is not ready to become Prime Minister, the only other man who the other parties will support is Winston Churchill (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Gary Oldman), the First Lord of the Admiralty. Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) becomes Churchill's new secretary, but on her first day upsets him, not following instructions properly, he causes her to cry and she considers quitting, but Churchill's wife Clemmie (BAFTA nominated Kristin Scott Thomas) has a word with him, telling him to be nicer to others. King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) reluctantly invites Churchill to the palace to form a government, including Chamberlain and Halifax, but he wants his friend Halifax to be Prime Minister. Although he has been right about the danger of Hitler, Churchill has a poor reputation due to various past incidents, and Parliament dislikes the new Prime Minister's first speech promising ""Blood, toil, tears and sweat"". Churchill refuses to negotiate for peace, he believes that the Germans are untrustworthy, but the French Prime Minister thinks him delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France. Halifax and Chamberlain agree, there is the May 1940 War Cabinet crisis, so they plan to resign from the government if Churchill refuses to negotiate peace, causing a vote of no confidence that will allow Halifax to become Prime Minister. British forces are trapped at Dunkirk and Calais, against the advice of the War Cabinet, Churchill orders Brigadier Claude Nicholson (Richard Glover) to lead a suicide attack to distract the enemy, while the soldiers at Dunkirk are evacuated in Operation Dynamo. The Little Ships of Dunkirk rescue 300,000 British soldiers, but Belgium surrenders, France will soon surrender, a German invasion of Britain seems inevitable, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt cannot send help. The War Cabinet support negotiating with Germany following the defeat in France; even Churchill's friend Anthony Eden (Samuel West) declines to speak up in his favour. Churchill reluctantly allows Halifax to speak to Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini, but then George VI makes an unexpected visit to Churchill, he encourages him to lead Britain and continue the war. Still uncertain of what to do, Churchill decides to use the London Underground to get to Parliament (this event is fictional), the passengers aboard are shocked to see the Prime Minister, he talks to the civilians about the war effort, they reject negotiations and want to continue to fight the Germans. Churchill now has the support of the Outer Cabinet and other members of Parliament, with the help of Layton, he prepares to address Parliament, while Halifax demands that an increasingly reluctant Chamberlain continue their plan to depose him. Churchill makes his now famous speech, proclaiming ""We shall fight on the beaches"" should the Germans invade, Chamberlain decides to forgo the plan and the room, including Eden and other Conservatives, applauds the Prime Minister's defiance, Churchill is satisfied and departs. Chamberlain died six months later from cancer, Halifax was sent away to become the Ambassador to the United States, Churchill continues as Prime Minister when the Allies achieve victory over Germany, but he loses the following General Election. Also starring Nicholas Jones as Sir John Simon, David Schofield as Clement Atlee, Richard Lumsden as General Ismay, Malcolm Storry as General Ironside, Hilton McRae as Arthur Greenwood and David Strathairn as President Roosevelt. The unrecognisable Oldman gives a sensational performance as the most famous historical figure (recently featured on the £5 note), Scott Thomas does well in her scenes as the politician's supportive wife, and there is splendid support from Dillane, Mendelsohn, Pickup and others. It is a mostly chatty film, there are only small battle scenes, and obviously it is full of political stuff that may be complicated, but it is all about the leading character proving himself, the special effects prosthetics to transform Oldman is amazing, and there are many memorable moments, especially the final speech, and even the pretend meet and greet with the public on the train is enthralling, it is most watchable wartime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Original Music for Dario Marianelli, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design.

"alindsay-al","8","2","6","17 January 2018"," A great film led by a powerful performance
","This film has been heralded recently with a really strong lead performance and I have now seen darkest hour and I really enjoyed this film with a really strong lead performance. The premise of the film is set at the beginning of world War 2 and sees new prime minister Winston Churchill dealing with the grips of war. Gary Oldman plays Churchill in this film and he owns the screen throughout the entire film, he physically transformed for the role and it does give him a great presence on screen. He just delivers a truly passionate performance that provides some great moments in the film. Lily James plays his personal typist in the film and she does a good job giving some good emotion to the role and I felt her and oldmans chemistry worked very well. Ben mendehlson plays the King of England in the film and he does a good job with some of his scenes with Oldman being the most invigorating of the film. There are some good performances from the other politicians in the film and shows an interesting side that I wasn't aware of. The story as mentioned before has some interesting elements to it especially as it sees different conflicting ideas that make you see both sides of the argument. However, this film for me shares alot in similarities with last years 'Churchill' film that it was hard sometimes to get emotionally invested. The script is really good, it provides some great dramatic scenes that really build up the suspense well, also this film provides some good humour that makes these characters especially Churchill seem more human. The style of the film makes it seem very old school and with a look of the times it was set which is done well. Though, this film at times comes across as Oscar bait and over the top when it isn't necessary. Overall though this is a really enjoyable film that might give Oldman a chance at his first Oscar."
"joker-scar","6","4","17","28 December 2017"," NOT Winston's FINEST HOUR...
","I had high hopes for this film for many reasons, I am a history buff, especially the 2nd world war era, I love biographies and famous people's own struggles in life that get them to their respective accomplishments and....the main reason. I thought FINALLY... the Gary Oldman of old has found a juicy part to sink his teeth into rather than the pedestrian roles like Commissioner Gordon. The film has fine moments in it, like the beginning montage of vintage B&W stock footage that people who watch history docs have seen hundreds of times but the treatment of it with the subliminal music instead of the clichÃ© harsh drum-beat score really drew me in. Great photography, great sets/locations and then enter Mr. Churchill. Or more to the point, Gary Oldman's ""interpretation"" of the British Conservative bulldog.
 In every film of this nature when either a well known actor or unknown plays a famous figure from history there is always ""that moment"" when he/she is first seen on CAMERA and we, whether conscious or un, judge whether they ""are"" that person, the look and then when they speak the voice. The problem with doing bio-pic's of famous people like Kennedy, James Dean, Elvis, etc... they are all part of the 20th century and we all know what they look and sound like. In this case they are all unique in both those respects. Daniel Day Lewis pretty much ""nailed"" Lincoln (well, in my mind) Nobody knows exactly how the great Emancipator really sounded because it was before recorded sound. We only have photos and written accounts so it is easier to smudge some details and few would know. Bruce Greenwood nailed the ""essence"" of Jack Kennedy even though he did not really resemble him and Anthony Hopkins looks NOTHING like Richard Nixon but his acting over came those hurtles and you believe he is Nixon. Oldman's own portrayal of Beethoven is amazing and I have seen JFK at least 20 times and I still think his portrayal of Oswald is nothing less than stunning/frightening.
With someone like Churchill he not only had the unique look but the sound of his voice to identify him. When I saw Mr. Oldman, I thought he looked pretty good on screen. I never read any spoilers before I saw this film, (I never do anymore) but I ""assumed"" (my fault totally) that he had done the whole method actor thing and gained the weight a la' De Niro. But it was make-up and padding. No problem, totally understandable and in this day of high tech make-up you can get away with a lot more than in the old days. As the movie progressed Gary's eyes were not Churchill's, they were his and that kept me from getting into the movie and letting myself watch Churchill and not Gary Oldman acting as the great man. Then there was the voice... this problem could have easily been ""adjusted"" to make him sound a little more like the real man. This to me was the biggest problem with the portrayal, Churchill had a voice of gravelly meat-and-potatoes, of gravitas, of weight and authority...which Oldman did not bring to the roll. The facial make-up would not have distracted me if the voice was closer to the real man's but by now I am being critical to every mistake instead of being sucked into the viewing experience. The voice was weak...pure and simple. If I were a British citizen hearing Gary Oldman's voice in 1940 trying to rouse me to fight the Hun, I doubt Churchill would be remembered as strongly by history. The real man, JUST hearing his voice has a strength that inspires one to be and give more than you think you have within you. A true leaders voice...not so with Oldman's voice treatment. It sounds like a kindly old man working in an antique book shop. A man who you can trust but hardly inspiring to put one's life on the line for him or anyone else for that matter. Either the director was happy with it OR more likely, he didn't want to press the matter due to social/artistic awkwardness.
Another problem, a small nit-pick one I grant you, when Oldman walked it seemed to have the weight of his own and not one of a man with more girth to his mid rift. 
I am not one to point out CG work unless it really stands out as great...or...lame. Most of the shots of CG planes looked like CG planes...fake. The completely ""fake"" and contemporary shots of being on Churchill, him looking up from the roof and the CAMERA PULLS up into the sky to reveal passing bombers is not of the same tone as the rest of the film. That is a very 21st century film ""gimmick"" and took both myself and my friend out of the film once again. The rest of the film had the proper pace and tone of its subject matter and then here comes a CG grand standing shot to show the head office where some of the budget was spent... or wasted. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Establish a tone and stick with it, this is basic 101 directing stuff. 
I really ""wanted"" to like it BUT I like it even less the day after. This review would have been kinder if I had written it last night..."

There are tens of thousands of books and documentary films about WWII and its participants which claim to be entirely historically accurate. Darkest Hour is not one of them. Instead, it is a 125 minute long movie which effectively evokes the drama surrounding one critical month of British history.

","Although a well made movie considering the cinematic, the script is poor and as stated before disturbingly historically inaccurate. The script's take on Churchill, and Oldmans interpretation, is a mythical one created as how they wanted it to have been. Churchill is portrayed as a senile alcoholic with a feminine voice and touch that is obviously ridiculing in order to make his persona distorted. Considering that the movie had the prerequisites it had it fell flat in what probably can be interpret as an agenda to distort history in favor of today's general political views.<br/><br/>Feels like an effort to rewrite history for the general public.

"don2507","9","1","2","17 March 2020"," ""He Has Mobilized the English Language and Sent It Into Battle""
","I'm not a historical literalist when it comes to films based on historical events or characters so long as imagined scenes and events carry the drama forward and are not completely unfathomable or unfairly distort the record of historical characters (e.g., see LBJ in ""Selma""). If you want a good historical account of Churchill's first weeks as PM, read John Lukacs' ""Five Days in London: May 1940"" but if you want a vivid and visually dramatic portrayal of Churchill during this crucial time, then watch ""Darkest Hour."" I was totally absorbed in this film knowing that a British negotiated peace in May 1940 totally alters the arc of world history going forward.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is, of course, brilliant in his portrayal of Churchill, cigars and all, and the filmmakers did a great job recreating the House of Commons since they weren't allowed to use the real House, or at least its benches. Oldman's Churchill stammers a bit in this film which surprised me as I believed Churchill's verbal fluency was such that American diplomats marveled at his effortless eloquence at Tehran and Yalta. As for the much-maligned underground (subway) scene where the aristocrat PM solicits the opinions of common Brits on whether to fight on or not, it worked for me. In the midst of a peace movement within his war cabinet, he had to solicit the fighting mood of everyday Brits; this was an effective dramatic scene. Would you rather have the filmmakers have him reading poll results at 10 Downing Street?<br/><br/>Another thing that makes ""Darkest Hour"" work for me is that the ""peace"" group within the war cabinet, the ""antagonists"" so to speak (specifically Chamberlain and Halifax) were given compelling arguments to counter Churchill's belligerence. They wanted to see what kind of negotiated terms Britain might get from Hitler. After all, we don't know definitively to this day why Hitler held up his panzers before Dunkirk for several days: was he getting anxious about the speed of the German advance or did he admire the British Empire so much that he could live, for a time, with its preservation?"

"Hey_Sweden","7","1","2","1 April 2019"," Better if taken as an actors showcase.
","Gary Oldman finally picked up a (most deserved) Best Actor Oscar for his sterling work here. Acting under makeup and prosthetics, Oldman delivers the goods as the legendary 20th century politician Winston Churchill, a man who certainly had a gift for orating. As the film begins, it's the ""darkest hour"" of WWII, and hopes are severely diminished against the ferocious onslaught of Hitlers' military forces. The public has decided that current Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is not cutting the mustard any more, and makes it clear that they want change. Churchill is offered his job, and learns that by accepting it, he will have to accept that people have little faith in him. He will have to earn their trust.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is better seen as a showcase for its wonderful cast than as a story. It ends just when it's getting interesting, and it would have been nice to have seen more of an assessment of Churchills' overall achievements. As it is, it often focuses on Churchills' confrontations with indignant associates, who think that there are already strikes against him in his past history. Yet, we do get some sense of the heavy weight that this man bore, as he took every setback and all casualties to British forces to heart.<br/><br/>Assisted by his makeup team (who also brought home Oscars), Oldman is able to completely disappear into this role. You won't recognize the actor, but you'll be struck by his ability to engage the viewer, and get them involved in the story. The supporting cast is equally strong: Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, Lily James as Churchills' sometimes overwhelmed typist Elizabeth Layton, Stephen Dillane as Viscount Halifax, Samuel West as Sir Anthony Eden, David Schofield as Clement Atlee, etc. However, Kristin Scott Thomas gets precious little to do over the two hour five minute run time, as Churchills' devoted wife Clemmie.<br/><br/>In the end, this is typical filmmaking, in which events are either dramatized or fictionalized entirely, which once again just goes to show you that with movies, you sometimes just have to take them with a grain of salt. Not that I know many people who really expect an accurate depiction of history with this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","Not often that I see an actor in a getup and I find it hard to recognize him at first glare.

Besides this, the acting of Gary Oldman and the direction of Joe Writght allowed the viewers to view every aspect of Winston Churchill, his in-office and in-house frame of mind.<br/><br/>The historical events were somewhat fictional because I research every event and then map them into reality, so that I don't mix my historical facts. This flaw on its own could have debacled the movie if it had not been the Award-winning performance of Oldman. The power of words was the main captivation of the movie, which enraptured the British Parliament even if they were against it at first.
For those who are interested in historical movies/World War II movies, this is a must-watch movie. They will be mesmerized, inspired and fascinated by acting, direction and screenwriting.

","We have had the pleasure of enjoying the career of Gary Oldman for nearly four decades, and he has since evolved to become one of the finest actor in film industry. Never onve before had he won an Oscar, but now it was his turn, and it couldn't have come at a better time. The portrayal of Sir Winston Churchill is a performance of a lifetime. I would go as far to say it is one of the best acting performance of the 21th century.<br/><br/>Considering the story and the theme of the movie, it had the potential of just being a flat out boring, slow paced, political drama, but Darkest Hour is none of those. It is entertaining, funny and gives an insight of Churchill like we've never seen before. It's a captivating story behind the only man who dared stand up against Hitler.<br/><br/>On the matter of Hitler, similarities can be found between this movie and the Hitler biopic ""Downfall"", between Hitler and Churchill in terms of character. Both are great speakers able to convince an entire nation to go to war, both lashes out at army generals not following orders, and both are naiv war leaders believing in the strenghts of their respective army. However, to quote Bane, from ""The Dark Knight Rises"": ""It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan"", and this is where the two go go seperate ways. Both movies shows the man behind the actions, giving us a different way of seeing them. But in the end, when watching ""Downfall"" one is filled with vengeance and anger towards this man capable of such horrific actions, whereas when watching ""Darkest Hour"" one feels motivated and engaged to fight back.<br/><br/>Additionally, one of the things that gives this movie joy, is the wonderful music by composer Dario Marianelli. Combined with Churchills powerful spechees, the movie grabs a hold on you, keeping you on the edge of your seat wondering what the next move might be.<br/><br/>The best scene of this movie is its last, where Oldman perfectly captures Churchills greatest ever speech. Right after the speech he walks alone in the alley towards the exit, handerchiefs and papers flying all around him, closing the door behind him as the screen turns to black. The perfect ending to a wonderful movie. It truly makes you want to join his army and fight for the Brittish Islands."

","Set in the year 1940, the future of Western Europe is in the hands of a new Prime Minister. As the new Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, is announced, he will be required to make some of the most difficult choices in history, such as questioning if it is indeed wise to negotiate for peace with Adolf Hitler, or bring the fight straight to him...<br/><br/>Needless to say, the choices that rest on Winston Churchill could in fact lead the end of Western Europe.<br/><br/>This film is based on a true story.<br/><br/>Winston Churchill is acted by Gary Oldman, who received an Academy Award for best male actor for his work in this film. Within a short duration of this film, I can understand why. From the very get go, we discover that Churchill and his capabilities as a suitable Prime Minister are doubted. We also know that Churchill is a man who has a heart to do what is right for the good of his country and the world.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour for the duration is shot well and looks dark and feels gritty. For a dramatic film, we have many scenes shot underground or in dull rooms and I overall enjoyed the style to suit the film's tension and ""Dark Times"". Even as a drama, I was surprised to see how many moments Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as a character would also bring some slight touch humour to screen. This mostly comes from his working relationship with his new stenographer.<br/><br/>Overall, Darkest Hour is a fantastic war film without the explosions and gun fire. The film is loaded with tension, suspense but also managed to bring some smiles, which is to the credit of the award winning performance from Gary Oldman. Needless to say, this film comes recommend just to witness Gary Oldman's performance alone.<br/><br/>8.1/10

Gary Oldman is literally the best actor alive! He was fantastic as Churchill and should win that Oscar. I loved the makeup and hairstyling, costume design, and production design. The cinematography was beautiful. I'm sad to see that the score wasn't nominated for best original score but The Last Jedi was. I thought the score was beautiful. As for flaws there were only a couple scenes that dragged a little and a few characters didn't have as much development as I would've liked. Other than that it was amazing. Definitely see this one!

"blanche-2","8","1","2","6 October 2018"," a dark time in history
","Passionate, rousing film about the dark days of May 1940, when Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) became prime minister and resisted the idea of peace negotiations with Germany.<br/><br/>I suppose hindsight is 20/20 but honestly - Hitler takes Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium , and was on his way to France, who had no defense planned (how many Frenchmen does it take to defend Paris from attack - answer, no one knows, it's never happened), and there were people in Parliament that thought Hitler would negotiate a peace treaty.<br/><br/>After taking over from Neville Chamberlain, Churchill finds himself alone in wanting England to defend itself. His speeches rally the people, and in the end, England fights.<br/><br/>Now, it's never good to get your history from the movies. Films take dramatic license, combine characters, events, and telescope time to make a compelling story. There are a few things here that are fictional, the biggest one being Churchill going into the subway. That should have been cut.<br/><br/>Also, history tells us that although in the film, Churchill agrees to at least listen to a proposed peace agreement - in reality, he never considered it and never agreed to it. Chamberlain is depicted saying he is dying of cancer; Chamberlain never told anyone he had cancer because he was never told that himself.<br/><br/>The portrait of Churchill certainly matches what has been read and said about him. As everyone knows, Gary Oldman was magnificent. The rest of the cast did well, but it was Oldman's show.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing to me about this film was the director (Joe Wright's) ability to capture the tension, the pressure, and the fright of what Britain was facing - alone - since the U.S. wouldn't do anything. For FDR it was all about Russia, and in the end, we see that Russia was handed eastern Europe. The forces against Churchill are depicted as overwhelming - one historian suggests that there probably weren't the loud shouting matches as depicted, but certainly a great deal of discussion."
"The_Film_Auditor","8","1","2","17 July 2018"," Interesting Historical Piece
","Historical films have always been a soft spot for me, and Darkest Hour is no exception. The story of Winston Churchill and his promotion to Prime Minister of England during World War II, this film lets you see Churchill struggle and succeed. I enjoyed seeing the British political side of the war, and learned a lot about Churchill and how the English government handled WWII. I was captivated the entire time; the story even became inspiring towards the end. I found this film to be complementary to Dunkirk, it included the same period, only the political side of the story. This film added to my understanding of Dunkirk as a whole.<br/><br/>I also thought that Gary Oldman's performance was grand. His delivery as Churchill was captivating, and you could tell that he was dedicated to nailing the performance. The makeup team also did an unbelievable job transforming Oldman and definitely deserves the best makeup award. As for the films negatives, I think the film did not excel at thinking outside the box; it was similar to other historical film biopics I have seen. I also think that the film had a few parts that dragged a bit. Other than that, I enjoyed the film."
"nikcoppin","8","1","2","22 June 2018"," Go Gary!
","Of course it was a magnificent performance from the always great Gary Oldman. I think we always knew it was going to be the case. From the trailers and from a long history of fine performances from the man.<br/><br/>It was easy to forget it was actually him with all the blubber around his jowls, taking on the doubters all around him as he tries desperately to find a way to lift the mood of the nation with the mighty German army about to push the last of the British troops into the sea on the northern coast of France.<br/><br/>It was almost a behind-the-scenes sequel to the movie Dunkirk as we work towards the civilian fleet sailing off across The Channel to pick up the stranded soldiers.<br/><br/>And thanks for the help America!<br/><br/>They certainly build the mood nicely as we feel the pressure mounting on Mr Winston, who has to make some pretty tough decisions with a war cabinet pressing for a peace deal with Hitler.<br/><br/>""YOU CANNOT REASON WITH A TIGER WHEN YOUR HEAD IS IN ITS MOUTH!"", he screams at Chamberlain and Halifax.<br/><br/>Given my knowledge of the big cat family, I'm not sure you can reason with a tiger at any time actually. But then again, maybe with a nice juicy steak. Hitler of course was a famous vegetarian, so I don't think a 12oz ribeye would do the trick.<br/><br/>Of course there were some fine performances from the supporting cast too. Ducky from Four Weddings was superb in her part as Mrs Churchill, as well as Aussie Ben Mendelson in his role as the King.<br/><br/>I do have to wonder if anybody in the 1940's could actually pronounce their R's properly. Or should I say 'pwoperly'. Many of the characters seemed to suffer from this.<br/><br/>It was also interesting to see the internal anguish that Winston was going through after being thrown in at the deep end. Because of course, we all know how it all turned out so it's easy to forget just how hard those tough decisions of sending men to certain death must have been for a man trying to save a nation.<br/><br/>But thanks to a scene with Winston talking to the the real people on the ground, or rather Underground, it was made clear that the British people would rather die than bow down to fascists. <br/><br/>Upon looking up whether this situation actually took place, it appears it didn't, but rather was put in for dramatic effect. However, it very well could have in a different way given Mr Churchill's tendency to go missing on occasion and apparently often to go talking to your every day person on the street. Either way, it was a fantastic scene that summed up the resolve of the British people at a very dark time.<br/><br/>Mr Oldman must surely be up for an award, if not the top award for his portrayal of the man who refused to bow down to tyranny marching its way across Europe."

The movie helped the audience feel the fear of a more advanced military. I wanted to cry for the soldiers lost at Calais.<br/><br/>I was torn by ""Call FDR"" vs. the tragic disappointing help the US could provide at that time.<br/><br/>Was it unbelievable that France was getting defeated by Germany--was it right to sympathize with Churchill that the German advance against French military defenses was unbelievable and that it put France up against the wall?

"warthogjump","9","2","7","25 January 2018"," Gary Oldman's finest hours
","It is as if Gary Oldman was born to play Winston Churchill. I think 3 Oscars for DDL is enough. Another role like this will unlikely come Oldman's way - he has waited almost a lifetime for it to begin with. Gary Oldman literally transformed himself to become Churchill. It is the best performance of the year by far, especially considering Oldman's very wide range of acting capability. He is one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood. As good as DDL is, Gary Oldman has zero oscars for his many amazing performances. In the Darkest Hour, in my opinion, it is without a doubt Oldman's greatest performance. The movie is tense, gripping, entertaining, and at many times comic, mainly due to the perfect behaviour and mannerisms of Oldman as Churchill. Some will not like it because it's 'boring', but it is ultimately a retelling of historical events, and there is only so much room for 'entertainment' in such a category of work. It is more a dramatic depiction of Churchill and the politics of war, rather than an 'action' piece, and it is the humour, will and determination of Oldman as Churchill that makes this movie truly worthwhile. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for this type of a film."
"comps-784-38265","8","2","7","21 January 2018"," Admirable, vastly entertaining
","The problem with any film about Winston Churchill (let alone WWII) is the subject is too complex for one film. However, Darkest Hour does make a very entertaining stab at it for the period when Churchill has just become Prime Minister. <br/><br/>Many other films have used 'artistic license' as an excuse for lazy script writing where they blatantly ignore historical facts, or down right lie. Then have the gall to announce 'based on a true story' which is just code for B.S.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour uses 'artistic license' as it should be used, i.e. to help tell the story (not re-write history) <br/><br/>Whilst any film on Churchill is going to be contentious, I found this film extremely entertaining, showing some of the 'Great Man's' many quirks, flaws, greatnesses and weaknesses. I particularly like the fact it showed how close England was to making peace (at almost any cost) <br/><br/>We can all look back with the wisdom of hindsight now, and know Churchill was right, but at the time Britain was staring into the abyss of facism and was alone. <br/><br/>I have only 2 criticisms of the film <br/><br/>1.The King's 'stutter' was portrayed as an 'W' pronouncer 'woger' (roger) and came across as similar to Kripkey character from Big Bang Theory and was a little irritating. However as the film progressed the actor reduced this dramatically.<br/><br/>2. After 2 hours the film finished.

"jeffyoung1","9","2","7","22 December 2017"," Historical drama of Great Britain's political will to resist Nazi Germany
","The World War II historical event of the British evacuation of it's army from the French beaches of Dunkirk has been covered from the military aspect several times over the past decades. DARKEST HOUR fills the void over what transpired in the British government over that time period, how Great Britain teetered between an armistice with Nazi Germany that would have been a de facto negotiated surrender and continued national resistance. As the movie depicts, it was a close thing. 
First of all, the television commercial preview gives a somewhat misleading perception of 'Darkest Hour' as a more traditional war movie. But that is not the case. The movie is almost wholly human drama back in London amidst the center of political power encompassing Parliament, the House of Commons, the intrigue between its most powerful men, and the involvement of King George V. This movie is not suited for perhaps for younger people but for older fans of historical drama. Make no mistake, it is a high-quality human drama theatrical production and well-worth watching. It would be too dull for children, teens, and young adults.
As the historical drama unfolds, the populace and the government of Great Britain are shaken and fearful in May 1940 as the German Wehrmacht steamrolls over Western Europe, crushes the numerically superior but poorly-led French Army, and forces the British Expeditionary Army reeling back against the sea at the beaches of Dunkirk. But that is just the backdrop for the real movie. 
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, a secretly dying man, his appeasement policies towards Nazi Germany a catastrophic failure, is forced from power. In hindsight, the history books might be too harsh on Chamberlain as an appeaser. Closer examination of contemporary history shows that he was highly supported by the British government, the populace, and the king in the two years leading up to war. In the late 1930s, the once highly nationalistic and jingoistic British and French are a thing of the past. The human meat grinder of WWI have wholly transformed both nations into pacifists, almost at any cost. Despite rearmament by the U.K. and France, both are still unprepared for major war in late 1939. A highly respected, experienced and powerful statesman, Viscount Halifax, is considered by many to be the natural successor.
In historical hindsight it was fortunate for the United Kingdom and for the world that Halifax declined the prestigious job of prime minister. Had it been peacetime, no doubt he would have accepted. But it was desperate national times. Halifax, and many in the British government at the time saw things pessimistically and for legitimate reasons. It was true, Great Britain was still unprepared and underequipped to oppose Nazi Germany. Logically, some kind of peace agreement did make sense. True, but as Great Britain had suffered a serious military defeat on the continent, any peace treaty then and there would no doubt be disadvantageous. Hitler would undoubtedly have demanded harsh terms from the British government. Why not? He was the winner at the time. Halifax, one of the leading members of the peace settlement with Hitler, understood this better than anyone besides Chamberlain and Churchill. An ambitious, highly intelligent man, Halifax was astute enough to recognize history would hold him responsible for any negotiated surrender with Germany, which is what any 'armistice' would have been in May 1940. Halifax did not want that. He declined the prime minister job which went to second choice, compromise candidate, Winston Churchill. Had Churchill agreed with Halifax's demand for peace terms with Hitler, it would have been Churchill's entire fault in the history books. And history would have been changed forever. The movie dramatically shows how even Churchill himself wavered at the critical moment, when he stood alone in defiance of Nazi Germany. Churchill held to his instincts, his natural stubbornness, his unwavering faith in the greatness and power of Great Britain which he witnessed and participated in as a young man, the timely moral and political support of King George V, and his well-advised talks with the British common people. By accident, Churchill's earlier reluctant 'implied' assent to Halifax and Chamberlain to explore peace negotiations through mediator, fascist Italy, got both men off his back temporarily, giving Churchill more breathing space and room to act. The crowning moment arrived in the House of Commons when Churchill rallied all parties, essentially the entire government, behind him to continue the war against Nazi Germany. Chamberlain gave his quiet assent (he would pass away 6 months later) and Viscount Halifax fell from power, later to be dispatched by Churchill to the USA to purchase armaments and supplies for the national war effort. And the rest is destiny and final victory on May 8, 1945."

I can not understand this because I felt his portrayal was a caricature of Churchill. The only part that Oldman was hands believable was when he has a talk with his secretary about a photographic of her brother.<br/><br/>The cinematography also was very amateurish and tried way to hard.

In spite of that, the Churchill we see here is a blustering buffoon who shouts at anyone who disagrees with him and relies on people in the street (including the obligatory ethnic minority types) telling him whether he should make peace with Hitler or not. Utter nonsense, of course, and completely non-historical. Churchill had very good reasons for continuing the war and defying Hitler and without these reasons he would himself admit that he would have had no choice but to negotiate. These reasons were not analysed and all we get here is an obese blowhard who throws hissy-fits and invokes ancient history to justify his decisions. This is history for the tabloid readers, not for the intelligent audience seeking 'real' history.

I always admired her deeply, she adorns every film she partakes in, she is intelligent and beautiful, which is an invincible combination - she just has to appear, and she turns any dreadful story to something deeply interesting. Her perhaps least successful appearance was in ""The English Patient"" as the romantic lead - she is only superior as a leading supporter.<br/><br/>As for the rest, Roland Pickup makes a very convincing and almost heart-breakingly melancholy Chamberlain, all too clearly singing on his last verse, who is the only tragic figure of this movie. The others are all quite all right.<br/><br/>The music by Dario Marianelli was a positive surprise, it's very well manufactured, even pointing out and underscoring some comical moments, while the main character of the film is documentary - the effort has been to catch the strain of that terrible first month of Prime Minister Churchill's, which ambition definitely is achieved. It couldn't have been made better.<br/><br/>So without flinching I join all the other 10-voters and hope to see the film again."

Edward R.Murrow wrote some of the best words of the millions written on World War II. Yet his memorable line about Churchill mobilizing the English language is attributed to Lord Halifax. King George had a speech impediment yet there is no hint of it in this movie. There are many other goofs and gaffes.

","I was excited to see a movie made about Sir Winston Churchill. I was hoping that it wouldn't ""marble-ize"" him as a hero (which he was) and gloss over his periodically abrasive personality. This movie did a pretty good job of capturing his persona, and Gary Oldman (who is a chameleon) deserved the awards and accolades he received for his performance.<br/><br/> The depiction of Neville Chamberlain was masterful as well. It's one thing to find an actor who looks somewhat like the character, but Ronald Pickup looked and acted so much like him, it was creepy.<br/><br/> Several scenes were masterful - such as the War Cabinet's attempts to maneuver Churchill into acquiescing to an Italian peace envoy. Another was the total feeling of isolation and despair that Gary Oldman projected after being rebuffed over the phone by FDR. And Mendelsohn as King George contemplating potential rule ""in abstentia"" showed the start realities of total defeat they were facing.<br/><br/> Was it a good movie? Yes. Was it award worthy? Yes. The only thing I would have to critique about the movie is that it is geared more for people who don't know the story of Churchill, the Nazi blitz, Dunkirk, or only know the generalities of World War II. It's a good starting point for those individuals, but for students of the genre, it won't add anything new to your repertoire."

","Last year two major movies came out, both about the same subject, the invasion and then rescue of men from Dunkirk during World War II. One was a big budget war movie directed by Christopher Nolan, Dunkirk, that was shot entirely with a blend of Imax and 70mm cameras and became the biggest war movie since Saving Private Ryan. The other, this one, gained critical acclaim and received some awards. That movie tells the story of how Winston Churchill (played greatly by Gary Oldman) overcame the odds and became a popular prime minister who delivered his famous ""Never Surrender"" speech years before the end of World War II. Unlike Dunkirk, this movie has no violence at all but thematic elements of war that might be a bit scary for little kids. Worth a rental on bluray."
"pmetz-31955","7","1","3","24 March 2018"," Nationalism is over the limit.
","Not wanting to despise everyone's work in the movie, but no, it just does not. The film shows when Winston Churchil assumed the post of prime minister in 1940 and shows the difficulties in which he passed. The problem is not this, and how the story of the 2nd war is told. Anthony McCarten, the writer of the script, did everything to put England on a pedestal, written: the heroine of World War II. It puts all the rest of the countries like losers, villains, the one that error.
With that mistake, let's talk about the good things in the movie. Yes, Gary Oldman does a bitch for a performance, no doubt the best of his career. The design, makeup and costumes of the film are stupendous, especially makeup.
Between mistakes and positives of the film I give my farewell with a single phrase: nationalism is over the limit."

","Repeating myself all over again - this film was done only to give Gary Oldman an Oscar. About damn time, by the way. But... Apart from him (and his film-wife) being incredible onscreen, I got really bored. It was nothing shocking or maybe I'm just not very much into war history films. Costumes and, more importantly, make-up are done perfectly. Gary is almost unrecognisable and all the 40s suits and dresses catch an eye. The same goes to cinematography, but it is such a common subject recently, I can't tell if it was something out of the scale. Myself, I enjoyed The Crown more in this area.<br/><br/>The film tells a story of very first days of Winston's rule and that Dunkirk thing. So basically Nolan's film from the point of the minister. I don't have to tell you what happens, the history books will tell you that more accurately than I ever could.<br/><br/>And to be honest - it was a boring story. Apart from the couple I described before, everyone are somewhat plain. Especially Lily James, who gives me more and more reasons to doubt her acting skills."
"davidgee","6","1","3","24 January 2018"," And the Award for Best Prosthetics ...
","Gary Oldman's take on Winston Churchill is already winning awards and hotly tipped to take this year's Oscar. Brian Cox gave a more thoughtful performance in last year's CHURCHILL, but he didn't win anything. That's showbiz, I guess.<br/><br/>This version looks at the Great Man at the pivotal moment in his career when he replaces Chamberlain as prime minister of a coalition government in 1940, with the British Army facing annihilation at Dunkirk. King George is not keen on Winston (he championed Edward VIII during the Abdication crisis), and he has a 'mortal enemy' in Lord Halifax who thinks he should be leading the country. Churchill's decisions during the First War don't give him a good military track record.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in dingy rooms and corridors in the war bunker beneath St James's Park. Even Buckingham Palace looks a bit dour. The movie's best scene, almost certainly invented, is when Winston takes the Underground from St James's to Westminster (a 90-second journey that here takes six minutes) and finds the people are keener to fight on than the Tory members of his Cabinet. I found myself thinking of Laurence Olivier's deliberately hammy Archie Rice in THE ENTERTAINER.<br/><br/>Kirsten Scott-Thomas is a grander, less motherly Clementine than Miranda Richardson was last year. Lily James is charming as the PM's shy new typist. Everybody plays down against Oldman's shouty interpretation of Winston. His prosthetics deserve an award of their own and he captures the voice and the mannerisms as well as anybody else has, but other actors have given us subtler reincarnations that, unfairly it must be said, failed to attract the Oscar buzz."

","Churchill is known as one of powerful and influential personalities of twentieth century. Movie showcases his time since he became prime minister of United Kingdom and his work in administration. <br/><br/>First time, I am able to realize other side of a great leader. Churchill fans might not like to see negative sides of a leader. Films shows he is short tempered and gets easily angry over anybody who works with him. He drinks very frequently, even during day time. He is unable to talk properly. He spatters while he talks. <br/><br/>His most decisions are unapproved by others and have to be executed on his strict order. Churchill is the only political leader who received Nobel Prize in literature. He wrote pages after pages in his lifetime. He wrote speeches on his own, but in old age he has hired a girl who writes for him as he dictates.
 
Film also show him taking help of US Army while his decision to save soldiers from Dunkirk. Churchill fans would love watching him giving persuasive, motivating speeches. He is one of greatest orator in history. Small clippings of his best speeches such as ""Finest hours"", ""His offerings of Blood sweet and tears"" are shown in films. <br/><br/>Film ends with his quotes - ""Success is not final, Failure is not fatal, It is courage to continue that counts.""

"diana-99061","7","1","3","13 January 2018"," Misleading history
","A fascinating performance and enjoyable film, but one omission that annoyed me was the lack of fair acknowledgement of the French troops, who fought like lions and in many cases sacrificed their lives when all seemed lost for France itself in order to protect the escaping British troops. The impression given was that it was the extremely brave British defenders of Calais who alone made the Dunkirk rescue possible. With current relations between France and Britain at a low ebb following Brexit, I find it appalling that the film could not pay homage to those courageous French troops. Without them, we would have lost.<br/><br/>Another misleading element was the implication that poor old Chamberlain was the ultimate appeaser. In fact, he had sacrificed his personal honour to buy time for Britain. The second he landed back home waving that piece of paper and proclaiming 'peace in our time' he put the aircraft factories on 24-hour shifts. Not a second too soon, admittedly, but if we had gone to war when Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia we truly would not have had a hope in hell. If the film showed one thing accurately, it was that even with the extra time he bought, it was still 'a close run thing'."

"ferguson-6","7","2","10","7 December 2017"," a turning point
","Greetings again from the darkness. Cinematic historical dramas, by definition, face the challenge of overcoming a known and documented outcome. Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) and writer Anthony McCarten (Oscar nominated for THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING) attempt to re-create the tension-packed few days that literally changed the course of history and the free world.<br/><br/>It's May 9, 1940 and the film takes us through the next 3 weeks of political wrangling that begins with Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) being named Prime Minister almost by default, as he's the only candidate acceptable to both parties to replace an ill and weak war time leader Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup). Even King George VI (Ben Mendolsohn) is skeptical of Churchill and prefers Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane), his friend who is likely better suited as Churchill's adversary and a contrarian than as the actual decision- maker in this crucial time. <br/><br/>Uncertainty abounds within the government and the top priority of debate is whether to negotiate a peace treaty with Hitler and Nazi Germany, or fight on against seemingly impossible odds in hope of maintaining the nation's freedom. Perspective is required here, as at this point, Germany was viewed as an unstoppable military force with Hitler as the leader. The war atrocities and his despicable vision were not yet fully understood. FDR and the United States declined to help and Churchill had few allies inside or outside his country.<br/><br/>We can talk all you'd like about history, but more than anything, this is a showcase for the best working actor who has never won an Oscar, Gary Oldman. This is an actor who has played Lee Harvey Oswald and Sid Vicious, and probably should have won the award in 2012 for TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. Earlier this year, I was impressed with Brian Cox as the lead in CHURCHILL (which was set four years later), but Oldman's Churchill looks, sounds and moves like the real thing. We see the familiar profile and silhouette in numerous shots, and it's actually kind of thrilling.<br/><br/>The always great Kristin Scott Thomas plays wife Clementine, and she shines in her too few scenes. Lily James plays Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's bright-eyed secretary and confidant, and she has a couple of nice exchanges with Winston – especially the one explaining the ""V"" hand gesture. Another favorite line has a character state, ""I love to listen to him. He has 100 ideas every day  4 of which are good  96 of which are dangerous."" It's this type of writing that emphasizes the opposite approaches between this film and Christopher Nolan's DUNKIRK, which utilized minimal dialogue as opposed to the emphasis on words taken by Mr. Wright's film.<br/><br/>We go inside the House of Commons to experience real political gamesmanship, and see the hectic activities inside the war room as typewriters are being pounded while strategies and alliances are being formed. It's an example of politics driven by a fear of action (by most) while there is a touch of hero worship as Churchill stands alone for much of the film. Some creative license is taken as Churchill rides the Underground (subway) in order to connect with citizens and take their pulse on war  despite most having no clue just how desperate things are. We see tremendous and tragic shots of Calais, and the wide range of camera work really stands out thanks to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who also masters the indoor lighting and shading.<br/><br/>Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk is discussed briefly (this would be the perfect companion piece to Christopher Nolan's masterpiece from earlier this year), but mostly this is the personalization of those who politicize war. The good and bad of history is made up of people, good and bad. Yes, there are a few too many Hollywood moments here, but Oldman does capture the pressure, isolation and belief of the historical figure who helped save a country, and perhaps the world. We hear two of Churchill's most famous speeches: the ""Never Surrender"" speech to Parliament and ""We shall fight them on the beaches "" prompted by the red glow of the ""on air"" radio light. There are many published books that provide more detail, but Oldman's performance does guide us through what the Prime Minister must have gone through  and that's worth a ticket and a gold statue."

","Director Joe Wright takes 'Darkest Hour"" to Winston Churchill's early years as Prime Minister as he's now on his own in his involvement during one of darkest moments in world history as WWII is at its pinnacle, Churchill must make decisions that will determine the fate of Europe if such parties should succeed. One thing for sure, failure is not an option. While the performers might have a well balance of character both physically and mentally, the real red herring was when the script meanders into the realms of fantasy over accuracy.<br/><br/>In recent years Sir Churchill has been a popular historical character to portray with President Lincoln coming at a close second. From Brian Cox, to John Lithgow, from Michael Gambon to Robert Hardy and getting mention in high prolific movies like ""Dunkirk"", ""A United Kingdom"" and ""Viceroy's House"". Now it's time for Gary Oldman to step up to the front of the line to portray one of the greatest Prime Ministers in British history. From the looks of things, Mr. Oldman has molded himself in near perfect detail from the rounded jowls to the rich sonorous voice, Oldman's portrayal is the best one of the whole bunch.<br/><br/>Wright's film directs us to May of 1940 where ailing Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) declares he's resigning his position due to declining health while under pressure brought on by the Labour Party leader Clement Attlee (David Schofield). At first Chamberlain appoints Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) to take over, but felt he wasn't ready up to the task. Therefore, Chamberlain dig deep and appoints Churchill to replace him. In an awkward twist, we find that Churchill is not present to hear this announcement, with one MP whispering something made for some witty sarcastic banter. The dialogue used in Anthony McCarten's script provides the weak spots to ""Darkest Hour"" as he replaces a more reverent use of speech to more a more cynical humour that almost feels satirical over authentic. Another primary example stems from the somewhat estranged relationship between Churchill and his wife Clementine (a near-perfect Kristen Scott-Thomas) after one of his shouting matches to her, she responds by calling him ,""an insufferable, pig""!<br/><br/>Although Churchill is a stapled named in the history books when the subject of WWII comes to mind, almost like he's an immortal comic book hero of some sort, but in the end, he's still human and his decisions have not always been the smartest. But still he's weaker moments in history doesn't get enough mention. Take for instance the Gallipoli disaster come up time to time but is regarded as minor flaw when really it's anything but. Or even his angst-laden weekly get together with King George VI (a subtle performance by Ben Mendelsohn who lays low on the trademark stammer) who questions how he manages to hold a high position while consuming so much alcohol. His direct response, ""practice"".<br/><br/>And even though the witty banter is subtle hyperbole, it still has moments where it holds a place in remaining plausible. But the script can't seem to get a grip on the scenes and situations where Churchill is at his most vulnerable in the more challenging moments that occurred during the events of of WWII. Where the Nazis overthrow the smaller countries, the French army is losing it's battle, 400,000 Allied soldiers were deported to the French island of Dunkirk, where he's stuck in the war cabinet while Chamberlain and Halifax are persuading for him to make surrender with Germany, it's where the realism of the story meanders to fantasy territory. The most absurd moments was when King George pays a nightly visit to him while unprotected and unguarded who out of nowhere and without a reason arbitrarily takes his side to tell him to consult the people and ask for their approval. So after getting off an underground locomotive, he addresses to the people if he should surrender his fight and let Hitler take over. The crowd responses ""Never!"" and with that he read off a quote from Macaulay's ""Horatius"". All the while the train ride from St. James Park to Westminster seems to take 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Wright's awkward direction never fully recovers from the surrealism in spite of the acting that is truly top of the line. Ronald Pickup was truly amazing as the gaunt and ill Chamberlain (who would die six months later from cancer). Stephen Dillane was also quite impressive as Lord Halifax who has a vampire-like image towards him. Oldman delivers a powerful speech in the end with the ""we shall fight on the beaches"" but it's not very likely that he would be right there on the District Line."

","This film is a masterpiece in every respect, and I say that with a certain amount of surprise since it is the first of Joe Wright's films that I have liked unequivocally. I've not seen them all, but those that I have seen have always left me disappointed and frustrated. Not this time.<br/><br/>I went into DARKEST HOUR with high hopes and modest expectations. I hadn't seen any clips, but I'd seen pictures of Gary Oldman's prosthetics, and thought he looked a pretty decent Churchill, and of course the Oscar buzz was unavoidable. But nothing could prepare me for the superlative experience I've just had watching this extraordinary display of talent.<br/><br/>The Churchill prosthetics are far better than the pictures had led me to believe. Perfect in every detail, and without a single visible flaw - even in extreme close-up. And Oldman's performance was easily the finest of his career; a powerhouse tour de force which at several points left me breathless and deeply moved. It is no surprise that both Oldman and Lucy Sibbick won Oscars for Best Actor and Best Makeup respectively. Oldman also scooped the Best Actor awards from BAFTA, SAG, and the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, a generous scattering of veteran British talent, acquit themselves admirably and mostly hold their own when sharing screen time with Oldman. But his mesmerising, electric presence is all-consuming.<br/><br/>The screenplay is pitch-perfect, drawing copiously and unavoidably from Churchill's recorded words, with fine structuring and a strong sense of controlled crescendo; the narrative is compelling, dramatic and fraught, with a few scattered moments of levity and some nice scenes of doubt and introspection. But everything leads inevitably and inexorably to the climactic ""we shall fight them on the beaches..."" speech, which I found infinitely more powerful and moving than the real thing, thanks to the subtle emotional manipulation that I'd willingly undergone throughout the preceding couple of hours.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the direction.<br/><br/>I used to know Joe Wright. We played together as kids. His parents and mine were friends, and I spent many happy days of my childhood at their family business - a puppet theatre in Islington, London, where his mum used to keep me occupied for hours at a time while my mum and Joe's dad were working on recordings for the puppet shows. It was a blissful period of my life. So when I first noticed Joe's sudden and impressive rise as a movie director, I was very excited to see his work. But despite my best intentions, I just didn't enjoy his films. Some of them were very good, and they certainly impressed most other people. But I always had niggles about one thing or another, and just couldn't settle in to them.<br/><br/>Until now.<br/><br/>Wow! In Darkest Hour, Joe Wright has created a cinematic vision that is every bit as stunning as I had hoped. And more. It is a visual treat, with truly outstanding cinematography, and I've already expressed myself about Mr Oldman! In this film, I totally felt Joe's presence, stomping purposefully and, yes, even aggressively, through each scene, personified in Oldman's portrayal of Winston Churchill. I saw Joe's hand in every beautifully lit and composed shot; in the exquisite art direction; the flawless costume design; the rousing and powerful score; the punchy and dramatic editing. In every aspect of this astonishing movie I saw Joe Wright fulfilling his potential as a filmmaker. And somehow it now feels right and proper that it happened with this particular film, rather than any of the others. Because Churchill was the greatest leader our country has ever had. So I'm really glad Joe didn't bugger it up!"

And I could hear some people sigh the longer it went on. So while I didn't feel this was or rather is too long, I can understand if some people may not have the patience to really watch something like this for so long. If you are aware of that and critisize the movie for this, you are doing the movie a disservice and other potential viewers might not feel that way.<br/><br/>So while you can argue about the place in film history in general, you can't argue about the performances in this. The speeches could have gone wrong or backfired, but they didn't ... they actually made this really good. It's almost a shame quite a lot of it, is shown in the trailer"

But even if it wasn´t, it would still be worth to watch it only to witness the performance of this magnificent actor."
"zkonedog","6","1","4","18 March 2018"," All About Oldman's Performance
","Historical biopics are usually a genre that is right up my alley, as I love seeing historical places/events/people come to life on the big screen. I can't say that ""Darkest Hour"" is one of my favorites of the genre, but it does include an iconic performance from Gary Oldman (that I can say for sure).<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Darkest Hour"" tells the story of Winston Churchill's (Oldman) selection to become the Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1940, with Hitler's Germany having all but conquered the rest of Europe and now knocking on England's doorstep with a seemingly overwhelming force. Trapped between the appeasement talks that government officials want to pursue, and the hard-line stance he wishes to adopt, Churchill must somehow find the conviction to forge ahead and lead the country in one of it's truly darkest times.<br/><br/>The big draw here is the stunning performance of Oldman as Churchill. I'll confess that I am not a great scholar of Sir Winston, but from what I do now this seems to be an accurate portrayal of the figure. Visually it is probably the most stunning, as Oldman is utterly unrecognizable from his days as, say, Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Bat-trilogy or Sirius Black in Harry Potter. Every time Churchill's psyche is probed, that is when this film really, really ""works"", as his internal struggle is what makes the whole thing tick.<br/><br/>What I found to be lacking in the film, though, was a sense of something really new being accomplished in terms of plot. I know this is somewhat of an unfair burden to place on a film trying to be historically accurate, but I think the point still stands. In a year where Christopher Nolan released a film entirely devoted to the Dunkirk operation, those parts in this movie (which take up a decent chunk of time) seem dull by comparison. To be honest, I wish the film had focused more on Churchill's political leanings, as I thought that was where the really ""meaty"" stuff resided in the film. Preaching ""war in the face of peace/settlement"" (as Churchill did) is not a popular stance these days, and that is what (at times) really drew me into the narrative. I just wish that would have comprised more time.<br/><br/>For me, then, I think the reason why I can't consider ""Darkest Hour"" one of my favorite films is because it is set in a period (WWII) that has been ""done to death"", so to speak. I'm not saying that it still isn't a worthy period to probe, but rather that it is difficult to stumble upon new material while doing so. As a result, from ""Darkest Hour"" I mainly came away with Oldman's remarkable performance, as well as the thought of Churchill being pro-war when so many in his own government favored appeasement. That was easily enough to go no lower than 6/10 stars. The other four stars, however, were lost due to the fact that the other WWII fare in this film was pretty standard and never felt to me like it stood out from other materials I've seen before."
"r-h-m22","6","1","4","2 March 2018"," Lacks Depth
","The script is quite mediocre. If you don't already know the history of this story and what an icon Churchill was, then you might be impressed by this movie. For me personally, I had expected more depth and to learn more about the astonishing personality of Winston Churchill. The tacky sense of humor really killed the movie for me as I could not take it seriously afterwards. I believe the entire movie was focused on his speeches which they'd forcefully add much drama and effects to it to try to get you into him. The rest of the movie felt like a filler to be honest. <br/><br/>The only plus points go to Oldman for the amazing performance and to the make up team as they did a splendid job on him. I just wish the camera wasn't so up close to Gary during the whole entire movie. Okay, we get it, you're proud of the make up. Can we zoom out now please?<br/><br/>Lily's character was absolutely unnecessary to exist in th first place. <br/><br/>Overall, very weak writing/directing. It lacked the emotion and spirit Dunkirk had. And this movie was about the main man behind the entire Dunkirk rescue mission. It should've been stronger than this."
"ssapouna","6","1","4","1 March 2018"," Great film but full of lies
","The Director has chosen Churchill as the figure who represents the ""darkest hour"" of every person's life, the period of doubt when you know your decision is crucial and probably you might have to swim against the tide.
The cast, the cinematography, the claustrophobic atmosphere, everything was perfect. The problem is that W.Churchill is presented once again as a hero and as a man of the people which is completely wrong. He was a racist, an imperialist, the worst progeny of ""high british aristocracy"". He was a politician raised in, and formed by, the British Empire. Churchill succeeded in proving himself a man by those imperial standards, fighting in India and Sudan, helping the Spanish suppress Cuba's freedom fighters, and, after a brief South African parliamentary career, fighting in the Second Boer War. Churchill's promotion to home secretary came at a time of still-rising political turmoil in the United Kingdom: Irish struggles for Home Rule, Suffragism, strike waves. Churchill opposed them all violently.
He was a ferocious advocate of intervention to quell the Russian Revolution, and wrote furiously about the dangers of the ""International Jews"" (communists) and their ""sinister confederacy,"" against whom he invoked the far more acceptable ""National Jew"" (Zionism).""
The racist said: ""I do not admit that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America, or the black people of Australia . . . by the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race . . . has come in and taken its place.""
The war criminal who used for the 1st time in history chemical weapons (against the Bolsheviks and then against Iraq) said :""I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes""
Finally, in 1933 he praised Mussolini as 'the greatest lawgiver among men"". In 1935, Churchill expressed his ""admiration"" for Hitler and ""the courage, the perseverance, and the vital force which enabled him to . . . overcome all the . . . resistances which barred his path.""
I am writing all this because movies tend to educate people today. So, do your own research when it comes to history and enjoy the movie as it is, quite fictional."
"SmashandNasty","7","1","4","1 March 2018"," A good companion movie to Dunkirk
","During the early days of World War II, the fate of Western Europe hangs on the newly-appointed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler or fight on against incredible odds.<br/><br/>Our take: Watch it if you're into historical or political dramas, but watch Dunkirk if you're looking for an exciting, Oscar-Nominated film about WWII.
Post credit scene? No.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this year's Best Picture category contains two films that cover the same time in history. Actually, not just the same general period of time in history, but the months and days. Both Darkest Hour and Dunkirk follow the beginning of World War II, specifically the time around May of 1940.<br/><br/>However, the films cover two very separate aspects of the war. Unlike Dunkirk, this film does not contain a ton of action, it is definitely much more of a political drama. For that reason, this is not the average crowd-pleaser movie. But if you're a history buff, you can't miss this one. The script is tight, the narrative is gripping and at times the film is extraordinarily witty.<br/><br/>Oldman provides an Oscar-worthy performance in this film. He is completely unrecognizable as Churchill, and it's not just the prosthetics. From his mannerisms to his accent, he embodies Churchill better than anyone else has before. Even so, not enough can be said about how impressing and believable the prosthetics were in this movie.<br/><br/>Some may have issues with the female characters in the film. The truth is that Kristin Scott Thomas (as Clemmie Churchill) and Lily James (as Elizabeth Layton) are props in the film, with barely any backstory and are used just to serve the whims of men. As two female viewers, we did not have an issue with their portrayal. We came in knowing that this would be a biographical film about Churchill, and would feature a time when women did not have the rights they do today - we aren't expecting any more or any less.<br/><br/>Featuring... Ben Mendelsohn as probably the best King George VI we've ever seen. (Sorry Colin Firth.)<br/><br/>Also, a corgi brilliantly portraying the role of a Royal Corgi.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour picked up five nominations in addition to Best Picture: Best Actor in a Leading Role for Gary Oldman, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and Best Makeup. While it might not win Best Picture, we would be interested to see if anybody can take down Gary Oldman in his prime. And if Iron Lady (Meryl Streep's 2011 spin at British PM Margret Thatcher) can win best makeup, you better believe this can too."

","It's movies like this that are making me want to learn more about history, but please let me keep doing so through great films! I really enjoyed making connections to the stories and characters of other movies like Dunkirk, The King's Speech, and Atonement, and now I want to continue watching The Crown! Darkest Hour's highlights for me were storytelling, acting portrayals and creative camera angles!"
"DKosty123","8","1","4","17 February 2018"," Biographical Surprise
","This is a very well done Biographical film, which throws some critics for a loop as Biographies deserve a different type of rating versus other types of films. Well done bios can be entertaining, Patton being a best picture example. But usually Bios are more about acting and script than entertainment. Once again, Patton is a great example of those with George C. Scott in his greatest role.<br/><br/>Here might very well be Oldmans greatest role. He brings Churchill very much to life in the darkest hour of history. Especially interesting is the fact this films writer did not use a Biographical Novel to base this on. While that makes me wonder about the historic accuracy, but the film is so well done it is a pleasure to watch. The Director of ""The Theory of Everything"" does a great job with this one.<br/><br/>On the assumption it is all factually based, the film brings up important moments of history from Churchhill becoming Prime Minister in crisis to the Dunkirk rescue. There are brief references to Churchills failures in the past including India but this films focus is May, 1940. Oldman gets wonderful support from the cast with Mrs. Churchill, and his typist being very well played.<br/><br/>The story begs some questions. Today it is hard to imagine Nevill Chamberlain wanted to negotiate a British Surrender to Hitler in 1940. Yet it does fit with a diplomat whose career as Prime Minister was of trying to avoid the inevitable. His character and the alternative person to appointing Churchill are very well drawn here. The chaos Hitler brought upon the world is a stark picture.<br/><br/>The bonus here and surprise is Churchills ride in the London Subway prior to his dramatic speech. This scene might never have happened, but then again if it did, it would have been like this. This is unexpected but a perfect lead in to the finale. ""We will never surrender."""
"carlo_simone18","7","1","4","16 February 2018"," Great Work from Gary Oldman
","Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill truly makes this film. He effectively becomes the character, thus enhancing the viewing experience as we witness all of the man's insecurities, doubts and flaws, but most importantly his great determination and stubbornness, even if he's looked down upon by everyone around him. <br/><br/>I do like the fact that we see Chamberlain resigning and how that leads to Churchill's struggle in trying to gain acceptance within his own party and from the King, as well as trying to deal with the German forces breaking through mainland Europe which causes him great turmoil. Viscount Halifax is the main antagonist in this film trying to get Churchill to sue for peace, but his motivations are understandable for the situation.<br/><br/>In terms of production this is a splendid effort with assured direction from Joe Wright, with some satisfying cinematography and use of lighting to compliment that. There are also many strong performances aside from Oldman's with Ben Mendelsohn, Kristen Scott Thomas, Lily James and Stephen Dillane being particular examples of that.<br/><br/>There are some issues though as whilst the acting is strong, the actual characters aren't that interesting aside from Churchill himself. Also there is some flouting of historical accuracy (the scene on the tube seem quite contrived) but overall that wasn't a huge issue in the narrative. Therefore I would recommend this is a solid wartime drama that can also act as an accompanying piece to Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk."
"carlos37andre","9","1","4","15 February 2018"," A surprisely above the average ""biography"" film
","Ok, I know that this is not exactly an biography movie, but you know, it's the history of a short lifetime period of a real guy, who did great things, so it's in a way, a biography.<br/><br/>And, once again (like we get with Battle of Sexes) we have some really above the average biography here. I think that do a biography movie is something really tough to do, so not every director can, but here, Joe Wright does a great job.<br/><br/>The movie is very good, the approach of Churchill's life, and how the world simply fell on his shoulders in like two weeks is fantastic. It's also amazing to see, how ""weirdly"" this movie and Dunkirk in a way complete each other, every time they talked about Dunkirk, I ""knew"" how badly thing were back than. The conection, even thoght it was not something planned, is amazing.<br/><br/>So the script is pretty decent, the speeches are fantastic, and some Churchill's scenes are remarqueble. The acting is just stunning, Gary Oldman is a monster, there isn't another way to describe he in this role, the guy is a legend, give him an Oscar. But also, the supporting cast is extremely competent here, Lily James give us a solid performance, with such a charism, even though she hasn't many lines throught the movie. Ben Mendelsohn is great as King George, Stannis Baratheon (just kiding) is very good too. Anyway, you get it, the cast is awesome.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is ok, the montage is interesting, with some different styles, using like the calendar popping up on the screen, to show us how much time pass.<br/><br/>Probably the only issues that I have with the movie is regarding the filming style, I think that the movie is great shoot, but sometimes the director seems to go a little bit over the top in some scenes, like the close up in the hands of the boy, or some going back shoot of the top of a building, anyway, is just a little thing. Also I think that the overuse the ""motivation speech"" on Churchill's life, I don't know how much there is true (and this why is hard to judge) but every once in a while some one as to say some motivation words to him. Again, is not a big flaw, but those thing prevented the movie to be a 10/10 one for me.<br/><br/>In short, Darkest Hour is a great film, and deserves to be in the Oscar run. Gary Oldman gives the best performance from him that I ever saw. And one really big plus is the powerful and great history that the movie tells, one of the most important figures of mankind in modern times, for sure."
"cllmhpkns","8","1","4","14 February 2018"," Outstanding acting, with (mostly) great directing.
","Gary Oldman is outstanding as Winston Churchill, providing a captivating performance of Churchill's 'Darkest Hour'. For the most part Joe Wright does a great job will flashes of artistic brilliance in an effort to make the film special. Hitting this mark on the odd occasion, his desire to create something unique and special actually detracts from the main draw of the movie, Oldman's performance. As a result most of Churchill's dialogue is forgettable as it becomes less about the man and more about the reaction of the people around him- mainly the government and the British public. <br/><br/>Nevertheless it is still well worth the watch with one of Oldman's best performances on screen. 8/10"
"orlando-somera","9","1","4","12 February 2018"," I was expecting a sappy retelling of Churchill's heroics
","But I should have realized Gary Oldham is capable of lifting up an entire genre. Here he and his costar, Lily James, recreate the tension and dread that must have accompanied an impending invasion by the Nazis such that I was actually on the edge of my seat, despite knowing the story. That's quite an accomplishment for everyone involved.<br/><br/>And for anyone familiar with the historical Churchill who might have a hard time imagining his personal life, rest assured, you will not be bored or disillusioned. This movie is brilliant and I was in awe of Oldham throughout this moving portrait. In my opinion Gary Oldham deserves any award he's eligible for. I'd say the same about the direction which was on the same level as the acting, spot on as Brits might say.<br/><br/>I would not necessarily call myself an Anglophile but this movie does a lot to stoke my wanting to revisit the UK. That's totally unexpected giving my attitude going in."
"eddie_baggins","7","1","4","11 February 2018"," Oldman shines in this Churchill feature
","Death and taxes, the certainties in life, now have a friend; Gary Oldman the 2018 Best Actor Oscar winner.<br/><br/>Like the certainty of our ever encroaching end, there is no chance that well-respected British icon Gary Oldman won't be walking away from this year's Oscar's ceremony without a golden statue for his mantelpiece for his stunning and tour-de-force performance as esteemed English prime minister Winston Churchill.<br/><br/>Dominating Joe Wright's dialogue heavy and rather intimate study of the Prime Minister in a very specific time of his life, when he was ushered into the role of England's leader in the heat of German's attack on Europe and in particular England's potentially disastrous Dunkirk situation, Oldman disappears under brilliant prosthetics and make-up and truly becomes Churchill in a turn that shows the iconic figure as a man with a wickedly dark sense of humour, a stoic determination to do what he feels is best and most tellingly, a man that feels the pain and pressure to lead a country in its most bleak time of need.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour will not satisfy those seeking an expansive examination of Churchill's upbringing or those seeking war time spectacle but for those looking to get an insight into Churchill's mindset and to get a feel for a man that played such a big part in the greatest war we've ever seen, Darkest Hour will hold your attention throughout and leave you at times breathless from Oldman's turn.<br/><br/>Narrowing his focus onto but a few weeks of Churchill's reign and in particular three key speeches the Prime Minister made in the month of May of 1940, Wright's film isn't anything ground-breaking but thanks to Oldman and some key supports, Darkest Hour is one of the rare modern movies that thrives purely off its actors without the usual modern pizazz taking centre stage.<br/><br/>Surrounded by quality supports such as Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's beloved wife Clemmie, Baby Driver standout Lily James as Churchill's typewriting assistant Elizabeth Layton and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, with whom Oldman shares some delightfully awkward scenes with, Darkest Hour is truly an acting showpiece with some added well-established production design and bigger budget sensibilities, assuring that Wright's film feels like more than just a jazzed-up BBC event.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though all else within Darkest Hour matters little in comparison to Oldman, very much the captain of this particular cinematic ship, Oldman is the key ingredient to this feature and the reason as to why Darkest Hour has found itself a key part of this year's awards season.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>While there's nothing particularly special about Darkest Hour outside of a well-trimmed script and some fine acting supports, there's something undeniably magical about Oldman's portrayal of Churchill that will go down as one of the most impressive lead turns of the modern movie era and the quintessential embodiment of one of the most iconic political figures of all time.<br/><br/>3 ½ wrongly executed hand gestures out of 5"
"classicsoncall","9","1","4","5 February 2018"," ""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.""
","It's almost incomprehensible to consider that one man could have such a singular impact, not only on the direction of his country but on that of the entire world. Just consider, had Churchill not stood fast (and he did have his moment of doubt), England would eventually have succumbed to Hitler's tyranny, and virtually the whole of Europe might have been speaking German today. By contrast, Viscount Hallifax (Stephen Dillane) and Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) appear almost like traitors in retrospect, though in their hearts I believe that THEY believed they were doing the right thing by their country. What I didn't expect to see in the story was Winston Churchill's brand of humor, often sarcastically applied but generally effective for the situation. Gary Oldman's portrayal is one for the ages; if you compare his regular features to those of the man he represents here, or to many of the other characters he's portrayed (Lee Harvey Oswald in ""JFK"", Bram Stoker's ""Dracula""), it's virtually impossible to tell it's the same actor. His transformation into the British wartime Prime Minister is simply remarkable.<br/><br/>""Darkest Hour"" also has an exceptional supporting cast. In addition to Dillane and Pickup, Kristin Scott Thomas is admirable in the role of Churchill's wife Clemmie, steady as a rock and unwavering in defense of her husband's resolve. Ben Mendelsohn is effective as King George, and though somewhat understated, Lily James was a fine choice as Churchill's secretary, Elizabeth Layton. What this all amounts to for awards season I'm not quite sure as I haven't seen all the principal contenders yet, but as a history buff I'd like to think this film has a good shot at some of the major awards. One ought to consider watching this one in tandem with this year's ""Dunkirk"", the wartime event that played a central role in this story, though for my money, this was the superior movie."

These two are the main characters through whom we get to catch glimpses of what the great Churchill might have been actually like in real life.<br/><br/>But this is where the must-see ends, I'm afraid. ""Darkest Hour"" was produced with 2017/18's awards season in mind, with the typical shortcomings of such kind of ""prestige project"".<br/><br/>Meaning that the story is shallow and concentrates mostly on showing aged Churchill shambling around like a cigar-, alcohol- and bacon-loving zombie, not on what exactly makes him such a legend of historical figure.<br/><br/>Yes, just seeing the great man is nice, and would make a great sketch, or short movie, or even a supporting character in some other movie. But for a screen story lasting over two hours, this approach feels like a one-trick-pony who's exhausted before the end of the journey.<br/><br/>There's some but not enough explanations, be it through saying or showing, what exactly is so special about Winston Churchill, neither as a human being or politician being able to convince Great Britain to stand up instead of surrendering to Nazi threat.<br/><br/>Based on his great speech in the end, I didn't even buy him winning all the other leaders over. So, I'd conclude that the movie is a bit underwhelming as a whole, and the leading man alone can't quite remedy that.<br/><br/>For me, director Joe Wright's works have always been more about interesting story and good actors than enough nuance to make them really memorable. And this is true in ""Darkest Hour"" case too.<br/><br/>Having said that, Oldman and his performace are good drawing cards for sure. It's a award-winning turn, and steady show from veteran thespian who doesn't need to prove anything anymore.<br/><br/>Oldman's greatest artistic achievement here is ability to bring out two sides of Churchill: an old and tired geezer who's most comfortable in the company of food, drink and smoke AND powerful orator and politican who has not lost his strengths to withering body and mind just yet.<br/><br/>The make-up and hairstyling used to make Oldman look older can't - and are not meant to - hide the sharp, ferocious, wolf-like energy still ticking behind the crumbling facade.<br/><br/>During the moments when it shines through, we get the best of him on screen, and the best of the performance. There's only a small problem of having to wait about 50 minutes to see any of that. The first act of the movie is satisfied on showing just how cool is to see Oldman as Churchill instead.<br/><br/>There's nothing inherently wrong with a movie being made with awards season in mind, or being based on one strength. But it should last less: there's simply not enough interesting content to justify 126 minutes' running time.<br/><br/>""Darkest Hour"" has been nominated for six Oscars, including best movie, actor (Oldman), make-up and hair, cinematography, costume design, production design.<br/><br/>Oldman and make-up department seem to have strong chance of winning, especially considering the veteran thespian turns 60 soon and has been nominated for Oscar only once so far (with ""Tinker Tailor..."")."

","9 May 1940; in the fog of war Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is struggling with the immense task of trying to contain the ever growing threat of Nazi Germany and their destruction of Western Europe. Calls are made for him to resign and he does so and he asks Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) to take his place. Halifax declines and eventually Chamberlain proposes to the King that Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) takes his place as he is a popular choice with the opposition. Churchill accepts the position and has the difficult task of deciding whether to broker a peace deal with Germany or go on the offensive in what proves to be his Darkest Hour...<br/><br/>Gary Oldham was nominated for best actor for his portrayal as Winston Churchill and after watching this film I can see why. He really does become Churchill - yes you could argue that the bodysuit and all the prosthetics helped to achieve this effect, but Oldman's convincing portrayal and the way he gets into character do go a long way in making the film work. Director Joe Wright working from Anthony McCarten's script does a solid job here too; the film does move along reasonably well and it rarely felt padded out or repetitive. The film also has many powerful moments (many of which are between Halifax and Churchill whose approaches to war are polar opposites). One other thing I liked is that both director and screenwriter gave the film some light-hearted and humourous moments which is always nice to see - it may have got a bit boring if it was serious the whole time.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the balance approach that was given to the material; we all know that Churchill was a great prime minister, but it's nice to see that he was represented as being a flawed prime minister. At the start of the film, Churchill is portrayed as a miserable old curmudgeon who takes the job out of a sense of duty rather than desire, but as time progresses he shows his worthiness as a leader.<br/><br/>There is one scene in the film where Churchill is riding on a tube to Westminster when he starts to strike up conversations with various passengers. I'm unsure whether this actually happened - (I'm leaning towards a no personally). Regardless of whether it did or didn't happen it was a powerful moment as it highlighted Churchill as being a man of the people and also showed that he had the backing of the public.<br/><br/>The only other thing I'd like to add is that this film focuses on Churchill's strategy and planning in trying to quell Hitler's dominance in Western Europe. The film has very little action in it and the scenes of war are also rather limited (in other words those that prefer their war films with more action are probably advised to look elsewhere). However, if you're not put off by lack of action and are interested in World War 2 history then The Darkest Hour ticks enough boxes to make it worthwhile."

","When I saw the first image of Gary Oldman in the make-up as Winston Churchill, it is was quite impressive to see, however it didn't prepare me for the performance that he was going to give.<br/><br/>This film gambles hugely on the performance and interpretation of Winston Churchill by Gary Oldman, the film as a whole can only stand up if this works. Wow just wow is this spectacular to say the least, mind you the film makers probably had a good sigh of relief. That is not to say that I had any doubt in Oldman as an actor he is one of the greatest actors of all time, no its just the enormity of the task of portraying the most recognisable person in British history. There is a lot of pressure and a lot of people watching, Oldman pulls it off and in some style, some truly brilliant scenes and monologues. Breath-taking, personally for me the most outstanding performance of 2017 and definitely deserves an Oscar! <br/><br/>Also a special mention should go to the supporting cast in the film as well, everyone has been cast extremely well in the film. Lily James was very good as Churchill's ""typist"", I have no idea what her job title was, didn't do a lot but thats the point, did have some good scenes with Oldman. Ben Mendelsohn was perfectly cast as King George VI , accent was very good throughout and performed the awkward relationship with Churchill very nicely. Kristin Scott Thomas and Stephen Dillane were very good in there roles also. Lastly a mention for Ronald Pickup who was also very good as Neville Chamberlain.<br/><br/>Weirdly even though this film has, personally, the best male performance of the year and is cast and acted extremely well across the board, the rest of the film is just good. The film starts off alright and is help by the acting but it now and then just drifts off and becomes a bit hit or miss really. Don't get me wrong there is nothing bad about this film, however the performances are pretty much the only outstanding part of it. Which of course in some ways is the most important part however I do feel as if the technical side of the film was not to the same standard. <br/><br/>Overall though this film is good 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, the best performance of 2017 and one the best performances in recent times. Gary Oldman 100% cemented as an all time great, personally, deserves that Oscar cant see how he cant win it really. All the other cast members are really good also, unfortunately though the rest of the film is a little behind in standard nothing bad or wrong just expected a bit more. There is one strange thing with this film, it works so much better when you watch ""Dunkirk"" by Christopher Nolan before. Trust me everything that is said in ""Darkest Hour"" means so much more!!"

","""Darkest Hour"", an account of Winston Churchill's premiership in the few weeks before the evauation from Dunkirk in May 1940, can be seen as complementary to two other recent films: ""Dunkirk"" by director Christopher Nolan and ""Churchill"" with Brian Cox in the eponymous role. It may be a coincidence that all three works have appeared since the British people (narrowly) voted to leave the European Union, but each of them seems to intended remind us that historically this country has (sadly) always been insular both geographically and politically.<br/><br/>As cinema, ""Darkest Hour"", directed by Joe Wright (""Atonement"") and scripted by Anthony McCarten (""The Theory Of Everything""), is an absolute treat. There are some very artful visual compositions and techniques but, above all, this film is made by its actors. <br/><br/>A barely recognisable Gary Oldman is simply brilliant as Churchill, conveying powerfully all the varied emotions for which this this complex (and controversial) character is known. This tour de force portrayal deserves all the awards which it will undoubtably win. But the support roles are also quality, notably Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, Ronald Pickup and Stephen Dilane as the appeasers Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily James as the women - wife Clementine and secretary Miss Layton respectively - who calm the volcano that is the new PM.<br/><br/>As history, however, ""Darkest Hour"" has some serious weaknesses, especially because of something that is not shown and something that is presented as pivotal to the glorious finale. <br/><br/>The missing element of the story is the recognition that Churchill was not alone in opposing a peace settlement with Hitler; his Labour ministers - led by Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood (who have tiny roles in this film) - were equally determined to fight on. The scene to which one has to take great exception shows Churchill taking the London Underground and seeking the views of fellow travellers who conveniently are a cross section of the popuation but all back resistance to the Nazis. Not only did this incident never happen; it is quite frankly unthinkable and spoils what is otherwise an informative and gripping account of a huge turning point in British history."

"snakekeeper-11956","9","1","4","14 January 2018"," Intimate period of WW2
","Even if ""The Second World War"" 2000-page volume was never a matter of your passionate interest, ""Darkest hour"" is among the most important and involving biographic dramas over the last years. Joe Wright and Gary Oldman took advantage of a close private three-week story of Mr. Churchill to depict an intimate period of British and world history. Years of 1930-s politics of compromises, nine months of a new World War and future European priorities. All of this revealed by means of few shots of battlefields, a shelter-map with scratches and facial expression of Sir Winston. The Big War is brought up with an introspective standpoint. <br/><br/>""Darkest hour"" disposes only three weeks of home politics, which has succeeded in locking the story and perception focus on limited locations, historical figures, but at the same time, on multiple privately-held events of importance. Scene-by-scene progressive tension and Sisyphean Labor of a Prime Minister forms a sense of political suspense on the issue. Your tree of historical knowledge, after all, will not be essential to satisfy the process. Even events done may cause intrigue and positive anxious forestate. <br/><br/>We generally sensitive to perceive a story told insofar as our attitude to the protagonist. Gary Oldman has done much more than just got used to the layers of make-up. Throughout these weeks of May 1940, Churchill reinvents himself both as a historical figure and a particular movie character. Towards the end of the second hour a serving dish or our sympathy to this characterful person is being mixed with tones of another emotions. In particular, a sense of personal dignity and our social demand for justice. Herein, the movie expresses a hint of comedian charm and irony. Living history of men and women without artificial sadness. A story about people who argue, hate, have doubts, love, afraid and admit mistakes.<br/><br/>*8.5 of 10*"
"maurice_yacowar","5","1","4","12 January 2018"," Oldham's great performance plays Churchill as Trump
","British Director Joe Wright has admitted his replay of Churchill is relevant to current America: The director claims to be heartened by the growing resistance to the president's increasing tyranny. 
 But the connection is deeper and more troublesome. Wright's Churchill is specifically inflected into a figure of Trump populism. The film is a defence of Trump. As no responsible person could say Trump is Churchillian, Gary Oldman's - however brilliant - performance serves to reduce Churchill to Trump. 
 The most serious malfeasance is the PM's visit to the London Underground. On the brief trip to the next station, Westminster, Churchill meets a carload of Ordinary Citizens, overcomes their awe, learns their names, cracks a few jokes, finds out about them, and hears their full-throated rejection of any peace over war against Hitler. He learns the voiceless citizenry happen to agree with him!
 The encounter reverses Churchill's decision to join the freedom-sacrificing pacifiers. Instead he stands firm, rallies the government and - spoiler alert- five years later defeats the Nazis. 
 The underground scene is not based in Churchill's real life at all. Instead it derives from Shakespeare's Henry V, when on the eve of Agincourt Hal walks incognito among his motley army connecting to his roots and drawing strength from them. 
 Wright's version is stilted and dangerous. Instead of poetry and sincerity it seems like an animated Communist poster, all the faces radiant and of one heart and mind to risk a nations' population in an uncertain war. Indeed in this idealistic vision the one black man on the train - indeed, in the film, and possibly in the England of that time - can complete Churchill's classic poetic quotation. 
 This truly ""fake"" scene portrays Churchill as a populist, just like our Donnie! He alone knows what The People want, hears their needs and resolutely serves their purpose in the face of conventional politics and against the elite (the class he of course enjoys). 
 Even the Churchill traits here that have historic basis are by that fake scene mobilized to present Churchill as the Trump kind of leader. As a serial flip-flopper, he's rejected by his own party. He's bullying, impatient and insulting to his staff. His career is pocked with spectacular failures, with Gallipoli standing in for Trump's many - of course, personally profitable - bankruptcies. He takes corrective advice from his First Lady, the fashionably done-up Clementine evoking the combo Melanka. Where others operate by knowledge and principle, he goes by his - here prosthetic - gut.
 His daily 4 p.m. nap evokes Trump's sliver of a work-day that punctuate his golf breaks. In fact, Churchill worked two full days every day by taking an extra sleep, shower and breakfast within each 24-hour period. This Churchill's explanation - ""I work late"" - doesn't cover that. It instead shows Churchill Trump-like in seeming to be lazy by grabbing an extra break.
 In short, this Churchill serves to valourize a leader who in these surface particulars is like Trump: quirky, disliked, a political outsider, unpredictable (to the point of frightening the king), but with a preternatural dedication to and insight into The People. 
 What's omitted is the very essence of Churchill, everything that distinguishes him from Trump: his massive education and scholarship, his brilliant research, his idealistic, humane eloquence, his long and varied political experience and his rock-solid moral character. Sure, if you set aside all the ways Churchill was the antithesis to Trump, then you can make Trump seem like another Churchill, an outsider populist unfairly maligned by everyone with sense and responsibility, who are here played as treasonous cowards. 
 Wright's Churchill goes wrong in another scene. Churchill knew his Shakespeare. Churchill would NEVER say ""Lead on, Macduff."" The verb is ""lay on,"" as in hand to hand (not Trump's foot in mouth) combat.
 This undercurrent may explain the film's weird opening shots: the Nazi army and military equipment in massive uniform array. In bringing us into the action, the element Wright chooses to characterize the time is not landscape, city or characters, but the threat of a war. The images connote Little Rocket Man. 
 The first reference to Churchill is the shot of his empty seat in parliament. Under the threat of war, the leadership is a vacancy into which the people's saviour will by our good fortune slip. However unpopular, unconventional, unattractive, he will prove the right man at the right time and place. Really.
 As the film opens on the Nazi threat, it closes on the Churchillian resolution. And of course it's another distortion. ""He mobilized the English language and sent it off to war"" was not the wisdom of Lord Halifax but of Edward Murrow, later quoted by John Kennedy. But why quibble at misrepresentation and more egregious lies when it's in service of a larger (or in this case, ""fake"") truth?"
"stevendbeard","7","1","4","8 January 2018"," Movie Critics Will Love It
","I saw ""Darkest Hour"", starring Gary Oldman-The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Dark Knight Rises; Lily James-Baby Driver, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies; Ben Mendelsohn-Rogue One:A Star Wars Story, The Dark Knight Rises and Kristen Scott Thomas-Only God Forgives, The Horse Whisperer.
This movie covers about a month's length of time in 1940 when Winston Churchill became the British Prime Minister. Gary plays Winston and does a great job, with the help of some good make up and padding-I can see Oscar nominations in his future because critics love this kind of stuff. Gary is very convincing in his portrayal, covering Winston's mannerisms, heavy drinking, smoking and his unpredictability-he actually would scare people, intentionally or not, including even the King of England. Ben plays the King. Kristin is Gary's wife and Lily plays the secretary that follows Gary around and gets to type all of his speeches, sometimes in awkward places. I enjoyed the scene where Gary rides a subway with regular English people and he asked them about how they felt about the war and Hitler. It also covers more of the background and wheelings & dealings behind the famous evacuation of Dunkirk-just recently seen in the movie, 'Dunkirk'. I enjoyed the humor, too, but I must admit, this is not my favorite type of movie. I prefer more action and this one lacks in that department. But, as I've said many times before, people are different and they like different types of movies, so I'm sure there are people that will like this one better than I did-FYI: I didn't really care that much for 'Dunkirk', but lots of people loved it.
It's rated ""PG-13""for thematic material and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would make a good rental if you are interested in the material."

It manages to make the politics and backroom struggles engaging and exciting without any war battles."
"neil-476","7","1","5","1 May 2018"," Performances are better than the film
","Winston Churchill becomes Prime Minister because he is the only candidate who will be accepted by the opposition at a time when the country desperately needs war leadership. The country is facing military disaster and there is great pressure for a negotiated peace with Hitler's fascist regime.<br/><br/>This revisitation of the short period between Churchill's appointment and seizing triumph from near tragedy at Dunkirk is fairly well travelled ground but is, for the most part, well presented here. I wasn't too sure about Churchill consulting a cross section of the general public (including a fairly unrepresentative for 1940, but politically correct for 2018, coloured gentleman) on a single stop on the District Line which lasted about 5 times longer than it should have done), but it was an attractive conceit. The period feel overall was good.<br/><br/>And the cast was excellent. Lily James came across well as a young secretary, and I greatly liked Ben Mendelsohn as George VI. Most convinced visually when they needed to, and it was clear that much care had been taken to make Gary Oldman look like Churchill.<br/><br/>There tend to be two approaches to the visual side of actors playing well-known historical figures. The first is ""It's all about the performance"" ie. if there is truth in the performance then it doesn't matter about the resemblance. The second is when effort is taken to ensure a high degree of resemblance in a performance which is a close impersonation. Oldman here does both. He looks like Churchill and he captures most of the key speech mannerisms (his voice is, perhaps, not as gruff as Churchill's). He also delivers a convincing- and entertaining - performance.<br/><br/>This film is, perhaps, not as good as it's being made out to be, but it's not at all bad, and has some excellent performances in it."

","When i went to see this movie, i thought it can be a ""boring"" movie but no! The main interest of this film is purely historical about how Churchill chose to resist while other wanted to negotiate with the Nazis. Gary Oldman played very well the role of the prime minister of that time( Churchill) both in his moods and his doubts! The scenario isn't too original ( this is normal, we can't change the history) but allows me to better understand the history of England during the beginning of the Second World War. It's a great lesson in management and humanity that this film gives us.This movie impressed me, it allowed me to realize that the story might be different with another leader than Churchill.

If nothing else, the movie is forcing me to the history books to brush up on a few things. I won't spoil the movie by going into detail.<br/><br/>One thing that I was screaming at the screen over: The movie needs subtitles for the important players. One cannot assume that the person they're looking at in the 2nd scene is Neville Chamberlain just because he kinda looks like Neville Chamberlain. And who knows what the other players in history look like. I really wanted to know who was speaking and what was their role in the government at the time.

"MarcSchmarc","9","1","5","18 February 2018"," A great Churchill
","I read an immense amount of history. I've also read just about everything that's been written about, or by Churchill. So I was reticent about this film going in, and not in the least in wondering how in the world Gary Oldman could possibly take on the role. Not that as an actor he would be incapable, but that he simply is so far from the physiognomy. I guess I'm really out of touch with what makeup artists are capable of these days. The result was immediately believable and the rest was pure story telling. As some have noted, there are moments the script strays. It's perfectly acceptable to have moments of humor and personal reflection, but they began too seem too punctual, as though we needed reminding of the humanity within the unfolding of terrible events ... somewhat like how calibrated novels repeat certain types of scenes every 50 pages. That said, this is a tremendously good movie, both enjoyable and while telescoping and using movie-making liberties (Churchill knew exactly what he was doing, when he flashed a reversed V sign), it is a faithful rendering of the knife-edge a danger the world was in, and how Churchill rode above the politics of the time, and showing why one man, alone, making the difficult choices others can't or won't make, makes the difference. And goes down in History. A movie about real heroism of another sort."

One by one the countries gave in and Britain took a stand something Neville Chamberlain the former Prime Minister was unable to do. Everyone remembers his visit to appease Hitler which only led to Hitler stating afterwards England is ours as Chamberlain came across as a weakling. By contrast, Churchill is handed a lose situation and gives it a go only to reach a point where when you are watching this movie, you want to stand -up or at least grip the armchair of his famous words of fighting to the death than give-in. It rouses one to the heights and it di that precisely back then.

"surajrajeshchelat","9","1","5","26 January 2018"," Gary Oldman is sure to oust you out from your seats on intense outbursts; Joe Wright has done it all in a conventional way, delivering an outright classic.
","The Second World War is at its height; the system has fallen and Britain is at its Darkest Hour. Chamberlain has stepped down from the Big Chair, Halifax refuses to take over the reins, and the focus obviously shifts to a man who they believe can win most hearts; a flawed man who's known widely for his strange habits and fitting eloquence, a man who lives upto the reputation he upkeeps-none but one of the greatest Leader-Orators the world has ever had a taste of-Winston Churchill. At the darkest of hours, he takes over the reins, when the country is torn apart by tensions and turmoils; the heading members of the coalition government are against him; it's not by choice they chose him, but due to the lack of a sumptuous alternative. And against their wishes, the Man isn't of the kind who'd give heed to peace-mongers; to win something, you'll have to fight it out he believes. He loves his country and respects its traditions, but his attempts to keep the flag waving high gather wide resentment from among his own colleagues. The Great Leader is presented with an intensified inner conflict, than the outward political drama which is going on. He knows that each of his decisions from now on will count, and not only won't it be a smooth sail, but one demanding more bread than his life indeed!!!<br/><br/>It's such a well known story, with multiple underlying aspects to it. Joe Wright, the man who made 'Atonement', chose to make a movie on this one in particular, because he knew how far elucidative and reverberatory a story he could tell on this one. He has managed to rip of multiple perspectives on the same, besides the Great Man demanding a constant centre stage; the movie focuses on the view points of Clementine Churchill, King George VI, Halifax, Chamberlain, Eliza Nel Churchill's personal secretary, and more importantly that of free citizens, as much as it focuses on The British Bulldog. The word 'Dark' is given paramount importance in the whole method of storytelling; most of the drama happens in dark rooms and unlit alleys, and within the brooding darkness of a perplexed mind, Churchill has always housed. They never liked him from Gallipoli; the film rectifies some common beliefs and misconceptions too. Some of his iconic speeches have been featured in the movie, and the arresting flow of visuals blended with a storming performance by Gary Oldman is sure to oust you out from your seats on intense outbursts. Gave me goosebumps, literally.<br/><br/>Portraying Churchill, Gary Oldman's is an expression par excellence. Besides impersonating Churchill to the maximum possible extent, in appearance, gait as well as strange poses, he has manifested the essential character of the Man under study, to astounding results. He looks like a Churchill in the eyes, in deeds and posture; even in silhouettes!!! As far as an actor is concerned, he must make the rest feel nothing about his acting at all; at least until the movie ends. I never saw a trace of Oldman in this movie; all I saw was Churchill, who I even took to believe could've replaced the real one. Such a profound feat! Brilliance is the word. Churchill was not only a man famous for his leadership, looks and behaviour, but also for his strong words. The modulation that Oldman has brought about, combined with the strict control he has kept, gives us one of this year's countable performances which will make the Big Race soon. As of now, I'll say it's Oldman; have to watch Phantom Thread more to judge on that one completely! At one instance Churchill says at the peak of his screen tension, ""You cannot reason with a Tiger when your head is in its mouth."" Oldman will make us wonder which side Churchill meant himself to be in; he has both the tiger as well as a fearing doe in his face there!!!<br/><br/>The movie is all about inner conflicts, the mind's darkness; it also brings in unheard details about the Great Man. It shows even the great Winston Churchill had stuttered on many occasions, before presenting some of his iconic pieces. The movie was made the same year we had another Dunkirk movie by Nolan; 'Darkest Hour' presents a whole lot of unseen perspective on Operation Dynamo and Churchill's hardbound decisions. There's even a subtle nod to the hasty 'naming ceremony' of the whole operation. There's another great scene where he makes a call to the Whitehouse, asking for help and reinforcements to defend his country; 'Franklin Roosevelt' on the other end is shown as a helpless voice, while the effective drama is taking place in Churchill's face and his head, not to leave out the darkness enveloping his private recess. The movie starts of where the darkness has just crept inside the Men's souls, wounded with fear and ends off on a resolutive high. It shows the ordeals that the Great Leader had to surpass to reach there, the new channels he had to break open towards it. Instead of focusing on the general victory, it dwells and swings inside a perplexed heart; which had to think a great deal in pain, before making an anyway detrimental decision at this hour, with the least harm assured. The age too wasn't favourable for him; Thanks to Oldman's acting expertise, all these details subtly flow. It also has its funny moments; gives some trivial confirmation on the iconic man's strangest ways. His wits were impeccable, as was his uncontrollable rage!<br/><br/>Joe Wright has done it all in a conventional way, delivering an outright classic. The Drama is so intense, and rich with emotions; and it's as riveting as the peachiest entertainment flick there is, running in town. A very well written screenplay by Anthony McCarten, and a dashing score by Dario Marianelli has rightly contributed to its ebbs and flows. A really well made movie on one of the most adored figures from History, a ripe man who was always young at Heart and eloquent in speech, 'Darkest Hour' is easily a must watch. Quoting Halifax from the end of the movie-""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""!!!"

Gary Oldman's character detested by fellow parliamentarians is the desired choice of the titular Prime Minister during the month of May's darkest hours. Though thought to be the scapegoat on the onset of forceful resignation of Chamberlain, Oldman shows signs of being able and yet an ordinary human being with his trademark glass of whiskey for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Saved from being muddled by the English outcry and King's evident hatred for him, it is Clementine who stands by him like a rock as the dotting wife and the first lady to the iron headed Prime Minister. <br/><br/>
Scenes of important military decisions being stagecrafted by him in the bathroom, expected English sarcasms thrown during conversations with his young and desperate-to-prove herself typewriter and Oprahesque Radio speeches make the film a true winner. <br/><br/>

","Gary Oldman lived and breathed Winston Churchill and his charisma carried the entire movie. This was such a monumental time in Churchill's life, yet it took place over less than two weeks. At first glance, one might think that the title was referring to England's darkest hour, but the subtext of the film is that it was actually showing Churchill's darkest hour, where he was riddled with self-doubt as well as opposition from people who should have been his allies. Despite his belief that surrendering to Hitler would only make things worse, people were dying day after day and it seemed that the only option that wouldn't result in annihilation was to negotiate with the tyrant. In the end though, it wasn't the pressure of politicians or concern over his reputation that caused Churchill to choose to keep fighting against overwhelming odds. It was the opinions of ordinary people. Which brings me to my favourite scene in the movie. I don't know if it's historically accurate or not, but the scene on the train shows us what a kind-hearted, funny, likeable and humble guy Churchill was. He joked around with normal people whilst also asking for their advice, even to the point where he treated a little girl as though her opinion held weight. As Sirius Black once said (not in the Harry Potter movies unfortunately, only the books, but this is a nod to another of Gary Oldman's characters) ""If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals"". Churchill treated his inferiors with just as much respect as he would treat the King of England. He had his flaws, such as his habit of mumbling and short temper, but he had the spirit of a man who believed not only in freedom, but in equality. Churchill's speech at the end of the movie, though I can't quote it line for line, was incredibly passionate as he let go of his insecurities and forged ahead in his quest to defeat Hitler and establish himself as one of the greatest leaders England has ever seen. Not for himself, not for his reputation - hell if England lost the war, his reputation (which already had some stains) would be destroyed and Churchill knew that - but for the freedom of his country."

","Glad to take a break from all the cheap superheros sagas and go back to enjoy real cinema. As a sober, yet humorous and emotional depiction of a giant figure of modern western history, Darkest Hour delivers 2 hours of delightful cinema work. In the center of this English jewel the performance of Gary Oldman is a little less than epic. The veteran British actor has played some famous and difficult characters before (Beethoven, Sid Vicious and Vlad the Impaler) but I dare to say this time we got the real thing. Winston Churchill was simply back from the beyond, his spirit channeled through the body and the work of Mr Oldman. Recently we have had the chance to see some other major historic personalities brought to life by the magic of cinema, being Thatcher and Lincoln perhaps the most notable examples. Now you can add Churchill to this list, and put the name of Gary Oldman along with exceptional actors like Meryl Streep and Daniel Day Lewis.<br/><br/>This is a solid work in the old tradition of English cinematography. Outstanding acting, marvelous script, accurate editing and pleasant photography are some of the features that make Darkest Hour nothing less than a masterpiece.

"eagandersongil","8","1","5","15 January 2018"," Gary Oldman's film
","Experienced Joe Wright makes a solid, historical and preemptively bibliographic film, although at some point the film's handling is dangerous, luckily Joe Wright manages to support his narrative Gary Oldman's fine acting and competent technical direction. The script counts from days before Churchill to be appointed prime minister until moments before the withdrawal of the soldiers in Durquique, the first act is very good and develops the character well, already the second and third are very embolados, although not a third of because we saw only the tip of the iceberg that Churchill faced in order to save England from the Nazi threat that had dominated Eastern Europe, and the film's conclusion comes just when England will once again put itself in the conflict, praiseworthy, because we all know the story, but few of us know the lines between the beginning of it. Joe Wright assumes that we all know of the events of World War II and so it accelerates history, embodies acts and gives no chance to the viewer to blink. An extremely dark photograph, a diversity in the use of light, open angles, narrative mirrors and a good soundtrack are part of the technical aspect of the film, and all of them are competent, perhaps the editing leaves something to be desired, but it's more the script's fault than itself. Gary Oldman understands his character, and acts, maybe he does not live his character in the essence, or maybe we do not notice it because of Churchill being extremely caricature, but Oldman with the course of the film ends up engulfing, and ends up becoming bigger than by Joe Wright, we will have a sure indication to Oscar for Gary Oldman. Finally, in general terms, we can say that ""The destiny of a nation"" is an average film, but that by the performances, characterizations and photography, ends up being a little above the average, but it is probable that it does not stand nor between the films more the first quarter of 2018."

","This is indeed Gary Oldman's best movie. I suppose it's not so much that he is great at playing Churchhill it's more of the fact that he carries the entire film and Oldman is up for the challenge. He carries the entire film almost all by himself and he does a marvellous job at it. His voice, his walk, his jokes, and his expressions are 100% spot on for playing Winston Churchill!We can both see why he is getting nominated for all these awards. Brilliant performance and highly recommended film. The support cast such as Lily James and Ben Mendelssohn as King George were also good, but It's Oldman who carries the movie. Gary Oldman is going home with the Oscar! 4/5 stars. Jay And Nick- The Autistic Reviewers."

","Although lacking a little in excitement, this war drama is has impeccable direction, hugely engaging dialogue and cements Gary Oldman as one of the greatest actors working today. His performance as Winston Chuchill is nothing short of outstanding and well worth the ticket price alone!"
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","5","14 January 2018"," Insightful and engrossing political biopic.
","With over 60 depictions in film, television and theatre, Winston Churchill is a historical figure not short on visual portrayals. Only last year John Lithgow won an Emmy for his turn as the former British PM in Netflix series The Crown, whilst the well-received film Churchill explored the few days leading up to the invasion at Normandy. So can Joe Wright's political period piece offer something fresh on Churchill in what is fast becoming a sub-genre all unto itself? Short answer: yes. Wright combines a tight script, gorgeous cinematography and high calibre cast to deliver a gripping wartime drama. This snapshot of history homes in on the famed leader's first few weeks in the job: it's nine months into WWII, Germany is succeeding in their Western Europe takeover, and his ousted predecessor Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is conspiring against him. What's more, 300,000 soldiers are stuck at Dunkirk with days to live, King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) doesn't approve of his methods, and the Americans won't come to the party. All this with the threat of bombing on home soil looming in the near future. You would be forgiven in thinking this must be a 3-hour-plus movie considering the dense, multi-pronged plot, but screenwriter Anthony McCarten smartly recreates key exchanges / moments (excluding a clunky phone call with Franklin Roosevelt) in order to extrapolate greater themes and build the gloomy mood. Behind the camera, and ably assisted by director of photography Bruno Delbonnel, Wright bolsters the storytelling through select sequences in which he unleashes his visual flair. A recurring bird's-eye-view motif superbly encapsulates the total carnage caused by aerial bombings, whilst the West Wing-esque single-take camerawork in the Brit's underground bunker injects a spark into the constant walking-and-talking. Playing the man himself, Gary Oldman imbues his Churchill with equal parts stubbornness and fierce intelligence; his pride often getting in the way, yet his determination to do what he feels right in the face of extraordinary odds ultimately shining through. Having already won the Golden Globe and BAFTA for Best Actor, Oldman's formidable performance-even under heavy prosthetics and make-up-will likely earn him his long overdue Oscar. With such a commanding central turn it's easy to overlook the support cast, but special mention should be given to both Mendelsohn and Lily James; the former showing a side to his talent rarely seen as the quietly instrumental King George, the latter providing an emotionally crucial perspective on events (as both young and female) as Churchill's trusted secretary Elizabeth Layton. Anchored by Oldman's riveting on-screen work, Darkest Hour is an insightful and engrossing political biopic that warrants a big screen viewing."
"bowmanblue","9","1","5","13 January 2018"," Oldman's finest hour
","I've just come back from a screening of the new Winston Churchill film, 'Darkest Hour,' and I have to say I'm pretty blown away. It might as well have been a one man show, as Gary Oldman appeared better than ever as the man himself. It says it's 'based on true events' which is pretty accurate. Oldman seemed so lifelike and believable as the wartime leader of Britain that sometimes it almost felt like it was a documentary.<br/><br/>It begins a year or so into the Second World War where Britain is already at war with Germany. Current Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, has lost the confidence of Parliament and the King is forced to allow Churchill to take over the war effort. I didn't know much about the film before I watched it (apart from the obvious, i.e. that it was about Churchill) and did assume that it would chart his time in office throughout the entire conflict. However, it only really focuses on about a month or so of time - I guess the part of the war which could indeed be described as Britain's 'darkest hour' when the British army looked lost, no one was coming to help (the army or the country!) and a deal with Hitler looked like the only way out.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that cinema goers all over the world will appreciate this piece of (dramatic!) history not only for Gary Oldman's Oscar-worthy performance. Being British it did stir up just a smattering of national pride, but I'm guessing that won't be the case for other nationalities.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that a film so 'character-based' (as opposed to simply having superheroes destroying a major city) doesn't have many special effects or amazing 'set-pieces,' however, what sets it up isn't just Gary Oldman's acting, but also the make-up team who turned him into the hunched, balding old man he was portraying.<br/><br/>The only thing that irked me about the whole film was one scene near the end. It felt totally unbelievable and scripted. It was more like a scene from a romantic comedy where the lead character learns a valuable, life-changing lesson. I have since Googled it to see other people's opinions on it and, as I thought, it was a moment of total fiction that was put in to 'represent' this defining moment in Churchill's life.<br/><br/>The film is a couple of hours long, but it certainly sped past for me. It's rare that a modern film can capture a person so greatly and it's all down to Gary Oldman (and also the team of make-up artists!)."
"dvdbvvmn","8","1","5","13 January 2018"," ""Well worth seeing just to watch Oldman's performance."" - Unfortunately, that is it's major let down
","It is by no mean's a bad film but I think, given the circumstances that the rest of Europe was facing, that the greater context should have been provided to give greater tension within the war cabinet. <br/><br/>Even at two hours it did tend to drag. Apart from Oldman there were no other recognisable actors playing MPs or in the cabinet which made the film a bit one sided."

As the film's focus is the early days of War War II and how the fate and balance of western Europe hung in the balance.<br/><br/>Churchill(Oldman) who's unpopular to many has just been named British prime minister and the balance of power is in question as he and others face the cruel and brutal Hitler. Does a nation choose between war, or peace with liberty and freedom? The film shows many scenes of debate and discussion as plenty of thought and decision making goes into play. Plus Winston is not without his vices as he enjoys to much chain cigar smoking and guzzles many glasses of whiskey it's like he's an alcoholic! Still his mind and determination is sharp and on point for an old overweight man. This man is a champion of the people as his listens to his country first, Winston Churchill was not a man who was afraid to act, or change his mind for the best interest he was a hero. Plus see this film for the performance of Gary Oldman as it's one historical war biography drama not to be missed."

"ravitchn","6","1","5","31 December 2017"," The hero
","As I arrived in the theatre to see Darkest Hour I happened to sit next to a British couple who proceeded to tell me they had to come because Churchill was their hero. This is precisely the point. This is not a movie about the start of WWII or about battles or diplomacy. It is entirely about the nomination of Churchill to be Prime Minister by a skeptical George VI and about how he managed to stay in power despite the disdain of his Conservative party and the desperate situation Britain faced as Holland, Belgium and France were overrun by the Nazi Blitzkrieg.<br/><br/>Churchill had been disdained by Conservatives and many other Britons ever since his Gallipoli disaster during WWI and also because of his rather fickle association with any British political party, whether Conservative or Liberal. Churchill was also suspect in the ranks of Labour because of his dedication to British Imperialism and his brutal dismissal of all Indian strivings for independence. Churchill had no following but the story is about how he created a following among the British people, one which would only last for five years at most.<br/><br/>The film takes place during only a few weeks prior to the rescue of the British troops at Dunkirk. There are no battle scenes to excite the public. There is only his mental gymnastics to defeat the enemy, not Hitler but Lord Halifax and the former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who sought negotiations with Hitler about a peace deal.<br/><br/>Churchill in a mood of despair even agreed to preliminary feelers to the Axis through Mussolini about a deal, but he at the same time worked for the evacuation of the British armed forces at Dunkirk, perhaps persuading Hitler thereby to let the British flee back home from the danger of annihilation.<br/><br/>The acting by Gary Oldman is superb, the best Oldman has ever achieved. But the film has several doubtful features. First, the belated support Churchill found with King George is ascribed to the king's fear of having to leave Britain for Canada, a move for safety which would also make the monarchy weaker than ever, something not desired after the abdication of Edward VIII to marry ""the woman he loved."" Secondly, Churchill's ride to Westminster to deliver his defiant speech against peace with Hitler took place according to the movie on the London tube where he discussed his dilemmas with ordinary Britons whose names he took down and referred to in his speech a few hours later. I tend to doubt the historical accuracy of these two events, especially the tube ride. <br/><br/>In the end Lord Halifax, while admitting defeat in the face of Churchill's triumph in Parliament in rejecting anything but blood, sweat and tears, spoke the theme of the movie and of Churchill's whole career. Halifax told Chamberlain who was dying of cancer, that Churchill had mobilized, not Britain and its armed forces, but something evidently more important: he had mobilized the English language. This was an offhanded tribute from someone who disdained Churchill but had to admit his success in oratory, a sort of Cicero for 1940. He expressed the high moral beliefs of Englishmen and Englishwomen in the face of German brutality and monstrousness. Thus Churchill emerges in the film as the hero. The needed support from America would only come with America's entry into war after Pearl Harbor. In 1940 FDR would and could do nothing for Britain. Churchill and FDR needed to thank Japanese Imperial aggression for their own salvation.<br/><br/>Thus the movie is only for a very specialized audience, more interested in Churchill as a person than in military affairs. This means its appeal with necessarily be limited to those who seek real understanding, not mere entertainment."
"scgmckman","9","1","5","29 December 2017"," Overall A Superb Film
","This film does a far better job in a few seconds of telling the story of the Dunkirk Evacuation than the almost total boor of a film Dunkirk did. This film also does an excellent job of showing the behind the scenes battle Churchill faced against those who wanted to quit the war. Gary Oldman's protrayal of Churchill is without a doubt the best anyone has ever done. If he does not get an Oscar for his performance, the award should be abolished."
"fletcherc21","8","1","5","29 December 2017"," An Oscar Worthy Performance
","Gary Oldman is brilliant in Darkest Hour, he becomes one of most important figures of the 20th century so effectively that I forgot I was watching a movie for a few moments. Oldman's Churchill is fighting a war not only with Germany, but with his own government, who are desperate for peace and appeasement. Churchill was willing to make the hard choices when few wanted to face the reality of the situation Britain was in at the dawn of the war.<br/><br/>Joe Wright puts together an excellent film that is not solely dependent on Oldman's performance. Wright captures the mood of England shortly before the war had actually begun to have a huge impact on everyday life. The threat of war was still just a looming darkness in the east, which was why Chamberlain and others were so convinced peace was possible.<br/><br/>In addition to Oldman, the rest of the cast performed well, in particular Ben Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn was outstanding as King George VI, the role that won Colin Firth an Oscar in The King's Speech. He perfectly incorporated the lisp into his speech patterns, and he also carried himself like the King who never expected to be King. All in all, Darkest Hour was one of the best films of the year and I would be shocked if Oldman doesn't go home with the Oscar."
"cherold","6","1","6","6 April 2018"," A rather stodgy bit of history
","Darkest Hour makes me think of 2012's Lincoln, in that it appears aimed more at schoolchildren looking to learn history than in moviegoers looking to be moved and entertained. <br/><br/>Gary Oldman is quite good as a Churchill. Rather than the sharp, sure, rather loud Churchill one often sees, Oldman offers a man torn between his beliefs and the possibility that he's about to make a horrible mistake.<br/><br/>Apparently the movie does take some liberties with the historical facts, and unfortunately the movie seems to find it easier to make the false stuff, like a conspiracy to take Churchill down or an engaging subway ride, more entertaining than the real stuff.<br/><br/>I'm torn between giving this a 6 and a 7. It's pretty decent, and Oldman is quite good, but it feels overall rather slight."
"leftbanker-1","10","1","6","21 February 2018"," The Role of Gary Oldman's Career, or Anyone's Career
","As intimate a look at Churchill as we may ever see-something only possible in fiction (sometimes called a bio-pic). Gary Oldman portrays the statesman as he moves into power at one of the crucial junctures in human history. Had things gone against Churchill who the hell knows what would have become of the world? <br/><br/>It's worth the price of admission just for the scene when the Prime Minister takes the underground in an effort to get a feel for the will of the people. Of course, this scene paves the way for one of the most moving speeches in recorded history and one of Britain's proudest moments, if not the proudest."
"a_naismith","6","1","6","15 February 2018"," Well that was underwhelming
","I was looking forward to seeing this given all the hype. Turns out it is a bit of a dud. They raved about Oldman's costume. IMO he didn't look much like Winston but that was redeemed some by his acting which was first rate. I have seen better Churchills make up wise. Lily James was very good. I am sure she will go on to great things given the opportunity. Plot wise, I felt that the subject could have been handled much better in a 3 or 4 part TV serial. This for me is where Hollywood falls down, they have failed to grasp that TV is in the ascendancy whilst they flounder. Most homes nowadays have large screens. 
Why the fantasy items. There is no evidence Churchill ever took the tube and interacted with common folk. Then the virtue signalling was unnecessary. And the tube ride from St James to Westminster lasted 5 minutes when in fact it is one stop and should have been just 1 or 2 minutes. Makes me wonder what else was made up."
"CineMuseFilms","9","1","6","11 January 2018"," the finest film ever made about the Churchill legend
","In the wake of several high-profile films about Britain's greatest leader, is there anything more to know about Winston Churchill? The archives of history attest to the unique stature of this political figure: more remarkable is the surrounding folklore that has shaped British and world history. It is at this level that Darkest Hour (2017) is perhaps the finest film ever made about the Churchill legend.<br/><br/>The dialogue-dense plotline is tightly compressed yet massive in the scale of its largely unseen off-screen action. Set In the critical weeks of May to June 1940, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) emerges as the least objectionable candidate to become Prime Minister after the British Parliament loses confidence in Neville Chamberlain. As the film Dunkirk (2017) so graphically shows, the Nazis had cornered almost the entire British army at Dunkirk and their total destruction was imminent. It was the definitive turning point of World War II: Churchill must inform Parliament that if the British forces are wiped out in France, it may not be long before a swastika will fly from Buckingham Palace. Belgium, France and Holland are entering surrender negotiations and a political group still loyal to Chamberlain are urging that Britain use Mussolini as an intermediary to secure favourable terms for a British surrender. Churchill must weigh the saving of countless young lives if Britain surrenders against the loss of nationhood and life under Nazi rule. As history records, Churchill rejects appeasement and his speeches to the British nation declaring that ""we shall never surrender"" are still regarded as among the finest ever made.<br/><br/>It needs to be said that Darkest Hour does not add to, nor subtract from, what we know of these historical events: it's power lies entirely in Gary Oldman's tour-de-force performance. More psychological thriller than bio-pic, the plotline advances with electrifying gravity, painfully pausing to amplify the enormity of impending national doom. Oldman executes a brilliant screenplay with eloquence, belligerence, and a gifted gravel-voiced orator's 'call-to-arms' like the world has never seen. As we saw in Churchill (2017), this is a profoundly mortal, flawed, and emotionally vulnerable leader: Oldman is simply brilliant in portraying the knife-edge balancing of two fateful options, both of which would shape the course of modern history like no other single event: surrender or risk annihilation. When President Roosevelt declined his personal call for assistance, it was indeed Britain's darkest hour.<br/><br/>This film comes close to being flawless but for one scene that lingers with an air of compromised plausibility. With a Parliamentary speech about to be given, Churchill bolts from a rear car seat and into the London Tube. He enters a carriage full of ordinary citizens and soon has an audience of astonished gazes which become a single chorus urging Churchill to never surrender. Despite the rousing sentiment, the scene plays like a dream sequence from another movie. Perhaps this is trivial in light of what this excellent film achieves: a portrait of a leader who had the weight of the world on his shoulders and the courage to be guided by his uncompromising belief in the British people. As today's British and American leaders offer more walls and less leadership, Darkest Hour is a reminder of what leadership actually means."

","Stop what you are doing and go see Darkest Hour without delay! This is by far one of the best pictures of 2017. In this film, you walk alongside Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he makes some of the most difficult decisions for the United Kingdom during World War II. <br/><br/>Faced with a difficult situation as Churchill assumes the role of Prime Minister and with opposition from his own party, Oldman plays Churchill masterfully. One might recognize the name-Oldman- as Commissioner Gordon from the Dark Knight Trilogy, but you would never recognize him by looks or demeanor. Oldman played Churchill with chilling effect and you could not help but keep your eyes on his character wondering what he would do next. Oldman should be up for Best Male Actor for this portrayal. It was not just Oldman, however, that contributed to the great acting. The entire cast was brilliant in the picture. <br/><br/>Director Joe Wright comes off the success of Anna Karenina and very well may have made a film worthy of being in the best picture category. Wright draws on the human need of survival through his cinematography, which helps the audience root for the decision we already know the UK made. <br/><br/>Overall, the picture is worth your time and opens the door (and your eyes) to a piece of history that, if done differently... could have drastically altered the world we live in now.

"CANpatbuck3664","9","1","6","27 December 2017"," Darkest hour is a Beautiful Movie About Courage Under Insurmountable Odds
","Darkest Hour takes place over a relatively contained amount of time. It covers the month of May in the year 1940. Normally you would want a little more to pass as it would add to the overall scope but I preferred this approach because of how good a job they do of underscoring the danger of this situation. Without stating the obvious, there's a reason this movie is called ""Darkest Hour."" This was a perilous time and between Dunkirk and the Nazi invasion of Western Europe, things really could have spiraled out of control. The tension in the movie is thick and ever present, you never forget for an instant how scary this would have been. This helps the movie because without a lot of action, you needed something to help get you from A to B and my attention never wavered when it came to Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>We've had more than a couple biopics now and for better or worse, many of them follow the same beats. One of the more irritating aspects of that is that many movies take flawed main characters and gloss over or ignore the seedier side of their personalities. This was one of the more refreshing aspects of Darkest Hour. Not only is Churchill a complicated man with many flaws, they do a good job of showing that there was reason to doubt him. His record was mixed and he had done a decent amount of flip-flopping to get to his spot. The future looked very bleak and as Viscount Halifax repeatedly points out, peace talks did look like a viable option. Looking back now, Churchill was proven right but I have to credit the movie for showing the other side of the argument. We also see some of the less pleasant side of Winston. He was arrogant, hard-headed and tough to deal with. He also drank way too much for a politician during office hours. But this helps you understand him better as a character and I appreciated that those things were included.<br/><br/>If something caught me off guard about Darkest Hour, I was shocked at how beautifully it was shot. The cinematography was eye-catching, they added a lot of interesting shots and style for a movie that might have seemed like a procedural. Maybe I shouldn't have doubted Joe Wright who has done work all over the Hollywood spectrum and his team, but I didn't expect something to be visually interesting in this. They used the overhead shot of a turbulent area a lot but that was the only thing that made me pause for a second. I also have to tip my cap to the people who did the makeup on Gary Oldman. It didn't look flawless, but it was consistent and I wasn't taken out of the movie because it looked cheap or fake.<br/><br/>I've touched on a few aspects about Darkest Hour but the centre of the movie's advertising is Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill. This is appropriate, he's as good as advertised and I would hope he wins best actor at the Oscars. This is a good character, but Oldman brings it to another level. He's funny, rude, scary and powerful all rolled into one. Lily James gets the next biggest chunk of screen time as Elizabeth. I think she nails it, her character is very vulnerable but through the time she spends with Churchill, her inner strength and conviction comes out and James does her part splendidly. I hope that Kristin Scott Thomas doesn't get lost in the shuffle as Winston's wife Clemmie. She's very charming and I enjoyed her performance every moment she was on screen. It was interesting to see how different the historical figure of King George VI was played by Ben Mendelsohn as opposed to Colin Firth in the King's Speech. This portrayal was a lot less romantic and more calculating and I actually liked that. Mendelsohn excels at playing this kind of character and he holds his own in every scene he has. I also liked Stephen Dillane as Lord Halifax. He's far from a mustache-twirling antagonist and Dillane does a good job of putting the other side of the argument out there.<br/><br/>This movie is so good that I only have one complaint. The ending includes a very emotional scene that is very effective but has limited to no basis in historical fact. That's fine as it underscores some pretty powerful stuff, but it borders on being too sappy. I get why it was there, but you could feel the movie pushing the limits between genuine and over-romantic. I also think this is another adult movie that will have limited appeal to younger people. Again, that's fine but with how good I think this is, I just wish it had broader appeal.<br/><br/>This movie is about courage when you're at your lowest. I got swept up in that, I had been through a difficult time lately and this spoke to me in that way. I saw 3 movies on boxing day and this was the best of the bunch. I wasn't expecting such a well-rounded and affecting drama out of this, but it lived up to the billing. If WW2 history interests you or you just want to enjoy some well done historical drama, this is worth going out of your way to see."
"Dan1863Sickles","7","1","6","25 December 2017"," Exceeded My Expectations
","My feelings as I went into the theater were not optimistic. Gary Oldman was absolutely brilliant in Oliver Stone's JFK, but I was afraid that casting him as Winston Churchill was a disaster in the making. Sort of like asking Peter Lorre to switch places with Sidney Greenstreet in THE MALTESE FALCON. <br/><br/>As it happens, though, Gary Oldman is actually pretty good in the role of the embattled but fearless Winston Churchill. His voice is no match of Churchill's, and in fact it's a lot higher pitched. But the meaning still shines through. <br/><br/>Every other review I've read seems to suggest that this movie stands or falls on Gary Oldman's performance alone, but that's not true at all. The thing I loved the most about this movie was not Gary Oldman's bumbling around with a cigar and drink in his hand, trying to look like Churchill. It's the way the other characters react to him -- not always with admiration. Sometimes with fear, sometimes with doubt, sometimes even with horror. But in the end all of them are changed by him to a greater or lesser degree. <br/><br/>I never saw THE KING'S SPEECH because I felt like celebrating the British monarchy is not what movies should be about. But Ben Mendelsohn is spectacular ad the English king. I actually felt more for him than I did for Churchill! Here is a man without much character, or much of a brain, yet he's placed in a position where he has to take a stand. It's almost against his nature to have strong convictions, yet Churchill forces him to feel something for England that's entirely personal, maybe for the first time in his life.<br/><br/>Ronald Pickup was amazing as the luckless Neville Chamberlain, a man who is remembered today only for his flaws, such as weakness, cowardice, and a gullible reliance on the words of Adolph Hitler. This movie made me see Chamberlain from a different perspective, as a man who knows history will despise him but is too big a man to stop trying to help his country survive. By the time he lifted up his handkerchief at the end of the movie I was in tears. <br/><br/>Lily James gives a captivating performance as Churchill's new secretary even though her character is sadly under-written. I do wish there had been some indication of why she was more qualified than any of the hundreds of other girls who must have been available. It made me a little uneasy to see her doing nothing but typing away like a machine for most of the movie -- it sort of reminded me of DOWNFALL. Surely young women contributed more than just their fast fingers and their adoration to England's war effort?<br/><br/>One other thing that struck me as both annoying and gratuitously false was the late-night phone conversation between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. In real life, these two men had been close personal friends for more than twenty years before World War II even began. They liked each other and trusted each other. But for some reason, (to bolster English pride?) director Joe Wright insists on making FDR sound like a liar, a lightweight, and an all-around twit. FDR did what he could, when he could, and he took plenty of political heat in the USA for forcing through things like the Lend Lease Act. More respect is wanted, gentlemen!<br/><br/>Other than that, Darkest Hour exceeded my expectations on many levels. It was poignant, suspenseful, and full of unexpected twists."

"howard.schumann","8","1","6","24 December 2017"," Churchill's Greates Hits
","Allen Packwood, director of the Churchill Archives Centre referred to former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill as an ""incredibly complex, contradictory, and larger-than-life human being."" This complexity is lost, however, in Joe Wright's (""Pan"") Darkest Hour, a look at a crucial time in British Prime Minister Churchill's stewardship that covers the period from May 10, 1940 until his famous speech to the House of Commons on June 4th. This was the speech in which Churchill declared that, in the fight against Nazi Germany, Britain would fight to the end and never surrender. Written by Anthony McCarten (""The Theory of Everything""), the film stars Gary Oldman (""The Space Between Us"") as the confident leader who carried Britain through one of the most challenging periods in its history. <br/><br/>Beneath Oldman's makeup and mannerisms, we get a sense of what Churchill was really like, but it is more of a master class in acting than a three-dimensional portrait. Churchill's most familiar personal trademarks are ticked off: his bluster, mumbling, drinking habits, cigar smoking, soaring speeches, and buoyant sense of humor, but it feels like a compilation of his ""greatest hits."" The main focus of the film, however, is not Churchill's personal idiosyncrasies but the political conflict between those who want to negotiate with Hitler and those who prefer to fight to the end, whatever that might look like. When Prime Mister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup, ""The Time of Their Lives""), who will forever be associated with the word ""appeasement,"" is forced to resign, no candidate besides the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, is acceptable to the opposition. <br/><br/>Those who oppose him include Chamberlain, Lord Halifax (Stephen Dillane, ""The Crown,"" TV Series), and King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Una"") who see him as too ""hawkish"" and urge Churchill to ask Mussolini to negotiate a deal with Hitler in order to prevent an all-out invasion of Britain. Churchill, however, is convinced that making deals with Hitler will lead to the end of British independence and the film does not seriously consider other viewpoints as having any merit. While the new prime minister's boundless optimism did much to inspire Britain, Wright also shows him to be torn by doubts. In one scene, Churchill sits alone by himself in a darkened room, suggesting a struggle with depression, as has been rumored. <br/><br/>By this time, Hitler has already conquered Norway, Belgium and France are near capitulation, and 300,000 British soldiers are surrounded by German forces at Dunkirk. Haunted by his part in the heavy loss of life in the World War I Battle of Gallipoli, the prime minister has to come up with a plan to save the men but little help is offered. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"") creates an atmosphere of musty corridors and underground rooms where there is little light or air and where life or death discussions take place. In spite of the gloom, there are moments of humor. We listen in on a phone call between Churchill and FDR where Churchill asks for help and Roosevelt tells him that he ""can't swing it"" because of U.S. neutrality, suggesting that he should get horses to pull B4 bombers across the border into Canada. <br/><br/>Support from his acidic wife Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas, ""The Party"") and his devoted but put-upon secretary Elizabeth Layton (Lily James, ""Baby Driver"") are welcome interludes, but they basically serve as a distraction and we learn little about Churchill's personal life other than one contrived conversation with the King about his parents. While the film zeroes in on Churchill's thought processes, embellishments to the historical record sentimentalize his achievements. At one point when he is still considering the proposal to seek negotiations, he bounces out of his car to take the Underground to Westminster. On the train, he talks to the people asking them about their attitude toward negotiating with Hitler and is buoyed to hear when they tell him to never negotiate. It is an event that never took place. <br/><br/>There is no doubt that Churchill was a great man who helped save the world from the Nazi barbarians and Darkest Hour makes that clear. It does not, however, present a balanced portrait, ignoring Churchill's blemishes as if they never existed. While we can all celebrate Churchill's courage and fierce determination, no mention is made of his lifelong dedication to British imperialism and his disdain for Gandhi and the Indian independence movement, or his virulent anti-Communism, casual anti-Semitism, and support for the Spanish dictator Franco. They were not his finest hour."
"leporegregory","6","1","6","23 December 2017"," Stellar Gary Oldman, With Little Else
","As so many have mentioned, this film is a one-man show supported and driven by the brilliance of Gary Oldman. His top-notch performance is worthy of the the Golden Globe for which he's nominated, and makes this film worthy of viewing. Complete with Churchill's rolling Rs, top hat, cigar, witty, biting and complex delivery, Oldman's performance is impeccable. <br/><br/>The rest of the film takes away from Oldman's brilliance. This is a historic, biographical drama which means it must be factually accurate if it is to be taken seriously. The climatic or ""turning point"" scene when Churchill realizes Britain cannot negotiate the peace brokered by Halifax and Chamberlain but instead must continue to fight, is carried out with complete disregard for actual events and ventures into the realm of absurdity. ""Hollywood liberties"" are OK in some cases, but not in this one.<br/><br/>The absolute ridiculousness of this scene pulls the rug out from what was a solid first half of the film, and the ending takes on an aire of what we've seen so many times before, a hero defying all odds to triumph in absolute victory. <br/><br/>Considering Oldman's performance, this film had so much more potential than what it delivered on. Arguments between Churchill, Halifax, and Chamberlain are present, but few and far in-between. Halifax's disapproving expression does not change once during such scenes, and I'm almost positive the director found the right Stephen Dillane face, and told him to hold it for the entire duration of filming.<br/><br/>Argumentative dialogue during a time of war is not likely to end in a witty joke, as it so often does in this film, and I would like to have seen more intense discussion about Britain and the Western World's future i.e. what is to be gained through war or peace, and what is to be lost. The pressures on Churchill were enormous, and the film presents his situation as if brokering peace and engaging in war would both have been acceptable outcomes. I understand this is not a war film, but flashbacks to what's happening on the battlefield as Parliament quarrels amongst themselves wold also have added evoked more emotion in the audience. <br/><br/>All things considered, go watch this movie for Gary OIdman, but keep your expectations low."

","I gave this fine movie an 8 of 10... Fine perfomances by Gary Oldman, Lily James , and Kristen Thomas, were countered by a weak Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. There have been better portrayals of Churchill over the years , but not many. I did not give it a 10 because of some weak scenes, particularly the scene where Churchill sneaks out to ride on the Subway. Unlikey if not completely false. And we had the obligatory PC moment of a Shakespeare-quoting black man accompanied by a white woman. Unlikely in 1940's Britain. Also weak was Oldman's incorrect use of the key word in one of Churchill's most famous speeches. The stressing of the word "" surrender"" instead of ""NEVER"" is hard to understand , and could only have been done deliberately, assuming that both the actor and the director actually listened to Churchill's speeches beforehand. Worth going to see."

","""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""

Although I have spent my career cavorting with words, this film does in two hours what I had always believed: Words can win wars.<br/><br/>Although at this point I can see no other competition for the Oscar than Gary Oldman, you may not believe me because you can't recognize him in his role. He does lose himself playing Churchill, not just because of the fat prosthetics, the glasses, and the cigar, but because he channels Churchill's indomitable spirit and endearing flaws with a perfection rarely seen this side of Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>For the complete historical experience, see Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk as a companion, for Churchill's success of the 300,000 soldier-rescue/retreat at Dunkirk made Churchill's legacy and changed the war to a losing proposition for the Nazis, notwithstanding their withering superiority on the land and in the air. 
What makes this doc so memorable is the revelation of Churchill's flaws as well as his genius. He wavers in acceptance of Chamberlain and Halifax's proposals to capitulate to Herr Hitler, yet he can be persuaded by the populace's ""never"" to give in to them as he rides the tube to listen to their heroism first hand.<br/><br/>Besides the tour de force performance, Darkest Hour has other splendid moments such as the nose-to-nose confrontations between Mrs. Churchill (Kristin Scott Thomas) and the prime minister. Additionally, director Joe Wright employs his well-known camera acrobatics to keep interest and relay meaning (e.g., the opening camera shot from the ceiling of the House to a close-up of the speaker's left side is ominous about the lofty proceedings and their roots in humanity, and his street-tracking shots are several and realistic.<br/><br/>Here's a docudrama to make you weep as you watch real-life heroes struggle in a battle of the mind, and oh, yes, words."

","Oscar season is always a fun time to review movies. More often than not, you'll be able to talk about a great movie with many award caliber aspects. In many ways it has surpassed ""blockbuster-summer-season"", partially because blockbusters are more spread out now, but there's nothing like being able to go see this many different great films in the theater in consecutive days. Darkest Hour is another film in 2017 that will surely be talked about on March 4th, and probably for one specific reason, Gary Oldman.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour is a solid film all around, and there's nothing inherently wrong about it, but Oldman's performance stands far above anything else that you could say he overshadows his own film. Maybe that's because I'm just so excited that he may finally get his time to shine on an Oscar stage after being overlooked countless times, or maybe it's because a lot of the material in Darkest Hour tends to lean in the area of political conversation. Naturally a film about Winston Churchill will deal with politics, strategy, and patriotism, which is always difficult to encapsulate on screen without boring audiences. Luckily, Darkest Hour handles that side of things relatively well. Granted, there are some moments I did feel my interest drifting a little bit, but Oldman's performance is easily the most engaging part.<br/><br/>The supporting actors are also impressive in their own right. Stephen Dillane, Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Ben Mendelsohn, and Ronald Pickup all play solid counterparts to Oldman's churchill. What helped them is not being very well known actors and hence being able to disappear into their respective roles. Whereas Oldman, who is iconic in his own right, is challenged with becoming someone who most everyone knows about in a very famous prime minister to England at the heart of World War II. It's not exactly a task just any actor can do, and Oldman does it to perfection.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, Darkest Hour isn't necessarily a movie I'll ever re-watch and one could make the argument it's a very formulaic biopic. Be that as it may, there's more than enough that comes from the performances of Oldman and the supporting roster that elevates the film to an Oscar conversation.<br/><br/>7.7/10"

","If you found Lincoln to be a moving film about a great historical figure played by a respected actor doing some of his best work, with great emotional resonance at its core, then you will find the same things in Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>This film centers around Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, and focuses on his first three weeks as British Prime Minister in May of 1940, when nearly the whole of Europe has been conquered by Nazi Germany, the British Army is being forced to the sea at Dunkirk, and there is the very real possibility that Britain will be left defenseless.<br/><br/>Oldman shines in this role, and the makeup team did great work transforming him into Churchill. Truly, he is a chameleon in any role he lands. There are great emotional stakes at work in this film, as it is made clear that Churchill is an older man who has a very particular style, and often struggles to get certain thoughts out in a coherent and convincing manner.<br/><br/>While props must be given to Kristen Scott Thomas who portrays Clementine Churchill, the truly standout supporting role is Lily James as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's secretary, who often conveys great emotional weight using only her eyes and her posture. Her scenes alongside Churchill are the best in the film.<br/><br/>Where the film falters is in the pacing, which does tend to drag in the middle a bit. Also, if you go into this film knowing nothing about the historical context of the players involved, then certain character motivations will be left either unexplained, explained in passing, hard to hear, or explained very clunkily in an obvious manner, such as Churchill's involvement in the Gallipoli campaign in World War I.<br/><br/>That aside, though, you should see this film simply for Oldman's performance, which is stunning, and he is most deserving of at the very least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor."

","In 1940, King George VI (Ben Mendlesohn) picks Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) to be England's new Prime Minister. All fear the war with Germany is being lost and many want Churchill to agree to have Italy start negotiations with Germany. Churchill is against that. Many in Parliament want Churchill out. Churchill orders all civilian boats to go to Dunkirk to help evacuate about 300,000 troops stranded on the beach there. 
 
Since there are 2-Churchill movies out at the same time it is hard not to make some comparisons. First of all in Darkest Hour there is no mention of Operation Overlord, a plan by the Allies to invade France to push the Germans back and this is being discussed at the same time 300,000 troops are stuck in Dunkirk when Churchill orders civilian boat to help evacuate the troops in Dunkirk. The movie Churchill talks about both.<br/><br/>The name of Churchill's secretary, who types all his speeches , in the movie Churchill is Miss Garrett. In Darkest Hour her name is Miss Layton (Lily James) Why this apparent difference? There are some other discrepancies, but they are minor compared to the ones just mentioned. <br/><br/>I did notice that in both movies Churchill never seemed to have a Security Detail with him. <br/><br/>We saw Churchill talk with U.S. President Roosevelt asking for destroyers and Roosevelt says cannot do because of some new U.S. Laws. Then Churchill asks for planes that England has already paid for. Roosevelt says cannot do again because of new U.S. laws. However, Roosevelt does say England can pull the planes into Canada and that would be acceptable. Now here's the thing: The planes issues was never addressed again in Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>Nobables: Ronald Pickup as Neville Chamberlain, the outgoing Prime Minister; Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie, Churchill's wife.<br/><br/>When Churchill was agonizing over what to do: fight or negotiate, he finds support from ""friends"" in a car in the Underground (subway system) and now knows what to do. To sum it up one rider says that if the Germans ever invaded: "" They'll never take Picadilly."" And the rest is history. <br/><br/>Acting by all was excellent. In Darkest Hour we see Winston Churchill and not once did I see Gary Oldman. What a performance. The Oscar is a lock for sure. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No.

Thank goodness it wasn't.
This film moved through time in the normal way. Day by day, in the right order.
I only hope that the makers of Dunkirk study this film and apply their findings to their future work.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour is an excellent piece of entertainment, not a history lesson, but offers a good depiction of the May 1940 period.
It is very well acted with Churchill and the King leading the way. <br/><br/>This film covered the two possible responses to an attack on this country - fight or sue for peace. <br/><br/>To the people of the UK I would point out that nothing changes.
The country is again under attack and there are schemers who think that they know best.
These schemers truly believe that, although the 'plebs' may have voted for one outcome, they can be ignored.<br/><br/>Blair, Osborn and Branson are today's version of Halifax and his cohorts of the 1940's.
If Halifax had got his way we would now be governed (at best) by Germany.
Blair etc seem to have the same objective.<br/><br/>The question is, ""Can May be as successful as Churchill in the defense of the UK?""<br/><br/>Let us hope that our ""Darkest Hour"" is not yet to come."
"ronkpken","9","1","7","22 January 2018"," I wish all historical dramas were like this!
","An excellently made film in every way. The acting. cinematography, pacing, almost perfect. Best of all, unlike nearly all other historical dramas, they almost completely refrained from inventing un-historical and implausible stuff to push the film-maker's point of view.<br/><br/> Among the few slight failures in this regard was to push a little too hard on the ""Churchill friend of the ordinary common working class people"" angle (combined with the unhistorical portrayal of the Labour Party as always strongly pro-Churchill and anti-Chamberlain/Halifax).<br/><br/>Another quibble is a single line giving the impression that George VI hated Churchill because he was pro-Edward VIII remaining king. In fact George VI never wanted to be king, but took it on as his duty after Edward's abdication. Churchill's only input was to publicly worry about whether Baldwin was hurrying Edward (a personal friend of Churchill) into a rash decision. Once it was shown this was not the case Churchill was happy with the abdication. There was never the slightest question of his total loyalty to King George.<br/><br/>I thought I knew everything important there was to know about Churchill and WW2. But this film made it so much more real by filling in what nobody else thought to mention.<br/><br/>Especially pleasing was that the anti-war Chamberlain and Halifax and their followers were not portrayed as the usual cardboard cut-out cowardly and secretly pro-Nazi idiots, but as true patriots who sincerely thought they were doing the best they could to save another generation of innocents from senseless slaughter; but who discovered that they had been mistaken."

","The lesson that Winston gave us in history; was to never quit, dismiss or ignore your convictions. To strive until the very end, whatever the cost may be, to achieve our own personal goals: Our Victory. Most scholars consider him the greatest British man to ever lived and this movie is proof of it. 
The film takes place during the crucial days leading up to the colapse of France and Wester Europe during the early campaigns of World War II and how a man took upon its shoulders the burden to give hope back to those who opposed Nazi tyranny and oppression across the globe. The movie is all about the resolute of Prime Minister Churchill on his quest to convey its own people that the only way to settle a conflict with an unleashed beast is by fighting back and never give up. 
I have read and heard Winston famous ""We shall fight on the beaches"" June 4 1940 speech over 100 times. I apply to my life the specific message he passed on to future generations on how to approach times of conflict and despair. Hence, my hopes for this film were extremely high, and I must confess I am absolutely satisfied and content with the result. 
The film itself is extremely good. It has all the elements that make a good film...good. Script, Director, Cinematography, Score, Make-up and Performance (& others). The first four characteristics do not require more delve into it, besides the short text I just voiced. The make-up is fearfully accurate to what the man behind the V (for victory) looks like.The works with prosthetics done by Kazuhiro Tsuji is breathtaking. I asked myself: Is this a movie or a documentary?, because simply you cannot tell the difference (or very subtle) between the man and the actor. 
Portraying Winston Churchill is no easy task for any actor. Many have stepped onto his shoes, to name a few: Finney, Gleeson, Burton, Lithgow and others. All of them have given the audience solid performances, however, Gary Oldman is by far the finest interpretation of this beloved historical (ecumenical) character. In just over 2 hours he manages to pass on the viewer the gentle nature of the man in the Top Hat and the strong and resourceful respect he imposes on those around him, because there is no such thing as a godlike man, but only a man that becomes a god when his darkest hour is upon him. 
The movie is probably not the best of the year, but Mr. Oldman performance is without a doubt the best of 2017 (2018 awards). There is no other contender this year that can rival his acting, for I strongly believe he not only deserves an Oscar nomination but the award itself. He steals the SHOW in up to this date his best acting. <br/><br/>The rating is of course 9/10, for all the things already mentioned. The only element that could have been done better is historical accuracy (which the movie has in at least 85%). Having said that I encourage you to go out and watch this film, it is formidable in every aspect. You will not regret it, and I promise...you shall never surrender."

","It's not very often that I am glued to the screen throughout a film - there are usually bits when time drags, when the plot is muddled, the cinematography or sound didn't work well or actors did not jell in their parts. Not so in Darkest Hour. Almost everything about it was excellent. Every actor played their part superbly but Oldman's portrayal of Churchill was nothing short of amazing. It was never an actor playing Churchill, it really was Churchill! Sure, his makeup and prosthetics were beyond reproach but his voice, which is nothing like the actors voice, was absolutely consistent and accurate from start to finish. <br/><br/>The only issue I had with this film was the tube train scene. The screenwriter's research had revealed that Churchill did sometimes ""disappear"" into London and would sometimes talk to ""ordinary people"" to find out what they were thinking and this scene was a fiction based on that. It was however nauseating in the use of stereotypes of London ""working class"" people. And the bit where the black man played (I think) by Ade Haastrup completes a literary quote was particularly nauseating, implying that you would be surprised that a black person could do that. Might have got a 10 without that!<br/><br/>But, that aside and forgiven, this is a truly great film and if it doesn't get the awards it deserves then there is no justice! Sound quality which accounts for half of the watching experience was consistently good although there were some silly artificial boomy thumps through the sub-woofers for some reason - presumably a misguided attempt to remind the audience that Dolby Atmos was being used. Atmos doesn't need that - it's very good without gimmicks. Bruno Delbonell's Cinematography, especially his lighting, was as usual beyond reproach, bringing out the beautiful colour rendering with the Arri Alexa. Great that Delbonell used the amazing Cooke S4 lenses, made as they have been in Cooke's factory since 1880 in Leicester England.<br/><br/>All in all this is a superb film that, if there is any justice in this world, should bring in the awards. If the second world war means anything to you, I think this is an important film to see. An object lesson in pushing ahead with what is right and not bowing to peer pressure that governments would do well to reflect on."

","True Stories flood cinemas around the world all year long. Quite frankly, the majority of original content in terms of filmmaking all comes from a pre-existing story. Ideas are running out in terms of originality, but great films are still being made regardless and Darkest Hour is one of them. Depending on how you look at Darkest Hour, it's definitely worth mentioning when reflecting on the better movies of 2017. From performances to well-written dialogue, this is a film that transports you into this time period during the hard political times and keeps you intrigued throughout every moment. Although this experience may be a slow burn for some viewers, here's why I believe Darkest Hour deserves your time.<br/><br/>Whether or not he's successful in the end isn't the point of this film, but Darkest Hour follows the recent appointing of Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as he strives to find the best way to course correct during World War II. Having to decide whether or not to negotiate with Hitler, this movie treads on familiar historical accuracies, while also providing a few new pieces of insight that I was unaware of. The overall plot of this film is quite simple, but it's the intricacies of the dialogue and where the writers choose to take the character of Churchill throughout the film that truly makes it a worthy viewing experience.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman plays the both loved and hated Prime Minister and I must say, after experiencing this performance for myself, it's going to take a lot for another actor to deserve winning all the lead actor awards this coming season. Whether he's being comedic for dramatic relief or going all out in one of his speeches, I was truly blown away by how he transformed himself into this historical figure. Yes, that's also due to great direction by Joe Wright and incredibly prosthetic work to complete his performance, but those are all elements that work toward creating a great feature as a whole. Direction and performances were pitch perfect here, but the pacing is where I'd have no make my one complaint.<br/><br/>For myself, the dialogue kept the film moving at a very brisk pace, especially a specific sequence involving Churchill riding the subway. If you ever find yourself bored when watching this film, I believe this one scene will win you over. I was truly moved by the way that scene played out. That being said, Darkest Hour doesn't exactly have the action that a film like Dunkirk had earlier this year and that will definitely turn people off. Darkest Hour is more in line with movies like The Social Network or Steve Jobs in terms of letting dialogue drive the entire film. That's a hard pill for some people to swallow, but it really worked for me here, which is why it's such a mild complaint.<br/><br/>In the end, Darkest Hour proves that a film doesn't need to be exciting in the conventional ways in order to please moviegoers. I was riveted by certain scenes, simply due to the context of the dialogue being spoken. The drab look and slow pacing would've normally wished for the film to end, but everything about this film was just so well done. From perfect musical cues to performances that will have many in tears, I think Darkest Hour is easily one of the best movies of 2017. Once again, I just have to stress how incredibly talented Gary Oldman is in this role. If you find yourself not enjoying this movie as much as I did, I can guarantee his performance will at least pique your interest in a few key scenes. I highly recommend this film."

","As a film goer, I give it a 10. It conveys a sense of the greatest moments in world history with the type of emotion such an event deserves. As an aside, it, by comparison, shows where the other movie on the event ""Dunkirk"" failed so miserably. ""Dunkirk"" took one of the most riveting, awe inspiring events in history and made it play out like a few guys stuck in an elevator in a burning building. ""The Darkest Hour"" carried the film goer into Churchill's drama and helped the movie goer experience it as the turning point in history it was. <br/><br/>Now, as to the actual history, as many films do to capture the emotion referenced above, it seems to have dropped out some very important aspects of the historical event. Not being a true historian of the period, I would note it disserved the sacrifice and valor of the French army that fought and died to buy Churchill the time needed to get his army off the beach. There may have also been historical inaccuracies in how and why Churchill played out the political hand he had to work with - BUT, what I think it captures well is that Churchill was the guy who had two diametrically opposed routes, capitulate and Hitler would have governed Europe for who knows how long, or lead England into a win or die war. He insisted upon and charged full ahead into the latter and, at a minimum, saved the world from a period of Hitler ruling Europe (the level of his race genocides were not known that that time). <br/><br/>Lastly, there is the ""what if"" historical questions that are mostly left un-inspected. It would be a whole different film, almost a sci-fi one, if they had been dealt with. What I mean is, the pacifist/peace at almost any cost people were not as wrong and/or ignorant as post war sentiment casts them. As someone noted above, the cost of going to war and defeating Hitler was financially staggering and diminished the UK to a second/third tier power after the war. Obviously the cost in lives and human terms was staggering as well. But for Hitler later veering off into genocide, would ""what if"" history have Britain looking as bad for making a deal with Germany to subsist in some form along side a unified Europe under German domination? In a historical context, how different is that history from today's ""history"" post Brexit? <br/><br/>In my opinion this film can't be castigated for not going more into the latter two issues. Films that try to tell too many big stories almost always fail. It captured the emotion and sacrifice that led to a defining moment in history very well. And I can not say often enough how it did that very well while ""Dunkirk"" was an abject abomination on that score. It took a huge, emotionally riveting historical event and somehow made it seem small and tepid."
"richard-1787","10","1","7","24 December 2017"," A remarkable movie
","It's inevitable that this movie will be mentioned with the summer blockbuster *Dunkirk*, since some of it deals with setting up the evacuation of British troops from that French port. You could say that this movie provides the background for *Dunkirk*, and that it does. But it also provides so much more.<br/><br/>While *Dunkirk* was a remarkable example of visual pyrotechnics, planes fighting, ships being blown up, etc., this is a remarkable example of human emotions facing crisis. Nothing blows up, except Churchill's temper. It is really almost a one-man show, in fact, because it spends most of its time focusing on what the Prime Minister went through emotionally and intellectually as he faced the crisis of the German invasion of Holland, Belgium, and France in May 1940, and the collapse of the combined Allied forces in that area that followed in the next several weeks. <br/><br/>(No, by the way, the German forces did NOT outnumber the Allies, nor were they better equipped. The characters in the movie who say that may have believed it, but we now know that it was not true. It was just that the Germans were better strategists than the Allies.)<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is remarkable as Churchill. He shows the outer bluster, but also the inner uncertainties, the hesitations, the fear of repeating the terrible World War I mistake at Gallipoli. This is a very complex character, brought to life in what is certainly an Academic-Award-worthy performance.<br/><br/>None of the other characters, with the partial exception of Churchill's wife, is given anything like that attention. We don't learn why Chamberlain and Hallifax wanted appeasement, though it had failed repeatedly before. We don't learn why King George VI took a long time to come over to Churchill's side, and why he did. This is strictly a one-character character portrayal. But it is very well done and, by the end, profoundly moving.<br/><br/>For myself I have no reservations about this movie. I don't know that I've ever given a 10 before, but this movie deserved one for me. Viewers who have not studied this part of World War II may not follow all that is going on, however, so for some parts of it may be difficult to follow. Then again, millions who knew nothing about this period went to see *Dunkirk* and enjoyed it, so that may not really matter. <br/><br/>As I said, a deeply moving film."

","Having watched this film twice now I can say that Gary Oldman gave the performance of his career and I will be extremely surprised if he does not win the Oscar for best actor. The film is never boring and keeps the story moving in a graceful way. Although it is a film about a truly horrible time in world history it still manages to bring in many instances of humour to break up the solemn mood. The story manages to contain only what is needed, perfectly capturing the mood of the United Kingdom in that time, without dragging the story too far into the war. Once again Gary Oldman manages to give a rousing performance of Churchill's vocal quirks, such as his mumble as well as the emotion conveyed in the low timbre of his voice. Also facial expression still manages to be conveyed even under all of the prosthetics/makeup proving just how great a performance it really is. Highly recommend for all."

","I was horrified by one reviewer who claimed that this film had a 'pat' view of the War, portraying Germans as 'evil fascists.' and the Americans as 'nowhere.' In 1940, when the film is set, the US was 'nowhere,' sitting om the sideline of neutrality and leaving us to struggle on alone. And if we forget that the Nazis were evil fascists we are morally done for. This film reminds us just what we were fighting for and who we were fighting against. Every school child should this film. As with all historical films, a few scenes are imagined, but only to underline Churchill's indisputable courage to continue. Gary Oldman is simply wonderful, conveying with brilliance the many-faceted person Churchill was, as well as his oratorical brilliance, which has never been rivalled. Moved me to tears."

Most of the important dialogue can be found in biographies and accounts by Martin Gilbert, Roy Jenkins, Andrew Roberts and John Lukacs.<br/><br/>The interaction between Churchill & his secretary was invented but it stayed within reasonable bounds (there has to be some way of showing the emotions of a people about to go to war, during a time when the Cabinet was not out on the street giving speeches) ... the ride on the Underground did not happen, but hey, this is a flick, and the people of Britain felt the way the people on the Underground felt, so it works ... Churchill reciting Maccaulay on the Underground, and a black man finishing the last two lines! ... ludicrous, but okay, considering the good qualities of the rest of the film.... the King did not visit Churchill's house; the King didn't grow to like Churchill until later in the war ... but okay.<br/><br/>And the dying, reprehensible Chamberlain really was won over to Churchill's side and away from Halifax.<br/><br/>So all in all ... boffo."
"breheneyjames","10","1","8","17 January 2018"," A brilliant lead performance in a brilliant overall movie.
","'Darkest Hour' is written by Anthony McCarten and directed by Joe Wright. It also features easily the best performance of 2017 delivered by the always great Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill. The film spans the time from Churchill's appointment as Prime Minister to his famous and powerful 'We shall fight them on the beeches' speech in the House of Commons. The cast is stellar all-round with Kristen Scott Thomas as Clementine Churchill, Lily James as Churchill's secretary Elizabeth Layton and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI all giving remarkable performances. Then of course there is the tour de force that is Oldman at the centre of this fabulous ensemble.<br/><br/>The movie has more accomplishments than just its performances however. The screenplay in particular is sharp as well as informative- It is very easy in a film like this for the writer to lose the audience by including excessive political and/or military strategy jargon. Instead Anthony McCarten's dialogue is coherent and engaging and drives the plot forward at a brisk pace. The great writing is coupled with inspired direction from Joe Wright and stunning cinematography courtesy of Bruno Delbonnel. The use of light and shadow, the emotion-filled close-ups and the wonderful tracking shots give the film an admirable visual splendor and grace. The production and costume design are also not to be overlooked which together give the movie a very authentic 1940's look and feel to it. <br/><br/>For me, Gary Oldman's Churchill is as definitive as it gets up there with the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis's Lincoln and Meryl Streep's Margaret Thatcher. Thankfully he's also in one of the finest films of the year. I highly recommend 'Darkest Hour'."
"doorsscorpywag","10","1","8","14 January 2018"," Outstanding Old Man
","Of course it was a rather stylised Hollywood view of what happened. 
But nonetheless it is a fact that a 65 year old Winston Churchill was handed the reigns of a war we seemed totally unprepared for hours before Germany steamrollered into Western Europe.
Churchill was certainly not popular but had warned about the evil of fascism long before Hitler revealed himself to be the monstrous tyrant he actually was.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman of all people captured the essence of the man who took it upon himself to say NO! to appeasing the Nazi and allowing them to become overlords of Western Europe.
His performance was astonishing.<br/><br/>Yes the tube trip was a fantasy and he was never cheered as if he was some American Quarterback or regaled with a shower of order papers.
But he gave my country hope when we had nothing to fight with and were about to lose the only professional army we had.
The pressure on this old man (pun intended) must have been unbelievable.
The other Oldman gives us a feel of what that may have been like.<br/><br/>His relationship with his long time wartime secretary was well played by Lily James even if the timeline was flawed. And Kristin Scott Thomas was very good as Clementine.<br/><br/>The Americans got a cursory nod which was nice to see as they were like the last war nowhere to be seen until it was nearly over so it was good that they were barely acknowledged.
It was Churchill who made it possible to achieve final victory along with our Russian allies by holding England together and imbuing us with the spirit to resist.
I knew many people who were there during those days who said as much.<br/><br/>Churchill indeed fought with words and Gary Oldman gave us a flavour of the man and some of his many flaws. 
He was no great friend to the working man which was why he was replaced by Atlee in the 1945 election.
But as a war leader and a beacon for resistance in the first years of WW2 he probably deserved the accolade of one of the greatest men of the 20th century.<br/><br/>This Hollywood style version has its faults but its subject is not one of them. Played with an Oscar winning panache from the last person I would ever have thought I would see in the role of Winston Churchill.
Flawed? yes. 
Sometimes Hollywood silly? yes but nonetheless a great movie about a great man."

","One of the most outstanding English filmmakers of the X generation, is undoubtedly Joe Wright, who since childhood shows artistic inclinations in painting, theater, TV and finally in 2005 presents his first feature film Pride & Prejudice, achieving a pleasant impression on the public and critics, then among others: Atonement 2007, Anna Karenina 2012 and her most recent film Darkest Hour in 2017.
The film is set in London exactly 80 years ago in May 1940, when the Nazis advanced uncontrollably in Europe and the English government for that reason, faced a political crisis, which ended in the rise of Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister, to the same time that other political rivals pressed for peace to be signed with Germany and thus overthrow Churchill. Aside from Oldman's affinity for the character of Winston (he studied it for a year) and Wright's touch to show the 'phlegm' and behavior of the English and their leaders, the strength of the film lies in the closeness of history with what happened in reality, regarding Churchill's conviction not to surrender against tyranny, to defend their land, their ideas and their freedom, then facing his political rivals he says: ""Nations which go down fighting rise again, and those that surrender tamely are finished"" A decisive moment in the history of the world -as we know it- that meant a great sacrifice, pain and loss of life for the English families, but that in the end with the victory, it was demonstrated that their leader was right not to give up, in another great phrase says to his critics: ""You can not reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth"" A renowned orator and iconic politician, he had to earn the respect of the king as well as his entire people in order to rule.

Although it's easy to see why Gary Oldman was nominated for some many awards for this role. He has played so many different roles that I've actually forgotten what he actually looks like. How can Winston Churhcill, Commissioner Gordon and Sirius Black all be played by the same actor. His facial brand isn't as highly recognizable as someone like Brad Pitt who can be seen in any role.

Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner.

The rest of the cast were excellent as well.
Even though you know the history you are drawn in and feel the time and all its terror and foreboding.
The time in history is captured with the cinematography and much is told visually. Politics is ugly and that was obvious in the scenes in parliament. It made me think of Brexit which is even harder than this decision whether to go to all out war or try to negotiate a peace. I think Britain needs another Churchill right now.
We know his famous speech or one of them in this case but are still riveted to the power of the words. A slice of a moment in history not unknown but revisited with all the emotion and soul searching that happened in 1940.

"CubsandCulture","10","0","4","27 March 2019"," A flawed masterpiece
","I was really taken aback when I first saw this film. I was expecting just another WWII drama with misapplied history and too much fiction. The script more or less gave me that. Centering on the month that Churchill 1st assumed office until Dunkirk and the famous ""we will fight them on..."" speech the film presents a near fictional story of Churchill nearly striking terms with Germany. Apart from that there is ton of ahistoric material involving George VI becoming Churchill's friend. The scripts weaknesses really come to a head during the (out of context) laughably bad underground sequence where Churchill goes directly to the British people for advice. I think the script is so functionary in a film like this. It is probably better to think of this as a morality play as opposed to historical drama.<br/><br/>Because despite all of the script's traditional dramatic trappings Wright really brings to life a wonderfully emotional and striking film. He repeatedly stages scenes in odd and ironic ways that comment on script and the myth of Churchill. For all the script is trying to honor the man Wright's visual selection undermines him and brings to mind his flawed aspects i.e. Churchill's militarism. Best of all, Delbonnel 's work, coupled with the art direction/costumes presents a version of the 40's that is inky mood personified; Many shots of this film look like am oil canvas come to life. Churchill's stubborn refusal to give in is presented in near black and white. Given today's political moment this sort of rousing treatment of the Dunkirk Retreat is very much needed. This is a far better film than Nolan's intellectualized claptrap that came out the same year treating the same subject.<br/><br/>Apart from Wright, Oldman is the other really outstanding aspect of this film. He emotes past a lot of (very good, invisible) make-up to give a really powerful impersonation and performance of iron willed zealot. I have seen the film 3-4 times and I cannot help but to get swept up into the central performance of this film. Apart from Oldman I felt both Thomas and Mendelsohn did a lot in their limited screen time. Thomas absolutely conveys the hot mess that Winston's personal life was. Meanwhile, Mendelsohn is saddled with a technically difficult character. George VI was a stammerer and moreover Firth in the King's Speech was fairly recent, inviting comparisons. Mendelsohn's George VI is more subdued with the stammering but it works in this film. I really like his performance overall given how he manages to stammer without calling attention to it.<br/><br/>Great film."

","There are plenty of films out there that claim to be ""art"" by pushing the boundaries of the medium. These movies often come off as just plain weird. Darkest Hour (2017) is an artfully crafted masterpiece, even if it seems to be a biopic about Winston Churchill at first glance. All the individual elements that go into a fantastic film are in top form here, as we see how lighting, cinematography, music, plot, and acting combine to create something greater than the sum of their parts. Darkest Hour doesn't have one element that makes it stand out as an incredible movie; it uses all facets of its production to create a masterpiece of art.<br/><br/>The look of this film is incredible. From the overhead shots of battlegrounds seamlessly transitioning into the carnage of war to the heavy contrast of light and shadow emphasizing the ""darkness"" of the ""darkest hour,"" the visual spectacle of Churchill's unconventional rise to power is memorable on its own. When you add in Dario Marianelli's fitting score to the visuals, the entire movie comes alive with emotion. Of course, this movie would be nothing without Gary Oldman's Oscar-worthy performance, made all the more impressive by the hair and makeup to transform him into Churchill.<br/><br/>Coupling with The King's Speech (2010) and Dunkirk (2017), Darkest Hour helps to show how dire the situation for the British was during this pivotal moment in World War II. Despite the substantial stakes, the movie never feels too depressing. In fact, there are plenty of moments that are downright hilarious. These moments are mixed in with poignant scenes that help to bring the humanity of the situation to the audience's attention. I'm a little disappointed this movie had such fierce competition in the categories it was nominated in, as I'm sure it would have won a lot more of them if it came out in any other year.<br/><br/>An artful piece of history, I give Darkest Hour 5.0 stars out of 5."

","Not often that I see an actor in a getup and I find it hard to recognize him at first glare.

Besides this, the acting of Gary Oldman and the direction of Joe Writght allowed the viewers to view every aspect of Winston Churchill, his in-office and in-house frame of mind.<br/><br/>The historical events were somewhat fictional because I research every event and then map them into reality, so that I don't mix my historical facts. This flaw on its own could have debacled the movie if it had not been the Award-winning performance of Oldman.

","With only days until the Nazis wipe out the remaining allied forces in Dunkirk, Winston Churchill is elected as the prime minister following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain. In what seems to be a lost cause, Darkest Hour follows Churchill and his decision, between peace talks with the ruthless Hitler, or the controversial decision to fight to the death, risking hundreds of thousands of young mens lives and possibly the fall of Britain. Backed by a party that has virtually no support for him, Churchill must not only appease his party but also win over the support of the general public, a task especially challenging with the imminent German advance. The only clear path Churchill sees is war - Despite the looming refuge of peace talks.
As Dunkirk's time grows near, estimates are that it would be lucky to get even 10% of the 300 000 soldiers out alive. With the addition of this grim statistic, more and more party members are being allured by the promises of negotiations. With the fall of France just over the horizon, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax beg Churchill to at least consider peace talks. Nevertheless, Churchill continues to push for a way to get the soldiers out, even if it means sacrificing the men situated at Calais. Amidst the chaos, Churchill puts forth operation Dynamo as a last resort, where civilian boats would be used to rescue the men stuck at Dunkirk.
Following the failure of the Calais plan, leading to thousands of unnecessary casualties, Churchill capitulates to the desperate peace talk negotiations. But before entering into talks with prime minister Mussolini, Churchill decides to take a trip on the underground, where support from average citizens once again renews Churchill's ardor to fight. Armed with a new fire, Churchill storms into Parliament to deliver his first speech, showing his indisposition to peace talks, stating that they must have ""victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival."""

","It's hard to believe the same guy was Sid Vicious in 1986, and Winston Churchill in 2017. 'Darkest Hour' really is the Gary Oldman showcase film. His performance is well deserving of the Best Actor Academy Award. I just wish the film had been as consistent and free-flowing as Oldman's acting.<br/><br/>The more I learn about Churchill, the less I seem to like about him. This film is no exception. It definitely portrays Winston as quite an incapable Prime Minister at times - which further illustrated what I have been reading lately.<br/><br/>The film felt a bit disjointed at times, though picked up toward the end. It was hard not to get a bit angry or frustrated towards the politicians being incapable of anything but infighting among themselves. It's definitely a ""yelling film"", which grew tiresome. Lots of yelling. Which if not for Gary Oldman, I'd say gets all too often confused for ""strong dramatic acting"". Though a shout out should also go to Ben Mendelsohn's excellent support performance as King George VI.<br/><br/>My heart definitely went out to the brave soldiers whose lives were in the front-lines, while these muffins sat puffing cigars at desks.<br/><br/>Oldman delivered strong renditions of Churchill's famous speeches, though it was the London Underground scene which was by far the highlight of the film for me. Churchill's also not short of quotable lines either:<br/><br/>""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."""

","Winston Churchill is one of history's most enigmatic figures. As Great Britain watches Europe fall to the Nazis, most of the leaders sit, hands in their pockets, trying to figure out what to do. Neville Chamberlain has sold the country out, thinking he has become buddies with Hitler. Of course, the scourge of history would simply see that as avoiding an obstruction. So the call on gnarly old Winston, whose reputation in other confrontations is not that good (according to this film). So we are going to see a biographical presentation of this great man. What we get is a guy that can't go twenty minutes without downing four fingers of whiskey or smoking a dozen cigars a day. He is doddering and forgetful. That's OK. Maybe that was him. I suspect not quite as severe. While this movie portrays the time pretty accurately, they repeatedly stick him in situations where he can deliver pithy comments. A secretary, the young woman who portrayed Rose on Downton Abby, is his confidante. There is a scene on the subway. Did any of this ever take place. I know it is historical ""fiction,"" but we deserve a bit more. It's not a terrible movie, hence my rating, but don't write a book report using the events presented here."

Oldman manages to grasp the gravitas of churchills accent and speeches with ease. The movie revolves around the darkest hour of Britain in which most of the British army is essentially stuck on the beach of Dunkirk. This movie plays as the ""behind the scenes"" to Christopher Nolans ""Dunkirk"" as the British generals and Winston decide what to do in this ghastly situation. The director Joe wright known for his excessive tracking shots includes many in this movie, one in particular is when Churchill is out on the roof and overhead planes pass, the camera (along with CGI) starts at the face of Churchill and travels up to the planes in one shot.

After a period of appeasement has clearly failed at the hands of Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), Churchill is selected by England's King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) to serve as prime minister and steer Parliament and the British Empire toward a path to victory.<br/><br/>What 'Hour' does particularly well is show how authentic Churchill was; a reluctant but willing soldier. The film is inextricably tied to Oldman's performance - without him, this could have been a very different end product. He has everything down to the hoarse chuckle and mannerisms, which explains why he was handed an Academy Award for the performance. But the supporting cast really does a great job not being completely eclipsed. Lily James is an especially bright star, as she portrays Churchill's trusted typist, Elizabeth, in a way that shows a range of emotions, from fear, to empathy, to pride.<br/><br/>'Hour' is a period drama, so is not intended to feature all of the bells and whistles that big budget blockbusters are known for. Instead, it's a combination of Oldman's on point portrayal of Churchill, smart dialogue and a chilling score that are what make 'Hour' the solid film that it is.<br/><br/>It's true that hollywood has saturated theaters with WWII-set films over the years, but 'Darkest Hour' is a good example of how there are still some gems to be found in the rough."

The whole movie spins around the figure of Winston Churchill and successes to present the deep duality of the former British PM. A person filled by flaws and of rather rude character, but stubborn enough to inspire both the people and the politicians. 
The recreation of places in the movie is perfect. Some of them can be visited in London (the Parlament, the Army's bunker under it, etc.).
Possibly the negative votes (almost 2000 people rating it under 3) might come from those opposing the political figure of Churchill. Personally, I think that regardless one's opinion about him as a political figure, both the movie and its representation of the events is rather accurate. 
On the negative side, some additions of non-historical events, that increase the cinematographic power of the script but were unnecessary."

The actor who portrays Chamberlain is quite good as are most of the supporting players. <br/><br/>The role of his personal secretary/typist is given more weight than I had heard about prior to the film.<br/><br/>It's amazing that so many in government refused to see what Churchill saw re: Hitler. There are many parallels between what was happening then, with what is happening now with the rise of Trumpism, which many, but certainly not all, see as nefarious. As I write this the anti-Trumpers hold a 'small' majority . . . we'll see how this plays out in history. <br/><br/>Churchill was a man of vision and could see what many others refused to see . . . which could also be said of the Republican majority in Congress at this time. <br/><br/>One of the most moving parts of the film is when he rides the London Underground and chats with the common folk and hears their voice, which is contrary to what the appeasers are seeking. Now, in America, the voice of the people will loudly be heard in the upcoming midterm elections in November. Bannon says it will be an "". . . up and down vote on Trump"" and I tend to agree with him. My opinion, Trump has conned millions of Americans in believing his lies. Any fact checking site will tell you that this man is perhaps the biggest and most frequent liar to rise this far in American government.<br/><br/>Churchill was a man of vision and Oldman does a wonderful job of portraying him. W.C. was able to think outside the box and order civilian transport (by sea) to save many lives in Dunkirk!<br/><br/>I'm amazed Chamberlain continued to hold such sway and influence 'after' his ousting. The fact that he wasn't seen as an impotent appeaser much earlier is rather amazing. Many experts have said for quite a while now that those who appease and enable the current POTUS will not be remembered well by historians."

The Brits have once again shown our Hollywood egotistical dames, dans and over glorified snowflakes what it is to perfect the craft of ACTING. Oldman is nothing short of amazing. He totally becomes Churchill. It is as if we have all been allowed to glimpse once again what took place some 70 years ago as if it happened yesterday. Recent films from the Brits, such as ""Dunkirk"", the Branaugh re-make of ""Murder on the Orient Expresss"" and now ""Darkest Hour,"" continue to reaffirm over and over what true talent is and that, sadly, in America, Hollywood - for the most part - has missed the boat on every level. Those true American actors who appeared in ""Murder"" were elevated by Branaugh's genius to their best performances. Most of our American actors pale by comparison.

","This film explores the narrow line between victory and defeat. Winston Churchill was and still is a great leader that led Britain from the jaws of defeat into victory and this film describes that moment beautifully, For me there was a little too much emphasis on his legendary drinking and today we are not going to know the full reality in that area. There are some English speakers crticising Churchill today who would not be alive today or be free to speak criticism, if it were not for him.<br/><br/>Both my parents lived through and participated in World War II and everyone that I knew from that generation said that without Churchill we would have lost the war. I believe those that were there and not the armchair critics of today.<br/><br/>The level of betrayal by some people within Parliament and in the aristocracy was something that I had not really appreciated before this film and I am sure that this film has got that right. Now I can see why Rudolph Hess, the Deputy Leader of the German Nazi Party thought it was safe to parachute into Scotland. Luckily for us he was caught and arrested by a humble honest farmer and never made it to the the traitorous aristocrats that he expected to help him.<br/><br/>These are lessons that we need to learn and remember."

"nairtejas","8","0","1","28 July 2018"," Molecule Review: Darkest Hour (8 Stars)
","There's a scene in director Joe Wright's Darkest Hour where Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) travels by the tube and mingles with the citizens of his country. As he walks into the Underground, it feels like any other peculiar scene from the film, but then he finds himself inside a tube car with people around him, standing awestruck and in adoration and respect. I was sitting here in my chair with the same feeling as Oldman's Churchill begins talking while his team is discussing an important treaty in other part of the city. There is no doubt that Darkest Hour is an intelligent drama made with enough doses of humor, politics, and embellishments that usually make up a World War II film, but what works for it is the perfect coagulation of all the ingredients. Watching Darkest Hour is like drinking a gallon of water in the middle of a night. The pleasure that you derive from it - be it from Oldman's terrifically nuanced performance or Dario Marianelli's exhilarating score - will have at least a full-day effect on you. It is a 'slice of history' film made in a way to appease its audience, and I, for one, am thoroughly impressed. It's an energetic affair that will make you get up from your chair, rush to the street, and dance like you have just won a war. TN."

","In the era of military operations, evacuation missions and sentiment injected war dramas, we have often failed to realize that another side of a coin that makes a currency whole. Rewinding back to 1940, World War 2, to peril inflicted locations mainly Britain and France, ""Darkest Hour"" showcases the retelling of the parallels of the Dunkirk evacuation. This movie boasts from a grounded point of view, exploring the very basic human emotions like regret, self-doubt, and courage embedding them all together in a beautiful mixture of political fiascos. Parliament debates, votes, political thrills all stuffed inside the same hat, particularly the hat happens to pertain to Sir Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman).<br/><br/>download<br/><br/>The film explores Churchill's early controversial days while being surrounded by the close-to-the-chest rivals in his cabinet. There is a constant threat of the Nazis being precariously close to annexing the United Kingdom at the backdrop, leading to a linear increase of the anxiety till the end of the film. The hopelessness of Chamberlain's perspective, the edginess during cabinet meetings and Churchill's eccentricity form the backbone of the movie.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the movie is inculcated in the very first scene, where Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is accused of being incapable of leading the parliament. The typical scenario of a house packed political debate replete with grey haired individuals making Klaxons sound futile unfolds smoothly. When Winston Churchill assumes the position of Prime Minister in the very beginning, it's the balance of the modern world resting on his shoulders which he realizes soon enough.<br/><br/>When peace seemed to be crucial to be attained at any cost, Churchill's opposite perspective creates a rift among the members and the Prime Minister. His clear struggle to establish a balance between the crisis and the tempting desire to yield to surrender is beautifully depicted adding a human ground to an eccentric roof.<br/><br/>When wars are waged, the swords and guns are the ones which are eagerly taken out initially. We fail to acknowledge the presence of words and oration that can truly make a difference sparing the arms and ammunition to a far greater extent. The way diplomacy, when done right can play an important role is slightly highlighted which pinpoints modern-day leaders. The powerful speech cementing their unbreakable faith to protect their Homeland, ""We shall fight on the beaches"", is a very testament to the finest degrees of oration, and how language can change the course of action. Indeed, ""Churchill just mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/> Gary Oldman's performance is perhaps one of his lifetimes. Buried under deep prosthetics deeming him unrecognizable, he submerges himself into the grumpy character of Churchill making us live his very experiences. The tantrum throwing man-child, the fierce but emotionally frail carrying the weight of the world was depicted as a fascinating historical figure cementing that history wouldn't have been the same without him. Supporting characters were adjusted here and there, like King George VI(Ben Mendelsohn), downplaying his stammering defect, was a surprising but satisfying casting. Elizabeth (Lily James), the typist girl was depicted as a victim of Churchill's eccentricity and was more of an onlooker to the events around her. Winston's wife, Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas) was perhaps the most underused yet useful additions in the script. Her unbreakable faith in her husband was an homage to the fact that a man under pressure needs nothing but love and support from his loved ones.<br/><br/>The game changer, however, was the London tube sequence where all the boundaries of caste, race, religion, and prejudice were demolished. A narrative device perhaps meant to moisten the eyes was perhaps the most defining sequence of the film out of the deck. However, the credibility of such a sequence was questionable as the fact that a decision could be taken just through an interaction between civilians quite briefly was borderline cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>As historical and peril stricken this movie claimed to be, there were a few melodramatic moments that did pull it down. The over-saturation of Churchill's presence in every frame felt moderately claustrophobic; especially when the necessity to show him taking a dump was considered. It didn't end up being a gem, as it was masqueraded but more of a significant watch. Perhaps the multiple takes on the World Wars have stagnated its genre, or maybe because of Christopher Nolan's recent take on Dunkirk. Many parallels can be drawn from both films that cross cut at various points considering that one of them is a behind the scene story and the latter a war ground drama (prequels anyone?). Churchill's courage and determination throughout is something commendable that not many world leaders would warm up to today. It's a queer disappointment that the narrative was lost somewhere in the fumes of war and Winston's vices. Nevertheless, a political drama that prolifically combines human nature, the war inside and outside themselves and a bearable history lesson for all prove more informative than your basic history lesson. Towards the end, we'd end up surprised how many times the phrase- ""We shall never surrender"" can hum in our ears."

"jamesrupert2014","7","0","2","8 June 2018"," Oldman excellent in otherwise mediocre biopic
","""Darkest Hour"" presents a somewhat hagiographic portrayal of Winston Churchill in the days leading up to the Dunkirk evacuation. Churchill is depicted as a steadfast defender of England in the face of both the ruthlessly efficient German army and the hapless conciliators in his own government, such as Neville Chamberlin and Lord Halifax, who see negotiating with Hitler as the way to peace. The clock is ticking, as 300,000 Allied troops are encircled on the beaches of Dunkirk and hard decisions must be made. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Oldman's much-lauded performance a standout, but the movies suffers from historical inaccuracies (discussed at length elsewhere). The scene where the Prime Minister suddenly leaves his chauffeur-driven car and boards an Underground train where he can gauge the opinions of a suspiciously diverse group of Londoners is a particularly egregious example of 'fake history', allegedly inserted to spare modern audiences from the monochrome reality of 1940's British politics. There are also some gimmicky camera tricks that could have been dispensed with. Many people who dislike Churchill feel that films such as this do little to present the darker side of his history and politics. While I have no problem with the perspective the filmmaker's chose, and I appreciate that some dramatic license is often necessary to tell a complex story in a short window, making up facts undermines the credibility of historical films, and, at least to me, diminishes their educational and entertainment value."

But...early in the war... in one month...May 1940, Joe Wright's film shows how Churchill was ...almost...pressured by others in the British government into settling with Hitler. <br/><br/>If you know anything about 1940's Hitler, Britain likely would have become a hamstrung vassal of Nazi Germany rather than a free but isolated state. But then, as now, some politicians live in isolation bubbles of their own making.<br/><br/>Two women show you Churchill through their reactions/words...The young secretary to Churchill shows you perhaps the common person's view of him... Clementine, a strong queenlike woman, Churchill's wife, who sometimes worked to temper Churchill's outbursts, gently prepares him for the expected leadership. Hints of the Clementine revealed in their daughter Lady Mary Soames' bio of Clementine come through. <br/><br/>Movie is a good intro into why Churchill was a great man. Suitable for junior high and above students. 
--------
Extra note...When this film came out, many (including director Joe Wright) scornfully spoke against US President Donald Trump and any favorable comparison of him with Churchill. But it's way too early to compare ANY active world leader with Churchill.<br/><br/>First, 1930s Churchill was considered ""a voice in the wilderness"" and a 
""warmonger"" for some years before...he gained traction as his prophecies of Hitler as dangerous...came true. Churchill made his decisions (most WW 2 decisions were good) but then then his time in office...came to an end. His record is done. Finished.<br/><br/>Thus, People may wish to forego comparisons with any living, active world leader. The hot tempers of current politics--the active name calling need to cool...rational judgment needs to be used-- to sort through any current leader's deeds...and then the long view of history might give you a better perspective of that leader. <br/><br/>Remember also, Churchill was once despised and called ""a warmonger"". His early tirades against the Nazi buildup made him look like a ""rabble-rouser"". <br/><br/>Churchill's life and works are done. finished. Yes, there are some dubious spots on his record, but overall he succeeded in the most important task he had...of rallying Britain to defeat the Nazis.<br/><br/>It's way too early to compare Churchil to President Trump (or indeed any other active leaders). Let time pass. Let long history discard the silliness of name calling and let historians sort through the long consequences of Pres. Trump's or indeed-- any other leader's decisions."

I myself watch this movie because of him.

"antoniokowatsch","7","0","1","19 May 2018"," Historically accurate
","This movie is a historically accurate depiction of the early days of World War II from the perspective of then-prime minister Winston Churchill. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is a little bit inconsistent; in the sense that the first 40 minutes or so were rather boring. The pacing was just too slow and not much was happening. I almost lost interest but then the movie started to shine with it's performances and the pacing adjusted itself accordingly. It was a pleasant surprise that totally changed everything.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is a seasoned actor so his performance as Winston Churchill was understandably thrilling. But even though he was ""unrecognizable"" in the movie, thanks to the great make-up artistry, he still didn't quite end up looking like Winston Churchill, in my humble opinion. Winston Churchill had those big friendly-looking eyes. You just can't imitate that with make-up.<br/><br/>The calendar date overlay transitions were a really nice touch. They keep the viewer in the loop and provide a frame of reference. That way viewers are able to develop a good understanding of the time frame in which the events ensue. 
It works rather well with the format of the movie. Sure, it may seem a little gimmicky at first (that's at least what I thought when I first saw that transition) but it turns out to suit the movie quite well.<br/><br/>
Quick synopsis:
Churchill is underplaying the threat that Germany is posing until things start going south. In order to avoid a total FUBAR in Dunkirk he tries an unconventional strategic move to ""bring the boys home"".<br/><br/>Viscount Halifax tries to undermine Churchill's authority by asking him tough questions concerning the principle of peace. He believes that Churchill's stubbornness may worsen the already problematic situation.
While it may seem like Halifax is the ""bad guy"" he's really just trying to do the right thing for the British people, just like Churchill. But both clash throughout the entirety of the movie because they have different perspectives. 
Halifax is the typical diplomat while Churchill is more of a ""Britain first"" type of person. Churchill considered Hitler too great of a threat to be reasoned with. <br/><br/>Most of the action happens in the war cabinet. And with Halifax as the opposing force to Churchill things get heated every now and then. Halifax believes that Europe is lost to the Germans and tries to play it safe by means of negotiation.
Churchill on the other hand wants to ""fight"" until the very end. Being certain that negotiating with the Germans would be useless. Churchill is unapologetic and comes off as rude most of the time, but he has his heart in the right place.<br/><br/>Churchill's relationship with the King was very interesting and nuanced. It was one of the main themes that was gradually explored during the movie. Which kind of makes sense; as the prime minister you are obligated to meet with the King/Queen once per week. It was therefore executed in a very thoughtful manner.<br/><br/>
Side note: if you plan on watching ""Dunkirk"" you should probably watch this movie first. You'll thank me later. Those two movies perfectly compliment each other and should be watched together in the aforementioned order.<br/><br/>To conclude: It was a great movie. If it wasn't for the slow pacing at the beginning I would have given it a slightly higher rating.<br/><br/>
Final verdict: recommended (if you like historical biopics)"

","Gary Oldman's showy yet honest and at times forceful depiction of Winston Churchill, pilots the events of early 1940s Britain and Churchill's start as Prime Minister. Winston Churchill is a figure who remains ever-present in the public's ""Greatest Britons"" analogues and over the past year or so, we have seen his image put on the five-pound note. There is certainly a romanticized view of the Great Briton and so too does Darkest Hour add a touch of gloss and shine to the esteemed former Prime Minister, occasionally to nauseating results.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour also marks the second major film release in the last year to use the Dunkirk evacuation as a romantic showcase of British pride and values, the first being Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk but while Dunkirk displayed the touching will of spirit in the troops, Darkest Hour takes us to the war rooms and political backdrop of those events. What director Joe Wright does with excellence is keeping the narrative entertaining but also unapologetic about its heavy dialogue scenes. Wright manages to burst vibrancy and urgency into 1940s Britain following proceedings that could have easily fallen into clichÃ©d dull and lifeless political chatter, instead much of the cinematography is inspired, energetic and fresh which mirrors Gary Oldman's portrayal of Churchill, gone is the presumed brooding grump and here is by all accounts an honest portrayal of Churchill in his spirited and humorous self.<br/><br/>Further in the realm of honesty and attention to detail is the costuming, casting and portrayals by most if not all of the cast members. There is a real sense of fact and respect of it throughout, the mise en scene is engrossing in its capturing of the time and these people, the project is layered with accuracy. However, at times the film's romanticised agenda gets in the way of its drama, one scene that stands out contains Churchill boarding the underground alone to produce a consensus from the people. While it has a flair of touching spirit to it, it plays off as a loathsome interjection of current world politics affecting its portrayal of true events and stops the drama in its tracks and anchors down the final act of the film.<br/><br/>There are also missteps with its narrative tone, much of the film eludes any analytical look into Churchill and his decisions and instead it acts as a British Second World War 101 class (Not necessarily bad if you no very little about Churchill), brushing over events lightly and playing off opposing opinions to Churchill as cowardly when the film should have been taking part in more of a discussion, instead it plays heavily into its agenda. Despite this Gary Oldman is lost once again in his performance and looks almost unrecognisable although there is still a touch of Oldman there. I was not particularly wowed by Oldman's shapeshifting into Churchill, but there is little doubt that it takes tremendous talent and effort to even give a good performance behind prosthetic and Oldman goes above box standard portrayal and is thoroughly gripping throughout the movie, never distracting. He certainly is Darkest Hour's finest moment."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>As a big Gary Oldman fan, I was excited to see him sink his teeth into the role of Winston Churchill. The film opens with the end of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's tenure and the beginning of Churchill's. He is thrust into navigating the political waters of negotiating peace or going to war with NAZI Germany as well as at home with appeasing or irritating various political parties, including his own. All this occurring during the month of May in 1940 and one of his core objectives to safely return over 300,000 British soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. The film is full of communicative shot framing, aggressive use of colors and to my surprise had some very funny moments. Kudos to the makeup team who convincingly morphed Oldman into Churchill. Overall, it focuses on real life moments while mixing in some fictional scenes for a dramatic touch and Oldman earned his Oscar win!"

","One day in a year is usually something you will not remember several years later, but as regards this movie, it will not be the case. Nothing will ever jeopardize the remembrance of this day in my memory: January 3rd, 2018, release date of Darkest hour. This masterpiece of historic and drama movie explores many faces of Churchill's personality and destiny at the head of the United Kingdom in the darkest hours of British history, from 1940 to 1945: sometimes in his private life within his own family, most of the time as the Prime minister and Head of the War cabinet. We learn, for example, that he had a truly great sense of humour, even when it came to financial issues he had to cope with, but also a great sense of duty, speech qualities in the House of Commons, and a strong will to stand firm against the enemies of the United Kingdom until the final victory, in 1945. Moreover, Gary Oldman perfectly shows the greatness of this historical figure with his actor's style, imitating many of the character's personality traits, and thereby making the connection between the spectator and Churchill in the movie even stronger. All in all, I do recommend watching this movie and as another critic wrote: "" It should be mandatory viewing for ALL !"""
"grantss","9","0","3","25 April 2018"," Superb, with an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman
","May, 1940. Germany has invaded Belgium and Holland and poised to invade France. UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain resigns and Winston Churchill assumes the role of Prime Minister. Churchill was an outsider for the role and many of his colleagues have misgivings about his abilities. Even the King has issues with Churchill. From the outset Churchill is opposed to any negotiation with Germany but as the situation in France worsens, certain members of his cabinet think that suing for peace may the best course of action. This not only troubles him deeply but puts his position in jeopardy. <br/><br/>Superb docu-drama. Edifying, capturing the situation of the war well and how perilous England's situation was at the time. The issues Churchill inherited and the problems he faced are explored well.<br/><br/>Good plot development, and quite accurate, historically. There are a few dramatic devices thrown in to help the story along. These generally don't tamper with the bigger picture though do feel a bit manipulative on occasion. <br/><br/>Quite an emotional and stirring conclusion.<br/><br/>Superb performance by Gary Oldman as Churchill. Virtually unrecognisable - the film's make-up department did an amazing job - Oldman captures Churchill's mannerisms perfectly. Churchill appears as a multi-dimensional character - strong but vulnerable, strong-willed but with moments of indecision, hero and anti-hero - and this is largely thanks to Oldman's deft handling of the role. Gary Oldman won the 2018 Best Actor Oscar for his performance - the first Oscar of his career - and truly deserved it.<br/><br/>Also deserving of their Oscar was the film's makeup team which won Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling.<br/><br/>Good supporting performances from a cast that includes Kristin Scott Thomas (as Clementine Churchill), Lily James, Stephen Dillane (as Viscount Halifax) and Ben Mendelsohn (as King George VI)."

","This movie contains lots of stagy acting with character depictions that approach the brink of caricature. Gary Oldham's portrayal of Churchill is especially cheesy. Nevertheless, this movie includes some powerfully dramatic scenes showing Churchill's self-doubts and indecisiveness over whether to negotiate with Hitler. Those familiar with the history of World War Two know how Churchill resolves this dilemma, but for those less familiar with the history, the theatrics contain much drama. Will he or won't he cave in? Will Britain become another France? To find out the answer, read a history book about the period or watch the movie. Either way, you will learn something interesting."
"natalierosen-81679","10","0","4","16 April 2018"," Brilliant performance
","Gary Oldman plays Winston Churchill so well that I forgot about the actor and thought I was watching Churchill himself resurrected from the dead. This film is that good.<br/><br/>I have not finished it yet but the 3/4 I did see concentrated on the miserable circumstances of the battle of Dunkirk in 1940 and Churchill's heart wrenching decision whether to seek a diplomatic solution with a psychologically sick unreliable (to say the least) Hitler or press on refusing to surrender. The losses of the Brits and French at Dunkirk were many and the German military the most superior on earth in the 1940's. Brits were stuck in this French town and surrounded by superior German forces in land, sea and air honed through their many victories in Europe. One by one western Europe was falling as Belgium fell, eastern Europe was in Nazi hands and Nazi victory seemed inevitable. Nothing less than Western civilization was at stake. Churchill desperately needed American strength but Roosevelt while empathetic to their plight in 1940 could do nothing as there was no legislature support nor popular appetite to get stuck in another war in Europe.<br/><br/>From the history I have read the evacuation by boat of the 198,000 British and 140,000 French and Belgian troops was miraculous. They were saved from an untenable situation and total decimation of their army at Dunkirk. They were miraculously helped by the Halt Order of Hitler the rationale of that Order still debated today. It was a spiritual victory for the Allies and set the table for Allied victory with American much needed help finally culminating in the 1944 D-Day Allied invasion by sea of Europe.<br/><br/>The film shows perfectly the resolve by Churchill, his strong and quirky personality with a monumental task laid in his hands and no prediction of victory. He was a force of nature.<br/><br/>If one is interested in WWII history shaping our own history to present day this film is highly recommended."

","""Darkest Hour"" or the film that shows you Churchill's life for two hours. It tells us the story of Winston Churchill between 1940 and 1945, when he was the Prime Minister of Great Britain. you have surely understood it, the story takes place during World War 2. Gary Oldman, the main actor (he plays Churchill, of course) won the Oscar of the best actor for his performance. I think he deserves it, but I also think that he is a bit too much on screen. And that is what makes me dislike (or ""less like"", you choose) the film. It could have been a 10/10 if it had been a bit more about what happened in France, so there would have been more action. Also, there are some scenes that were very, very, very long. And that is one more penalty on the final mark. Indeed, the film is 2h05 long, but I'm sure it could have fit in 1h50. Well, I told you all the bad things I could tell you about the film, but there are lots of things that are good. As the title of my review says, this is the best film that a Churchill lover can see. But if you're not a fanatic, you will like it all the same. So, enjoy!"

","Great experience, I saw lots of films about Churchill's life but this one was stunning ! It is about the 2nd World War in London. The film explains how Churchill became Prime Minister and focuses on the big deal he was faced with. In a country where power is shared between the Prime Minister and the king, Churchill had to choose between fighting against the Nazi party or find a way to get peace through negociation with Hitler. I was hooked. So much emotion, we can hear impressive speeches , see compassion, love, courage and passion. I was happy to see humour, and sarcastic moments. Well done to the actors, I am glad to see that we can still share emotion and enthrall the public. Also, the sets are great. I loved all the catchy music. For me it was one of the best ideas to mix stirring music with thrilling music. The last point that I would like to present you is the main character, Gary Oldman, special mention to him. We can see, from the opening scene until the last one: Churchill's mannerisms perfectly acted.

The politicking against him is well documented, and as a character piece this is accurate, and well portrayed by Oldman. However, having read a biography of Churchill, I was troubled by one scene, which was pivotal, but actually fictitious. Whilst I understand that this is film, not a documentary, I still felt it jarred slightly. It didn't ruin the film for me, as overall this was well done."

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library system. I was a decent student back in high school but I learned more WW2 history this year than ever before with this movie and its inadvertent companion, ""Dunkirk.""<br/><br/>Where ""Dunkirk"" started with British and French troops hemmed in at Dunkirk by German troops, and depicts the miracle evacuation of most of those 400,000 men, this movie ""Darkest Hour"" depicts what was going on in England during those days, focusing on the ""war room"" and newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman received many awards for his performance, in elaborate makeup, as Winston Churchill. His awards are well-earned as I was almost able to forget that I was watching an actor. Churchill in total is a controversial person but in this one specific case, with the future of Great Britain as stake, his being adamant about fighting until the end rather than negotiate with Germany was a turning point in WW2.<br/><br/>It is a long movie at just over two hours but never boring, always interesting, even though certainly some details were changed or fabricated for dramatic effect. Still it is a remarkably good movie and a great companion to the other movie, ""Dunkirk."""

This film takes place in London during World War II. The Nazis had invaded Belgium and wanted to do the same with the rest of Europe. We are following Winston Churchill, played by Gary Oldman, the Prime Minister of Great-Britain from 1940 to 1945. He succeeded Neville Chamberlain and stood firm against collaborating with the Nazis. The movie is a great summary of all this tense period, when Churchill had to take important decisions. In addition, Gary Oldman's actor's game is astonishing ! It only took me a few minutes before I was fascinated by this man. Throughout his emotions, his sense of humor and his personality traits, I could really imagine how stressful it was to carry the future of one's country ! Supporting roles are also very convicing.

"jrarichards","10","0","5","1 April 2018"," Huge success for Oldman ... with more than a little help from dear Winston
","And so to Joe Wright and Anthony McCarten's much-vaunted and Oscar-rewarded ""Darkest Hour"", which I caught up with after so much had already been said about it, on IMDb and elsewhere.<br/><br/>The first thing worth noting is that this is a Churchill film and a wartime Britain film more than it is a war film. It covers just a small part of the entire conflict, and shows even that in vignette form. The most compelling of these concerns the late May 1940 ""Defence of Calais"", which I must confess I had not even heard of. Many thanks to the makers for raising this issue, though slightly less praise for their take on it, given that Wikipedia tells us that: a) this was a British-French operation, b) although it did cost 300 British lives (+200 wounded) that was out of 4000, so this was NOT quite a suicidal bloodbath, c) 3500 Brits were captured, along with many thousands of French, and d) a few British troops were actually rescued from the port. <br/><br/>In any case, Calais may have achieved - at least in part - the mission Churchill had for it, and that is a fascinating and profoundly heroic story that must be recalled. <br/><br/>Dunkirk is shown as a single (not especially convincing) scene, though its success (and Winston's success therein) is of course referred to.<br/><br/>So otherwise, we are down to a film about wartime Britain, whose ordinary people and at-times humdrum way of life are lionised, as they were in other recent offerings like ""Their Finest"". This stands in clear opposition to the portrayal of aristocratic types like Chamberlain and Halifax, who are seen here intent on suing for peace with Hitler, in the face of what they deem certain defeat and an unwinnable situation.<br/><br/>We must be careful with our reception of these portrayals (ordinary Brits then were of course at times rude, selfish, cowardly, profiteering and full of moans, and some even went on strike). Yet it is now impossible for many of us to remain dry-eyed when we have the ordinary people of 1940 shown to us, and more so when we imagine the contrast between them and the part-complicit, part-enslaved folk of Nazi Germany. <br/><br/>History must have its way - and from the perspective of 2018, every single man, woman and child in the wartime UK was just simply a hero doing his or her bit. End of.<br/><br/>That said, this film's pressing (and actually fully justified) need to somehow symbolise the circumventing of slimy politicians and other layers of authority to expose the visceral (guts-dominated) link between Churchill and the mass of the British people comes close to derailing the whole effort, with a Tube-train scene so incongruous and near-embarrassing that one has to ""close one's eyes and think of England"" in order to bat on with the piece at all! <br/><br/>Of course, the effort to swallow this heavy touch of the naff is well rewarded! <br/><br/>And so to Churchill, and a Gary Oldman portrayal that obviously rises above all else here. Nevertheless, Kristin Scott Thomas does well (as she always does) in the role of wife Clemmie, while Ben Mendelsohn offers an impressively conviction performance as King George VI. A couple of scenes of the unlikely and at-first-awkward pairing between the King and Winston really hit home, and are both highly informative and deeply touching.<br/><br/>But Oldman's Churchill is memorable in the truest sense, since one comes back to it repeatedly in the days after the cinema visit. It is not quite mimicry (of the voice, for example), and indeed it offers a touch of what we have not seen before - an at times rather tongue-tied, spluttery and undecided Winston, soused in alcohol and veiled in cigar smoke, oldish and even a touch confused. <br/><br/>And, needless to say, and as the star freely admitted, the Oldman performance here, and indeed ""Darkest Hour"" as a whole, would not be what it is if Churchill had not been the man HE was. His simply endless list of pithy quotes finds quite rich reflection in the film, and we do indeed see a not-much-liked man of battered reputation who now begins taking brilliant decisions and does indeed ""mobilise the English language and send it into battle"". <br/><br/>When our hero really needs to be eloquent he can be so, and when he needs to be sober he is. He is supremely literate, cultured yet crude, vigorous and impetuous, childish and supremely mature. As in life, so here, he cries at the terrible decisions he must take, yet takes them just the same. Oldman offers us all of this, and somehow hints at background and depth he does not even present or protray. He embodies so surprisingly much of the Churchill we have read about. You know, the bricklaying historian, the experienced soldier and former POW, the Nobel Prizewinning writer, the racconteur, the painter of paintings, the loyal and loving husband, dumb school pupil and near-genius, the boy neglected by both parents, the son of a dissatisfied (and syphilis-crazed) father, the Tory (but also defecting to the Liberals) toff who could never be loved by ordinary people yet was (until 1945 when he suddenly wasn't), the maker of bad or controversial decisions and the greatest hero we have ever produced. <br/><br/>The man who saved civilisation from unutterable evil.<br/><br/>We have already seen countless portrayals of Churchill, and all have added something to our understanding of this impossible, wonderful man. <br/><br/>But none have quite managed what Gary Oldman has managed ... of course with a great deal of help from Winston himself."

","Churchill's predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, resigns in May 1940 because the House of Commons loses confidence in him. Winston Churchill replaces him as prime minister and promises to never surrender to Adolf Hitler. But he's isolated, and virtually no one in the House of Commons supports his position on British resistance. Additionally, British troops are marooned on Dunkirk and Calais. Can he overcome this impending doom and persuade the House of Commons to support his decision?<br/><br/>The production design is authentic (and claustrophobic), but superior. Cinematography is beneficial (that over-head tracking shot of France (?) being bombed then revealing a dead soldier fascinates me). The supporting cast gives serviceable performances from Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI to Lily James as the loyal secretary. But, of course, the real strength is Gary Oldman's tour-de-force portray of Winston Churchill. He's determined to refuse peace negotiations with Adolf Hitler, but susceptible out of fear because he doesn't want to make mistakes. The scenes where Churchill orates over the radio and the House of Commons really shine.<br/><br/>But, unfortunately, the scenes before these powerful speeches appear forced and unnatural, such as the scene with Churchill and the train full of passengers or when Churchill's wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) comforts him. These scenes don't feel authentic or raw, their manufactured to keep the narrative going for Churchill to fulfill his desire. Also, the director Joe Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten cram so much talking in this film that the movie becomes a discourse on dialogue. Other than that, the Darkest Hour is a satisfying historical drama with an Oscar winning performance from Gary Oldman."

","The British make different kinds of movies than us Americans do. Americans, always in love with making the most amount of money in the shortest period of time, tend toward the blockbuster spectacles. We invest millions of dollars in special effects computers and, all-too-frequently, measure the success by how quickly the investors see the return.<br/><br/>British films, however, seem to focus more on characters and history. Perhaps because they have a richer history to draw on, I'm not sure, but instead of dazzling displays of technical skill, their films develop their characters and nurture their language. Dialog is much more important and they pay careful attention to their use of language. (Granted, the English accents are sometimes difficult to understand - so much so that sometimes I turn on the English captions in order to comprehend the speech.). As a result, they also tend to develop tremendous character actors. Judy Dench is one of them and we have already seen, and reviewed, her movie this Oscar season, Victoria & Abdul, where she does a terrific job portraying Queen Victoria at the end of the 1800s. The movie, like a lot of British films, does not have a huge range of action, but instead focuses on the conversations and interactions of the characters - something the truly demands high-performance actors if it is to succeed. It certainly does with Dench.<br/><br/>It also does with Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour. Oldman, another English actor, has received multiple accolades for his performances in three Batman movies and his role as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter movies, but his only other Oscar nomination was for his leading role in Tinker Sailor Soldier Spy. His performance as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour finally brought him a Best Acting Oscar and it is powerfully deserved. He delivers a commanding performance and is clearly responsible for this movie's success. Oldman's performance seems to allow you inside the heartfelt mind behind Churchill's agonizing decision making in May, 1940. Britain had to make critical choices about its future direction as Hitler's assault on Europe reached nearly definitive and final control. Although Churchill seemed at one point to waiver seriously in favor of Chamberlain's strategy of appeasal, he ended up expressing the long-awaited courage that Britain needed at that time, its Darkest Hour. (Roosevelt, on the otherhand, comes across as a cowardly weasel!)<br/><br/>In addition to being Goldman's vehicle for his first Oscar, this movie also won the Oscar for Makeup and Hairstyling. I suspect the acknowledgement goes mostly for the superb job they did on Oldman. The prosthetic nose and jowls they gave him are seamless and I, for one, had to look very closely to recognize Oldman. Although Victoria & Abdul were also nominated in the Makeup category, primarily for the work they did in aging Judi Dench (although they didn't need to age her much), the better work was here in Darkest Hour.
The movie also received nominations for Production Design, Costumes, and Cinematography. I can say that the sets and decorations seemed mostly accurate, although others have identified flaws with certain objects in scenes that didn't belong there. The clothing seemed 1940ish, but since I'm not quite that old, I can't say for sure how accurate it was. Was it of higher quality work than in Phantom Thread (the winner)? - I can't say. But it was certainly more than adequate to represent the scene. And the cinematography was certainly in tune with the title, as nearly all scenes were very dark, reflecting the deep pessimism of the times I suppose, but also requiring some imagination at times to visually understand what was going on!<br/><br/>Lily James and Kristin Scott Thomas are the only two females with more than a few lines in the movie. Thomas plays his supportive wife, and James is his secretary. Although the movie has her helping Churchill in major ways with his speech writing, that appears to be a movie license as she did not join his team until later. Another key supporting role comes from Ben Mendelssohn who plays King George VI. In this movie, at least, the king plays a pivotal role in giving Churchill the courage to stand his ground against a withering sea of opposition organized by Chamberlain and Halifax. Whether that is true or not, I don't know.<br/><br/>The movie does take other liberties with the known facts. There is a very important scene that takes place in a London Underground where Churchill meets with London commoners just before giving his major, ""Darkest Hour"" speech. Apparently there is no historical basis for that scene, although it clearly helps give Churchill the fortitude to fight Hitler and take an entire nation with him.<br/><br/>So the movie may not be totally accurate to history. As long as we acknowledge that, then it is acceptable because a movie isn't required to be 100% accurate as long as it portrays the essence of what happened. And it seem to me that is what British film makers have a special ability to do. The director, Joe Wright, has never been nominated for an Oscar but did direct such great period pieces as Pride and Prejudice, Atonement, Hanna, and Anna Karenina. The writer, Anthony McCarten, received a writing nomination for the Theory of Everything, another British biopic about Stephen Hawking. (It is interesting that a lot of the technical crew for Darkest Hour also worked on the Theory of Everything.)<br/><br/>McCarten was not nominated for the Screenplay Oscar for this movie and for a very good reason. The real writing in this movie was done, not in the screenplay, but by Churchill himself as he composed his blistering speeches. Darkest Hour seems to recognize that fact by emphasizing the man and his words as the main vehicles for moving Britain through the dark days of May, 1940. After possibly the most important speech Churchill gave to Parliament, a legislator turns to Lord Halifax and asks 'What just happened?'. To which Halifax replies ""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle."" That is indeed what happened and it changed the course of history.<br/><br/>And that is what British movies seem to do. They aren't about action and superheroes - Americans do that well. Instead they reflect on history, tradition, language, and character. And that would be the reason to see the Darkest Hour.<br/><br/>For Oldman's performance and a tour through an important piece of history, I give Darkest Hour 4 stars (out of 5). (Also be sure to see Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, dealing with the same time period with a very different artistic perspective.)"

"neobateman","7","0","2","18 March 2018"," An average motion picture headed by a magnetic performance.
","Darkest Hour was the second Best Picture nominee about the battle of Dunkirk at the Oscars this year. In May of 1940, British troops have been trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. The Labour party demands the resignation of the incumbent prime minister, Neville Chamberlain. This leads to the controversial Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) receiving the job of prime minister. Churchill who has suffered criticism for his leadership during the Gallipoli campaign in World War I is a choice that doesn't fit well with the people of England including King George (Ben Mendelsohn) himself. In this darkest hour Churchill must find a choice to either fight or to negotiate peace with Adolf Hitler. Without the help of the US government of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill is pushed to his limits. Darkest Hour is a authentic and slow movie (even though its only 2 hours long). It features a small ensemble of interesting choices led by Gary Oldman in his deserved Academy Award winning performance. He pulls of the small mannerisms of Churchill with such ease, speaks in an authentic accent and looks great in the makeup that Oldman simply becomes Churchill. He is especially convincing in scenes where he yells his speech in front of parliament. Oldman even uses many of the Churchill mannerisms to his advantage to give some comedic relief. This helps the audience to be drawn to his character. The rest of the cast consists of Kristin Scott Thomas as Churchill's wife, she gives him strength and courage and her chemistry with Oldman is perfect. Lily James adds youth and inexperience and Ben Mendelsohn is gripping in his brief role as the King. The film feels authentic due to the great costume which consists of old fashioned suits, uniforms and hats. This together with the production design makes the setting of 1940 London even more authentic. The film makes the smart decision to keep things light hearted when necessary. Especially towards the start which shows Churchill to be somewhat of an outsider and slightly out of touch. Besides the actors, costume or production design the best word to describe this film would be competent. There is nothing interesting about Joe Wright's direction or Dario Marianelli's music. The writing feels clunky and wooden in certain scenes, especially at the start when people exposit about Churchill's character and past. As stated before, the film had some unexpected humour, which works for the most part. However the film unfortunately never becomes all that serious until the very end, and even at that point the picture never really becomes suspenseful. Even with this being a somewhat conventional drama, I would still recommend everyone to see this in particular for Gary Oldman's performance and for the important message of unity. Which in today's world is often forgotten especially in times with 'America First' or Brexit."
"DarthVoorhees","7","0","2","18 March 2018"," A standard Oscar bait costume drama
","Darkest Hour is a totally non-revolutionary film but it is very competently acted and directed. I got the feeling that the response you have towards it has to do with the amount of cynicism you have. <br/><br/>The movie all but canonizes Churchill. Fair enough. You can't help but have some respect for Churchill for his wartime role but that aside does he not seem like an insufferable aristocratic egotist? The movie sort of promises that it will be more critical of him. The first half of the film has the rest of the world talking about all of his faults but aside from scenes of him yelling at his secretaries we don't really see anything wrong with him. He's the Churchill of old with a halo on his head with a cigar and a witticism to shut everyone up. <br/><br/>The war isn't anywhere to be seen. It would have helped the film and it's stakes. It just assumes the viewer knows and appreciates their history. It's kind of amazing this came out the same year as 'Dunkirk' because that relays the same story in a much more assessable and dramatically richer way. 'Dunkirk' with it's minimalist dialogue shows the stakes of the war at the time far more effectively than any of the long winded speeches here because we see the soldiers and the overwhelming odds they are up against. If we saw that here it might make Chruchill's stand against appeasement more heroic and in the now. It would strengthen Stephen Dillane as Halifax too as surrendering probably was a very tempting option in the midst of the carnage that British forces were experiencing. <br/><br/>One more note that seems small but that I really did appreciate was the make-up effects. Oldman doesn't look like a stroke victim and his face can articulate every emotion. I know that seems trivial but often you have to compromise actual acting for the sake of such a transformation. 'Darkest Hour' is a triumph in prosthetic effects.<br/><br/>It's a good film but it never rises above being a standard costume drama retelling the events. If you like Oldman you'll get a level of appreciation(although this is clearly a case of the Oscars making up for not awarding him earlier)."

","History wrote this story but Anthony McCarten translated it into a screenplay for Joe Wright to direct one of the truly great films of the year. The film is about the month of May in 1940, the odd rise to power of Winston Churchill, and the near miraculous survival of the island of England because of the rascal/devil obstinacy of Churchill's commitment not to give in to Hitler's sweep of the world into a globe of fascism. And crowning the importance of this film is the impeccable performance of Gary Oldman in the role of Churchill. <br/><br/>'Hitler has invaded Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway. 3 million German troops are now poised on the Belgian border, ready to conquer the rest of Europe. In Britain, Parliament has lost faith in its leader Neville Chamberlain. The search for a replacement has already begun...' So opens the film. With Europe on the threshold of World War II as Hitler's armies rampage across the continent's once proud nations, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), is forced to resign, appointing Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) as his replacement. But even in his early days as the country's leader, Churchill is under pressure to commence peace negotiations with the German dictator or to fight head-on the seemingly invincible Nazi regime, whatever the cost. However difficult and dangerous his decision may be, Winston Churchill has no choice, but to shine in his darkest hour. He gains the favor of King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), the assistance from his secretary (Lily James) and wife (Kirsten Scott Thomas), and the tolerance of peacenik Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane). Of course the ending is known: Churchill overcame the darkest hour and saved England by refusing to stand down.<br/><br/>This is one of the most successful historical films to date and it is so very appropriate that it was released in the same year as DUNKIRK - the battle that involved the people and polished the British tenacity.

","For those of us who grew up in the 60s and 70s we grew up with the iconic personas of the past, historical figures that transformed history we were reading about WWII into reality as we knew it. While many of those figures had passed away a few remained. One of those was Winston Churchill. We'd read or listened to recordings of his speeches. Movies have been made about his life but few have the impact or provide as in depth a depiction of the man as DARKEST HOUR.<br/><br/>The film opens with Parliament in turmoil. The year is 1940 and the predictions Churchill made about Hitler and Nazi Germany have come to fruition. Belgium and France have both been invaded. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's (Ronald Pickup) hope for peace has been crushed and his removal from office demanded. But who to put in his place? The position is offered to Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane) but he turns it down. To placate both sides of Parliament they choose Churchill (Gary Oldman).<br/><br/>Our first glimpse of Churchill comes as he awakened at home to interview a new girl as his personal secretary. Elizabeth Layton (Lilly James) is nervous and warned about numerous personal idiosyncrasies that Churchill has. It doesn't take long before those pour forth as he chastises, yells and insults her causing her to run from the room. Before leaving she is handed a telegraph to deliver to him, the word that he has been offered the post of Prime Minister.<br/><br/>Churchill forms his cabinet and in an effort to please both parties selects both Chamberlain and Halifax to be a part of it. He then moves forward with his own view of what to do with the current invasion of all European states by Hitler: fight on to the bitter end. Of course this doesn't sit well with Chamberlain, Halifax and their party who instead push the idea of peace.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses we're presented with three stories running concurrently. The first is the political maneuverings among party lines. While Halifax may have turned down the opportunity to become PM it doesn't mean he isn't ambitious. By allowing Churchill to take the position he has room to move and perhaps form a contingency to remove Churchill from office and take his place, sowing seeds of discontent among his peers behind the scenes.<br/><br/>The second is the imminent battles being fought in France. Churchill continues to believe in the strength of the combined forces of the British and French armies. As those begin to crumble and the soldiers retreat he must then make the decision to find a way to rescue them or to capitulate to Hitler. The last location the troops can make is the seaside town of Dunkirk.<br/><br/>The third story here revolves around Churchill's personal life. Scenes with his wife Clemmie (Kristin Scott Thomas), his family and those friends closest to him, few though there may be. His brash and bullying attitude has earned him no long list of allies. Even King George VI (Ben Mendelson) is wary of his being in this position. How Churchill can overcome his overbearing ways and save the country makes for one tremendously dramatic story.<br/><br/>The movie does a tremendous job of bringing both the man and history to life. Instead of boring newsreel footage that we've seen again and again we're made privy to what went on in the back rooms and secluded war rooms of the British Empire. Knowing what we now know of the things Hitler and the Nazis did it seems inconceivable that the British military would even consider a peace agreement with them but they did. And the speech that Churchill presents near the very end of the film remains as stirring today as it was when it was delivered.<br/><br/>The entire movie relies on one major thing and that is the performance of Oldman as Churchill. Many actors have played this role. And with the right prosthetic makeup many would be able to look like the man. But it takes an enormous amount of skill to not just look like Churchill but to bring him to life. Oldman has done that here in the most amazing way. Every nuance in his abilities is used here to make the man come alive. Moments occur where the words are gone and he falls silent but the emotions, concerns and mindset of the man are on display by Oldman. He won the Oscar for Best Male Performance and deservedly so for his role here.<br/><br/>Earlier this year we were presented with the film DUNKIRK about what happened on those beaches that day. This movie would make a fantastic double feature with that film, using this one to set up what happened that day and the month prior. That's all this movie focuses on, the month that it took for Churchill to take office, pull off Dunkirk and to inspire a nation. It does so looking glorious at the same time with cinematography, set design, costuming and makeup that make you feel as if you are there. You can't pay a better compliment to a film than that."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In May 1940, Hitler has invaded Checkozlovakia and most of the eastern bloc, while Allied troops are at his mercy in France. Current Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) has suffered a vote of no confidence due to his appeasement stance, and so the current government look for someone to take his place. Cue the eccentric, highly strung Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), whose approach to governance is as unconventional as his lifestyle, sending the establishment into a flurry. As France and other European nations seek to surrender, Churchill flies in the face of popular opinion and vows to fight them till the end.<br/><br/>In British folklore, it's hard to imagine a figure more revered for courage and 'bulldog spirit' than Winston Churchill, and yet there's been hardly any attempts to create a dramatization of his life, and how he sculpted his place in history. With Darkest Hour, director Joe Wright has attempted to do this, taking an all star cast and placing the burden on their shoulders to do justice to the great man and his exploits. And the result is a film that even the most drama dodging film goer would struggle to move away from, a testament in itself to the grand job he's done.<br/><br/>It may be depicting one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the world, yet despite this, the film itself is pretty much an endless barrage of talking, with hardly any action at all. And so, Wright has an extra hard job of making it enthralling and taut, and it's a credit to him that the writing, dialogue and delivery do keep you on the edge of your seat as they do. Despite a marvellous supporting cast, including Kristen Scott Thomas and Ben Mendolsohn as the King, it is of course lead star Gary Oldman who makes it as exciting as it is. He injects his portrayal of Churchill with that wild, crazy energy you remember from earlier performances in grittier films, such as Leon and The Firm.<br/><br/>For the most part, it stays on track and plays out in a realistic, true to life manner, with the possible exception of Winston taking a detour and going on a train (when the standard 'diversity' moment is shoved in our faces.) But whether it's exploding in theatrics or staying grounded in reality, it's still brilliant, seat edge filmmaking of the type you don't get so much of these days. ****"

","One of Winston Churchill's favorite authors was Lord Macaulay, who wrote of the heroism of Horatius who held off the Etruscans from invading Rome, due to his heroism in guarding the bridge. ""Darkest Hour"" portrays Churchill's similar actions in rallying Great Britain in his first month in office as Prime Minister in the dark days of May, 1940. The only difference between Churchill and the ancient Roman hero was that Churchill was using words in an act of patriotism in some of his greatest speeches.<br/><br/>Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where Churchill is dictating his speeches to a typist, a fictional character named Miss Layton. Unknown to Churchill through most of the film, the secretary has lost her brother, who died while on the retreat to Dunkirk. It was Churchill's defiance of Hitler and his stand against the members of his war cabinet (especially Viscount Halifax and the disgraced Neville Chamberlain) that resulted in the successful evacuation of nearly 300,000 troops from Dunkirk.<br/><br/>Churchill eloquently said that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to control that counts."" Britain was truly alone in the dark days of 1940. Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, and Norway had fallen to Hitler. Soon, Belgium and France would capitulate. No help was forthcoming from America. Churchill recognizes that England had to take control of her own destiny. <br/><br/>When Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, he had a string of failures to his credit in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign of World War I, the paternalistic policy on India, his contrary stance on the Russian Civil War, the gold standard, the support of Edward VIII in his marriage to Wallis Simpson, and the Norway adventure. He was essentially cashiered as a politician and in the ""wilderness"" throughout the 1930s. <br/><br/>Yet, in May,1940, Churchill took center stage while admitting that he had ""nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat."" One of the turning points in the film was when King George VI gave Churchill his unconditional support for resistance. There were to be no negotiations with Hitler. Viscount Halifax was correct when he acknowledged that when Churchill addressed Parliament in his famous ""fight on the beaches"" speech, he had successfully ""mobilized the English language and sent it into battle."""

","Darkest Hour - Gary Oldman is absolutely fantastic, completely disappearing both under the make up and deep into the role!(I predict an Oscar, especially considering he does not have one yet.. somehow!) It's a war movie that uses war more like a setting/backdrop or even a decoration at times, to show people dealing with it and how it affects them, from the King himself to the simple citizens of British Empire, but especially of course the wonderfully portrayed main character."

","If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Joe Wright brilliantly directs this movie, using very long takes and fantastic camera control to elevate Winston Churchill's powerful speeches. However, this film is only good because Gary Oldman executes a career-best performance. I've never experienced such a magnificent display of a historical character.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie does not fail. The editing is seamless, the cinematography and the costumes feel extremely realistic, and the subtle score provides something extra to Oldman's flawless discourses.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Darkest Hour falls into the genre issues and cliches. It is far too long, having in mind that there is no sort of action or excitement during the whole runtime. It is a slow-burn and unless you especially enjoy this true-story adaptation filled with repetitive talks, I consider it just above average, solely due to one of the best displays from an actor I've ever witnessed."

","I'm french and I think that it's very interesting in this film to discover what happened in United Kingdom during the World War II, especially in May 1940.
The subject of the movie is historic, so the director, Joe Wright, couldn't do what he wanted but he succeded to realize a good film. In spite of his serious, some moments or lyrics in the film are funny. 
Gary Oldman (Winston Churchill), Kristan Scott Thomas (Clémentine Churchill), Ben Mendelsohn (Georges IV) and Lily James (Elisabeth Layton) who are the main characters are very talented, they really make the film better. 
I think the middle of the film was slowly and a little boring. But the end was very fast and lively. It's the end of the film but I have felt it was just the beginning of the war."

","This movie is about Winston Churchill struggle to power. It shows Britain's internal policy by showing the conspirations, the King, the fear of the Germans...
It also shows how Britain's leaders wanted to capitulate against the people's will to serve their personal interests, the struggle of Dunkirk... It is really a good political movie that really shows Britain's point of view of the war even if it overestimates Britain's importance in it. A movie to see if you are a fan of Britain's history but not a great overview of the war in its entirety. Personnaly I appreciated it but as I have already said I think it shows Britain as the main country of the war while every country in this war has done a part of the job."

The point of the movie is to show triumph and unique leadership, not teach a history class. Some scenes gave me chills I was so moved. Oldman blew this role out of the water. While everyone knows this, I wanted to say it because his acting performance alone gives the movie the boost it needed to reach top tier. His portrayal of Churchill was intoxicating, and every time there was a climatic scene I caught myself cheering, or expressing some other appropriate emotion.

"sirenebern","7","0","4","1 March 2018"," Great lead performance by Oldman
","""Darkest Hour"" is all about Churchill's role in guiding his country through this very perilous time. Joe Wright's film lionizes him to a great extent, although some of the great man's vulnerabilities (self-doubt, fear) and shortcomings (temper, bullheadedness, tendency to flash his secretary) are shown without varnish. I felt that the best thing about this film was Oldman's performance, and as usual, he dives deeply into the character's speech and mannerisms with perfection. Not so easy when you consider how many screen portrayals of Churchill there have been, including several in just the last decade. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is a bit predictable in its portrayal of these well-known events, but enjoyable enough. Of the supporting cast performances, I thought Kristin Scott Thomas did a great job as Clementine Churchill, capturing her strength, razor wit and look very well, and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. Stephen Dillane as Viscount Halifax was just fine, although I am weary of seeing Dillane scowl and glower through so many parts. Lily James plays Churchill's loyal stenographer, and provides a sweet, gentle foil to the thunderous orator in their scenes together. But she seems very much the same as she's been in other roles. <br/><br/>If you are interested in Churchill or WW2 history, you may enjoy ""Darkest Hour"" very much, especially if you remember that time period (like my dad, who said he just loved this movie). It lacks dramatic action and tension to be a truly great movie, though."

Whilst I was aware of a lot of the storylines covered in the film I really didn't realise that they happened in such a short space of time. What I thought took a few months was actually just a few weeks. Obviously the focus of the film is Gary Oldman as Churchill.

So much of the film depended on the viewer having some prerequisite knowledge about Winston Churchill and the politics of World War II, and my lack thereof played heavily into my lukewarm reaction. And that's my main criticism of the film - as someone who doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of the events portrayed here, it didn't do enough to establish the character of Winston Churchill and help me understand his plight. I spent the majority of the film feeling as though I was passively watching the events unfold, mildly interested at best. It probably doesn't help that political intrigue films tend not to be my cup of tea. In any event, the film certainly looked nice and I absolutely admired and enjoyed Gary Oldman's performance.

","""Success is not final. Failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts."" What a war-drama movie to watch. Gary Oldman deserves more than one Oscar. It's his best and one of the best war time political courageous movie I've seen. The biopic of Charchill shows us there's a certain irony that, as Britain stood alone against Nazism, Churchill found the courage to stand through community. King George tells him that he'll support Churchill, even if he chooses to risk the island's destruction. His wife, Clementine, encourages him in his moment of doubt: ""You are strong because you are imperfect,"" she tells him. ""You are wise because you have doubt."" And then, when he asks regular Londoners on the Tube what they would think about considering making peace with Hitler's Germany, their answer is unequivocal.
His country inspired him. And so, in turn, he inspired it. 
The story, the acting everything is flawless. I must say, Oldman, who has just won a Golden Globe, is in phenomenal form as Churchill. He doesn't underplay at all. There wouldn't be any point in that. He blusters and bellows, makes V signs, smokes cigars, and will win the Oscar too."

Now, I haven't seen them all yet so I can't comment on how close that was to being true, but what I can comment on is the fact I enjoyed it much more than anticipated. The film holds very little in the way of interesting concepts to me, yet it was able to catch me off guard by just how fascinating this Winston Churchill bloke really was. <br/><br/>I can't see the film having any chance of winning Best Picture. It is simply too generic and character based to pull off that feat. The nomination itself is about right for the credit it deserves. One award I can see it winning though is Gary Oldman for Best Actor in a Lead Role. He was simply fantastic. He became Churchill. I'm a big Oldman fan and I often had to remind myself it was him in there, based on both the look and character traits he managed to pull off. I would call him all but a lock to win the award.<br/><br/>The film is really just there to characterise Churchill. As a film itself it doesn't really have much to offer (the reason I can't see it winning Best Picture). It is basically a very well executed vehicle for Oldman to ride in.

Should little pithy statements that are not part of historical record have been added in? The answer is no.. If you are going for historical accuracy, as you cannot help but having to do here in historical record areas, then BE accurate The historical material is dramatic enough, without messing with history in some areas. That being said, it was entertaining enough. Is it an Oscar winning role for Oldman? No, for the reasons already mentioned.

","For all it's obvious grit, gore, loss and greed, this movie serves as a behind the scenes reminder to how much of WWII was fought not just on the battlefields but in the stuffy buildings (and minds) of the British. I will not detail every nuance of this film as I'm others have more succinctly presented, but I will say there's something here which is quite undeniably unique. 
As Winston Churchhill, Gary Oldman graces us with a very dedicated performance, (which was not solely achieved in makeup alone but...) admirably represented a significant amount of research resulting in his very complete character. The accompanying cast filled their roles well, no doubt inspired by equally well-designed sets---transporting us back to a part of historic Great Britain. Yes, the movie dragged a bit, something this category often does. But I felt it was a timely shift from the blood we often see in war movies to a view of what goes on in the minds of men who make good things happen.
Darkest Hour paradoxically brightens near the end as Churchhill questions the people on the train, a scene it felt the whole movie was waiting for. Bringing the whole story together, and possibly serving as a challenge in asking ourselves the same questions."

"TheMovieDiorama","8","0","3","24 February 2018"," Darkest Hour puts Joe Wright back on track with this patriotic drama.
","Forget about 'Pan', every director is allowed to create one bad film. The important thing is the he learnt from his mistake and regressed back to what he does best, British war dramas. Detailing an important month for Britain in World War II where Winston Churchill is positioned as prime minister. With the weight of the country on his shoulders, he must battle, not just Nazism, but his own parliament. I don't think we can fully appreciate and grasp the enormity that Churchill was faced with. Yes, some bad decisions were made where hindsight acts as a wonderful tool for regret. However, he confronted his own war cabinet and progressed the war with his gut instinct, taking into account the British public that he swore to protect. He eventually became a noble leader in a time of need, to me that is commendable. The film expresses patriotism, conflicting views and fear of war rather well actually. After a shaky start with various narrative stumbles that prevented me from being fully engaged, it sets off in full force and consistently kept me captivated. All thanks to Gary Oldman. In an Oscar worthy performance (in which he absolutely deserves the golden statue), he utterly transformed himself. Another role where he became the character, I can't stress enough that he is one of the best character actors working today. He chewed up every scene, particularly adored the moment Churchill takes the London Underground. Simply just watch this film for his acting alone, you won't regret it. The supporting cast were also decent, although it took me awhile to warm to Mendelsohn...slightly miscast in my opinion. Wright's direction was effective, I loved his bird's eye view zooming and the slow motion tracking shots. The inclusion of British wit was of paramount importance and suited the narrative incredibly well. It may not feel hugely creative or inventive, yet there is an underlying sense of competence both on and off screen that has consequently created an assured drama."
"Mohican15","9","0","3","23 February 2018"," A Fascinating And Gripping Look At One Of Britain's Greatest Heroes!
","It was definitely Britain's DARKEST HOUR but it was most certainly Winston Churchill's finest hour. He led the country at a dangerous and most uncertain time against the monster that was Hitler. He encountered opposition and political backstabbing at almost every turn from the likes of Neville Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax, but most of all he refused to give in and resolved to fight on to the bitter end. This rousing story is brilliantly brought to modern life by director Joe Wright with DARKEST HOUR! Wright's film is a tore du force of character acting (since this film is carried by the cast) and offers an informative and inspiring look at the great man and his struggle to lead Britain through the war. <br/><br/>I must admit, before this film I knew very little about this titan of a man. I knew him as the Prime Minister who led us through the war. I knew him for his gruff voice, cigars, whiskey and infamous speeches, but after this film I realised he was so much more than that. I realised he was an incredible patriot who cared deeply about this country and it's people but I also saw that he was really the only one (in government) with enough guts to stand up to Hitler. With DARKEST HOUR, director Joe Wright and script writer Anthony McCarten have brilliantly portrayed Churchill and all his characteristics. They have brought REAL drama to his political campaign and also, even though we know the ending (we won!) they have still managed to create that sense of doom and gloom and uncertainty that surrounded the period. Wright has really delivered with this film, showcasing Churchill in all his glory and explaining the character of the man himself. However, as I said this film is carried by the cast and it's the cast that really make the film the masterpiece that it is. Let's begin with the man himself...<br/><br/>I can wholeheartedly say that Oldman has really earned his Bafta. As well as being virtually unrecognisable under his Mrs. Doubtfire-ish face, Oldman acts out SO many emotions of the great man. At first, he's grumpy and a little rude, but then, as we get to see deeper into the character, he becomes very emotional and tender and totally inspiring. He is also a titan in politics; while everyone is pushing for surrender he continues the hard fight for victory with little cooperation from his fellow MPs and sees Hitler for what he really is/was. Oldman plays a hard man too, but a man who needed to be tough in such an uncertain world. All of these emotions are brilliantly and authentically portrayed by Oldman. He dazzles in this role, totally different to what he's used to (with LEON or THE FIFTH ELEMENT) as the old battle-axe that was Winston S. Churchill. Oldman says so much with his facial expressions that portray such emotion and sometimes pain. The only thing that didn't fit was the voice. Oldman didn't get the voice (but then again not many can) but he still gave it his best go. However, the most important thing was that he captured all of Churchill's mannerisms and characteristics. He is a VERY powerful actor and this was definitely Oldman's ""finest hour"".<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is totally stellar as well, with the likes of Kristin Scott Thomas, Lilly James and Ben Mendeleshon. All of them perform to the uttermost of their ability and bring depth and conviction to their roles. This outstanding cast carries the film and you really enjoy watching ALL of them.<br/><br/>This film really delivered with it's brilliant cast and engaging pace and showed so many sides of the great man that we rarely saw. Who thinks Gary Oldman well and truly deserved the Bafta? EVERYONE!"
"odaleg","7","0","3","23 February 2018"," Dunkirk made polity or a Churchill biopic?
","Okay, this review is totally personal and that's why I'm going to talk about this movie from a more ""political"" point of view.
Let's go, the film seems that all he wants is to dulcify the figure of Winston Churchill and presents him as someone needed for the world today; I mean, the British prime minister is facing a cowardly political class that is only looking for a peace with Hitler because of the fear of losing what they have in case of defeat (similarities between Trump's victory? where? I do not see them)
In the midst of all this, and with a party that does not support him and has only chosen him to gain time for a favorable peace treaty, or little bad, Churchill appears as the savior of the nation guided by his instincts and the voice of the people, this is so funny because only happens in one scene when there are fifteen minutes left for the end.

","""Darkest hour"" is a masterpiece, one of the rarest pictures to convey authentically the ambiguous and shallow intricacies of security councils and defence rooms during the second World War, it follows one of history's biggest politicians, the former British prime minister Winston Churchill, a man who stood alone against the pernicious European peace treaty that would have rendered the United Kingdom a slave nation to the German Nazi regiment. Winston Churchill, as depicted by the Oscar worthy Gary Oldman, was a man of honour and pride, one who would never allow his beloved country and fellow countrymen to fall into the hands of a ravaging European war , a man who didn't let his blood stained past hinder him from his political duties. Let's be frank and delve in directly to the thing that compelled us the most to buy tickets to this picture: the man , the legend , Gary Oldman , one of Hollywood's greatest actors and the highest grossing actor at the moment in all of history, He is undoubtedly the most suitable man for the endeavour , and believe me, I am not exaggerating when I describe his role that way : portraying one of Britain's greatest men is without a doubt a very difficult thing , let alone for a British man . This huge responsibility is furthered by the fact that the actor and the personage have nearly nothing physically in common, the actor , a man of a slender physic, had to adapt himself with Churchill's weight and resemble to the most his manners and most importantly his face , one that was worn out by politics and its complexity, a job that couldn't be possible if not for the make up team that stood by the actor to create the closest depiction of Winston Churchill known to date. Even though the attempts were multiple on the story of sir Churchill during the second world war , this picture topped them all ,hence its staggering record of 6 Oscar nominations: it didn't rely totally on the mind blowing effect of its astonishing cast , notably the one in a lifetime performance delivered by Mr. Garry Oldman , but wrapped the whole thing in a visual gem : one of this movies pillars is its flawless directing , M. Joe Wright created a compelling picture to add on its beautiful story , and succeeded in supporting the cast's expressive acting with a war tensioned atmosphere , one that explores the depths of war in Europe , and the sense of powerlessness that turns good men cruel , this picture clearly does not try to justify the critical decisions that were taken during that period and that perhaps directly killed countless innocent Men , it only shows that the worse have clearly been avoided thanks to the manner in which Winston Churchill solved the moral dilemmas of the war. ""Darkest hour ""is one of this year's top five pictures, it deserves the critical acclaim that it received and will undoubtedly be commemorated as Gary Oldman's best performance (although I am a devoted fan of Léon the professional ! )"

","Darkest Hour is a film directed by Joe wright. At first when I watched the trailer for this film, I was impressed seeing Gary Oldman. He was almost unrecognizable. And after the film festivals said that he was the top choice for Best Actor, I felt that I should give this film a watch. Finally, After watching this film I can say that everyone was right.<br/><br/>Plot: During he early 1940's Winston Churchill is elected as prime minister of UK much to the dismay of many people.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Let me say very frankly that I had doubts regarding this film since the very initial reviews for this film in IMDB were not that good. But after the film released the my faith in this film got restored. Yes the film has faults in certain places but I can still say that it is a decent watch. The film starts off quite nicely. We can feel the tension that is mounting on screen. Then we immediately shift to Churchill and his life. The portrayal of him was what made much of the film. Also the characters surrounding his personal life were good in their own way. The characters of the parliament were captivating. Kudos to the makeup and production design team. The atmosphere of the 1940 was very well maintained. Also the photography. It was spectacular. It never felt superficial. I felt like I was living during that era. The story started off great initially. But after an hour or so the pace seems to be a bit uneven. But again during the scenes towards the climax the pace is regained. Also the film felt quite cliched from the political perspective like people not liking Churchill, deciding for no confidence vote, etc...<br/><br/>Performances: Gary Oldman deserves a standing ovation and all the praise he is getting. That first scene in his bedroom where he is with a cigar, wine and English breakfast sealed his fate. I mean after some four hour makeup, who can maintain a diction like that? Kudos to him. Kristin Scott Thomas was great too as Churchill's caring and supportive wife. Lily James' role although was limited but she was impressive. She continues to prove that she is a great actress. Ben Mendelsohn was also good as the King.Ronald Pickup and Stephen Dillane were equally significant in their roles.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: Many would say the speech scenes were great. And it would be a very easy statement just for anyone since they are meant to create impact. But for me it would be the scene in the London Underground with the commoners. I didn't kind of expect that scene. But still the sense of responsibility towards the people and knowing what the people want is what attarcted me to this particular scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: Even with its flaws, this film is a intense and applaudable in its own way. Joe wright very meticulously interweaved this film. Although the film is titled Darkest Hour, I would say that my 2 hours were well spent.<br/><br/>I am going with an 8.5/10."

","Darkest Hour is directed by Joe Wright and stars Gary Oldman, Lily James and Ben Mendelsohn. The movie takes place in the beginning of WW2, Hitler has just sent his army to the neutral Belgium. Britain's house of parliament is in chaos. Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), who signed a peace treaty with Hitler only weeks earlier has lost all his support in the parliament. The only man that the opposition will accept is Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), a politician with a past full of fiascos. Hated by his colleagues, Churchill must rule the UK in a state of crisis with all odds against him. <br/><br/>Darkest Hour isn't an action movie, it's a political thriller about one man's stand against the Nazis with the whole world on his shoulders. The focus is 100% on Churchill, luckily Oldman pulled it off. He's totally worth the nomination for best actor and with this superb performance he should win the award. Oldman brings new aspects of Churchill to the big screen - an energetic, funny and slightly awkward Churchill. The movie is genuinely very funny, but doesn't lack the amount of powerful scenes, such as Churchill's famous speech - it made me shiver. Wright got the tone of the movie just right. The cinematography is stunning, the lightning was outstanding.<br/><br/>What about the cons? Even though I like the fact that the movie focuses on Churchill, it does bring some problems. The other character arcs are really thin, they're just there. James and Mendelsohn give really good performances with what they have. However, the actions of the characters are seldom motivated and don't work at all with Mendelsohn's character. Another negative is the music. I'll admit, in the last scene it made my jaw drop, but otherwise it never really was there. There were many powerful scenes where the music felt sort of ""meh"". My last minus is that the movie is very British, it makes fun of the allied leaders, such as president Roosevelt. Darkest Hour is a politically correct movie that celebrates Churchill. But why ruin other big names during that time period? With all aspects considered I'm going to give Darkest Hour a solid 7/10."

","In May 1940, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) has just been appointed by his party to become Britain's Prime Minister, thus facing the daunting situation of Adolf Hitler's growing dominance of Europe.<br/><br/>""Darkest Hour"" is a beautiful, historical period piece that could also be a companion piece to ""Dunkirk"" which was also released in 2017. A good chunk of ""Darkest Hour"" covers the events of ""Dunkirk"" though more at the behind-the-scenes level.<br/><br/>Oldman is superb in the lead role and lives up to the current awards hype - winning numerous awards and likely to receive more. Under all that make-up, he is very convincing as a legendary renegade - one who never travels with the pack; one who could only lead the pack or go on his own.<br/><br/>Oldman is given many chances to show his talents as the film focuses almost exclusively on Churchill. Unfortunately, this is also a flaw. He is over-exposed. Thus the finale - which was likely intended to be rousing and succeeds to a high degree - loses some of its impact due to the over-exposure. Many scenes last too long and the movie, by the end, also seems too long. But ""Darkest Hour"" is still worth seeing for its lead performance."

","This would be great as a double feature with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk where that film features the Operation Dynamo through the people directly involved, this shows the various political proceedings focusing on how Churchill is elected as Prime Minister and have to deal with all the tensions. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as he embodies Churchill. Joe Wright's handle over period films is proved again with the production design, music and camera that perfectly sets the backdrop for such an involving story where no character is black or white.

","If the cast list had not mentioned Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, I would never have known. Only on a few glimpses did the prosthetics and makeup fail to convince, on only two or three turns did the phrasing of those famous speeches not match the recordings of the day.<br/><br/>The Darkest Hour does not deal with swashbuckling Spitfire dogfights or heroic Berlin or bust land actions, but the inner turmoil of one of this country's foremost wartime leaders.<br/><br/>Winston was not without faults; was not always sure and resolute. He was parachuted into a job, a poisoned chalice, following the abject failure of Neville Chamberlain and the appeasers. The same backseat drivers who sought to undermine Churchill once they had put him into Number 10. Halifax is shown as a viper in the bosom, whose blackmail and emotional coercion almost caused the great man to falter.<br/><br/>You need to watch the film to see what it was that, in the vision of Director Joe Wright and the scriptwriter, Anthony McCarten, turned Churchill's darkest hour to the bright uplands of optimism and victory.<br/><br/>The camera caresses every scene, with no unnecessary motion, no shaking - the drama shines throughout. The properties are given an attention to detail that convinces, except in a couple of instances. The red light from the BBC to denote the open microphone during a broadcast, was in real life small and green, not the volcanic glow bathing the whole room in scarlet. I'm sure that the Ford Popular car, whose bonnet we saw briefly, to denote an ordinary street, was a post war model. Others might spot more anachronisms, but I was far too swept away with the story to notice.<br/><br/>From the first to the last, the lighting is low, the colour grading desaturated and bathed in brown, so that it takes a short while to become accustomed to the gloom.<br/><br/>The sound is clear, the dialogue comprehensible, even to this viewer's increasing deafness. The music is apt, yet understated. The voices do not fight for your ears over the trumpets and timpani.<br/><br/>A cogent, moving account of a few days in May, 1940 when the future of our country hung on the wits of a few men."
"Turfseer","7","0","3","4 February 2018"," Oldman shines in impeccable performance as Director Wright narrowly avoids pitfall of complete hagiography
","Political leaders often come to represent the embodiment of a nation, particularly during wartime. In reality, they are only singular entities, part of a greater whole. The challenge in any fictional representation is to humanize them, and avoid hagiography at all costs. Joe Wright manages to do that, but comes close to putting his Churchill on a pedestal. Nonetheless, one must still admire the effort.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour covers the period of Churchill's ascendancy to the office of the Prime Minister, through the darkest hour of Britain's retreat from Dunkirk and near capitulation to the Nazis. This particular period in British history usually is regarded as Churchill's finest hour, so the tendency to elevate the iconic figure to almost unquestioning estimable status, is ever present. But Churchill was flawed in more than ways than one, and notably he was cast out of office by popular demand, following the end of World War II.<br/><br/>The notion that Churchill was a politically flawed candidate is ably brought to the fore by Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten. There was principally the debacle of the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, as well as his support for Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis in 1936. What's more it was Churchill's unpredictable temper (magisterially conveyed by Gary Oldman in an Oscar-worthy role), that led to great reluctance (particularly among members of his own Conservative party) to elevate him as head of state.<br/><br/>When we first meet Oldham as Churchill, his unpredictable demeanor is on display in full relief as he berates his newly minted secretary, Elizabeth Layton, who has difficulty understanding him while taking dictation (Layton jointed Churchill's staff a year later than depicted here). In addition, Kristin Scott Thomas, in a minor part, is most convincing as Churchill's wife Clementine, who remains supportive but isn't afraid to criticize her often brusque husband, when he's in need of some choice words to mollify his often over-the-top behavior.<br/><br/>Director Wright did a fine job of casting the principals, as they all resemble their real-life counterparts, fitfully. This is particularly true of Neville Chamberlain and King George VI, who look and sound like the real thing. One fact I was unaware of was that Churchill kept Chamberlain on in an advisory role even after he was roundly dismissed from office.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best scenes in the film are the meetings between Churchill and the King. Ben Mendelsohn does a better job as King George VI than Colin Firth's Oscar-winning performance in ""The Kings Speech."" Not only does he look like George VI, but here the King appears more adapted to his speech disability than was depicted in the earlier film. The King's misgivings about Churchill eventually give way to admiration, as they end up on the same page in their determination to defeat Hitler.<br/><br/>Wright's antagonist here is Lord Halifax, who declined to become Prime Minister despite strong support in his Conservative party (it was in fact the Labour and Liberal parties who were against Halifax, finding Churchill the lesser of two evils!). Halifax wanted a negotiated peace with the Germans as he feared that Britain would soon lose the war and incur massive civilian losses. In hindsight, Churchill's prescient views on Hitler and the Nazi menace appear morally superior to Halifax and the so-called ""appeasers"" in the Conservative party. But in the context of the times, ""appeasement"" was quite understandable, given the fear of another World War I debacle, so imprinted in the minds of all Europeans who lived through that devastating conflict.<br/><br/>Wright's treatment of Churchill during the Dunkirk crisis is well-balanced. We discover it's Churchill's idea to institute ""Operation Dynamo,"" where a flotilla of private boats were conscripted to save the Army stranded on Dunkirk beach. But it was also Churchill who ordered the garrison at Calais to stall the Germans from reaching Dunkirk before the evacuation. Wright's best visual is a shot of the beleaguered troops at Calais about to be annihilated; the camera pulls upward as the doomed troops are now a dot, with the German bombers raining bombs on their untenable position.<br/><br/>By its very nature, the Darkest Hour narrative is inherently dialogue heavy. But Wright very cleverly follows Churchill almost as if everything is in ""real time"" (yes it's over a few months but feels like days). Wright constantly is shifting scenes, taking us from Churchill's study, to the underground bunker, outside on the streets and in Parliament. The only dark stain here is Wright's decision to create that subway scene (or as the Brits call it, the ""underground"") out of whole cloth.<br/><br/>Wright argues that Churchill purportedly disappeared at times and often would go and speak with people out on the street for their input. It never happened that Churchill took a ride on the subway and spoke to the common people. It's a scene that feels forced, especially where he has Churchill take advice from a black man of Caribbean origin (it might be comforting to know Churchill harbored no ill-will toward minorities, but historically he was probably just as elitist as both his confederates and adversaries at the time!).<br/><br/>Ultimately there is enough here to conclude that Joe Wright has avoided complete hero worship (narrowly!). With Oldman's impeccable performance and a fluid recreation of a key period in world history, Darkest Hour is one of the stronger entries in this year's Oscar pantheon."

","A biography movie about the days following Winston Churchill's assignment as the prime minister of Britain. I think the movie is a bit exaggerated. It merely consists of close-up scenes to Churchill who is played by Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman is indeed very successful in impersonating Churchill, especially the way he smokes cigars, drinks whiskey together with his sluggish movements are fascinating. But come on guys, that's all about it. I even got a little bored towards the end of movie. I think some people take it too seriously. Maybe they are craving for a national hero. If they ask me that is not Churchill but those left alone in Calais. 7 points overall for Gary Oldman's performance."
"martontomka","9","0","3","4 February 2018"," The best picture of the year despite a few negligible flaws
","After seeing the trailer, I walked in to the cinema with great excitement to watch this movie, and it did not disappoint for a second. It was written to give Gary Oldman the opportunity to earn his Oscar, and boy did he do so.<br/><br/>I am not going to further explain the reasons why Oldman's performance is extraordinary, it is surely obvious for those who have seen this movie. But I would like to mention two supporting actors whose brilliant work made it possible for Oldman to excel: Stephen Dillane's perfect performance as the realist Halifax and Ben Mendelsohn's performance as King George VI were truly amazing.<br/><br/>The thing I liked most about this movie is the rapid transition from the funny, joyful, even mischievous atmosphere of the beginning of the film to the troubling, shocking and dark reality of the nazi threat. Events escalated very quickly, and the change in Oldman's behaviour illustrated perfectly the seriousness of the situation. He had to make a choice which affected milllions of lives and he had to endure pressure that very few could cope with. The scene showing the siege of Calais represented the huge responsibility on his shoulders and the tragedy of his position: whatever he does, his decisions will cost lives. As a result of his strong and confident personality, he managed to overcome his doubts and did what was necessary. The ending scene was the perfect resolution to this story: his famous speech that changed the course of history.<br/><br/>However, there were some small flaws in the movie. The film makes us believe that almost every citizen in the UK was against peace talks, when this is in fact not true. A lot of people (not just among politicans, but among every layer of british society) were supporting peace talks, as there are a lot of different opinions in every society. No country can be on a full consensus regarding such complicated questions: even though the majority might have been against peace talks, it was not such an overwhelming majority as this movie makes us think.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the scene in the subway was not realistic at all. I do not think for a second that any politician in any country would be greeted this way by every single person on the train. There must have been at least a few people there who disagreed with Churchill's policies: for example there were a lot of socialists amongst the UK citizens at that time (especially amongst poor people) and most of them despised Churchill, and Churchill despised them as well (one of his famous quotes: ""Socialism is the philosophy of failure..."").<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is the perfect tribute to Winston Churchill, and for me the main message of the film was this: democracy is what saved the UK in this darkest hour of European history. After a heavy battle of two different ideas of how Britain should move forward, a talented politician called Churchill managed to convince the parliament and the people that the right choice was continuing to wage war, and after the majority backed his stance againt nazi Germany, it turned out he was right. He was the perfect prime minister for wartime, and as peace drew nearer he was quickly replaced, even though he was considered to be a hero among many: an unexpected turn that could only be possible in a true democracy."

","This story follows closely Christopher Nolan's "" Dunkirk"". In that film, Churchill barely makes an appearance, in ""The Darkest Hour"" Dunkirk doesn't make an appearance. Perhaps the two should be combined?<br/><br/>Gary Oldman is sensational as Churchill. His career has some difficult moments in retrospect. Director Joe Wright circumvents this by concentrating on a few weeks, Great Britain's Darkest Hour, when Western Europe had capitulated to the Nazi war machine, the USA sat on its hands, and the British army was about to be wiped out in France.<br/><br/>Oldman is complimented by some fine supporting, if underwritten, roles. Kirsten Scott Thomas is cruelly underused as Churchill's wife, eking the maximum out of her few minutes of screen time. As Halifax, Stephen Dillane is magnificent in a superbly oleaginous portrayal. Ben Mendelsohn develops King George V from foe to friend in quick time.<br/><br/>The political scenes are atmospheric and terrific, the oratory a reminder of how powerful a good speech can be. Lily James is easy on the eye as Churchill's secretary, but the part feels clunky. It pulls a pretty young woman into the story, but does little else. Adie Haastrup's part as the only black face in the film feels a little contrived in the tube carriage scene which itself feels very contrived.<br/><br/>Yet these quibbles are part of the films strength. Wright has crafted a drama out of great raw material, the two hour running time flies by."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","3","2 February 2018"," A Powerful Performance by Oldman, Given the Stage to Itself
","Against the backdrop of the second world war, with mainland Britain on the brink of a Nazi invasion, Winston Churchill is appointed prime minister amidst almost universal reluctance. Determinedly anti-capitulation, he's swimming against the stream from day one with an embarrassed, vengeful political faction in his war ministry and a wary, unconvinced king watching his every move. The entire weight of this film rests on the strength of its central performance, as one might argue any biopic should, and Gary Oldman, once again, proves up to the task. His take on Churchill is transformative and enveloping. He lives the role, becoming this historical giant through wardrobe and makeup, but also speech, posture and subtle mannerism. The power of his convictions on full display, we can almost see each sharp, momentous proclamation form upon his quivering lips before it's barked out into the air. In fact, that formulation is a crucial piece of the story: as his speeches and opinions develop, we see them change shape, wording and direction, progressing through various rough drafts to a tight, powerful, focused final product. The plot tends to slow down at points, and not every supporting character deserves the scrutiny they receive, but as mere decoration for the one man show, those flaws can be somewhat overlooked. Overall, it's a very well-constructed, finely focused narrative that gives the audience a sweeping glimpse of the man himself, both guarded before the sting of his political enemies and vulnerable in the friendlier confines of his home or office. Interesting to pair this with Dunkirk, a fellow Best Picture nominee, as the two explore the same military event from very different perspectives."
"justinwfirestone","6","0","2","2 February 2018"," An interesting pair for ""Dunkirk""
","The best acting always includes the best yelling, and Gary Oldman does some of the best WWII yelling since Bruno Ganz in Downfall or George C. Scott from Patton. In fact, that would have been a great movie, Oldman, Ganz, and Scott yelling at each other about everything or nothing at all, trapped in a bunker for two hours or more.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour shows us a Winston Churchill who mumbles and bumbles and stumbles through the weeks of the Battle of Dunkirk, when there was no steady coalition in the British Parliament to pursue a course of non-capitulation, and a dying Neville Chamberlain seeking to appease Hitler one last time. Catching Darkest Hour in close temporal proximity to Dunkirk is an interesting movie pairing, one getting shelled at on the beaches of Dunkirk, another getting yelled at in the basements of London.<br/><br/>Oldman shuffles around with neck popped down and eyes popped up over thick glasses, like a turtle or overfed goose, smacking a cigar and drinking champagne as if always on holiday. Why not lie about some of the news when all of it seems so awfully bad?<br/><br/>Oldman deserves any awards he gets, showing you can find interim solutions to problems that cannot be solved immediately, sometimes winning a war of words, sometimes winning a war with words."

","I put off seeing ""Darkest Hour"" forever, and pretty much assumed I would only watch it, if I ever did, when it hit Blu-Ray a few months from now after awards hoopla had died down. I figured Joe Wright + historical English biopic + awards bait performance = snoozer. But then the film was nominated for a buttload of BAFTAs, I started to get the feeling that it would be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar (which it was), and the Oscar completist in me finally convinced me to see the damn thing.<br/><br/>So the fact that I thought it was pretty darn good can partially be chalked up to very low expectations. But I also think this film resonated with me, and appears to be doing so with many others if box office receipts and awards attention are any indication, because I needed a movie like this right now in our dark times. I need to believe that there are leaders out there who have the best interest of the people in mind. I need to believe in a time of national pride (even if not American pride) and the ability of a country full of citizens to ban together for a cause that is much bigger than any one individual. Is the film historically accurate? Oh, probably not. Even if the facts are generally right (and I don't know whether or not they are), I imagine much has been embellished for dramatic purposes, and I know that one scene, in which Winston Churchill rides the underground and polls a group of everyday Londoners on their thoughts about fighting off Nazi Germany or giving into peace talks, was outright fabricated. But I don't care. That stupid manipulative scene worked on me even as I knew I shouldn't let it.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it's slick and extremely well made, clicking along and maintaining a blistering energy. It looks glossy as a magazine, and Gary Oldman, who will most certainly win an Oscar, leaves not a bit of the pretty scenery unchewed. But he does deliver one of the better biopic performances in recent memory, because he chooses to create an actual character rather than a blustery impersonation. <br/><br/>And in a happy accident, ""Darkest Hour"" happens to be a perfect companion piece to another Best Picture nominee from this year, ""Dunkirk,"" as the battle at the center of the latter film plays a major role in the plot of the former.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","This season of the Academy Awards has two strong contenders in movies that deal with the events that took place in May and early June 1940. While Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk used the power of the computer effects to retrace the saga of the evacuation of the British army from the beaches of Europe in the first year of WWII, Joe Wright's Darkest Hour takes us in the shady rooms of the politicians and army decision makers who had to make crucial decisions after the disastrous beginning of the war. While the focus in the first movie was on the collective resistance and heroism, the later puts on the first plan the personality of the man who took upon himself the reigns of power in the most difficult moments of the history of the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>There is a lot of history in Darkest Hour, part of it facts, some other fiction trying to be true to the spirit of history. 'se non e vero, e ben trovato' - 'Even if it is not true, it is a good story'. The vision created by the authors of the script presents Winston Churchill as a candidate of compromise at a crossroad of the history, who reaches the peak because he is the only politician capable of gathering Labor opposition support for a national unity government. The conservative party and the king himself are very hesitant about his nomination, and much of the first weeks (described in the movie) of his prime-ministry will be faced finessing the attempts to have him replaced by an internal party coup, and fighting to take the kingdom firmly on the path of uncompromising resistance to the Nazi enemy and fierce fight to total victory, in the conditions of the defeat of the allied armies and fall of most of the Western Europe under German occupation. It's a story of political intrigue and the personal story of the controversial politician becoming the leader of the free world at war.<br/><br/>Director Joe Wright does in my opinion a very good work in building the story as a political thriller, re-creating to detail the atmosphere of London at war, and bringing to life on screen the characters of the principal players of this historical drama. At some moments he plays with the formats of the frame, we can see the characters and especially Churchill cornered or squeezed to part of the surface of the screen, almost like in two-dimensional paintings, thus creating the sensation of claustrophobia or psychological pressure the heroes find themselves in. Churchill may be one of the most popular historical personalities in cinema, but the absolutely fantastic performance of Gary Oldman brings new angles, as we see the quite old politician and flawed human being transforming himself into a leader with the moral force, political skills and strong convictions not only to lead but also to become a model for his country at war. The rest of the actors team is up to the mission as well, including Kristin Scott Thomas as Winston's supportive wife, Ben Mendelsohn with a nuanced version of King George VI (although his change of mind is not so well explained) and Lily James as his young and devoted secretary.<br/><br/>Winston Churchill is not only a popular film hero but he is also claimed as a model for many politicians who came after him, until today, when they try to prove that compromises and appeasement are not the right tactics when faced with enemies perceived as evil. He proved to be on the right side of history more than once, first when fighting the Nazis, later when opposing Communism in Europe. Yes, he was was also a human, he liked whisky and champagne and cigars, but this was not what made him great, but the fact that he fought for the right causes. One of the key scenes in the film shows him taking the underground - for the first time in his life! - and confronting the random sample of people in the train car with the dilemmas he is facing. They unanimously express their support for his own uncompromising positions. The moving scene intents to show that his strength derived from the people's will. It's a little bit romanticized and of course, fictional, but yet, this seems to concentrate the principal message of the film."

","Gary Oldman is unrecognisable as Winston Churchill in war time drama set during the first five weeks of the war time Prime Minister taking office.
The story restricts itself to the first five weeks of Winston's Premiership as he battles the escalating war against Hitler, the back bench revolts and his own mind under the massive pressure now thrusted onto his shoulders during this monumental moment that History is watching intrepidly closely.<br/><br/>The film rejects the temptation to make itself to big or too far reaching by just covering this particular time frame and more to the point this particular mind frame of Churchill as dark and difficult times are waged all around him. Or has Churchill says receiving the job in these times is ""Not a reward, it is revenge"" to the amusement of himself.<br/><br/>Never once pulling punches of the frailties or faults of Churchill from his temper, drinking, smoking, rants or loss of thought the man is exposed (and in one scene in every way) to show that he is just a man. A flawed man. But cripplingly his psychological journey from backbencher to Prime Minister in one of the most taught, stressful accusations of power (making even Mrs May think she has it easy) shows this flawed man was designed for this moment in history where he would represent the spirit of the nation against the worst dictator the world had ever seen.<br/><br/>
Joe Wright keep a massive film small but showing allot through the eyes of Churchill keeping sweeping shots mainly POV and consisting of the view of the world from a smaller perspective. Whether it be London streets from Churchill's car or France from the window of Churchill's plane hard work has been made to keep the world objectively exposed to the viewer. Special effect shots are also used sparingly and effectively to spice up the story telling from swooping grand shots from the roof of the war rooms to trenches in Europe.
Gary Oldman should receive the Oscar nomination and win for a role that is truly mesmerising to the viewer exposing so many aspects of Churchill's nature is truly tremendous and difficult feet the versatile actor has successfully done and should be rewarded.<br/><br/>Stand outs in this cast are Ben Mendelsohn taking on the role Of King George a role that won Colin Firth a Oscar only a few years ago might have caused trepidation but the Australian actor pulls off the voice, lisp with great effect and performs the character ark well creating a new memorable cinematic entry to the performances of the role.
Kristen Scott Thomas plays Clemintine Churchill to great effect (as usual) but unfortunately doesn't have a complete character ark to accomplish like Churchill and the KIng and Chamberlin for that matter but plays the scenes she does have well but will not obtain the memorability that I'm sure the other Characters will.
A great well told account of the one greatest struggles the world had seen through the eyes of the most memorable figures the world had ever seen proving that every dog has his day.
From the writing, directing and acting this film truly excels in it's execution and I'm sure Gary Oldman will doing V for Victory on Oscar night."

","While Dunkirk was the WWII film that kept us on the battlefield and left us out of politics, Darkest Hour goes straight into the story of Churchill. Surely, a story for our times. Underestimated by the British elite, Churchill heard Nazis and fascists knocking on Britain's door. He led a bold charge to fight them with everything the nation had, instead of appeasing them to avoid conflict. ""We shall never surrender"". Churchill remains to be one of the most important men in human history. A man who helped saved Europe from the most cancerous evil's of it's society. Gary Oldman's portrayal is absolutely stirring and stunning. He is lost, under the most impeccable makeup artistry of the decade, as Churchill. This is the performance of 2017 to beat and nobody has done it yet. Cinematically, when the film breaks free from the dialogue laden scenes, the editing and cinematography guides us effectively through Churchill's world. An astonishing sequence involves Churchill commuting from the Underground and talking to the British working people on his way to deliver the big speech at parliament. You can feel the electricity, the hope and the righteousness among every player. For it was the people's thirst for vengeance that inspired him to lead the charge against Nazism with all of his might.<br/><br/>We don't quite have a leader as fearless as Churchill these days, but what we do have is history that reminds us of what kind of leader he was. If not through the pages of a textbook, Darkest Hour should be shown in every classroom in America."

"John-564-342449","8","0","3","28 January 2018"," Expressionistic Churchill portrait with brilliant cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel
","It's a very good film, that sometimes touches greatness. <br/><br/>I think most people who expect a conventional historical biopic misunderstand the film, when they only focus on 'realism' and how correct 'the facts' are represented and so on. ""Darkest Hour"" is stylistically the polar opposite of ""Dunkirk"". Joe Wright gave the story an expressionistic telling, while Christopher Nolan went for impressionism. <br/><br/>Joe Wright wants the audience to feel, what it felt like to be Winston Churchill for a specific month in 1940, when the fate of the world was decided. To achieve this 'going inside Churchill's mind' effect, Wright uses all the elements that are possible in cinema - and only in cinema - like editing, lighting, framing, music, sound design in a poetic and operatic way. In the first hour, this a thrillingly cinematic film, so rich and detailed, that it demands several viewings to fully appreciate its beauty. Especially in the scenes, when Churchill is more and more isolated and doesn't know what to do, the cinematography by the always-inventive French master Bruno Delbonnel perfectly translates his loneliness into images. You just feel like you are with Churchill in his 'darkest hours'. This is not an easy thing to achieve - and most historical epics fail at it - therefore the film should get more praise for its cinematic qualities. It mostly succeeds at giving you a feeling of the times and Churchill's situation.<br/><br/>It's a very entertaining film and it works not only because of Gary Oldman's masterful performance, but because of the whole approach. It's like Weimar Cinema or German Expressionism adapted for British historical drama, far more inventive and artful than ""The King's Speech"" for example. This is as far away from the realism of Ken Loach movies as you possibly can get - and I find that approach exciting and fresh.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's not a flawless film. Many critics had a problem with the Shakespeare-inspired scene, where Churchill speaks to 'the British people' in the tube to better learn what they expect from him, just like ""Henry V"". The writing and direction in this important scene - which tries to illustrate the difference between a democratic mind and a dictator like Hitler - is so off, that it tuns into near-self-parody. I bet, that most critics, who dismissed this film, simply couldn't accept this big flaw, for example Mark Kermode. While I understand them, it didn't ruin the film for me, even if it is sad to see a masterpiece-in-the-making not reaching its full potential. <br/><br/>My question would be: Why did the very experienced producers Eric Fellner
and Tim Bevan not insist on re-shooting this scene ? Too expensive? Too little time ? It's a shame, because it probably will cost them the 'Best Picture' Academy Award. If they could have made this scene work and fixed a few other flawed moments, this would have been one of the strongest contenders this year. Only because of this scene, the otherwise well-written, suspenseful and funny screenplay didn't get any award nominations. Only because of this scene Joe Wright's exciting direction was totally ignored. But it you are able to look beyond this one failure of artistic judgment, then you still have a rich, funny and beautiful film, that might become a small classic.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the make-up and Gary Oldman should win Oscars."

","Darkest Hour is a very well made film with an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman. The rest of the cast shine as well. Another nice thing about the film is that it feels quite light despite the very serious topic. Winston Churchill's remarks and jokes will make you laugh and his speeches will give you goosebumps. He practically had the weight of the world on his shoulders and felt pressures from all sides. Nevertheless, he made the right choice in the end and it is horrifying to even think what would have happened with Europe if peace negotiations would take place. If you are well familiar with the history of this man, you will enjoy this for sure and if you are not, you will enjoy it as well and at the same time learn about this great man."

","It is rare that I give a perfect score to any movie, but this one fully deserves it. Indeed, it is so good that I was fully engaged and engrossed throughout and, when the final credits came up, I was rather surprised and actually could have sat another hour quite happily.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman was never on my list of top actors, but he is now. So too is Mendelssohn for his regal portrayal and Scott Thompson for her Clemmie. The young secretary (Miss Layton) also must receive high praise for her carefully composed face, which carried so much emotion and message.<br/><br/>I was also delighted at the humour and humanity. Oldman does Churchillian wit very well indeed and, whether or not it was historical, the unexpected visit by the King was just brilliant. Of course, the subway scene was entirely confected but it made little difference. Wright added it simply to show both the humanity of Churchill as well as, and this is important, the enormous respect the British people held for him.<br/><br/>For the key figure of WWII, possibly the iconic leader of the free world at the time, and certainly one of the most remembered, I was keenly alert to anything in the movie which would degrade or pollute this. Yet both Oldman and Wright portrayed Churchill as cantankerous, quite individually bold, quirky, gentle, witty, alert, decisive, hard-working, and just the leader the Western world needed in that darkest hour.<br/><br/>Casting Oldman as Churchill seemed to me to be like casting Winne the Pooh to play Batman. Yet it worked! Indeed, it worked so wonderfully well that, by the end of the movie, I was IN the Parliament, in Number 10, in the underground War Cabinet rooms and in 1940s Britain so much that the actor Oldman disappeared and the character Churchill emerged in all his bold, cigarish, waistcoated glory.<br/><br/>Brilliant! One for the ages."
"manders_steve","8","0","3","28 January 2018"," Gary Oldman becomes Winston Churchill and shines a light on the horror of war
","It's worth seeing this film for Gary Oldman's realisation of Churchill alone. He looks, sounds and makes one forget it's not the original man in the frame. <br/><br/>It shows most of the first month in May 1940, when Churchill was thrust into the leadership of a government of national unity after Neville Chamberlain was thrown from the Prime Ministerial office, for leadership inaction and weakness . Churchill has to decide if attempting a peace treaty with Herr Hitler through then-neutral Mussolini was a better option than trying to stand firm, when his military position was hanging by a thread. The dilemmas faced, against the backdrop of the crumbling position his forces were in, gave me a clearer insight into what WW2 must have been like than many other representations. <br/><br/>The story presents other main characters such as Chamberlain and Halifax fairly shallowly in my view, possibly to enhance the perception of Churchill, or possibly because that is what they were like, which seems less likely given their political and military careers. I don't know how accurate the portrayal of other nations actions was, but Darkest Hour seemed to portray other countries fleetingly and their leaders as incompetent. I found a particular scene in the underground tube train just so twee and unlikely that for me it seemed a fabricated plot device to explain Churchill's about face to stand firm and defend their position when he had almost been convinced that a peace treaty was the only hope. We were told he had one stop to go yet spoke to those people for much longer than that - I was expecting a lost Churchill who had missed his station. But Churchill was well known for capturing and understanding the mood of the general public, and perhaps this is one method he used. <br/><br/>Kristen Scott Thomas was terrific as Churchill's wife Clementine, and Lily James was convincing as secretary Leighton. The way these people were treated jars now, but I daresay was true to the time. . The look and feel of the film captured the early 1940s effortlessly, particularly the parliamentary and war cabinet room scenes."
"iNickR","7","0","3","28 January 2018"," Oldman's Spot-On Performance Is Key
","Darkest Hour, in short: In the early months of WWII, Winston Churchill was asked by the King of England to form a new government at a time when the Brits, and all of Europe, faced what seemed like insurmountable odds. Prime Minister Churchill had to decide whether his government should essentially capitulate and negotiate a peace deal with Hitler, or fight and face possible annihilation.<br/><br/>What I think: I saw this movie on the same day I saw Dunkirk (2017), not knowing that Darkest Hour makes several references to the ""colossal military disaster"", that affected more than 300,000 solders, on the west coast of France. Darkest Hour takes place around the same time that Dunkirk takes place: May 1940. Seeing the two movies back to back was a good idea (if not fun) and if you have the means and time I suggest doing the same thing. I won't get into the why's and how's of Churchill's appointment eight months after the U.K. declared war on Germany. For that, you can do some research, although the movie does briefly touch on it to give context. The focus of this film is on Churchill's first turbulent month in office; more specifically when and how to evacuate 300,000 soldiers from Dunkirk (or leave them to the Nazis), and if surrender to the most powerful army the world has ever known should be considered (""Do you want a swastika flying over Buckingham Palace?""). I think it's safe to assume everyone already knows the answer to what happened.<br/><br/>Two things you'll LIKE about Darkest Hour: 1) This isn't a war movie per se, it's about what occurs behind the scenes and what happens leading up to Churchill's rousing speech to Parliament on June 4, 1940, the day Operation Dynamo (the evac of Dunkirk) was complete (which is why this makes a good companion to the Dunkirk movie). Gary Oldman is nearly unrecognizable as Winston Churchill, the makeup job is amazing, as is his performance. Oldman's presentation of Churchill's unique speaking style is nearly spot on, as are his mannerisms and peculiar personality. Darkest Hour is dialogue heavy, but interesting enough to keep your attention (as if Oldman isn't enough to do that!). 2) As most period pieces are, awesome costumes and accurate design and construction of sets are paramount for authenticity. I've been to and seen the actual war cabinet room and bunkers where Churchill and his team spent most of the war, and it's pretty damn close as I refer to my photos. Darkest Hour is Oscar Nominated for both costume design and production design.<br/><br/>Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) Coming in at just over two hours, your bladder may be ready to burst about the same time the film is ready to hit its climax. 2) Have you had enough of the subject matter yet? Hollywood has released war-era films ad nauseum since...well, almost forever. It's not going to stop anytime soon."
"c-36048","6","0","3","27 January 2018"," A great performance piece
","Gary Oldman is a fantastic actor, but I had doubts when I saw him in trailers as Winston Churchill. In all the trailers it just seemed like Gary Oldman in a fat suit with some makeup. But as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, he truly transcends my initial impressions. He should definitely win the Oscar for best actor. I don't want to go to in depth on him, but he does feel like Churchill, or at least a very distinct character. 
So, how is the actual movie? Much better than I thought it would be. Movies like this have tendencies to only focus on the individual performance, like what happened in last years Roman J Israel Esq. Fortunately this film excels in both its narrative, all around cast and style. The cast is great, and although Oldman is the standout, he doesn't outshine other actors. Other actors such Ben Mendelsohn are great as well.
The story is what I was most concerned about because in non fiction films the stories have a tendency to get ruined by the fact that they might be putting too many cliches or tropes in a story that is far more interesting without them, or they might treat as the story actually happened, and as such the story doesn't seem to have much focus. However this story seems to get the balance right. While they do exceptionally well in the story department, out of three most important things to me in a film (story, characters and style) this is the weakest of the three because their are pacing issues and one particularly unneccessary scene. I'd say the first 20 to 30 minutes needed a sense of direction because they seemed a bit meaningless, but they were good scenes anyway, just too slow. I can't mention the scene in case I spoil it for anyone (and i dont want this to be a spoiler review as it is a new release) it is towards the end of the film and it feels very awkward and it sort of rubbed me the wrong way. You'll get what I am saying when you see the film.
Style is a problem I have with a lot of Oscar nominated films, like Call me by your name or Lion, and so many others. With bland cinematography and sound, its hard to remember these films, and for someone like me who loves film it annoys me when I see these high calibre films made with little effort besides from the writer and actors. However this film has a great style, utilizing bright white colours and grey to emphasize the time period, and also the depressing state that Europe was in. The sound was fairly effective with a forgettable but effective score, and great sounds that established the period. There is this one call that I believe is an actual recording from this event. That's either cool if they did find the recording, or props to the sound department that made me actually believe it was an actual 1940 recording. 
So this film is pretty great, establishing that 2017 had not only had really great films, but really great WW2 films too. Although a few flaws hold it back from the 10/10 rating, this movie is great and well worth a watch at the theatres."
"tmpsvita","8","0","3","25 January 2018"," A great surprise
","Probably this is one of the biggest and most beautiful surprises that the cinema has reserved for me for this year that has just passed.
""Darkest Hour"" is a surprise on several fronts, not only the narrative but also, and perhaps above all, on the technical one.
In fact, the film enjoys an extraordinary visual and artistic component.
A cinematography of the most beautiful of the year that, with fascinating colors and extremely atmospheric lights, fills the film with beautiful images, to say the least suggestive and always remarkably coherent with the tone, which changes several times during the events, that the director Joe Wright decided to give the film.
Also worthy of note is his work for the directing which is rigorous in form and ambitious in content with shots full of symbolism and visually very beautiful.
Excellent also the soundtrack that plays a very important role, almost always keeping the tension high involving the viewer; moreover it is greatly helped by an extraordinary editing.
Impossible not congratulate to Gary Oldman who, with his masterly interpretation, his unique look and movements, mostly of the body, studied in the smallest detail, gives us the best Winston Churchill in the history of cinema.
Furthermore, impeccable make-up and faithful costumes make it perfectly credible.
What prevents me from calling it a film masterpiece is its fluctuating rhythm, it starts in a perfect, fast, captivating, pressing and engaging way, but from the second half onwards it becomes heavy due to a slower, perhaps inevitable."
"Grumphy","7","0","3","24 January 2018"," Not dark enough
","Darkest Hour<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone's heard anything about that story before. Is it real? Yes? How real is it? Does it matter? Pretty much everything in the film is overshadowed by the performance of the majesty that is Gary Oldman. So much so that it's even nominated for the Oscar Award in Best Achievement in Cinematography, though it has its fair share of ""mishaps"". Anyway. Back to the screenplay, which, once again, as it's a ""based on"" production, takes perhaps certain liberties that are somewhat difficult to swallow in the form of inane scenes and moments that would be (are) cringe worthy if not for the great acting. <br/><br/>Oldman is spectacular and like some have said - it's a one man show. Which it's true. Not to lessen others, well established members of the cast, who are also great, but it just goes to show the magnitude of Oldman's performance and pretty much just because of that, it's a film worth watching.<br/><br/>All in all, the general set design, costumes and make up are to be praised. However, the camera work is way over the top at times and goes overboard with the extravagant behaviour. Unnecessarily so. It did not help the storytelling, if anything, it diminished it and the general effort put in the rest of the film's CGI budget. Definitely not something worth giving an Oscar for. <br/><br/>Directing wise, if you've seen Joe Wright's earlier work, you pretty much know what you can expect. He does a decent job, but it rarely touches the ceiling. And though Darkest Hour is enjoyable for the most part, the aforementioned issues cripple the story. It seems like director himself was on the point were he had to choose and unfortunately he chose to give in. Perhaps it makes the story more cinematic. One could argue. But it definitely didn't make it dark enough."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","3","23 January 2018"," The epitome of an Oscar showcase
","""Darkest Hour"" (one of the best titles this year in my opinion) is a new American/British co-production from 2017, mostly in the English language and this one takes us into the life and world of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the most crucial days and weeks from his political career. This is not a biopic at all as the focus is really just on a pretty brief period of time. When you hear Gary Oldman is playing Churchill you could already guess that this would be a force to reckon with and so it came indeed. He seems a lock to win the Oscar now, even a safer bet than the other 3 actors McDormand, Rockwell and Janney, who all seem pretty safe themselves. This movie here runs for over 2 hours, pretty long in fact, and it was directed by Golden Globe nominee Joe Wright who adds another film to his body of work that you could call a period piece, even if it lacks the literary references like his Keira Knightley works. The standout here is certainly Oldman as we see him fight against political enemies, but also find out about his more personal character when he interacts with the females played by Lily Collins and Kristin Scott Thomas, for example about his not so pleasant nickname. Still the key in here is all about politics obviously, namely how Churchill manages one by one to gain everybody's trust and convince them that fighting Hitler and not making piece with him is the right approach. This includes the young woman typing his speeches, the king, the former prime minister and of course the British people. The film also lives through the strength of individual scenes like the Tiger's Mouth scene, the final speech, the phone talk with the American President, the subway scene and many others. Oldman nails the part and the make-up sure helps him to an extent that a second Oscar may come for that. Films focusing on Dunkirk, at least to some extent, seem really frequent this year as besides Chris Nolan's work, we also have a movie starring Gemma Arterton that has some references about this historically memorable place.<br/><br/>What else can you say about this one here though? I think it is very well-crafted and lacks any kind of weaknesses altogether, also from the technical perspective. It is a great character study and there are many really interesting moments and references that make you want to check them out after the credits roll in like Gallipoli, Wallis Simpson and a lot more. Of course, you may be familiar with the latter already if you have seen the Best Picture winner ""The King's Speech"" from a few years earlier as King George VI plays a major role in both films and they are set at the exact same time of course and show us how standing up verbally against the Nazi reign in Germany was essential back then. These two may also be a nice choice for a double feature. This one here is not a contender in the Best Picture category though of course at the Oscars, but that's fine. There are still enough reasons to see this one, not just the historic, and I think you really wanna go for it. There's also lots of tongue-in-cheek humor in here fitting Churchill's funny side (""can only deal with one **** at a time""). It may not be one of my biggest favorite films from 2017, but given the runtime, this film really flew by. Unless you really aren't into history movies, you wanna check this one out. I give it a thumbs-up of course."

","22 January 2018
Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Darkest Hour. Darkest hour indeed. This biopic of Winston Churchill showcases his rise to Prime Minister and the battles he faced whilst in office during some of the darkest days of the history of Great Britain. Now, my knowledge of history is not very comprehensive so I came into this film with an open mind and a trust that what I was being shown was fairly close to the truth as far as historical accuracy was concerned. That being so, I was quite surprised to learn how he was being undercut by members of parliament and being pushed into making decisions he wasn't ready to make. Politics is another area which often eludes me but this film drew me in and I was gripped right from the start. Gary Oldman was outstanding in his role as Winston, he brought a vulnerability to the man, whilst portraying his immense strength, and massive credit must be given to the make up department for his transformation. If you looked into his eyes you could see it was him, and a side profile of his mouth also gave him away but apart from that we were looking at Churchill the whole time. The glorious Kristin Scott Thomas played the long suffering Clemmie and brought her usual dazzling pizazz to the character. Amongst the superb remaining supporting cast I must mention Ben Mendelsohn who was cleverly cast as King George VI, he brought a believability to the role which showed a man fearful for his country and steadfast in his support for those he felt would do their best for him. A great, bleak, dark, powerful film, I believe we may be looking at the winner of this year's Best Actor at the Oscars."

","Dear readers, finally I watch Darkest Hour. Like shown in trailers, this movie is about Winston Churchill in the very impressive diplomacy in history. Churchill was well-known for his firm action against Hitler and Nazi across Europe. His ideas and military intervention had saved many lives, not just in Dunkirk, but for whole Europe. Churchill is not just a hero for United Kingdom and alliances, but for the history of mankind that refused to be dictatorized by Hitler. Gary Oldman is this movie is really amazing, he is acting perfectly just like the old man (Churchill), his voice, his style, his fashion, his remark of ""V"" symbol, his cigarette, his mumbling lips, etc. Gary Oldman had done such a hardwork in this movie. I appreciate that. Gary Oldman is really different in this movie, as habitually I have seen him as police figure in Gotham city for Batman Trilogy or such figure in Harry Potter. For this changes is incredibly remarkable. I applause the Director also that could live up the scene of that darkest hour of World War II, the wardrobe of all actors and actresses, the building, the moment, the story plot, and other things. I rate this movie 8, because in the story plot, we just see Churchill finding ideas to defeat Hitler, not his military intervention. I imagined I can see war in this movie, but I could not, maybe this movie is not going to show up the war, but the figure behind the war. Among other movies in this January, Darkest Hour will lead this year dramatically and people will reflect the history by watching the old man."

"Prismark10","5","0","5","20 January 2018"," Winston the legend than the more layered man
","Growing up in the 1980s with a right wing Thatcher government in Britain who seemed to eulogize Winston Churchill at every occasion even if she had barely known the man. I ended up not being over enthused by the man even if he was the right person to be a war leader in world war 2, no doubt helped by copious amounts of alcohol.<br/><br/>Churchill was a man with a dim view of people darker than him. He was happy to use chemical weapons against Iraqis and was desperate to use them against Indians. In 1943 almost 3 million Indians, subjects of the British empire died in the Bengal famine, because food was diverted from the starving Indians and gone to the west. Despite taking their food he blamed the deaths on the Indians themselves for breeding like rabbits.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour does mention the ill fated Gallipoli campaign where blame was laid on Churchill's door. However the film recreates the legend than a more complex portrait.<br/><br/>The film covers the first few weeks from May 1940 as the Nazis are invading Europe with Britain standing on the brink of invasion. Chamberlain was forced to resign, Churchill becomes Prime Minister but the Tory Party grandees are at odds with him and even the monarch is reluctant to back him. Some Tories want Churchill to have peace talks with Hitler, cut a deal but he is having none of it.<br/><br/>Gary Oldman gives a fruity performance but really he is a long line of actors who have played Churchill. There is nothing here that Albert Finney or Robert Hardy has done better.<br/><br/>The film really could had been dynamic but just becomes bland and plodding as it becomes a battle between the politicians plotting against him. There is that underground scene where Churchill consults with the people, it must have been the longest ride on the Westminster tube line."

"gnix1979","6","0","2","18 January 2018"," What do you get if you cross the movies Downfall and The Kings Speech?
","Like many people who have watched and reviewed this movie, I think there is one thing we can all agree on, we wanted to see Gary Oldman play Churchill.<br/><br/>However for me I struggled to love the film, and even tough there are some great moments, even to go so far as to say there are powerful moments, I was left a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Early on I felt like I had seen this movie before but perhaps in another format, you could easily relate to movies like Downfall, The King's Speech and even Lincoln which all portray specific periods in one person's life be it their moment of victory or triumph or their demise and compare it to Darkest Hour. In those kinds of comparisons the movie does excel. As a historical piece it shows the moment of Churchill's appointment to the background cries of defeatism to the rallying cries of ""WE SHALL NOT SURRENDER"", and if your into that kind of thing there is a lot to like about this film.<br/><br/>However that being said their are times when its unclear what this movie wants to be, is it about Churchill the man, Churchill the Prime Minister, or Churchill the family man? In my opinion the movie fails because it tries to be all three and it struggles to do it, even with the fine acting of Gary Oldman. I often wondered if the scenes with the excellent Kristian Scott Thomas were necessary? They were few and far between and in some scenes she is on her own listening to the radio broadcasts of Churchill's speeches. Waste of good talent in my opinion and not necessary, perhaps the exception to this would be early on when Churchill becomes PM, but the speech about family sacrifice didn't really add to the narrative of the movie.<br/><br/>I felt the scenes involving Ben Mendelsohn deserve a mention as he was great playing George VI, I immediately felt the connection between the two characters and he plays an important role in the movie, and indeed in real life. We have only really scratched the surface of his role in WW2 with this movie and that of The King's Speech as he as well as Churchill were the embodiment of defiance especially during the Blitz.<br/><br/>There is a side of me that thinks that this is sort of a natural sequel to last years Dunkirk movie, as they both are set during the same months in 1940. I particularly liked the scenes showing the difficult decisions and unpopular decisions Churchill had to make, such as the brigade at Calais who were told your not getting rescued. I would have liked to have seen more of this, but it was short lived.<br/><br/>I think 6 out of 10 is a strong review, I don't think it deserves any more than that, perhaps maybe a weak 7 given how Churchill's makeup was done."
"magnusmax","7","0","4","17 January 2018"," Darkest Hour: Dunkirk's Political Counterpart
","Director Joe Wright's award winning Darkest Hour not only met my expectations - it exceeded them. Here is why:<br/><br/>The narrative of Darkest Hour is set forth with flair, drama and comedy. As in some of the best stories, the movie dives deep into the protagonist's character, demoting the subject of the war to second place. The story's result is no secret - instead, it deals with a lesser-known, more personal subject. The million-dollar question is not so much - will the troops at Dunkirk escape the beaches - as - will Churchill prove to be a competent leader of Britan? Some people may roll their eyes at dramas so apparently predictable (though many dramas are more riveting than actions), and indeed the film does use a rather formulaic plot strategy; yet it doesn't feel so. It is engaging, unique and fresh, though a bit talky by the end. The unobtrusive humour meshes naturally with a generally serious mood. I would be remiss in omitting a few brow-raising details addressing the relations between fact and fiction. Cinema, sadly, very often finds reason to warp a previously established premise into any shape or form considered necessary for the ""adapting"" from history or book or play to the screen. In this case, Churchill's notorious reputation in the film seems a mere conjecture - certainly by 1940, the man was famous for his poor military stratagems in Gallipoli, ect - yet it seemed hardly an obstacle to his national leadership. Common opinion at the time may be assessed by an American visitor to Britain at the time, as quoted on Wikipedia: ""Everywhere I went in London people admired [Churchill's] energy, his courage, his singleness of purpose. People said they didn't know what Britain would do without him. He was obviously respected. But no one felt he would be Prime Minister after the war. He was simply the right man in the right job at the right time."" Evidently, the movie plays rather heavily on a fictional antagonism generated by the British citizens and parliament and directed towards Churchill. I wish it could be otherwise - the story the way it is presented in the film is quite charming.<br/><br/>Need I praise Gary Oldman's performance? I think yes: I shall unite with most other reviewers, and uphold Darkest Hour's Winston Churchill as (though historically false) altogether a joy to behold, and a unique protagonist, I think - in that, for the first ten minutes, you identify more with his fresh-faced typist (Lily James) than with the sour old crosspatch who debuts as something of a nobody and a failure in life. Without spoiling the movie, I certainly can't agree Churchill's temper was justified, and despite the burden laid on the man's shoulders, he was largely a crusty, selfish person; at the same time, I admire his perseverance, his can-do attitude, and his ultimately selfless intention. Oldman makes the film worth your ticket with arguably his best performance to date. A sort of veritable towering mass of quivering prosthetics, Oldman underwent a nigh on incredible transformation in turning Churchill - a feat deserving of the ready incredulity of millions. This dominating character is juxtaposed nicely with that of his typist - a fervent soul who is in a way caught up in the tragedy that is war as much as her superior. The cast is rounded out with a collection of politicians of varying rank - Ronald Pickup played Neville Chamberlain well, yet I should liked to have seen the late John Hurt in the role.<br/><br/>If the acting is great, the visuals are superb. From the opening scene, I was blown away by the style, class and the drama arising from the creative lighting, cinematography and editing decisions. Where recent films have only partly succeeded, Darkest Hour remains a consistent film for the whole duration in looks and mood. It pleased me no end, and I'd love to lay eyes on the Blu Ray edition. I noticed the general brightness felt very subdued, not due to shadows, but rather as though everything was submerged in a dull half-light, which lent the film the sensation of being forever in the thick, murky shade of something titanic - whether it was the dread of war, the drab London buildings overshadowing the lives of all, or something else altogether, I cannot say. For all that, the movie remained fresh; fresh, only, not in the sense of brightly coloured greenery. The mood described above brings to mind a sort of modern noir - again, not because of clearly cut shadows, but of dramatic lighting. <br/><br/>Too many blockbusters rely on grandiose light shows and immense scale to impress audiences without necessarily giving them much (if any) food for thought - a sort of wow-factor competition among the elites. Don't get me wrong - I love effects as much as the next man. Only, I find mediocre narratives driven by millions of dollars worth of explosions an entire waste of ability, time and money. Oscar contenders, on the other hand, tend to be more character-based, more artistic, usually not relying too heavily on effects, I find. This most often leads to immoral, revolting movies which audaciously broadcast the current agenda to the American and international audiences. All right, both ways you lose? Not necessarily. The films of both categories that excel at their art are a joy to behold, and I hold that Darkest Hour delivers a solidly entertaining, visual effects-minimal drama of very high quality. It is mature, amusing, and beautiful to watch. If you see it, make sure you pair it with its partner, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, as they harmonize so well anyone would think they were made purposefully to belong together."

"Alexander_Blanchett","7","0","3","16 January 2018"," Dunkirk's little brother with Iron (Old)man
","Well it was your typical very dry old fashioned political biopic with a strong resemblance of ""The Iron Lady"", just without the kitsch.
The film lives and breathes from the tremendous performance by Gary Oldman. Its not all about make up, which was flawless, it is really about the performance because Oldman manages to give his character so much soul beneath the dozen layers of make up. Not only does he perfectly captures the mannerisms, voice and wit of Winston Churchill, no he shines most in the silent moments (when Lily James' character tells him about her brother, or the scene in the subway). 
Kristin Scott Thomas is also good. Its really not a showy performance in any way, but she does little wonders with it. And she was perfectly cast as well. Ben Mendelsohn is good as King George VI and has some memorable moments. 
Where the film lacks a bit is the direction, because it was rather uninspired (besides some good camera ankles ) and the rather boring screenplay. They should have given us a much deeper insight than just showing historic facts and famous speeches. It would have been a great opportunity. Well, towards the ending it gets some drive but really truly lives from Oldman's performance and thus serves perfectly as a vehicle for him."

","Oldman delivers a superb performance here, you can barely recognize him under the heavy prosthetics that make him look like Churchill (compared to that, the makeup that tried to make DiCaprio try to look like J. Edgar Hoover is a joke).<br/><br/>Too bad that with a fascinating and controversial character like Churchill, from all the stories they could portray - They could have shown his leadership during the Blitz, during the North African campaign, the italian campaign and the leadup to the D-day, but from all of these they chose to write about the couple of weeks before Operation Dynamo. That would be like making a film about Jesus and show only the Cleansing Of The Temple. It's just half of the whole story. A lost attempt indeed.<br/><br/>Being a history buff, I'd give this one a 3/10, but i added 3 stars for the sake of Oldman's performance."

","Darkest Hour focuses on a few characters and issues, and is effective in what it does, but that is limited. Oldman does live up to the hype and has a strong performance, and is very likely to win Best Actor as a result. The themes focused on were very specific and the same viewpoints were considered over and over. It's not that the ideas of never giving in, and staying true to your values always aren't great themes, but I didn't see lots of development beyond the simple points or characters that were very dynamic in considering the issues. The story arc wasn't great, as people seemed to be very against Churchill for being too aggressive, and as he continues to be aggressive and take losses, people seem to side with him and support him in the end. I didn't think the political explanations for how things occurred were great, and some of the stylistic choices seemed strange. For example, why was the typewriter a character of emphasis? Despite being a very narrowly focused film in May 1940 Britain, it was fairly enjoyable to watch and for the most part a believable depiction, thanks to Oldman's performance."

"hunter-friesen","7","0","3","12 January 2018"," Gary Oldman gives the performance of the year in a good, but conventional biopic.
","Every year there is bound to be a biopic that is released in the middle of awards season. Films like The Social Network, The King's Speech, A Beautiful Mind have come along and won major awards telling the story of famous men. Darkest Hour perfectly fits this description and will certainly be an active member of this year's awards race. An outstanding and unrecognizable performance from Gary Oldman along with great direction from Joe Wright. While it falls into some conventional trappings, the overall quality is still good and makes for an interesting character on one of history's greatest leaders. <br/><br/>The setting of the film is during the month of May 1940. We witness Churchill at his most vulnerable as he has just been given a huge amount of power in a time of looming terror. He has enemies on the opposing side of the war, but also enemies within Parliament as they take problem with his leadership. A large part of the film covers Churchill's decision of how to deal with the battle of Dunkirk, which, like the title, was one of Britain's darkest hours. From here we follow Churchill along as tries to find a solution to a momentous problem that could spell disaster for England and the rest of Europe. <br/><br/>The film can get slow and repetitive at some points since it carries a 125-minute runtime and is mainly about Churchill's decision over Dunkirk and the Nazis. Specific arguments and facts are over explained to the point where the film becomes somewhat predictable as to what characters are going to say. There is a small storyline about Churchill's objectors within Parliament, led by the ousted Neville Chamberlain, but that plot wears thin quickly and doesn't come to a very satisfactory end. There are also some overly cinematic moments that are distractingly over the top and take away from smaller scenes that carry more weight to the story. <br/><br/>Apart from its small problems, Darkest Hour has a very good script that gives Oldman many opportunities to shine. The dialogue between Churchill and other politicians is almost Sorkin-like in its way to move at a very quick pace but also give you the information you need. The moments between Churchill and his wife are also touchingly done, as both find solace in each others company in troubled times.<br/><br/>Darkest Hour is a perfect companion piece to Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, the other brilliant film that came out this year featuring the titular battle. While Dunkirk showcases the real fight on the beaches, Darkest Hour lets the audience witness how Britain's leaders reacted to such a major battle. Seeing both together allows the viewer to see both a first and secondhand account of one of the biggest points of conflict in human history.<br/><br/>With experience in period piece films such as Atonement and Pride & Prejudice, director Joe Wright expertly knows how to stage and execute a film with lots of dialogue and grand sets. Most times we are literally following behind Churchill as the camera travels with him. We see his journey from his home, Parliament, and Buckingham Palace. It is all impressively done and superbly showcases the grandness of London in such dreary times.<br/><br/>There is also a wonderful score from Dario Marianelli that mixes both booming and soft orchestral music. The music usually hides in the background until just the right moment to grab your attention. A highlight is at the very end of the film when Churchill makes his famous speech.<br/><br/>Even though he is in practically every scene of the film, Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill is so good I wish there was more of him. He perfectly captures Churchill's brutish tone and attitude but also shows his softer side when he is away from the public. Oldman also plays excellently off all his supporting cast members, most notably Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife and Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI. <br/><br/>We also get a larger supporting role from Lily James as Churchill's assistant. When we are not following on Churchill we are focused on her character and the journey she went through being a witness t to one of history's most powerful figures. While Oldman takes command and gives us an inside look at Churchill, James holds her own by letting us see how others saw him on the outside. <br/><br/>Any actor who wishes to play Churchill in the future will now have to live up to the unrealistically high bar Oldman has just raised. Awards will surely, and deservedly, go to him, but also should go to Bruno Delbonnel for his cinematography and Marianelli for his score. Not since Lincoln has a film done such an incredible job examining a historical figure and makes us feel like we are right in the middle of history."

"coreyjdenford","8","0","3","12 January 2018"," Spreads light around darkness
","This review of Darkest Hour is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>WINSTON CHURCHILL ISN'T just a historical figure at the top of Britain's governmental power during war time, he's also a man with character, this character, though sometimes tipped by his fundamental anger issues, is often cherishable and warm-hearted. Director Joe Wright with his latest Darkest Hour exposes his warmth to the nth degree, a heavy package that entirely offers hands up to his leading man Gary Oldman. An actor who has impressed us for many decades with chameleonic methods through his performances, his emotive heft to carry a story, despite this work through the years, has astonishingly been rewarded with only a single Oscar nomination (earned after Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). And if his performance here can't change that, then perhaps nothing will, which unfortunately will be forever his shame because Churchill is a gift of a role and with Wright he truly gives the performance of his life. 
 
Of course from first glance you simply have to credit the way he pulls off the infamous Churchill features. The sensational make-up work courtesy of Kazuhiro Tsuji who smoothly complements him rather than smothers him, the make-up artist gives his purest attention to the detail as every spot, every mole, even the circular spectacles, and the unique bowler hat coming complete with a cigar in hand. The effects on show here are something to cherish indeed, though that's just his detail...for the rest you have to hand it to Wright, who succeeds as both a virtuoso filmmaker (images of raiding German bombers don't go without a mention) and a natural designer paying exquisite detail to the period setting and looks stunning while doing so thanks to Bruno Delbonnel's brilliant cinematography. 
 
Oldman also eloquently shows the frailty of Churchill, sweat on his brow from the stress of war, the speeches which he dictates to his secretary (Lily James), keen advice from Ben Mendelsohn's Kingly figure and finally the stress of putting up with one of his advisers (a stern Stephen Dillane, looking greyer than usual). His power in government is at a turbulent time, he sees that he's not much liked among the people he shares his work with. Members of the public see him as a valuable figure for moral in moments of war. Which not only is this seen as Oldman's evidence of dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it shows him as a reliable force not to be reckoned with. Happily it's not just a one man show. Kristin Scott Thomas is brilliant as his wife Clementine Churchill, with her in the picture he knows he can go to her for a friendly hand of guidance when he's at his most stressed and most of the time he is, his temper can rise quite easily whenever he's angry at any of his advisers. Of course, she gets excellent support too, by Mendelsohn's King George VI, Dillane's Viscount Halifax, James' secretary Elizabeth Layton. However the script by Anthony McCarten (The Theory of Everything) often struggles to integrate some of the female participants into male-dominated '40s Westminster, but Oldman offers just enough power to withstand through the lacking female narrative. 
 
For his stature in polished filmmaking of a bygone era, Wright too gains praise as here he returns to the style where he's strongest. Much like his previous venture into the past, Atonement which was set around the same time: the climactic evacuation of Dunkirk (furthered in Nolan's summer hit). In short, Darkest Hour is a gripping British political drama filled with astonishing performances and one which flawlessly brings history back to life. ""V for Victory"" at the Oscars? Quite Possibly. 
 
VERDICT Oldman brings Churchill to life with his fiercest performance ever in this gripping, and touching drama which visually transports you into the past."
"Drabble500","10","0","4","12 January 2018"," An astonishing performance from Gary Oldman
","It would not be fair to say that Oldman steals this film. Partly because it is so gripping in its own right. Partly because the other actors are excellent. And partly because it could be argued that it is Winston Churchill steals the show.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the great man is astonishing. Those who have studied a little about Winston will recognise the subtleties but anyone can enjoy a bravura performance. The Academy are a strange lot so who knows if he will win an Oscar but there has rarely been anyone so deserving.

","I think we saw this years Best Actor academy award performance today. Garry Oldman is superb..
I wasn't keen to see this movie as I'm not a Winston Churchill admirer and certainly not a Hitler fan and we've seen endless movies about that mad monster.<br/><br/>So went with a hope that we'd see a realistic portrayal of Churchill the man , who was as history shows the right man for the right time to lead Britain to victory in World War 2.
What Garry Oldman delivers is a superb characterisation not an imitation of a very flawed but very determined individual, the screenwriter has not shied away from Churchill's faults , his alcohol dependence or his past disasters like the Gallipoli slaughter or his massive ego and yet Oldman delivers under all that superb prosthetic makeup and padding to show Churchill's humour and insecurity and a vital characteristic lacking in today's politicians integrity and service.<br/><br/>Regardless what you think of Churchill he ignored his detractors and enemies most on his own cabinet and followed his own instinct and opinions unlike our current Prime Minister and was not interested in popularity to boost his already healthy ego.<br/><br/>Australian Ben Mendelsohn gives an equally good performance as King George the Sixth and Kristin Scott Thomas delivers a great supporting role as Clementine Churchill.

"MrDHWong","7","0","3","11 January 2018"," A mostly enjoyable, easy-to-follow biopic about one of the most important political figures of the twentieth century
","Darkest Hour is a biographical war drama starring Gary Oldman as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Directed by Joe Wright (Atonement, Pride and Prejudice), it paints an interesting picture of the controversial but influential leader during a crucial moment in the history of Europe.<br/><br/>In 1940, Western Europe is at war with Nazi Germany, who are on the brink of invading Belgium and the Netherlands. Meanwhile in Britain, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is forced by the Conservative Party to resign, and his successor is announced to be Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), a man most members of parliament do not see eye-to-eye with. Churchill's unorthodox and eccentric ways of conducting politics cause much irritation among his fellow ministers, and he must now swallow his pride to decide whether to negotiate with German leader Adolf Hitler or continue to fight on.<br/><br/>Featuring one of Gary Oldman's greatest performances, which is saying a great deal considering the many terrific roles he has played throughout his career, Darkest Hour is a mostly enjoyable, easy-to-follow biopic about one of the most important political figures of the twentieth century. The transformative makeup effects on Oldman and his perfect line delivery constantly make us feel as though we are watching the real Churchill on-screen and not some cheap imitation. Unfortunately, the film itself feels somewhat uneven at times, as it does not juggle the personal life and political life of Churchill as successfully as it should. There were moments where the film dragged due to inconsistent editing and poorly paced scenes that did not lead anywhere. However, Oldman's depiction of the celebrated world leader is fantastic enough to continue watching and thankfully counteracts most of the film's serious flaws.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"
"howboutthisone_huh","6","0","3","11 January 2018"," historical bs but entertaining
","This is an entertaining movie (with flaws) but historically BS. The story is out of context, historically silly, and negligently incorrect. Before applauding the movie, read some books written by respected authors of the time, and/or respected and accepted historians. This movie just repeats the same tired old stereotypes of noble england and their virtuous cause. Same story, nothing new; historically inaccurate. This movie though takes it to a laughable extreme. Take for example, at the end of the movie, churchill gives a speech saying something like the new world will restore the old world meaning even if england is invaded and subdued, the rest of the empire will resurrect it. He may have given such a speech, I don't know, however you can check for yourself, most of the empire broke off from the old order within 20 years after the end of wwii. In modern times, the brits have been responsible for more colonism and subjugation than any other country besides russia and wherever they've been, they've left behind a mess. Many parts of the world are still in turmoil since the brits exited. The most egregious example has to be pakistan/india where a nuclear war between the two countries could break out at any time. But, the repeated message throughout the movie is the noble purpose to which churchill is striving for, i.e. preventing nazi domination, yet of course no mention of the colonism and subjugation they've imposed on others for hundreds of years. Churchill is a worthwhile subject for a movie but they should have concentrated on the man, not his mission. His placement in society and his flaws instead of his ambitions and quirky character traits. <br/><br/>The movie also portrays churchill as deeply disliked and surrounded by enemies at the start of the war. They've made him out to be a comic book character by glossing over the important stuff. Actually, churchill was a firebrand before becoming pm. True, he wasn't universally liked by his peers or the public. He was deeply critical of chamberlain and his government and spent years before the war not just critiquing the govt but actively trying to get england prepared for war, in very concrete ways which sometimes bordered on treason. Like in america, the public was deeply against war but once it started, and again like america (and most countries really), public opinion changed quickly. But what's not covered in the movie is that it was months after the polish invasion, before hitler invaded to the west. Both the french and the english did little during this time to prepare. Afterall, the french had the largest army in the world and a line of defense that was supposedly impenetrable, so both countries were criminally complacent. When the blitzkreig hit, it caught their armies completely off balance and it was clear that england needed a war time leader. Churchill was chosen because he was the leading firebrand against the germans and deeply popular among the pro war factions. Who else to lead the country which was at war already? Churchill, not halifax, was the obvious choice. The decision was made, he became pm and the idea that the govt would collapse and go back to chamberlain or halifax is nonsense. There may have been talks of appeasement and negotiation thru the italians, but I doubt very much that churchill worried much about the collapse of his govt or that anything he was doing was at all wrong since he had been preparing for this role for many years. In many respects it was a role he had been preparing for, and wanted, all his life. You have to have drama to be entertaining but when you insert the wrong dramatic elements, it doesn't change history, but it does change how many people remember history and that is wrong and irresponsible for whatever entertainment value you get out of it. The self-critical, indecisive churchill portrayed in the movie didn't exist. <br/><br/>The movie was entertaining but not great film making. There are a lot of stupid elements and plot points that make no sense and were idiotic. Like why are so many characters talking with a lisp? I know churchill had a kind of a lisp, which john lithgow portrays brilliantly in the crown, but throughout the movie you have many characters, including churchill talking with a lisp in one scene, and then the lisp mysteriously disappears in another. Maybe they all had lisps, I dunno, but completely irrelevant to the story and historically unimportant.<br/><br/>And on an unrelated note, as with all the preceding movies like this, there's no mention of ireland. You know, the island to the left that was at war with england for hundreds of years. Period movies like this never mention ireland or what role it played during the war. On the other hand, england is always portrayed as this poor little island country withstanding the onslaught of the nazis on their own. At least geographically speaking, they weren't alone and given irelands size and proximity, it played a very important role in the survival of england that has been overlooked for 80 years. Yes, it was neutral during the war but it still played an important part in the war that's been overlooked."

Some sequences felt sluggish, but Oldman's tenacity and well-timed comedic touch managed to refuel my investment. The cosmetic work is impressive, I almost didn't recognize Oldman and he radiates such a dauntless energy as Winston Churchill.

","Are far more interesting and clouded. Did the British offer terms in exchange for Germans to pull up and let the British forces leave Dunkirk? You can get many different accounts from German Generals etc. but the consensus remains the Germans were just exhausted and low on materials. No doubt Churchill formed his war cabinet to leave the impression to Hitler that a deal could be struck. No doubt during the phony war (September 39' French Front up to May 40') plenty hack politicians of the Anglo French allies were looking to deal as well. So I found the intrigue a little naive in the film. There are hundred of operative narratives at so many levels of political and military channels going on at once but you only saw a single strand regarding Halifax and the Italian channel. I thought the dialog with FDR both accurate for the horses behind that he truly was. How he is protected as a great wartime leader instead of the hack appeaser who made the WW2 outcome many multiples worse to this day remains part of the American culture divide. Why is there never a film of the horrible defense/foreign policy decisions from 33-41' not to mention some horrible wartime incompetence (no battle class tank in France until spring of 45' for example, costing thousands of Allied/American lives)?<br/><br/>As for the film, it's worth seeing but in fact the ""Darkest Hour"" is linked to a famous speech and moment. The actual lowest moment would come during the Battle of Britian when all the focus was on the airfields but was then stupidly refocused on cities per Hitler's approval. Combined with Uboat results and blunders, poor coordination with Italian North Africa efforts the outcome might well have been different. It would have been a very different film of course if the timeline was far more extended. All of the Overlord blunders of Churchill are passed over as well in this timeline.<br/><br/>For the kids on the thread, there's a reference to Gallipoli that might be worth researching as well. Imagine your military cabinet recommendation, Churchill's plan, ended in mass casualties in the hundreds of thousands and you could still survive holding any office? It's not properly defined in the film only alluded to. I also don't think the appeasement policy is well understood. Halifax comes off really weak and sniveling but realize he had three boys of military age, one who would later die and another wounded. Almost everyone had lost relatives with in the 25 span of memory at this moment. I don't fault the appeasement policy other then the deliberate weakness of national defense to assure the policy result."

","I found the movie a bit slow paced, but then it's supposed to be a drama about Churchill, not a war movie.<br/><br/>What I really found unacceptable was how bumbling they made him look.
Churchill made a lot of mistakes, but he was making huge numbers of critical decisions. They don't show him conferring with generals, and trying to get actions taken, deciding how many planes they could afford to allocate to France and how many they would need to hold back to defend England. It wasn't just Dunkirk, many of his decisions were vital to the war effort. He repeatedly tried to get the French to withdraw and keep fighting, to fight house to house in Paris, to retreat to North Africa and keep fighting. He tasked subordinates to organize the economy for war, to prioritize different kinds of equipment, to organize the home guard.<br/><br/>Churchill was an energetic leader, and was not afraid to make decisions, even knowing that they would result in the death of a lot of people. And he was forced to make such decisions repeatedly. This is a man who had to decide to allow people in Coventry to be bombed rather than give up the secret of Ultra, and he did it.<br/><br/>This movie makes it seem like he was just a drunk who got lucky with one idea, and that is a very unfair depiction.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic. Gary Oldman is terrific. And individual scenes are fine -- it's only the whole that leaves the wrong impression."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","0","3","6 January 2018"," Can Makeup Win An Academy Award?....It can! Well well well...
","Darkest Hour could have been just another bland yet passable biopic. It certainly has the glossy, patriotic soul of something like Lincoln. However, where Lincoln tends more towards sanctimonious worship and Hollywood dramatics, Wright (mostly) dodges those inclinations in favor of honest engagement and high-entertainment. Much like Churchill himself, Darkest Hour is a reminder of the power of great-words-delivered-well to affect and thrill.
During Hitler's conquest of Europe, Britain was going through a changing of the guard, in which a brash but brilliant Winston Churchill became the Prime Minister and headed up the UK's stand against tyranny. Funny enough, much of the focus is on the conflict at Dunkirk, making it a great companion to that Nolan film from earlier this year.
But where that movie took place on the frontlines of the battle, here we spend our time in the backrooms with Oldman's Churchill, and honestly...what can I say? He's completely stunning in the role. Sure, the seamless makeup is doing a ton of work, but Oldman is definitely pulling his own ample weight. The accent, the little quirks, the thin line between ""resolve"" and ""stubbornness""; we're consistently reminded that, while Churchill was a certainly great man, he was also just a man.
Director Wright (Atonement) has a great knack for thinking through his films from an audience perspective. Yes, there's plenty of thematic import to the filmmaking; the playfully intense score, symmetric cinematography, and steady editing all capture the necessary disruption of Churchill in the order of Parliament. Yet even though he makes frou-frou, high falutin' period pieces, he always focuses on the understanding and interest of we-the-crowd, giving us a hyper-stylized and surprisingly cool historical trip."
"austin0731","8","0","3","6 January 2018"," A brilliant performance in a riveting bio pic about Churchill's time as prime minister
","Darkest hour was a very intriguing look at the politics during WWII, and serves as a pretty good companion piece to the earlier, Dunkirk. In fact Darkest hour and Dunkirk truly elevate each other as one plays out the story on the battleground the other discusses the issues on the homeland, the politics and behind the movement and the everyday people in Britain. <br/><br/>Darkest hour featured Gary Oldman in one of his most riveting and believable roles as Winston Churchill, his delivery, without a doubt was one of the greatest depictions of a historical figure. But, a great performance by Gary Oldman was of course expected, the real enjoyment was how engaging the story itself actually is, Churchill's struggles as a politician and in gaining the support of the people and his own parliament was a brilliantly engaging story. Which is only elevated by Oldman's performance, the countless monologues that he gives were all so powerful and really packs a punch to me as an audience. <br/><br/>While I am no expert in History, Darkest hour gives a very damaged and multifaceted character in Churchill. He is serious but there can be hints of jokes and sarcasm, he is scared but also courageous and firm. All of this is fine tuned by Oldman and his very subtle grunts, coughs and shaking fists. <br/><br/>Darkest hour was truly a beautiful film, and never a dull moment both worthy of awards and audience likability. It was an in depth look into humanity, emotions and the flaws that make us human, and the flaws that make good leaders."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","6 January 2018"," Joy in watching darkest hour
","""Joy"" pertains to watching Gary Oldman. I'll come back to that. First to Winston Churchill. Even people who have not seen any of the proliferation of his representations on screen would have caught glimpses of the man from newsreel footages (albeit three quarters of a century old). While the public persona is generally positive, there is no lacking in written material studying his dark side, all the way from Freudian effects since childhood. Churchill is not unlike a Skywalker. It is easy to apply hindsight. At his time when his influence was partly instrumental to shaping the world we live in today, however, instead of being a Luke who saved the world by pitching fearless heroism against evil, many believed that he would be an Anakin whose reckless crave for power would have plunged the world into a devastating disaster.<br/><br/>My own picture of Churchill came largely from his 6-volumes of World War II memoirs which I enjoyed over a period of many months. I have, like many TV series fan, also seen in the First Season of The Crown the portrayal by John Lithgow which earned him a well-deserved Golden Globe Best Supporting nomination. Gary Oldman's portrayal in ""Darkest Hour"" gave me a Winston Churchill that I have hitherto never visualized. Such a joy to watch. <br/><br/>We see Churchill first through the eyes of two women. But before we see the protagonist, the film starts with a sweeping crane shot of the Parliament when the fateful decision was made to oust ""appeasing"" prime minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) and replace him with Churchill, the only candidate that the opposition will accept. The next scene shows Elizabeth Layton (Lily James) first day at work as Churchill's secretary, bullied in his customary manner and sort of rescued by Clementine (Kristin Scott Thomas), his angel of a wife, with a nonchalant wave of hand and a dismissive quip ""all men are like that"".
Indeed, we will see the fire and fury of Churchill we expect to see. But director Joe Wright and screenwriter Anthony McCarten also give us a very human Churchill, with a fair share of self-doubt, self-deprecation, sense of humor (not all caustic), compassion, as well as a soft spot for wife and cat, hopefully in that order. <br/><br/>While plunging directly into Churchill's formidable challenge of Dunkirk, the film glides along its first half with a delightfully light tone. One scene shows Layton taking dictation outside the bathroom, when suddenly Churchill warns that he is going to emerge in his ""state of natural"" and we see the lovely young lady scurrying down a flight of stairs, trying to contain a giggle. There is witty play of language aplenty. In another bathroom scene, Churchill quips to a couple of government officials waiting ""Please tell the Privy Seal that I am presently sealed in the privy"". Slightly subtler is an affectionate exchange with Clementine when he cooed ""Remember the first time I met you, I was speechless"". Without missing a beat, she replied ""I must have been really beautiful to achieve that effect"". Then there is the more blatant exchange during a heated argument in the war council when he yelled ""Will you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!"" <br/><br/>It is towards the second half of the film that it takes on a tone more fitted to its title, as the Dunkirk situation becomes critical, with the imminent annihilation of Britain's entire professional army. Plead for help in a long-distance call to Franklin Roosevelt revealed that the latter was not as chummy as Churchill has been led to believe. The nearest to a villain in this film, Viscount Halifax (Stephen Dillane), was driving him to a corner that spelt resignation. The turning point (in this film) was the unexpected opening-up of hitherto lukewarm King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn), otherwise known as Bertie, offering him support. What followed was a little bit of melodrama, a scene of Churchill seeking inspiration by riding the London subway in a throng of common folks. Even some critics embrace this heart-warming scene, melodramatic or not. This inspiration fuels the climactic conclusion with the immortal speech, when four simple English words ""we shall fight them....."" changed the course of the history of the world. What can make immortality even more immortal? Gary Oldman's delivery. <br/><br/>The cast is splendid. After Downton Abbey and Baby Driver, Lily James continues to melt hearts. Kristin Scott Thomas is at her best. After Colin Firth and Jared Harris (The Crown, Season 1), Ben Mendelsohn's more subdued KGVI takes a little getting used to, but you will. Stephen Dillane you may not recognize as Stannis Baratheon but he is equally good here. But Gary Oldman owns the screen whenever he appears. As when Frank Langella played Nixon, critics had doubts about physical resemblance (or the lack or which, more specifically). It takes no time at all for Gary Oldman to vanish completely and Winston Churchill to appear. Just like magic!"

"mark-durfor","6","0","2","5 January 2018"," Oldman gives Oscar-worthy performance in otherwise dull film
","In the 1930s, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) spearheaded the efforts to warn about the dangers of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Germany. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was forced into retirement in May of 1940 when Parliament grew tired of his lack of leadership, foresight and results against the impending War. Churchill replaced Chamberlain as Prime Minister of Great Britain, in the early days of World War II. In the early stages of the war in 1940 and 1941, the British Empire was nearly alone in their opposition to Hitler, and Churchill's speeches and radio broadcasts were a source of inspiration in this dark time. One of his most famous and inspirational speeches included ""we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.""<br/><br/>Darkest Hour is the historical story of the early days of World War II as Hitler began his conquest of Western Europe. Churchill had warned about this and now Great Britain was all but solitary in their defiance of the Nazis. A peace treaty was proposed and it was now up to Churchill to decide what to do. According to the treaty, Hitler would stop his war with Western Europe provided that Great Britain did not interfere with his plans to move east and conquer the USSR. Churchill was never a fan of the treaty and felt that bold retaliation, standing their ground against the Nazis, would be their only hope of true survival. But, Churchill faced a lack of support from his own party, and even felt the pressure to not only entertain the idea of the treaty, but to accept it or face his own removal as Prime Minister. While battling with his doubts about the treaty, his doubts about the chances of Great Britain's survival whether they signed the treaty or not, and his own doubts about his ability to properly discern what was best for his country, Churchill took his fears and doubts to the people. They overwhelmingly expressed their disdain for the Nazis and their resolve to never give in. Thus, Churchill rejected the offer. <br/><br/>Director Joe Wright is no stranger to epic historical and moving stories as he has already tackled Pride & Prejudice, Anna Karenina, and Atonement which earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Directing in 2008. While Atonement did win for Best Picture, Wright lost out to Julian Schnabel who directed The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. While neither Darkest Hour nor Joe Wright have been nominated for a Golden Globe, Oldman has been nominated for his portrayal of Winston Churchill, and an Oscar nomination is all but guaranteed as he pulled of one of those rare performances where you do not see the actor on the screen, but rather their character come to life. While all the actors who have been nominated and won an Oscar over the last two decades have deserved their recognition, perhaps the most notable was Daniel Day-Lewis's win in 2013 for his performance as Abraham Lincoln. Oldman accomplishes the same brilliant execution. Not once did I notice that it was Gary Oldman, but rather I saw nothing but Sir Winston Churchill in the movie Darkest Hour. It was inspired, flawless and genius.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the movie just didn't hold up to Oldman's efforts. I expected Wright's latest work to be a moving, gripping and tense look behind the scenes of the early days of World War II. I had high expectations for Darkest Hour and gave a 4 Star Prediction. To me, it was slow, uninspiring, dull and dragging, especially considering the film is about one man's decision in a time that effectively helped to lead his country and the world out of one of the darkest times in world history. It is worth watching, for Oldman's performance alone; however, if you haven't seen it already in the theatres, wait for it to come out for rent. It's definitely worth renting, and I might watch it again, but I'm pretty sure it won't find a home in my permanent collection. Therefore, I'm lowing my rating to 3 Stars. www.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com"
"PotassiumMan","6","0","2","4 January 2018"," Lively Oldman performance mired in a stifling, talky biopic
","Gary Oldman's range is hard to dispute. He has been so many different types of people on screen that a performance of his as Winston Churchill during the Second World War would be an obvious selling point for this film. He does in fact give quite a potent portrayal of the British prime minister, whose character flaws and history of military and political failures were obscured and forgotten as he mobilized the British government and the British people to stand up in defiant resistance to Hitler after the German Army overran continental Europe in 1940.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy are supporting turns by Kristin Scott Thomas as Clementine, Churchill's patient wife, Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI whose disposition toward Churchill goes from disgust to ardent support and Lily James as Churchill's dedicated young personal secretary. Finally, Stephen Dillane is constructive as Viscount Halifax, one of Churchill's primary political rivals in the British government.<br/><br/>But the structure is a different story. With so many strong performances, the film seems quite content to merely tread water and give the audience little sense of how the war impacted the British people. Most of the movie takes place in closed government quarters, with Churchill either arguing ferociously with an obstreperous war cabinet or negotiating the fears of the crown. This is less a war film and more a political drama about shifting alliances in power and backroom Parliamentary calculations. It's about how initially the British government was anything but united on how to confront the possibility of a German invasion. While all of this is fascinating, it doesn't always make for viscerally gripping cinema. The film's best scene happens with Churchill talking to British citizens to gauge their morale, a rare moment of moral certainty.<br/><br/>I normally give a film like this a pass. But extended dialogue scenes in a film like this can actually obscure the war rather than bring it to life. This kind of stagebound account can weaken the story's grave sense of urgency and diminish the scope and ramifications of what Britain was facing in the spring of 1940. Not recommended."

","Gary Oldman is wholly unrecognizable as Winston Churchill, in the best way possible. He gives the performance of his career, and if he does not win Best Lead Actor at the Academy Awards this year, there will be riots in the streets. First of all, the makeup work on Oldman is just stunning. The only tiny resemblance I could see in this character on screen to Oldman was his eyes. Other than that, there is no part of this character physically that is Gary Oldman. The makeup people were able to entirely and utterly transform a person, and that is a Herculean feat on their part that they marvelously pulled off. But the transformation doesn't end with his physicality; Oldman is not performing in Darkest Hour, but has rather become Winston Churchill. He has inhabited another human being. I had to keep reminding myself as I was watching the film that not only was it Gary Oldman on screen, but that this was a film and not some sort of dramatized documentary. Every inch of Oldman is transformed, and it results in not just the best performance of 2017, but the best performance I believe Oldman has given in his entire career. He absolutely deserves to take home the Oscar..."

","'DARKEST HOUR': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A war biopic starring Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, when he first became prime minister in 1940. It was directed by Joe Wright, and it was written by Anthony McCarten. The film costars Lily James, Kristin Scott Thomas and Ben Mendelsohn. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it's a modest hit at the Box Office, and it's also another upcoming Oscar hopeful (specifically Oldman for Best Actor). I found the movie to be both educational, and well acted. <br/><br/>In May of 1940, during World War II, Winston Churchill (Oldman) was made British Prime Minister, after Neville Chamberlain's (Ronald Pickup) forced resignation. Churchill had a poor reputation with others at this time, and he faced a lot of opposition from Parliament. Especially with negotiations for peace (or lack there of). The film centers on this conflict. It also focuses on Chruchill's relationship with his wife (Thomas), and his new secretary at that time (James).<br/><br/>I knew little about this specific time in history, before seeing the movie; or at least if I had known much about it, I had forgotten it. So for me, the film was a good history lesson. It also (of course) delivers an outstanding performance from Gary Oldman, and I think Lily James shines in the movie as well. The makeup is pretty impressive too. The film is admittedly very slow-paced though, and it's kind of boring at times as well. It definitely took some effort for me to sit through it all, despite it's multiple qualities."
"phd_travel","7","0","3","4 January 2018"," Drags at first but it's worth it for the latter part
","There have been so many portrayals of Winston Churchill recently it's hard to choose the best one. John Lithgow in the Crown was too tall but very convincing. Albert Finney was droll and memorable. Now Gary Oldman gives a slimmer more sprightly and bouncier stepped version of Churchill. His voice is fine but sometimes he looks to slim and young compared to what we are used to on screen. 
As far as the plot this is an interesting but not perfect movie. A lot of scenes show the appeasers wearing down Churchill. FDR is portrayed negatively. It's interesting to see the planning of Dunkirk from this point of view to complement the grand war movie Dunkirk. The tube ride and final speech is moving and rousing.<br/><br/>Lily James is a lovely secretary and Kristen Scott Thomas is a little sweeter than the usual Clementine. The relationship with KG V is interesting.
Worth a watch even if you think you have just had it with Churchill movies."

Truth be told, for allot of us, this is still recent, and when people start loosing their history, they will repeat it. Oldman is infaliable, and given he is the thinking man's Johnny Depp, show your kids what true acting is. If you showed Gary Oldmans picture to an 80 year old who sees this film, to them that is special effects. Oldman, brings Churchill to life in modern 2 dimensions and helps those who think Dunkirk was simply a story, realize it was just a chapter.

"francesleegirl","Null","0","2","3 January 2018"," Brilliant Performance, Good Movie
","I would give this movie a solid B+ but where it really shines is the performance of the lead, Gary Oldman as Sir Winston Churchill, who is absolutely brilliant. I had reservations about him playing this part at first, even though I've always been a big fan of his acting work. But after the very first scene I saw him in I was sold and believed him in the part. I think the Academy Awards better take notice this year and give him just his second acting nomination after all these years. There may be a better performance from this year in a movie I haven't seen yet, but from what I have seen I'd have to say Oldman definitely should finally win his first Oscar statue. The Golden Globes have already nominated him, I see. All right!<br/><br/>OK as for the movie as a whole, the pacing is good overall and usually nice and tight and creating tension and drama, but sometimes it drags just a little bit, especially considering we all know exactly what is going to happen and how the story ends up. Not too many surprises in how it unfolds which is too bad. That's the downside of being so close to historical fact, which I always love. I just wish it had a bit more tension and action. Lots of heart though, but again a lot of that is due to the great acting job of Oldman."

","""Darkest Hour"" 2017 is a good movie. I enjoyed it and I'm glad I saw it. I don't understand, though, the rapturous reviews it has received. For me it never transcended from ""good"" to ""great."" ""Darkest Hour"" is about noble Brits behaving heroically during World War II. It's the third movie in 2017 to feature the Dunkirk evacuation. It's one of a few films in which major stars have donned prostheses to depict Winston Churchill. In other words, there's nothing new here. <br/><br/>Gary Oldman does a good job, but I was never able to overcome my fixation on his superb prostheses and focus on the person beneath the makeup. I think he should have done it without all that makeup so we could focus on the person, not the cosmetician's skill. <br/><br/>The folksy, comic, and tear-jerking scenes between Churchill and his typist, played by Lily James, struck me as manipulative and a tad maudlin. James does nothing for me as an actress and for me she brought nothing but her young and pretty face to the film. <br/><br/>Interspersed with quirky Winston, close-up-and-personal, are the politics, and the horrors, of war. Neville Chamberlin and Viscount Halifax push Churchill to reach a truce with Hitler, rather than enter into an unwinnable war. <br/><br/>Churchill, pathetically and unsuccessfully, phones Roosevelt to beg for help. Roosevelt turns Churchill down. There were reasons Americans were slow to go to war in WW II. Main reason: the recent, pointless carnage of WW I, which was, of course, Europe's, not America's, war. Americans had been told just twenty years earlier, that they were fighting ""the war to end all wars."" Roosevelt, behind the scenes, was quietly preparing the US for inevitable war, and helping his future Allies as best he could. The phone call scene struck me as petty America-bashing. <br/><br/>In a couple of scenes, Director Joe Wright brings the cost of war home to the viewer. In one scene, the camera is inside a field hospital with soldiers injured during the controversial Siege of Calais. The camera pans upward to plane height. A bomb is dropped. All those soldiers we had come to care about, we assume, were just killed. In another scene, a battlefield is shown from high above. It looks almost like a map. As the camera pans, we see the face of a victim of war. It's very powerful."
"cultfilmfan","7","0","3","1 January 2018"," Darkest Hour
","In reviewing Darkest Hour, I find it extremely difficult to write this review without making comparisons to this year's other film about Winston Churchill, simply titled, Churchill, starring Brian Cox in the leading role. The two different films have areas where sometimes they compliment each other and at other times it is as if they could not be any further distant, or opposite from one another. This same thing happened when back in 2005 you had Bennett Miller's film version of Capote come out telling the true story of writer and social figure, Truman Capote as he researches and writes his most famous book, In Cold Blood. The film was a smash with critics and was nominated for several Academy Awards including winning the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman the Best Actor Award for his uncanny and terrifically spot on portrayal of Capote. About a year, or possibly even less than that you had Infamous come out which starred Toby Jones as Truman Capote this time and yet still was about him conducting the interviews and even befriending one of the inmates on death role for the crime he committed which would later result in Capote's best selling book, In Cold Blood. I never saw the version with Toby Jones entitled, Infamous, but I remember one critic on television saying that of the two versions, Infamous was the one he preferred even though it got neither the awards, or media coverage that the earlier Seymour Hoffman film did. Is this always nescessary to have two films about a certain event, or person coming out in such short time apart from one another? And yet as I saw Churchill back in the Summer, and am now have seen Darkest Hour, in the days following Christmas, I have to make a distinction about which film is the better of the two and also which one I liked better in my opinion and I will go against popular opinion here and say that I actually preferred the Brian Cox film better for reasons which I will now elaborate on. The Brian Cox version of Churchill, I found to be not as technically polished, or shall I say that it did not come near as having the same financial backing, or behind the scenes talent that Darkest Hour did. You can tell right away that Churchill was more of an independent production whereas Darkest Hour probably cost a fair bit to make and of the two, Darkest Hour trumps it in terms of visual flare having what I consider to be some of the best cinematography, lighting and period piece attention to detail of any film I have seen this year. How the crew of Darkest Hour can set a tone and a mood just simply by it's lighting, or use of objects whether numerous, or few in a room was quite respectably and admirably done. The film was gorgeous to look at even though at times some of the scenes it was capturing were bleak, or the furthest thing you can think of away from the word 'gorgeous'. Also of the two performances, both were good, but Gary Oldman as Churchill in Darkest Hour, wins the prize here just as he most likely will on Oscar night as well. Everything from the miraculous make up and hair transformation of Gary Oldman into Churchill to his ravenous and empowered performance is the stuff that Oscar voters go for and truth be told it was an excellent performance. Brian Cox's performance used little to no makeup and yet while still a good performance on it's own merits, Gary Oldman's will be the one that is remembered. In terms of film structure and composition, Darkest Hour also overtakes the earlier film and you can tell that a much more experienced team worked behind it and they achieved what they set out to do and then some. So if Darkest Hour is visually a better film as well as technically structured better and has a better performance, why do I go with what is obviously the underdog between the two? I think more than anything it comes down to the fact that I overall found Churchill more of a pleasurable viewing experience and I was not only engrossed, but also fascinated by it's subject matter and for a fan of history as well as politics it was a satisfying night out at the movies. Darkest Hour on the other hand often to me felt very dry and at times it bordered on even being a bit slow, or dare I use the word 'boring'? It wasn't nearly as exciting, or as engrossing as the earlier film and I felt it also lacked emotion whereas it looked great, but there seemed lack of empathy at times and I do not think we got to know Churchill as well as we did in the earlier film where it often focused on his deteriorating health and on the rocks marriage as well. Darkest Hour feels more like a history lesson out of a really academic text book which is informative, but makes for a dull and dreary study session. Still both films have their merits, but of the two I have made my choice which I prefer and I am sticking by it. I am probably in the minority with my opinion kind of like that sole reviewer who preferred Infamous, to it's more awarded and decorated Capote, but in this case sometimes smaller is better and more effective."
"gcsman","8","0","3","31 December 2017"," ""He mobilized the English language and sent it into battle.""
","Western civilization still owes an incalculable debt to Winston Churchill, one of the towering figures of the 20th century and the one who more than any other single person was responsible for mobilizing the Allies to confront Hitler at an utterly critical stage of World War II. This movie focusses in on the crucial first two months of Churchill's stint as Prime Minister, May/June 1940 during which the Nazis were overrunning France, having already swept through Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. It looked like Britain would be next, which would effectively leave Europe as a Nazi empire. What then?<br/><br/>In other words, the stakes in this story are very high. Its dramatic arc is not the actual wartime action (though there are scenes of the attack on the garrison at Calais, and arranging for the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk is mentioned frequently). There are already countless movies WWII movies for that -- name your favorite battle or campaign and there's a film about it. This one shows the political and personal drama going on behind the scenes, leading up to how Churchill changed the course of his country's entire approach to the war.<br/><br/>The ""villain"" of the movie is not Hitler (who remains offstage) but rather Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary who is seen to relentlessly push for peace negotiations using (of all people) Mussolini as a broker. Halifax and Chamberlain have a number of scenes in which they are essentially plotting to make Churchill step down so that they can once again take over. Their basic argument seems to be that this will be the only way to minimize casualties for their own citizens; who cares about the other countries. I don't know how realistic this part of the script is, but it seems like dramatic exaggeration is going on. My guess is that the role of Halifax stands in for the whole negotiation/appeasement approach that did still have some support in general, despite plenty of evidence that it had already failed (see Chamberlain and the infamous ""Peace in Our Time"" speech).<br/><br/>As Churchill, this is lead actor Gary Oldman's film; in every scene either he's the dominant figure, or he's the subject of conversation by others. There's no doubt Oldman goes all out for this, absorbing himself into the character as he usually does. In the first half he plays Churchill as somewhat indecisive, uncertain just what to do next, and again I don't know just how realistic this is. Churchill was known to have suffered from intermittent depression for most of his life, but it didn't seem to affect his public persona or decision making. At a turning point in the plot, it looks like he will finally buckle under the relentless pressure from Halifax and his crowd. But then two events turn him around and finally solidify the instincts he has had all along: the first is a direct visit from the King (George VI, played very nicely by Ben Mendelsohn), who tells him that the one person who is the most dismayed by Churchill's taking the PM position is Hitler himself. The second is an entirely fictional (but cinematically pure gold) meeting with a bunch of average citizens riding to work on the Underground, who tell him emphatically that they will never give in to any Nazis. The big payoff is his electrifying speech to Parliament ""We shall fight on the beaches ... we shall never surrender"". It's a great scene particularly because this is, in a way, the actual time and place that Hitler's defeat was assured.<br/><br/>Everybody else's part in the movie is a supporting one, but I liked the roles played by Lily James (as Churchill's secretary), the underused Kristin Scott Thomas (as Clementine Churchill), and Stephen Dillane in the thankless role of Halifax. Good work all. But coming back to Gary Oldman himself -- obviously no effort was spared in making him up for the part with clothing, prosthetics, cigars (!), body posture and gait and everything else, but he still didn't look convincingly like the real thing. There's something fundamentally different about Churchill's facial structure that all the makeup can't cover for. But in addition to that, the real Churchill's voice had a type of resonance that Oldman can't quite put across. Oldman is no doubt going to get an Oscar nomination, and it's well deserved, but I actually thought he was robbed of the award for his even better work in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011). The character of spymaster George Smiley fits him a lot better.<br/><br/>The overall message of this film is a legitimately big one. It's not explicitly said, but it runs unspoken through the whole thing: Individual people matter at the level of world politics as much as they do anywhere else. Individual leaders can plunge their people into the abyss, or they can inspire them forward to amazing accomplishments. It's not any kind of exaggeration to say that Churchill and his powerful oratory turned the tide of World War II. Without him, we would be living in a very different world today.<br/><br/>See this one in combination with ""Dunkirk"" (also 2017), and the lovely little gem ""Their Finest"" (2016). They'd make a great little mini-festival centered on the same era of WWII."

","So today I saw Darkest Hour staring Gray Oldman and it was pretty good. Oldman clearly elevated the movie beyond it's story and without his ability the movie would have suffered. The camera work was serviceable, with quite a few scenes having good camera motion, mostly rotating shots. Other than that it was just fine.<br/><br/>A good portion of this movie centered around the whole Dunkirk situation so if you've seen that movie than it is pretty interesting to see what it was like from the other side of the channel.<br/><br/>Spoilers (I guess, it's history spoiler alert the Nazis lose), but there's a really good scene where Churchill goes on a subway and he gets the opinions of the public. It was a good scene to see how charismatic he was and how he used it to be a better leader.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this movie a 7/10."

","GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A solid performance by Gary Oldman makes this talky but always engrossing bio-pic work.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The first month of Winston Churchill's leadership as Prime Minister.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The filmed biography is an odd lot. It begins at a disadvantage from the start. Whereas a biographical novel can leisurely tell its tale with highly detailed research that spans a lifetime, the movie version usually is conventional storytelling with condensed timelines and hastily constructed dramatic flourishes, blurring facts and fiction and purporting to be true. Labeled as ""based on a true story"" is oft times misleading. Such is the case of Joe Wright's Darkest Hour, a well crafted and earnest attempt to tell the political beginnings of World War II and the early career of Sir Winston Churchill, as England's Prime Minister.<br/><br/>An unrecognizable Gary Oldman plays an unrecognizable Churchill. (Much has been said about the astonishing resemblance of the actor to this great man. But he barely resembles the Prime Minister, no matter what others may say. Make-up and prosthetics never fully capture the likeness of the man, although they come very close at times. But the actor certainly captures the mannerisms, voice, stance, and temperament of this crusader. It's a virtuoso performance that one can easily admire.<br/><br/>The film delves into the first month of Churchill's career as he tries to convince Parliament and his nation of the rise of Hitler and the risk of losing his beloved country to the Nazi movement. War is the only outcome in his mind and uniting his country against these forces is an uphill battle. Andrew McCarten plays fast and loose with the facts, but follows the basic outline of historical events. (Case in point: A mawkish ride on the Underground overplays the nationalistic fervor and seems very stilted and untrue, even if this scene makes its political argument and justification of the pending war.) Darkest Hour is rather talky and overtly dogmatic, with various impassioned speeches about survival and courage, amid all of the political intrigue and one-upmanship.<br/><br/>Mr. Wright's direction remains solid, although he again relies too heavily on slo-motion techniques, long tracking shots, and never-ending aerial photography, his trademark signatures, which becomes a bit tiresome. However, he assembles a fine cast that take these stock characters and breathes life into their stereotypical roles.<br/><br/>Kristin Scott Thomas masterfully plays his loyal wife, Clemmie, and she delivers an aristocratic elegance as his devoted spouse. Lily James is his supportive secretary, an embodiment of the English middle class and sounding board to Churchill's mood swings. Stephen Dillane and Ronald Pickup are just fine as his adversaries, Viscount Halifax and former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Ben Mendelsohn, as King George VI, brings the perfect degree of trepidation and concern, always questioning the unpleasantry and motives of another equally powerful man who ruled England with him.<br/><br/>But it is Mr. Oldman who centers the film in this showiest of role. Without his whole-hearted interpretation of a man defending his unpopular position as a war hawk during a time when the world prayed for peace, the movie could not have achieve its overall impact. Darkest Hour is a seriously minded film that contemplates the beginnings of World War II and the man who took his nation to victory.<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","""Darkest Hour"" (2017 release; 125 min.) is a movie about Winston's Churchill's initial month in office. As the movie opens. we are reminded it is ""9 May 1940"", with the Nazi's about to run over Holland and Belgium, and the UK looking for a new leader following Chamberlain. We get to know Churchill: working from his bed, with a stiff drink, and almost scaring away his new secretary (because she typed single-spaced). While certainly not revered by his colleagues (and oven less by King George), Winston Churchill nevertheless get his lifelong dream fulfilled and is named Prime Minister on May 10th. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British director Joe Wright, whose previous work includes the fine 2012 remake of ""Anna Karenina"". Here, working from a script by Anthony McCarten, we get a close look at Churchill in his early days as Prime Minister. The movie covers the period of May 9-28, 1940, so this by no means meant as a definitive bio-pick f the life and times of Winston Churchill, who had an amazing and long political career, spanning 5 decades. If you hope to learn anything about Churchill's personal life, then this movie is definitely not for you (his wife Clementine appears in some scenes, and their grown-up kids in exactly 1 scene). If on the other hand you are curious how Churchill ran his War Cabinet or how Churchill dealt with King George, then this movie is very much for you. I have no idea whether all of what we see on the big screen actually happened or not (did Churchill really take that subway ride to be ""among the British people""?), but the narrative is certainly there. And there there is Gary Oldman, in the role of his life as Winston Churchill. Oldman is virtually unrecognizable under all of the heavy makeup, and instead it is as if we see Churchill in the flesh. A role like this in a movie like this, is sure to generate a LOT of nominations in the upcoming awards season (Oldman was already nominated for the Golden Globes). Comments Churchill's wife at one point: ""You are wise because you have doubts"", and that about sums it up. It's apparently very lonely at the top, and riddled ith doubts. WHat a job Churchill did under the most demanding of circumstances. Last but certainly not least, as I was watching this movie, it feels like the other side of the coin to ""Dunkirk"", a very different movie obviously, but covering some of the same historical ground and facts. ""Darkest Hour"" is also far better than the weak ""Churchill"" movie from earlier this year (starring Brian Cox).<br/><br/>""Darkest Hours"" opened on 4 screens this weekend here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at (in a fairly large theater) was absolutely jam-packed to the rafters, much to my surprise. Looks like there is a large appetite for this type of historical drama. I encourage you to check out ""Darkest Hour"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
