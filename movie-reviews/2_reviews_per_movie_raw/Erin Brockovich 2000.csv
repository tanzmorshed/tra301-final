","If I didn't know it was based on a ""true"" story I might have dismissed this movie as ""unrealistic"", particularly in the first half hour or so when it started off like another Julia Roberts comedy. At the beginning the film appears to focus primarily on her wardrobe, her foul language, and the developing romance with the ""boy next door"", whom she initially dislikes. As it turns out, the actual story, according to the bonus features on the DVD was even more melodramatic than the film's. The real Erin actually got sick to the point of hospitalization from the chromium in Hinkley. The director wisely decided to cut out this part of the story, to avoid making her too much of a martyr. Another aspect while not totally ignored (she does mention at least once that she's a ""slow reader"") but underplayed is Erin's dyslexia. This makes her accomplishments all the more amazing! Personally, I think this fact could have been emphasized more, as no doubt it was a big factor behind her ""attitude"" problems - her combativeness toward people with more education than herself, her struggles in finding a job, perhaps even in her efforts to accentuate her physical attractiveness through her outrageous clothing. All in all I found it an enjoyable and enlightening story - the triumph of a unique individual whose determination, empathy, and sense of moral duty ultimately outweigh her abrasiveness and lack of social graces. And largely why she triumphs is her partnership with an intelligent and decent lawyer in Ed Masry. What a refreshing departure from the usual Hollywood stereotype! On many occasions, he effectively counters Erin's prejudices with rational explanations how and why the legal system works the way it does, and why lawyers behave the way they do. With her passion and his reason, they make a great team. Now if only the movie hadn't fallen into the old Hollywood trap of giving its leading lady more outfits than is realistic for someone of her economic status. The point that Erin dressed provocatively and this caused problems with her co-workers could have easily been made with just 3 or 4 costumes. Other than that, it was a good movie - great performances and a wonderful story."

","Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich opens with a car accident. The vehicle driven by Erin, an unemployed, twice-divorced mother of three, is broadsided by a speeding car at an intersection. She takes her case to a rumpled, cowed lawyer Ed Masry, who agrees to represent her on a contingency basis. However, in court, Erin's surly manner and blasphemous vocabulary do not endear her to the jury, which finds itself in the defendant's favor, as Erin goes home empty-handed. Still without work and needing to pay her bills, Erin, who has no demonstrable skills, but a passion, an uncommon quantity of common sense, and a defiant way of talking, finagles her way into a position as a file clerk under her former attorney.<br/><br/>It is in this capacity that she uncovers, entirely by accident, a paper trail leading to the town of Hinkley, CA, where an endless stream of residents have been diagnosed with various medical conditions including cancer, disintegrating spinal cords and brain damage. It turns out that the community of Hinkley has been poisoned by hexavalent chromium, leaching into the drinking water from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plant. The case is especially odious because PG&E knew exactly what it was doing but lied about what kind of chromium it was using. Erin gains the trust of the community to mount legal action and strong-arms Ed to put together a case that would win the largest direct claim settlement in American history, even as her personal life is threatened by her devotion to the case.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh tests Erin's limits of likability numerous times throughout the movie. An early scene is designed to show what a short fuse Erin has when she explodes in a torrent of profanity in the courtroom. Erin, the film makes clear early on, is no sentimental crusader. Rather, she is a tough, hard-nosed cookie who dresses like a hoochie and who would use anything from here heavily coiffured hair to her cleavage or also her baby to get what she needs. In short, Erin is adrift in a hard world. But what makes this potentially despicable character so affable is Julia Roberts' vulnerable and fiercely dynamic performance. As the eponymous character, she is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. As a foil for Erin, Albert Finney draws out a complex, engaging performance that is as warm as it is funny. Their scenes together crackle with chemistry and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction. <br/><br/>Soderbergh infuses the proceedings with a vibrant, almost peppy sense of style that would not have been half as compelling had a less edgy director helmed it. It would have been easy for him to have allowed Erin Brockovich to descend into manipulative melodrama, but he resists that path of least resistance, instead giving us a film that is smart, savvy, funny, and, at times, poignant."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","29","37","30 April 2008"," When feel-good becomes Oscar-worthy feel-good
","The only thing bigger than Julia Roberts' chest in ""Erin Brockovich"" is the heart this film has. While it is a drama, it would be more apt to describe the plot as a struggle, because it's all about fighting for what you believe in and overcoming the odds and all opposing forces. Nothing bad actually happens in this movie, at all, but it's the complications, the setbacks the moral struggles along the way that make it shine.<br/><br/>""Erin Brockovich"" stars Julia Roberts in the title role in a film based on the true story of a twice-married mother of three who is desperate to find a way to make a living and provide for her family. After a failed attempt at suing for damages after a car accident, Brockovich turns to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), for a job doing anything she can at his law firm. Reluctantly he accepts and soon Brockovich finds herself uncovering a potentially huge case.<br/><br/>Roberts had to have been a no-questions-asked best actress winner after this performance. As Brockovich she is incredible playing multiple roles as the loving mother, the driven working-woman, the troubled lover, everything. The mood swings are effortless for her. Perhaps the best element of her performance is that she comes across as glaringly flawed, even if she is quite likable. Her lines are killer and delivered with command. Though some of her rants are over the top, they're really clever nonetheless.<br/><br/>Finney's character is much the same way. He is really enjoyable to watch and gives a great performance even though his character never gets truly dramatic.<br/><br/>This is just a great screenplay by Susannah Grant. It's almost completely devoid of melodrama and yet it tackles so many real life issues. Brockovich's struggle to balance her work with her family brings up an issue that can connect with anyone, although the feminist tones of the film obviously won't connect as strongly with men. Director Steven Soderbergh feels very distant from the film. Every so often a shot or sequence will be artistic, but he allows the story to tell itself for the most part.<br/><br/>""Erin Brockovich"" is better than the average feel-good story. When there's little melodrama and great acting, a feel-good story becomes a great movie. Sports films based on true stories are feel-good stories, but they don't get nominated for best picture. While it may all seem too good to be true and the positive seems to trump the negative more times than it ought to, the film still feels very real and one that no one should miss."
"nycritic","9","48","65","30 October 2005"," Soderbergh's Visuals in the Service of Roberts.
","Despite being somewhat manipulative, despite being based on true events, despite essentially being a Julia Roberts' vehicle to the extreme, Steven Sodebergh hits a home run with his David and Goliath story. ERIN BROCKOVICH tells the story of -- who else -- Erin Brockovich, a single woman who has somehow lost her way and been under hard times. Urgently needing work to pay her bills as she is close to bankrupt she hustles her way into Masry's office and gets a job as a file clerk (much to his and the entire office's resistance due to her over-the-top personality) where she uncovers some papers from Pacific Gas and Electric mixed with other real estate papers which don't add up. Taking matters to her own hands she decides to investigate further and finds that PG and E had been buying people out of their homes and paying for their medical bills because they were covering up the contamination from hexavalent chromium in the community water to which she enlists Masry to bring forth one of the biggest lawsuits in California history.<br/><br/>Where most legal thrillers, in order to succeed, litter their stories with a slew of shady figures and double-crosses and plot twists, ERIN BROCKOVICH succeeds in sticking (like its heroine) to its ""little train that could"" story from start to finish. While this curbs some of the suspense, it heightens its social aspect because we identify with the little man. We want this woman who has had a hard life to get her case across, and we also want these innocent people who are victims of the ""big corporation to get their compensation. It's like a much anticipated fight between Rocky and his adversary but without the sentimentalism: it's not so much will he win, but what will he do to win. This is the kind of film in which we already know at a gut level what will happen, but what we focus on is the battle itself.<br/><br/>ERIN BROCKOVICH also succeeds in its performances, and with that I don't only mean Julia Roberts who with this role has found her inner actress. There is a scene in which Brockovich reveals to Donna Jensen (played by CSI's Marg Helgenberger) that PG and E have not been on her side, going so far as to pay for her medical bills to cover the fact that they have contaminated the water -- water that her kids are playing in -- her quiet horror is registered on her face. Albert Finney also brings some of his quiet to Ed Masry and in turn is able to ground her when things get rough near the end -- he and Roberts light up the screen whenever they are together without having any sexual tension, leaving it all to their acting styles. Veanne Cox is funny in a buttoned-up way as the lawyer who confronts Erin Brockovich, not knowing who she is coming up against. If anything, Aaron Eckhart is the only actor whose role seems a little like filler, or maybe the story didn't know what to do with him once he had effectively seduced Brockovich, but he has some good scenes near the beginning.<br/><br/>Then there is Julia Roberts in a role that should have gone to a more experienced actress -- someone like Felicity Huffmann who actually resembles the real Brockovich but was not a box-office draw. Roberts fully embodies her character and is given line after sharp line to the point that almost every scene ends with a savage quip from her mouth complete with reaction shot. There are even times when her ferocious grip on her character threatens to go into scenery-chewing. However, Soderbergh brings out a complete acting range from Roberts as Brockovich the person as opposed to cartoon, and with this, Roberts can claim this as her breakthrough role which finally separates her from her trademark persona. This was the role in which she got the Oscar for Best Actress, beating out Ellen Burstyn for REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Stephen Soderbergh would also win, but for a different film altogether: TRAFFIC, a film which would also grant acting nominations on its own."
"nzpedals","10","6","6","30 May 2016"," Great story, with great casting too. Great directing, acting, production.
","It doesn't take long to realise that this is a great movie. Everything looks so real, and so it should seeing that it is a true(ish) story, but all the minor roles have great actors too. There are lots of instances where little mannerisms make it real. My guess is that Erin wrote most of the dialogue?<br/><br/>Besides the real Brockavich, the real Ed Masry comes on the DVD bonus, and shows how good the casting of Albert Finney, and his acting, are and how much he contributed to the successful outcome of EB's efforts. Ed is so tolerant of Erin's apparent disregard for the norms of a legal practice, it is a bit hard to accept that he is for real! But he must have been. Also on the DVD is Erin (the real one) saying how surreal is the 30-second scene where she is the waitress, and then Julia saying that it is about ""inhabiting the concept, not imitating"". So true, and that is what makes really great actors, ie, JR.<br/><br/>The story of corporate carelessness and a small-town lady who found out that the water was contaminated and decided to do something about it in spite of heavy lawyers who do whatever the client says, might give others the incentive to do their own action? 'hope so.<br/><br/>Although this is a huge legal battle, there is very little of that shown - good idea, courtroom stuff can be so boring and irrelevant. We do see the judge deliver a judgement on a procedural matter, that is all that matters, and the no doubt long legal arguments are ignored all together. Good."
"mikel weisser","10","42","58","5 May 2002"," a definite winner, uplift, social conscience, and knockout acting
","Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich is exactly the uplift picture you've always hoped for. strong acting, moving script, important issues, legitimate procedurals and best of all it is scrupulously faithful to its true story. Struggling outspoken single mom, Erin (the Oscar winning performance by Julie Roberts proving irrevocably that she is more than just tits and teeth), gets on with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney in a justifiably nominated supporting role)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history. it is not a simple magic act either. Erin's got her character flaws (many of which are visited on supportive biker boyfriend George, played by Aaron Eckhart) and the lawsuit is immensely complicated, though Screenwriter Susannah Grant's nominated script keeps it all in focus and understandable. It's the kind of story we can all learn a lot from. Erin works her tail off,  polishes her own too harsh rough edges and ultimately wins a richly deserved reward (just the film itself was so amply rewarded.)It's a story that inspires americans to believe in the system and fight against corporate injustice on their own personal level. It's the kind of thing that shows each and every person can make a big difference. everybody should be proud of soderbergh for realizing what a huge hero Erin Brockovich is and for bringing her struggles and triumphs to the screen."

","Hallelujah for Julia Roberts. She was BORN to play this role! Erin Brockovich is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time! And I am VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT!<br/><br/>The element that made Julia Roberts a star in Pretty Woman is very much what carried this movie.  Julia's strengths is her ability to play street-wise, honest, and passionate characters.  Erin Brockovich is all those things.<br/><br/>The writing is dead on, making Roberts job easier, I am sure. And Roberts delivery of the lines was flawless. SHE WAS ERIN BROCKOVICH. Not that I have ever met the woman...<br/><br/>Only in some places did the movie feel a little slow, I think perhaps, because of what the movie was about.  Contamination cases aren't exactly the most exciting of plots, but it doesn't stay in one place too long and keeps moving.<br/><br/>I would pay full price to see this movie again. There is just so much funny dialogue in it.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 I vote."

","After all of the hype surrounding this film I was prepared to be disappointed. I was not! This film deserved to win Roberts the Oscar, her performance was superb. She plays the seemingly white trash Erin who may not have the qualifications but does not lack the intelligence. Through a simple research job she discovers that a large corporation has been poisoning the water supply of a town. She fights their corner for them and eventually secures them a huge court settlement. It is not plain sailing for Erin as she has to overcome stereotypes and prejudice but she wins through in the end through her hard work and determination. Finney provides sterling support and his exchanges with Roberts provide some classic moments. I cannot recommend this film highly enough!"

","Maybe this movie is not the right choice for action fans, but that is the only restriction of my otherwise fullest recommendation for this movie. It has everything, ranging from real-life documentary through love story via comedy to tragedy. And it is so lovingly done, and played so well. And it also has a wonderful soundtrack. To all the non-English Europeans: Get the DVD or original VHS, because the dubbed translated versions aren't quite like the original in terms of atmosphere created."
"bob the moo","Null","33","48","21 February 2003"," Enjoyable
","Out of work, out of hope, trashy, twice divorced single mother Erin fails to get another job due to her lack of experience. On her way home she is hit by another car. She goes to lawyer Ed Masry who spectacularly fails to win her any damages. Erin demands he gives her a job and he begrudgingly does. Doing some of his pro-bono work, Erin uncovers evidence that suggests that manufacturing firm PG&E had poisoned the local water supply and lie to residents about the content. As she looks deeper she finds a legacy of illness and a small bit of research turns into a mammoth case.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of this drama is factual and how much of it is changed to add to dramatic effect but regardless the story is involving, funny and moving. At the time there was a rash of 'environmental damage' legal films of which this is one of the more polished and classy. The film focuses as much on Erin as it does on the case and at times it risked failing as a legal drama/thriller. However it still grips as the facts pretty much speak for themselves  the film adds to this by creating a real sense of PG&E as a monster without scruples or concern for the residents. As a result the events feel more powerful and involving. It feels slow at times, but if you're into it then it feels patient rather than slow and deliberate rather than laboured.<br/><br/>The biggest reason that the focus on Erin works is because Roberts really does very well giving her Erin a down to earth, trashy feel that could have been hammy or unbelievable (she is a multimillion pound actress after all), but it wasn't. Instead it was realistic and quite warm  where she could have been annoying. The grumpy Finney is also good value and seems natural in the role. Eckhart is almost too good to be true but gives a likable performance and is a winning non-distraction.<br/><br/>The film benefits from the style that Soderbergh brings to it. It glides with the grace that he brought to Ocean's 11 and has the rich colouring that parts of Traffic had. His direction really adds to the film and makes the sum feel a little greater that the parts put together.<br/><br/>Overall this may not be the legal thriller that you hoped for and it may move a great deal slower that I thought a Hollywood film would, but it is worth it. The film is patient and worth baring with and Roberts is actually pretty good in the lead! Enjoyable."
"Buddy-51","Null","43","68","12 August 2000"," dazzling performance by Julia Roberts
","In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground.  Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath.  All the above five films expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities.  In the case of  `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&E electrical plant located in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California.  It seems that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that PG&E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at their site.  The company has even brought in medical professionals and toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears.  Almost by chance, Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&E's gross malfeasance in the process.<br/><br/>Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must concede that there really isn't much that is new here.  However, thanks to a pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph.  This may, in fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine.  First of all, she is often abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor.  Dressed more like a fashion devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion.  Yet, it is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the people she is trying so desperately to help.  A twice-divorced mother of three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in the defense of her case.  Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of internal contradictions.  Much as she loves her children, she has made a shambles of her life in recent years.  Rootless and lacking the skills necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a traffic accident case.  Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down her rhetoric or her temper  or to adopt the more `professional' attire of the business world  even if it might mean that she would be taken more seriously by those around her.  She assumes that no man would be willing to consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is fighting begin to drive him away  and her children as well.  Most fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an issue.  All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of believable paradoxes.  Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality, wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth.  Grant, by making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may be.<br/><br/>And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly.  Never before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action and statement.  She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this complex woman.  This is definitely Oscar-caliber work.  Equally brilliant is Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial, easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&E but the seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case.  One of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity harridan  a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does us.<br/><br/>If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door.  He seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting and believable part of the tale.  We feel we are being too often distracted from the meaty center of the story.<br/><br/>Still, this is a minor quibble about a film that works so beautifully on so many levels.  As Erin Brockovich, Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night."

Not only that, but Julia Roberts was excellent.  I don't think I've ever seen a Roberts movie where she had this commanding a screen presence.  Her physical presence may have helped in that regard but so did her acting. But man, she really looked good in this movie. Oh, and Albert Finney displayed some pretty solid acting skills as well even though he didn't look good. Overall, I'd say that most people who watch this movie will probably find themselves cheering for Erin and will be very satisfied with the film. I was."

","This movie may have changed my opinion of Julia Roberts.  I have never like her acting, and the media's portrayal of her as some sort of beauty queen in the 80's (and she has never been a very attractive woman) only made it worse.  But she did an excellent job in this story, seemingly portraying the real Erin Brockovich with perfection.<br/><br/>Great story, maybe a little hard to believe though if you didn't know it was true.  But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good. One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up? Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.  She's profane, crude, obnoxious, rude, and treats everyone around her, especially those who are better educated, like garbage.  She always had trouble finding and keeping a job and she always blamed it on her lack of education and experience.  That wasn't it.  It was her attitude."

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore. We love her. She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised. She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder. She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder). We love her.<br/><br/>Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)... How about...no, no, NO. Give her someone near her equal. How about a real actor twice her age? How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))? Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance. Not only does it work, it's a triumph. Finney really is brilliant. His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character. Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses? For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion). For the first time in her life she is doing something important. For the first time in her life people respect her. There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.<br/><br/>Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth. She neglects him and her kids for her obsession. Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife. Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her. It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts! She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real. That's her gift.<br/><br/>A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (""and all his relatives,"" as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the ""little guy"" versus the corporate behemoth. I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending. But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim. I haven't seen any of his latest movies, (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, & Videotape from 1989. I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000."
"kassandracobarruvias","9","3","3","7 June 2016"," Erin Brockovich is a riveting film about a woman who goes against a powerful corporation to bring justice to those who were harmed.
","Erin Brockovich Saves the Day<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a riveting film that will have you rooting for the underdog and hating large corporations that are out to get the little guys. This plot has been done many times before and in many instances, it has failed but not in this case. The film stars Julia Roberts as the protagonist of this film, Erin Brockovich. This film also stars Albert Finney as Ed Masry and Aaron Eckhart as George, who is Brockovich's love interest in this film. This film is based on a true story about a brave woman who goes against a huge corporation to pursue justice for others. Erin Brockovich is a single mother trying to raise her three kids. The opening scene of the film shows Brockovich desperately looking for a job so she can support her children and she ends up in a car accident. Jobless, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry into giving her a job at his firm. While working at the firm she begins to look into a real estate case involving Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E). She finds out PG&E is trying to secretly buy land that is contaminated by toxic hexavalent chromium, which they have disposed of incorrectly and has now affected the people living in Hinkley, California. The inhabitants of Hinkley are unaware that the land has been exposed to this dangerous chemical and think the company is solely trying to buy their homes. She decides to go to Hinkley and begins to question some of the people she read about in the files. As she talks to the residents, she digs deeper into what is actually occurring in the small town of Hinkley. She investigates further and soon Brockovich and Masry are involved in the biggest class action lawsuit case in American history against the powerful PG&E. Erin Brockovich is an inspirational film that will inspire you to do great things for the environment. She's a single mother of three, who without any formal education decides to go after a large multi-billion dollar corporation to help bring justice to those affected by the contamination of water in Hinkley. She was able to obtain the job in the law firm due to her tenacity as she convinced her lawyer to give it to her, which to me, says a lot about her character and how driven she is, which will help her as the film progresses. Despite her financial situation not being great, she still chose to help the people of Hinkley. This was a truly admirable act because she was fighting for a much greater cause. Even though she was not a lawyer, she was still an important asset in this case. I feel this helped the people of Hinkley trust her and bridge the gap between the lawyers and the clients. She was able to help the residents of Hinkley understand what was going on with the case in a way that they would understand. I think Julia Roberts did an exceptional job as Erin Brockovich. She was able to really connect with the character and it showed in her acting. This is a biographical film and I think it is vital that the writers don't stray too far from the truth and this film achieved just that. The costumes used in the film were great and helped bring a point across. The fact that she is working in a law firm brings a certain image to mind when it comes to the type of clothing you imagine employees wear and the clothes she wore were the exact opposite of that. Her clothes helped her stand out from the women in the law firm who wore pant suits and looked down on Brockovich because of her clothing choices. Even though the other workers were uncomfortable with the type of clothes she wore she did not succumb to their wills and she kept on dressing the way she wanted to. This action may seem insignificant but it really shows her refusal to conform to societal norms. The plot in the film is intriguing and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end because I wanted to know what the outcome of the case was going to be. Throughout the movie, you can't help but root for her and want her to succeed. She's a single mother going against a huge corporation because they did the people of Hinkley wrong. This really helps play on the emotions of the viewer. While watching the film I found this to be an admirable quality of hers. While there is an underlying romance in the film, it is not the main focus. The directors do an excellent job at not taking away from the plot and the story that is being told. I would highly recommend this film. The acting is phenomenal and the plot keeps you wanting more. After watching the film, it got me questioning the trust we put in the people that provide us with water. I'm sure there are many cases around the world similar to this and I think it is a topic that should be discussed more. This film really highlighted Brockovich's many admirable qualities and it inspired me. She was just one person who happened to stumble upon this case but that did not stop her from further investigating the situation and doing the right thing. The fact that she did not go to law school and yet achieved something great serves as an inspiration to us all. I think we all have something to learn from Erin Brockovich and we should continue to fight for things we believe in."
"joepanger","10","3","3","4 June 2016"," Erin Brockovich: When Self-Preservation Leads to Passion
","What happens when you mix a struggling, single mother of three, an accident, and a lawyer together? Well, you get Erin Brockovich. A film written by Susannah Grant and directed by Steven Soderbergh, this is an Oscar-winning biographical drama that is based on a portion of the life of Erin Brockovich, a woman that has dealt with unemployment, poverty, and just plain bad luck. Erin lives in Hinkley, California, a small town located between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nevada. That is where she and her three children live on the fringes of poverty in a small house located in a suburban neighborhood. To exacerbate an already unfortunate situation, one day, after Erin leaves an unsuccessful job interview, she gets into an accident, suffering damages to herself as well as her car. To add to her frustrations, her appointed lawyer, Ed Masry, is unsuccessful in winning her settlement case. After a heated confrontation with Mr. Masry in his office, Erin comes out of there with a job as a legal clerk for Mr. Masry. Her employment under Mr. Masry eventually leads her on a unwitting path to fight for justice against PG&E, an electric/utility giant. In the film, Brockovich is tasked by Mr. Masry to look into a case where the plaintiffs were suing PG&E for damages due to groundwater contamination caused by dumping waste-water which contaminated neighboring water supplies. As the film progresses, more and more victims of PG&E's contamination come forward and join Brockovich to fight against the giant. Although this film is a biographical drama, I would also suggest to Mr. Soderbergh that this is one of the best documentaries I've seen. You may ask: ""What are you talking about? This isn't a documentary! This isn't even close to a documentary."" Well, I'll have to stop you there. Although the film is captured in a dramatic way, the focus of the movie is not the drama, rather, the events. The film detailed the conditions that not only the protagonist, Brockovich was faced with, but those affected by PG&E, as well. Erin Brockovich was able to create a more powerful message that not only addressed environmental awareness but also corporate greed. One thing I liked about the film was that it wasn't littered with special effects or over-the-top dramatic music. Films that are considered documentaries nowadays are usually chalk-full of propagandic editing and loaded questions. This is especially prevalent in environmental documentaries. This type of documentary usually leads viewers to one conclusion: that corporations are bad, and the environment is dying. Overflowing with dramatic music and cut-offs, those kinds of films, to me, should be considered dramas, not Erin Brockovich. Erin Brockovich is able to make viewers aware of those issues, and more. Grant and Soderbergh immerse the viewer into the movie by giving a context for which many viewers can connect to or sympathize with: a single mom that has nothing but a few dollars, 3 mouths to feed, and a wild personality. She is split into many directions, and her personality is what gets her into as well as out of sticky situations. By introducing us to Erin, a mother, a foundation for connections are established with the viewer. They also introduce realistic conflict into the movie. In addition to her struggles for employment, Soderbergh includes a romantic relationship that the real Brockovich had with a neighbor, named George. Even after she eventually pulls her and her family out of near destitution, she is faced with the task of balancing her passion for her work with time spent with her family and George. Chasing her work would mean putting everything else on the sidelines. Spending time with family would mean that precious time would be lost in the fight against PG&E. Even as she works to repair her relationship with George and her kids, Erin has created a connection to those that were affected by the groundwater contamination. The issue then is where to focus her humanity. Should she sacrifice her family's happiness, potentially ruining her relationship with her kids for good, so that she is able to attempt to save or at least ameliorate the hundreds of lives that have been affected by PG&E? By introducing these aspects, Soderbergh gives a more realistic view of our society as humans, rather than the clips of starving African children you see in every other documentary. I think the addition of these elements keep the viewer more glued to their screens compared to typical documentaries, which try way too hard to grab your attention. Erin Brockovich, aside from the comparisons, is an excellent standalone film. Its unique story line/situation makes the film memorable. Its inclusion of the real Erin Brockovich in the beginning gives the viewer an impression of what the real deal was like, and what the dress, mannerisms, and vulgar language amalgamate into. His seemingly accurate portrayal of Brockovich greatly contributed to the film's intensity as a biography. Soderbergh's film, to me, is a 5-star (10/10) movie. It's incorporation of realness is what clinches the 5th star. Erin's situation was a very unique and rare occurrence. Her strife to survive in life led to successes and failures. Her fortunate chance to work in Ed Masry's office established a previously unknown passion about something that may have never crossed her mind: the environment. It is through random luck that history is made. History is not a set prophecy. Story lines are constantly being created, however, many go unacknowledged. Erin Brockovich created that story, and Soderbergh acknowledged it."
"Pryderi","Null","3","3","24 March 2000"," Two great characters, one fine film
","Erin Brokovich is all about two characters: the title character, played by Julia Roberts, and Ed Masry, played by Albert Finney. Brokovich is a bold and flashy woman; given all the buzz, everyone reading this has surely already heard about her wardrobe. Masry is a talented but world-weary lawyer in a small law firm.<br/><br/>Roberts and Finney are both in fine form here, making the characters sympathetic and believable. The supporting cast is not as strong - none of the other characters in the film seem entirely filled-out - but that's a minor quibble.<br/><br/>There is a bit of a tone of moral righteousness here. After all, it is the story of a nobody going up against Big Business, not to mention the obstacles facing a single mother in the working world. But it's not overdone, and the film succeeds in getting you to root for the underdog, an always popular pastime."

"sgrewe-84422","8","5","6","5 June 2015"," Courage, Devotion and Feminine Mystique
","Based on a true story of tenacity and humble beginnings, this film follows Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) in her stiletto-clad stumble through the challenges of scraping by to pay bills, raising her children and catering to the whims of whiny boyfriends. It is clear from the beginning what a haphazard balancing act Brockovich's life is, opening on her painfully awkward attempts to make a good impression through an unsuccessful job interview, where we learn that she is an unemployed single mother of three. Wallowing in her defeat only long enough to smoke a single cigarette, she makes her way back to her old orange car, which has since acquired a parking ticket, and almost predictably is T-boned at an intersection minutes after leaving.<br/><br/>The ways in which life is stacked against Brockovich are revealed gradually through her meeting with a lawyer in order to sue the driver that hit her, and later the disastrous cross examination in which her fiery temper and colorful diction cost her the jury's sympathy and her chances of winning any reparations for her pain and suffering. In her impatience at the defense lawyer's suggestion that she saw his wealthy client as an opportunity to capitalize on a lawsuit, it is clear that she is familiar with the ways in which power dynamics sway to favor the opposite of everything she embodies. Now confronted with the failure of her lawsuit, Brockovich is set back further than before, and forced to be even more driven and resourceful in her methods of obtaining her next paycheck. <br/><br/>In this desperation, she turns back to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), demanding a job at the law firm in a grand show of shouting and refusal to leave, expressing that he owes her something for false promises and the failed lawsuit that left her in even more debt. When it becomes clear that Brockovich will not take no for an answer, Masry offers her a position as a file clerk. It is in the midst of this tedious paperwork that she discovers suspicious details of what was supposed to be a simple real estate case, which sends her on an investigation of a scheme bigger than she could have imagined.<br/><br/>While the film was inspired by the story of how Brockovich investigates the ethics of the insidious corporation Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and touches on the intricate workings of the legal system, its strength lies in how deeply it appeals to the viewer's emotion, strategically taking the time to zero in on the struggles Brockovich faces in her personal life in order to humanize her, when on the job her abrasive personality could otherwise be off-putting. In the face of poverty, motherhood and romantic entanglements, it is clear how she grew to project a tough exterior for the sake of survival.<br/><br/>Brockovich's home life is one device used often to make her more accessible to the audience, revealing the tension with her young children over the long hours she must work, and her dilemma between helping the families she represents in her case or focusing on her own family. A defining moment illustrating the struggle she faces as a mother is in an argument with her boyfriend (Aaron Eckhart), who feels that he is being neglected for her work and taking too much responsibility in caring for her children. In a decision rarely made in fictional stories, Brockovich chooses to prioritize her work over her romantic relationship, a powerful choice challenging the familiar trope of a woman realizing that love is more important than her ambition. This is a powerful, pivotal moment in the film.<br/><br/>This film is more impressive than most in its portrayal of womanhood, Brockovich embodying a conglomeration of qualities which fictional accounts rarely conflate. It should not be groundbreaking to present a strong and intelligent female character who also has children and on top of this wears short skirts and high heels, but few other films with this type of character come to mind. And perhaps it is solely for the sake of remaining faithful to the true story on which this is based that her character was created with such dimension. Unfortunately, the other female characters in this film are disappointingly pigeonholed into familiar roles, deliberately contrasting with Brockovich in myriad ways only as a means to further glorify her and set her apart. There are the other women at the law firm who are mostly frumpy and overweight, and seem to regard Brockovich negatively based only on her fashion sense or out of envy. This reproduces the familiar but apocryphal idea that women are in constant competition with one another rather than being allies. There are the victimized clients she helps: rural, married and ignorant mothers who play the sympathetic characters. Then there is the other female lawyer, who, in spite of being on her side of the case, is portrayed as uptight and snobbish, unsuccessful in her attempts to connect with the working class community that the firm represents.<br/><br/>This is the story of an underdog, a representative of a stigmatized group in our society: a single mother, twice divorced, and poor. Above all of this, she is unapologetic in her femininity, refusing to be shamed for her opinions, clothing choices or pursuit of justice. Although it has its weaknesses in succumbing to an uncomfortable number of clichés, the film weaves a heartfelt tale of determination and navigating the gray areas between work and personal life as a woman. I am confident that anyone more emotional than me (read: anyone) would have minimal critique of this evocative combination of comedy and drama, which culminates to a tear-jerking resolution, even more impactful given the fact that it is based on true events. In spite of a few shortcomings and my own nitpicking critiques, I would rate this film highly and recommend it."

","A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of people in `Erin Brockovich,' a movie based on actual events, directed by Steven Soderbergh. When Erin (Julia Roberts) questions why medical records are included in the file of a simple real estate transaction between a public utilities company and some homeowners in the town of Hinckley, California, she uncovers information that PG&E may have been responsible for water pollution that may have caused widespread illness and even death among the citizens of Hinckley.  But truth is one thing, and having the resources to fight a company worth billions of dollars is another.  And that's the problem that falls into the lap of lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), owner of the law firm that employs Brockovich.  Millions of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake, but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a mailman's trousers. 	Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it like it is and won't take `no' for an answer.  She captures ever grain of realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked the odds against her. She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor that he succeeds so well in doing so. 	The solid supporting cast includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best movies of the year, `Erin Brockovich' is a well made, absorbing and entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.  It's a great story, with Julia Roberts at her very best.  This is one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10."

(Why moviegoers celebrate this is truly depressing.)<br/><br/>No, my problem is that Soderbergh is an artist -- the whole society loses when he works on tripe. The framing, the editing, the abstraction is so pedestrian it hurts. Maybe this will pay for something good on down the road.<br/><br/>But I did get something out of it.

"cjkintz","1","29","58","3 April 2001"," Hardly a True-Life Story
","One should head the warning that the movie is *based* on true-life events. ""Erin Brockovich"" is simply a ""lawsuits are really your friend"" feel-good Hollywood fluff movie that has little basis in fact. In real-life, an attorney that was retained by Hinkley residents to sue Brockovich and Masry after they took the money and ran, was quoted as saying ""I read the script; the only true part was Erin Brockovich's name.""<br/><br/>Julia Robert's performance was decent, but hardly Oscar material. I've seen her in far better performances, and it seems that the basis of her presence here is to simply use foul language and show off her cleavage. If it's foul language you want, rent ""South Park: The Movie"", which is funny and much more entertaining then ""Erin Brockovich"". Albert Finney was good as the in-over-his-head Lawyer trying to do what is right for the residents of Hinkley, but he was much much better in ""Traffic"".<br/><br/>I highly recommend that anybody who watches ""Erin Brockovich"" (and especially if you get up and cheer at the end) takes the time to do cursory research on the real-life Hinkley case. In real-life, the motivation of the three law firms was neither truth nor compassion, but rather 40 percent of the winnings. Their ""take"" from the settlement was $133 million plus an amazing $10 million more in expenses. Brockovich's bonus alone was $2 million.<br/><br/>""Give me a break!"" moaned one resident after seeing the film. ""They depicted the lawyers as so concerned about the residents,"" she said. ""But does she [Brockovich] really care?""<br/><br/>To understand why the Masry-Brockovich team won, it's important to know that the case was a settlement not subject to appeal, that PG&E (the movie ""Bad Guys"") was suffering terrible publicity, and that as a utility it could simply pass losses on to utility customers. But when these same three firms, including the Masry-Brockovich team, tried the same ploy in the court system against a company with no guaranteed income, the case collapsed like a rotten pumpkin.<br/><br/>Far from being ""environmental crusaders"" as the media now routinely calls them, the real-life Masry and Brockovich have never crusaded for anything but money."

Well, for starters, Julia Roberts does more than focus on beauty in this movie. As a twice-divorced single mother who helps prosecute a corporation that had polluted a town's water supply, Roberts is a lot bitchier in this role than in most of her other roles. Occasionally blurting out lines that sound like they came from George Carlin, Erin is one bad-ass mother. The movie is also helped by good support from Albert Finney as Erin's boss Ed Masry.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, even though I generally consider Julia Roberts pretty worthless, I do agree that her Oscar win for this movie was well deserved."

Julia Roberts SKYROCKETS her performance and EMBRACES the attitude, force, power, cleavage and a kiss ass hard gal who cares about other people so much, she presents a SHINING WOMAN.<br/><br/>Julia plays a broke, mother of three, jobless woman who changes her life in the most unlikely circumstances.

These illnesses which are threatening this town are very serious they include, Breat cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's disease, immune deficiencies, asthma and nosebleeds and in some cases, even LIFE Threatening. She spends a lot of time reading and taking careful time going through this, Brockovich knows every illness and every clients number life illness and information, Erin does not mess around neither bides time she gets to the immediate point, says it out load, blunt, bold and clear, this is one reason why i love this movie so much it's so CLEVER.<br/><br/>There are so many reasons why i love this movie, but the second reason is because any movie which has 'Thomas Newman' music performed in any movie is brilliant his music is so OBSCURE and DIFFERENT Thomas Newman has performed music for many other famous movie's which include 'Pay It Forward, The Green Mile and the modern master film 'American Beauty' with Kevin Spacey, his music was completely suitable for this work of art per say. Thomas's music is also and is most suited for Drama's because i think the contrast of the music is dramatic for dramatic movie's, maybe through Thomas's music it may make these films more outstanding think about it, all of these films are well known and they all have Thomas's music in them.<br/><br/>When i first seen Erin Brockovich it starts out as, i was watching a documentary of Julia Roberts and it had shown clips of Erin Brockovich and it appealed to me my mum called me up and i said 'I think i will rent Erin Brockovich' and said to me 'I don't think it will be your scene' i rented it out anyway and i watched it and WOW!

I watch Erin Brockovich in 2005, 5 years after it was made and i was surprised i hadn't seen it.<br/><br/>I think if you want to consider watching this film, which i think you should read this and see what you think, but in my opinion you may or may not get hooked on it.

","I don't know how accurate this film is to the real lawsuit, but it was played out very well, that you could understand the reason behind the lawsuit with the need of any prior knowledge. Julia Roberts did a fantastic job in portraying Erin Brockovich, which was quite different from her usual comedy romance style of acting. However, I felt there were two much emphasis on her sexual attractiveness and being a single mother with 3 kids and without a job, she seemed to have quite an unrealistic amount of wardrobe. Julia Roberts, although having a talent in talking the neighbors into signing for the lawsuit, she seemed ungrateful and rude to other people like George (Aaron Eckhart), who selflessly took care of her kids day and night. I don't know if Erin's ungratefulness was based on true story, but it seemed unnecessary and out of place. Also Erin Brockovich is dyslexic in real life which allowed her to remember phone numbers by memory, but in the movie it wasn't quite rooted except the occasional ""slow-reader"" reference, which adds to the confusion. Albert Finney (Ed Masry) did a great job as well all throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I find this movie very well-done and the acting stellar. And if you were looking for another Julia Roberts comedy romance, you're in for a surprise!"
"Screen_Blitz","7","2","2","10 August 2016"," Julia Roberts steals the spotlight and earns it
","The story of Erin Brockovich is significantly intriguing as much as it is thought-provoking, even if it doesn't make a landmark in America's history. Director Steven Soderbergh gives a lively treatment to the inspirational story with a confident direction and an intelligent screenplay, even when the film begins to feel like a two-hour episode of a television series. Soderbergh's brilliant taste of filmmaking comes to life in a 1993 story of a Californian woman taking on one of the biggest class action lawsuits to ever take place in America, and the result is a true cinematic work of art with just small pinch of shortcoming in the mix. The movie pits Julia Roberts in the role of Erin Brockovich, an unlikable and unemployed single mother of three kids who is involved in a car collision while passing through an intersection. She receives aid from lawyer Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney) to assist her in court, but her profane and disrespectful behavior result in her losing the case. Still stuck on the unemployment lines, Erin successfully convinces Masry to hire her as a file clerk at the law firm. There, she comes across a case involving contamination on the water supply of Hinkley, California done by the Pacific Gas & Electricity Company. With a growing number of Hinkley residents getting ill from the contaminated water, Erin enlists the help of the reluctant Masry to assist her in a case against the multi-billion dollar company. <br/><br/>This biographical drama doesn't rise into the rank of the most memorable biopics Hollywood has to offer, nor is it particularly groundbreaking at the least. But what matters most is that it's smart, it's clever, and it features Julia Roberts in a role that definitely defines her career compared to some of the romantic comedies she's endured in the past. Though the rude and surly attitude render of her character make her hard to care for at first, she eventually overcomes her cruel demeanor when she sets out to make a difference for those who are in need of help. Roberts embraces the role with sheer competency and grace (and profanity), it is significantly difficult to point out another role by her that impresses me more. Albert Finney also brings some acting gold in the mix, and his chemistry with co-star Julia Roberts comes on-screen and works quite effectively. Then there is Aaron Eckhart who has plays a motorcycle junkie who moves in next door and after his help with the children, eventually comes her boyfriend but faces a strain in their relationship when her constant work on the case dissolves her time at home. For the charismatic actor he is, he does pretty decent in his role, and does nothing to disappoint the slightest. The cast make admirable appearances on screen in this true story-based film written by Steven Soderbergh that captures true emotion without the temptation of manipulating it with overly sentimental tone, and makes an honest sense of the events that took place leading the title character into a major court case Erin had a very high chance of losing in trial. It was an important case where justice that meant not money, but the lives of the people affected by the wrongdoing of a filthy rich utility company. With people getting ill and some dying, Erin knew something had to be done. <br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is an endearing biographical drama that leaves a landmark on both Julia Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh's career. It is a fascinating movie with a just a few flaws that are overshadowed with greatness and therefore difficult to point out. When taking about Julia Roberts, this film is the role she is likely remembered for."

","Julia Roberts deserves her accolades for the performance in this.  Has she been better?  Probably.  But not as DRAMATIC.  And that's what counts for awards.  As a rule.  This bit of work holds its own with brother Eric in ""Star 80.""  Albert Finney has been better (best guilty pleasure performance? ""Wolfen."").  And I must give credit to Aaron Eckhart (unrecognizable from ""In the Company of Men"") as the house-biker who takes care of Erin's kids while she saves Hinkley, CA (standing in for The World).

"paul-nemecek","10","3","4","1 July 2018"," Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich
","Erin Brockovich is a modern-day David vs. Goliath story with a few notable exceptions. The villainous behemoth in this version is a faceless corporate conglomerate. The hero is a sassy, brassy, less-than-classy female with a prominently featured chassis. In the basic elements of the story line, this is a story we have heard before. The crusader vs. the corporation is a dominant theme in The China Syndrome, A Civil Action, and this year's Oscar nominee The Insider. The version where the ""good guy"" is a female working-class hero is the basic theme of Norma Rae and Silkwood. Like these latter films, Erin Brockovich is based on a real character and a real-life incident.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a twice-divorced mother with kids who finagles her way into a job working for the lawyer who lost her case in a civil trial. Erin is feisty, determined, independent, and mouthy. These very traits that get her into trouble with co-workers, friends, and family members are the traits that prove to be her greatest assets as a secretary turned paralegal. What makes the character sympathetic is her caring. She does not always show it well, but beneath the tough exterior is a woman with a heart of gold who cares deeply about her kids and is passionately committed to the families affected by corporate neglect.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is well-suited for the ""brassy broad with a heart-of-gold"" role. Consider her past performances in Pretty Woman (hooker with a heart of gold), Notting Hill (superstar with a heart of gold), and My Best Friend's Wedding (scheming, conniving, two-faced backstabber with a heart of gold). How could she miss?<br/><br/>What distinguishes this film from films like Norma Rae or Silkwood however, is the witty script by screenwriter Susannah Grant. Grant was the screenwriter for Pocahantas, Ever After, and 28 Days. What these films have in common is strong-willed independent female characters. Here the synthesis of Brockovich's character, Grant's writing, and Julia Roberts' persona all work together like a charm. The best way to turn an old formula into a good film is through distinctive characters. The characters and their relationships are the real heart of this film.<br/><br/>As a result, the film is much lighter in tone than Norma Rae or Silkwood. There are moments of high drama, but the film really shines in its humor and wit. Albert Finney is delightful as Ed Masry, Erin's boss. Julia Roberts turns in what may prove to be the best performance of her career as a working-class mom who refuses to stay down for the count. Director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, The Limey) handles the material well and the pacing of the film is nearly perfect.<br/><br/>Corporate neglect will become an increasingly important topic as evidenced by events in Seattle last year. By some estimates, there may be as many as 100,000 deaths per year (four times the homicide rate) as a result of ""corporate crime."" Erin Brockovich manages to raise the issue in a context that is neither preachy nor smug. But in the end this is not an issue film, but a character study, and what a character she is! Both thumbs up for Erin Brockovich."
"cherryvanilla-45790","8","3","4","1 June 2016"," Badass Brockovich
","Erin Brockovich, played by Actress Julia Roberts, is an unemployed single mother of three who finds herself with her hands even fuller when she gets T-boned at an intersection on her way home from yet another unsuccessful job interview in North Hollywood. Although her lawyer, Ed Masry, is confident that she will win the case against the careless driver, their optimism turns to disappointment when the jury decides that this foul-mouthed divorcÃ©e was just trying to make a quick buck. This seemingly inconvenient event will ultimately propel her into the launch of her career, despite never having any formal education, or a job for that matter. <br/><br/>Despite Erin's abrasive wit and eclectic wardrobe, she eventually lands a job with her former lawyer who introduces her to the world of fax machines and file cabinets. All the while, after having a run of bad luck with a couple of babysitters, her three young children are now being taken care of by George; the hunky bearded biker from next door. These relationships continue to unfold throughout the film. Erin's intuition and curiosity leads her to begin unravelling what was at first a dispute between a small family in Hinkley and the monstrous monopoly that is PG&E. After much investigation, Erin attempts to expose what could be one of the largest crimes of health and environmental negligence committed by a company to date. In the midst of chaos, she tries to find a balance between being a mother, a lover, and an appropriate employee all while attempting to find justice in a sea of corrupt companies and tedious judicial systems. Her astounding work ethic and ability to think on her feet is ultimately her only ammo in the unthinkable battle that precedes her. <br/><br/>Set in Southern California, the Rom Com Drama based on a true story alternates between glitzy Los Angeles and the dull, barren desert of Hinkley. Julia Robert's ability to portray Erin as a beautiful, bad ass, and yet somehow still relatable character is the driving force of the film. Her and Ed, who is played by Albert Finney, create an unlikely yet incredible duo who will have you cheering from the sidelines. Erin's selflessness, sass, and zeal creates a character that anyone would root for, and the exposure of PG&E's negligence creates a very qualified antagonist. Her love interest, George adds another element to the plot, showing Erin's sweet and feminine side. The ups and downs of Erin's personal life parallel those of the Hinkley case, creating an even more enticing story line. <br/><br/>Overall, Erin and the people of Hinkley's battle against the giant corporation PG&E, resembles the classic David and Goliath plot line. This real life story of one company's carelessness that lead to the suffering of an entire town, is one that will make you laugh, cry, and even get a little angry. Erin plays the hero that we all strive to be, and so much more. The great acting, character development, and riveting plot line followed by a great overall theme and message is why I chose to give the film a high rating. However, this isn't necessarily a movie I could watch over and over again, as it doesn't leave much speculation or mystery. Nonetheless, it is a great movie that is most definitely worth watching."

","I'll admit, even I'm jealous of her. She's blunt, unapologetic, strong willed, independent, hardworking, and maybe a little hotheaded and manipulative. But still, this is one film all the hardcore feminists will want to see. The movie Erin Brockovich chronicles the life of, you've guessed it, Erin Brokovich, played by the amazing and talented Julia Roberts. This drama is based on the true story of Brokovich who, with no legal background of her own, helped win the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a hardworking single mother of three young kids living in Southern California. In the opening scene, one sees Brokavich across from what appears to be a doctor. Brokavich explains she has kids and because of them she's learned a lot about medical procedures. Much to no one's surprise, she doesn't land the job. Immediately after she leaves the job interview she gets hit in her car at an intersection. Cue suspense. Well, this movie isn't a suspense film, but with an opening couple of scenes like these, one would hope for some plot twists. However, what really happens is that she ends up losing the personal injury lawsuit that resulted from the crash, which she claims wasn't her fault, and in thousands of dollars of debt, she is desperate for a job. <br/><br/>Brockovich ultimately asks her gray-haired lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), if he can offer her a job. He reluctantly gives her work as a file clerk in his office, despite her inappropriate cursing and outfits. During work one day Brockovich runs across some files for a case that was previously filed against the company Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E). Brockovich, determined, starts investigating into the cases and visits people in Hinkley, California, to hear the first hand accounts of chrom 6 poisoning. <br/><br/>She manipulatively persuades Masry to let her continue to do further research, but in doing so sacrifices spending time with her kids who end up being taken care of by her pseudo boyfriend and once unlucky neighbor George, (Aaron Eckhart). She discovers, however, that the PG&E Company has been purposely poisoning Hinkley's water supply, and covering up the fact that they were illegally doing so. This has what has been threatening the health of the entire community surrounding the plant where hexavalent chromium was found running off from the sites. For those of you people who don't know much about science (don't worry, I'm one of them) hexavalent chromium or (chrom 6) is very harmful to human and animal life. It causes chronic headaches, nosebleeds, bone deterioration, and cancers, all of which were reported by multiple residents of Hinkley. One scene that was heartbreaking was a slow zooming in of a girl around the age of 7 who appears to have cancer due to chrom 6 poisoning. Remembering that this story is based on true events, I can't help to think that this actually happened to someone, let alone a young child. It brought tears to my eyes. <br/><br/>Do Brockovich and Masry end up winning the case? Well you'll have to watch all of the 131 minutes in order to find out. That's one downside to the movie- the length. Some scenes tend to draw out, but this movie is about a legal case, and those aren't really an edge-of-your-seat kind of thriller. However, the music complemented the pace of the movie and added suspension to some of the scenes. This movie is also rated R because of the foul language, so parents, don't let your kids watch this movie. But if you're a cool Mom, have your daughters watch this movie when they are teenagers and tell them that even they too can become something awesome like Brockovich. But don't teach them that using their cleavage, like she does in the movie, to persuade men is appropriate. <br/><br/>Another reason this movie didn't get a full 10 stars is because there just wasn't enough romance. Maybe the writers (Richard LaGravenese and Susannah Grant) and the director (Steven Soderbergh) wanted to focus more on the full legal story than on Brockovich's romance with George. But as a sucker for good romance films, I wish there was more steamy scenes, if you know what I mean. The directors tried adding some more chemistry scenes between Brockovich and George but it still wasn't enough, at least for me. I wouldn't label this movie as a comedy either; the scenes are too intense to bring one even remotely close to a laugh. The movie in its entirety, however, was very well written and flowed nicely between scenes, adding to the fluidity of the film. <br/><br/>Erin Brockovich herself makes an appearance in the movie as the waiter Julia in one of the first opening scenes. It is reported that the real Erin Brockovich sold the rights to her story to Universal Studios for a sum of $100,000. That's a lot of money, but given all that she sacrificed, she deserves it. Whether or not some of the details of her life, like the fact that she was Miss Wichita or actually used her cleavage to get what she wanted, is true or not, Julia Roberts does an outstanding job playing this role, which she even won an Oscar for. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a film you'll want to see. If you like strong female roles, you'll love Erin Brockovich. Ed Masry says during a scene when Erin Brockovich is the last one at work along with himself, ""You're a girl. Why aren't you out to lunch with the other girls?"" She responds, ""I guess I'm not the right kind."" This statement pretty much sums up the kind of person Miss Brockovich is, in real life and as portrayed by Julia Roberts. This movie will give you the confidence boost you might need, cause I know it did that for me."

","""Erin Brockovich"" will likely be remembered as director Steven Soderbergh's other film from the year 2000 (""Traffic"") and of course for Julia Roberts' Oscar-winning performance. The film is not on par with ""Traffic"", but is still a great picture that may have been the second best film from the year. The titled character is an unconventional legal assistant whose greatest attributes are common sense and the ability to interact with anyone and everyone, no matter the situation. After mercifully receiving a job from small-time attorney Albert Finney (Oscar-nominated), Brockovich learns that the powerful Pacific Gas & Electric Company is dumping hexavalent chromium in an isolated area. This is causing many residents to become sick with strange types of cancers and other illnesses. What follows is one of the largest lawsuits in United States legal history. ""Erin Brockovich"" works because of dynamite performances by Roberts and Finney. This is easily the best work of Roberts' career and might be Finney's best performance as well. The screenplay is not as strong as it should be, but Soderbergh's direction more than makes up for the script. Overall an overwhelming success. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"derderder","1","19","44","15 February 2002"," Trash
","This film is simply trash, much like the woman it is about.  ERIN BROCKOVICH is a horrible movie.  Whoever thought that a woman with a bad taste in clothing, a vulgar mouth that spews obsceneties every time it opens, and continuous self-absorption could be the basis for a quality movie?  This movie tries to illustrate Erin Brockovich as a kind person with a good heart and will stop at nothing to help people and to make things right.  What a load of SH**!  Steven Soderbergh tries to fool us into believing that Brockovich is a good-natured woman trying to help the disease-striken residents within the area of PG&E.  Any wise viewer would look past this and see the truth, which is that Erin Brockovich is nothing but a bitch with a dirty mouth, a fraud, a dumbass, and not to mention a bad mother, which is well displayed when she leaves her children with a man she doesn't even know (George, who she treats like crap, even when they're together).  Another thing I couldn't stand about Erin was her selfishness and ungreatful, rude attitude that she displayed for her boss.  It seemed that every half hour she was asking for a raise, didn't seem to care when Masery was facing financial problems as a result of the lawsuit, and showed no respect for him at any point in the movie.  I guess she thought that she was the only one working her ass off in this whole thing.<br/><br/>And another thing that really annoyed me was that this movie was praised by so many people!  The movie had no good taste much like the title character. How this movie was praised by the Oscars is the worst of all things about this movie.<br/><br/>1.)Best Picture.  PLEASE!  This movie was probably one of the worst of the year!  It had no place to be in the running as the best of the year.  Its spot could've easily been taken by Almost Famous.<br/><br/>2.)Best Screenplay.  Susannah Grant may have had a remote deserving for an Oscar nomination if her screenplay was true to the facts, which would've illustrated that Erin Brockowitch truly is a money-hungary fraud who dresses like a wench.<br/><br/>3.)Best Director.  Soderbergh is a great director.  But it was nothing out of the ordinary here.  He did deserve a nomination for TRAFFIC,which he won. But the Academy shouldn't have squandered yet another nomination on something that was not worth it. 4.- Best Supporting Actor.  This was the only deserving nomination for this movie.  Albert Finney brings us the only likeable main character in this movie, and serves as the only bright spot in the film, except for maybe Marg Helgenburger.  He made the movie somewhat watchable with his strong, compelling performance. 5.- And now, last and certainly the least, BEST FU**ING ACTRESS!  Julia Roberts did a bad/OK job here.  Her performance might have been credible if she didn't accept all of these accolades.  All she did in the movie was flash her boobs, most of which were just a push-up bra, lash out at just about everyone in the movie for no good reason, and put in a sob, sympathetic facial expression, or a few tears in just to soften people up (didn't work on me Julia!).  The fact that she thought so much of her performance as to actually accept a nomination and then the award itself just shows how greedy she is.  Her nomination was a complete waste, and she couldn't hold a candle to any of those in the running.  Her nomination should've easily gone to one more deserving, such as Bjork for DANCER IN THE DARK.  The academy truly proved that it was out to boost egos and careers instead of rewarding for individual achievement.  The fact that every major awards organization (the oscars, golden globes, sag awards) and several critics associations gave their best actress honor to Roberts for her effortless performance instead of the true best actress of 2000, Ellen Burstyn, shows just how scandalous Hollywood is.  Roberts won the awards because she's the most bankable star in the business.  If these organizations did what they claimed, they would've awarded Ellen Burstyn for her heartbreaking performance in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.  Burstyn reaches out to audiences and rips their hearts out of their chests with her performance, which is unarguably the best in years, if ever, from an actress.  Not to mention the fact that Burstyn went through hell for her part, and still few gave her the recognition she deserves because they felt Julia should've won everything because she's younger, prettier(well, not really), and more people like her movies (yeah, sure: remember, Burstyn was the lead in THE EXORCIST [one of the most influential, scariest, and most talked about movies of all time in which she gave one of her best performances], not to mention her great performances in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE [for which the academy awarded her], and SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR just to name a few.)<br/><br/>Overall, I give this an imdb rating of 1/10.  If I could give it a zero, I would."

","Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies.  Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.<br/><br/>And I don't mean that literally.<br/><br/>Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments.  But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.<br/><br/>There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way.  If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots.  But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore.  Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  It's entertaining.  But it's formulaic.  A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot.  The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm.  Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car.  This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.<br/><br/>They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man.  Hip hip hooray!<br/><br/>I didn't ruin the movie for you.  It's not a surprise.  This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on.  Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality.  Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre. <br/><br/>
With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.<br/><br/>Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe.  Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot.<br/><br/>And she won't take none of your lip, neither."

I wonder how true-to-life this movie even was, but I'm sure any semblance of truth was ""hollywoodized"" out of existence.<br/><br/>First of all, Erin's character has a vulgar, lewd mouth. She is so worried about spewing expletives at everyone, including her employer, I was surprised one of the women she works with did not punch her right in the mouth. Also, she says so many 4-letter words in front of her children -- what kind of mother raises her children with that kind of white-trash potty mouth? It was not impressive and did NOTHING to add to the story. The writers ought to be shot for making every other word she utters obscene and indecent.<br/><br/>Because of her bad attitude and her vile mouth, is it any WONDER why nobody takes her seriously?? She thinks she ought to be praised for being arrogant, rude, brash, selfish and self-righteous? Give me a break. No employer is going to put up with that. Further, how is dressing like a scumbag whore going to earn her any respect from people? Where is the sense of reality here? How unrealistic can you get? It is wisdom to learn how to get along with people, but this movie seems to say that if you are vile, bitchy, rude, and obnoxious you will eventually come out on top. How phony and shallow is that?

","ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) ***1/2 Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger, Peter Coyote, Cherry Jones, Tracy Walter. <br/><br/>'Norma Rae' meets 'A Civil Action' by way of 'Pretty Woman' easily could have been the pitch for this based on a true story account of a feisty former Miss Wichita runner up/twice divorced mother of three (Roberts is superb as the eponymous character in arguably her finest acting to date) who struggles to make ends meet in a rural California town and after vehemently lobbying for a job as a legal clerk (with no prior experience) she unwittingly discovers a paper trail of immense proportions involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and its murky dealings with water contamination. The linear storytelling is excellent thanks largely to a smart straight ahead screenplay by Susannah Grant, a great ensemble cast including the gruff yet lovable Finney who gives a memorable performance as small-time lawyer Edward Masry whose paternal love for his plucky /sexy/tacky do-gooder is only exemplified as the case progresses to (seemingly) impossible odds in a modern day David Vs. Goliath lawsuit involving hundreds of infected people against a malevolent corporation. Roberts animates her good-hearted, tried upon heroine with finesse and much needed humor as well as her abrasive, suffer-no-fools gladly demeanor. Look sharp for the real-life Brockovich as a diner waitress with the name plate JULIA (!) Directed with on the mark helmsmanship by Steven Soderbergh."

I mean, wouldn't it be a great world where we could all walk around and openly insult those we work for, yet demand that they pay us?  And why?

Anway, basically Erin Brockovich (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Julia Roberts, earning her $20m salary) has a car accident, and after failing to sue a doctor, she bullies her lawyer, Ed Masry (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Albert Finney), to give her a job in compensation. No-one takes her seriously for a while, mainly because of her trashy clothes and language use, but that changes when she investigates a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. She discovers they are quietly trying to buy land contaminated by Hexavalent Chromium, a deadly toxic waste that is illegally being dumped and going into the town's water mains. This is a true story about one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history against a multi-million dollar corporation, pretty much taken down by one woman. Eventually they are found guilty for their crime, and have to pay over $300m for damages, almost $5m of that going to all families who have been affected by this cover-up. Also starring The Core's Aaron Eckhart as George, CSI's Marg Helgenberger as Donna Jensen, Cherry Jones as Pamela Duncan, Peter Coyote as Kurt Potter and the real Erin Brockovich-Ellis as Julia, the Waitress. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture (with the help of Danny DeVito) and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Julia Roberts was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Erin Brockovich was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 73 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 24 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die.

If there's a more overrated actress out there than Ms. Roberts, I'd love to see them. Her winning an award has led me to conclude the academy awards are nothing more than a popularity contest.

Albert Finney plays her lawyer who loses an opening case regarding her car accident. One day she practically hires herself on a case regarding a firm's lack of warning regarding toxic water. The firm is trying to force people out of their homes with little money to cover expenses. Her relationship with her biker neighbour is an unnecessary romantic subplot. Director Steven Soderbergh doesn't include a single interesting shot unlike his much more interesting Out of Sight. It is as if he just sat the camera down and let it run. There is too much showcasing of Julia Roberts in whorish clothes, and her verbal bouts are done more for show than character. Albert Finney as her lawyer is a prop. Aaron Eckhart as her neighbour is unnecessary. Marg Helgenberger is featured as one of the interviewees. Peter Coyote is also featured to remind us that once upon a time he was in a great film called E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial. The role is fairly standard where she tells us what we already know and awaits Roberts to make everything better.

Through an accident, in which her car was hit by one that ran a red light, she goes after justice.  Her own legal problems get her involved with a law firm run by Albert Finney, a great foil for this aggressive and independent lady.  In his office, she stumbles upon evidence of a massive injustice committed by a utility company, and works alone to uncover the enormity of the crime.  She discovers that in the town near the company's plant, people have grown sick  in some cases fatally  through the utility's criminal disposal of a carcinogen, contaminating their water.  She learns the legal processes by which the sufferers can be compensated.  By sheer willpower and persistence, she collects the affidavits needed to launch a class-action lawsuit.  A `David and Goliath' parallel is pointed out in the dialog.  As she learns, we learn.  If this sounds academic, it emphatically is not.  Erin, as splendidly played by Julia Roberts, is a dynamic personality, and the film is a detective story with suspense, excitement and humor.  In fact, after tossing off a wisecrack about having used `sexual favors' (she didn't) to amass the hundreds of signatures needed, Julia delivers one of the funniest lines in the last five years of movies.  Erin herself  now Erin Brockovich-Ellis, a popular name  appears briefly in the movie as a waitress.  She also speaks as herself in one of the worthwhile DVD extras.

","The time has come for Steven Soderbergh to sell out. I'll always think of The Limey as his last film before selling his soul to Hollywood. It's hard to believe that the director of sex, lies, and videotape made this. Soderbergh used to be one of the godfathers of independent filmmaking (before there was Tarantino, there was Soderbergh). The name Soderbergh meant quality cinema. I thought Out Of Sight was a little too mainstream, but I saw what he was doing: trying to take an action film, and give it the kind of gritty feel that The French Connection or Serpico used to have. Most directors don't make them like that anymore (pardon the cliche). Following that, he perfected the gritty action drama with The Limey. These movies prove that he is above directing a knockoff of A Civil Action built around Julia Roberts. What's next? Jim Jarmusch directing the third Mission: Impossible?

She seems like a genuinely nice woman who is growing up to be a competent actress. And *Erin Brockovich* supplies her with just the kind of role that the world like's to see her in  beleaguered but with spunk (an often repellant combination). She plays the real-life whistle-blower of the title (the real Erin has a role as a waitress in the movie), and proves she's a real actress by following the time-honored path beaten by Hollywood actresses since time immemorial  playing white trash. But, of course, she's white trash with a heart of gold, who cares only about taking care of her three children, and finding justice in the world. With her bra showing most of the time, and her New Jersey-deluxe hair, she actually does a credible job of it, and that's where it's possible to develop compassion for her character. And thank God for that  for without her, there's little else memorable about this movie that makes it any different than the kind of movies made for the Lifetime channel.

I'm also guessing they'll like it because of what Julia Roberts wears throughout the film - tight-fitted clothing.<br/><br/>Roberts does try hard to give her best performance - and pulls it off well. She may seem a bit desperate - using the F-word about twenty-something times - but she catches the audience's attention and breaks away from just playing Julia Roberts. I think this is the only role I've seen Roberts in - other than ""Conspiracy Theory"" - where she plays someone other than herself. It's interesting, really.<br/><br/>Albert Finney is great as Ed. I love the end of the film, because the smirk on his face is just so...Albert Finney! Throughout the film he keeps his strong screen persona while entertaining the audience. He is a calm, choice-actor. He doesn't go for the easy way out. He stretches for different roles. I rarely see an actor do this, and the only other leading actor who I can think of that regularly takes co-star roles is Gene Hackman - he takes roles that he likes for the challenge. He doesn't take the easy way out.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh rose to fame with this film, and it's no wonder why. The orange tint of the film provides a gritty and realistic feel - not your average girl-power film. One thing I like about Soderbergh's film is that most of the time you can expect something: The orange tint and a heck of a good movie.<br/><br/>While ""Erin Brokovich"" is in no way a GREAT movie, it is good, and quite possibly Julia Roberts' best performance to date.<br/><br/>4/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"
"filipemanuelneto","6","2","3","21 November 2016"," One of the best films of Julia Roberts
","This film is very slightly based on a real case of environmental pollution, where a small community processed a factory because of the pollution and the diseases that it caused. Erin Brockovich (whom Julia Roberts brought to life) is a single, unemployed mother who comes across this process by chance, while working (almost by favor) in a law firm. Julia Roberts has had, in this film, one of the most remarkable works of her career to date, along with ""Notting Hill"". She is a talented actress, who filled with spirit and personality a character who needed a point of irreverence and temper. At her side was Albert Finney in the role of Ed Masry, the law firm's chief partner, who accepts (reluctantly and suspiciously) Erin's help in resolving what promises to be the most important legal case of his career. The film does not hesitate to portray the polluting firm in the worst possible way, in a not inconsiderate and certainly premeditated criticism of the large US corporations, that rarely put environmental and health concerns at the top of their priorities. In this sense, the film, which never abandons the comic and entertainment side, takes a strongly interventionist stance, seeking to alert consciences and draw the attention to the situation portrayed, and some analogous situations that still continue to persist. The film also gives some importance to the so-called ""anonymous heroes"", which Erin symbolizes in a way, and that often make the difference when all other people choose to ignore the problem or let the authorities figure it all out. The cinematography emphasizes the warm and vibrant tones, which reinforces the sensation of heat passed by the filming locations and the garish prints of Erin's clothes, clothes that help the character to clearly assumes her popular and very humble condition.<br/><br/>This movie is far from a thriller or a police movie. It's an entertainment film that has been made for the families, but with a huge desire to alert consciences to environmental and health concerns, which it always approaches in a light but determined way."

It helps that the director is the supremely talented Steven Soderberg. Erin Brockovich was a unique legal thriller in that, during an era when overplotted and contrived stories like those of John Grisham defined the genre, it wasn't littered with throw-away plot devices designed exclusively to generate tension. With only a minor exception, Erin is not followed by shadowy figures. She does not become the target of violence and terroristic threats. With a performance that shows off both her comic and dramatic aptitude, Roberts brings the title character to life with a zest and intensity that may surprise viewers who have pigeonholed her into the romantic comedy mold.

But somewhere in the middle, there is ""Brockovich,"" a movie from the start of the millennium starring a talented cast including Aaron Eckhart, Albert Finney, and, who can forget in her Oscar-winning role, Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>This is such a solid character-driven movie, and almost every scene is fun to watch thanks to Julia Roberts. Act one is really interesting because you would not think to connect a traffic collision to the idea of a character getting a job, but that is exactly what happens. The titular character, Erin, is shown in a job interview at the start of the movie, and she has the right personality for the interview but lacks the experience. We feel for her as we learn she has three kids, she has been divorced twice, and she is basically broke. Once she gets in a traffic collision, she has trouble contacting the lawyer assigned to her case, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), so she figures if the people at the law firm cannot do their job, she will show up and do it for them. And we see that bold persistence in Erin throughout the duration of the film.<br/><br/>Erin is the type of human we should all aspire to be because her persistence and loyalty allows her to have a better work ethic even than her superiors. She does investigating on her own when she is given permission (barely) by Ed Masry, but this involves her doing her work away from the firm for a period of time, and she gets fired since everybody assumes she just left the job to ""have fun."" After all, most of the women working at that law firm have expressed their disliking of her due to the way that Erin dresses. But that is the thing about Erin - she could care less that she dresses in a revealing manner. It even helps her get information on the case she is working on. Masry asks Erin how she was able to obtain so much information that would help their case. Her response? ""They're called boobs, Ed.""<br/><br/>In terms of filmmaking, ""Erin Brockovich"" is nothing that is going to be remembered for its visuals or editing. It plays out like a typical movie - there are no iconic shots, there is no spectacular editing style, and the strongest aspects of the film are clearly its story and the performance by Julia Roberts. It is such a joy to watch Roberts in this performance and it definitely makes the movie feel more like a comedy than a serious drama. Audiences can probably look at it either way though since it is, above all, an inspiring flick.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts has never been better and she completely sells the movie.<br/><br/>9/10"
"eric262003","8","1","1","3 July 2019"," The Ultimate Julia Roberts Movie
","""Erin Brockovich"" is truly the film that truly made Julia roberts a star being that she transitioned herself from a star in romantic comedies, here she makes the move to starring in a movie that won her over with the fans and with the Academy Awards in 2001.<br/><br/>Starring in titular biopic of a paralegal confronting corrupt businesses and exposing their fraudulent ways without a care for her reputation in the process. The sides of Brockovich are handled in three integral parts. Her crass ways are never vulgar, just high-spirited. She may dress with questionable taste, but she has a heart of gold. If she berates and verbally mocks other people it's not that she's inconsiderate or mean, but because a lot of the corporations she's taking on hire some of the most underhanded and corrupt people on this planet. And for a bonus, she may act like she's naive, but we realize that she even hoodwinks the viewers revealing she's anything but.<br/><br/>""Erin Brockovich"" epitomizes every character that Roberts has starred in since she made her debut in the mid 1980's. The character of Brockovich herself is the atypical figure that the film industry idolizes. Roberts was rightfully cast as she can talk tough and smart and still be attractive at the same time.<br/><br/>The movie centres around this young paralegal who is a divorced, single mother of three children who's journey itself deserves to be written on paper. Though her job is not all that exciting or heavily paid, but was stunned when she found out that a major corporation like Pacific Gas and Electric were offering to underhandedly pay medical bills in the California town where their offices run. She goes undercover to further investigate with all the essential documents needed for a class action lawsuit and exploiting this corporation that are responsible for contaminating the water which has contributed to many civilians who have contacted several health problems.<br/><br/>In her grinding research, she has met a hairless little girl who had to have chemotherapy, a lady battling breast cancer and her husband who's dying of lymphoma. In one of the more pivotal cases she tells a woman named Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) that what's ailing her is not from bad luck, but bad water which led to her getting her kids out of the water.<br/><br/>Under the direction of Steven Soderbergh and based on actual events, this movie stands out as a true underdog story of how a small time paralegal goes through great lengths to take down a big corporation that has investments raging in $28 billion. Albert Finney plays lawyer Ed Masry who will have to go though great lengths to exploit this company for who they really are. Nobody ever said this case was going to be easy. Granted that Roberts usually handles performances on her own merits, but here it's Soderbergh that calls the shots plus he has to in order for this film to work and being this is not a fictionalized character she's portraying.<br/><br/>If Roberts took control of the character, this movie would end up falling victim to satire. Though she carries the heavy cargo throughout the movie, her emotions have to be spot-on and the camera's attention is based off of her. The other cast members have to remain frozen until Roberts has the final camera-shot of her. Whether she's happy, angry or in crocodile tears, we the audience are cued how to react. Roberts has a reputation of being quite self-indulgent and though Soderbergh gives her that freedom to some extent, to the point where it really becomes Julia's world and everyone else is just secondary.<br/><br/>Soderbergh does assure that the supporting characters are not underused here. Finney's character Masry is strong here though his reactions are mostly to stay disgruntled by his head-strong clerk, but underneath that hidden exterior is a man with a heart of gold who's contemplating retirement, but her presence does give him some strength. Veanne Cox is outstanding in some low-key comic relief as an uppity lawyer who's big fault was to usurp the determined Brockovich.<br/><br/>The only weak scenes is when Erin's personal life is added to the story. And though Aaron Eckhart was very good as the George, the kindly biker who looks after Erin's kids all day. Sure it adds character development to some extent, but other times it can be a bit of overkill. The personal scenes were at the most quite mundane. Fortunately the lawsuit is still the primary focus and this is what people came in to see even going far as to say they would rather watch the lawsuit scenes than Roberts gracing us with her emotions."

","While there have been similar stories told before (""All the President's Men"" comes to mind) and since (""Spotlight"" comes to mind), this film really hits hard with the idea that it takes a personal connection to make a difference. It's also inspiring to see what a bold and confident woman can accomplish if she doesn't take ""no"" for an answer."
"punchp","9","1","1","14 January 2019"," It's a fun movie with a heart, and definitely worth the big screen treatment.
","Steven Soderbergh, after over a decade of experimenting in various forms of independent film (sex, lies and videotape; The Underneath; Schizopolis; The Limey), has begun to dabble in the mainstream; his current marriage, to a major studio film with an A-list star, could have been enough to send him scurrying back to the art house.<br/><br/>The result here is not stillborn but a frisky, friendly child full of surprises. Erin Brockovich, Soderbergh's comedy-drama starring Julia Roberts, is in outline a lot like several other films, particularly A Civil Action, as well as the sort of true-life empowerment story you see on Lifetime every six months or so. But this film moves with a light step, and it takes time not just to establish characters but to appreciate them. You're in the hands of a director who genuinely likes people. In tone, the movie is actually closer to gentle mid-period Jonathan Demme films (like Melvin and Howard or Citizens Band) than to a routine legal drama.<br/><br/>If Erin Brockovich didn't actually exist (she does, and has a cameo in the movie as a waitress named Julia), some screenwriter would've had to invent her for Julia Roberts. As written by Susannah Grant (Ever After and 28 Days), Erin is brassy, determined, full of love for her three kids and wary of everyone else; the character is perfectly suited to Roberts' strengths, and she plays Erin as a frazzled, ordinary woman with a knack for cutting to the point. No cutie-pie, Erin is a sharp, angular person -- an irresistible force that doesn't believe in immovable objects.<br/><br/>After managing to find work at a California law firm, Erin starts to discover odd things in routine real-estate files: medical records that don't seem to belong there. She soon learns that a local plant, Pacific Gas & Electric, has been contaminating the water with chromium and has been trying to buy off the locals. With the initially grudging help of her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), Erin digs deeper and tries to rally the townspeople in a lawsuit against the corporation.<br/><br/>In a way, Erin Brockovich is the distaff companion to Wonder Boys -- a disorganized wreck finds meaning in an endeavor larger than him/herself. The filmmakers here, as in Wonder Boys, pay more attention to subtleties of character than to plot mechanics. The actors are given space to bloom. Aaron Eckhart, so reptilian in his other roles (In the Company of Men, etc.), turns in a relaxed, friendly performance as George, the scruffy biker who gets involved with Erin and looks after her kids because he genuinely likes them. Albert Finney, too, seems energized in his many scenes with Roberts. They make a great team, providing two laughs for the price of one: Erin says something outlandish, and then Ed stands there silently, unsure whether to scream or laugh, or both. Watching Albert Finney struggling to keep his composure is one of the quieter pleasures of the movie season.<br/><br/>Don't mistake Erin Brockovich for a classic or a masterpiece. Like Soderbergh's previous mainstream film Out of Sight, it's simply an example of Hollywood entertainment done with finesse and compassion, the way it always should be but so often isn't. Perhaps such a movie triumphs more because of what it doesn't do than because of what it does (Erin Brockovich, for instance, contains not a single tedious courtroom scene).<br/><br/>The movie isn't really even about the lawsuit or about going after a corporation. It's about a woman finding out what she was meant to do, and finding the community that needs her."

","I saw ERIN BROCKOVICH mere days before I saw Erin Brockovich and, while definitely worthwhile, the movie often focuses too much on the woman behind the case and not quite enough on the particulars of the case itself... much like what happened when she arrived here in wilmington, north carolina, to address 300 concerned citizens regarding Dupont's dumping of carcinogenic chemicals into the Cape Fear River (the source of drinking water for 250,000 north carolinians). Alongside a ""water expert"" who spouted indecipherable gobbledygook for the better part of an hour and a half, Brockovich said, in essence, that it's all up to US to get things Right (the Mayor of wilmington, who owns a construction company, didn't bother to show up at this Public Meeting- perhaps because he'd gotten wind of something that Brockovich revealed to us that night: that there's a pipeline like the infamous North Dakota Access Pipeline about to begin construction HERE, before long). Like we ain't got enough problems, already... Crack Town- wilmington- has been referred to as ""Ground Zero"" for the opioid epidemic in this company (the so-called ""united"" $tate$ of ameriKa), with a reported 13% of wilmingtonians hooked on opioids (my guesstimate is much higher- 40-50%-, based on personal interactions I've had with many of the locals over the past two decades). When I arrived here, the then-governor was in the process of accepting a bribe of half a million dollars from the local Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow them to dump Nuclear Waste into the Cape Fear River. (There was no follow-up investigation, as far as I know.) I've personally seen men openly armed with handguns in grocery stores, gyms, pawn shops and shopping mall parking lots hereabouts and the sight never fails to give me pause. The ""housing"" DE-Construction going on to accommodate the projected 65,000 newcomers to Crack Town over the next 10-15 years is causing even worse flooding than ever (my own used bookstore was flooded nearly 20 years ago). The bottom line: the denizens of Crack Town are up S--t Creek, without a paddle... News of some small comfort: Brockovich also told us that all of the water fountains in Washington have DON'T DRINK THE WATER! THE WATER IS POISON! signs on them. At least we're not alone..."

","The movie starts with a man's words on a black screen, the next frame shifts and focuses on Julia Roberts beautiful face heavy with baby blue eye shadow and big voluminous hair. You almost believe you're watching Pretty Woman, but you'd be mistaken! Julia Roberts is Erin Brockovich in the biographical movie directed by Steven Soderbergh, written by Susannah Grant. This movie tells the story of the people from Hinkley, California in the San Bernardino County and how Erin Brockovich unlocked the secret to Hinkley's many unfortunate health issues. The story of Erin Brockovich is by far an interesting one. It is a story about a strong, motivated, and driven woman who never took no for an answer. Erin Brockovich is a single mother of three who has been kicked down and hit with misfortune after misfortune. After leaving a disappointing and discouraging job interview, Erin gets hit by a rich asshole zooming through a red light. Seeking compensation from the reckless driver, she ends up in Ed Masry's office in search of lawyer. <br/><br/>My 8/10 rating stems from the great performances done by the actors, the amazing wardrobe and costume department, and the great directing. It is no secret that a good movie and a good director go hand in hand. Director Steven Soderbergh did a fantastic job at creating a film that depicted Erin Brockovichs' life and the Hinkley Water Crisis on screen in an easy going and realistic manner. The characters were likable unlike other ""underdogs"" that annoy the audience because we just know things would work out for them eventually. I was rooting for Erin and I was rooting for Hinkley."

","Julia Roberts is not my favorite actress. She has hung on to a star that was sort of thrust on her from a movie that is not all that great, ""Pretty Woman."" This, supposedly, established an edginess for her, though her character had literally no connection to a true prostitute. With all that said, I think she did fine in this film. I know that some have said that this has all been done before. So crusading for people victimized by humorless industrial entities has been done before. The strength, however, is in the specifics. Brokavich, a real person, found herself in the midst of a nasty situation. She makes a discovery that sets in motion a huge lawsuit where she is put to the test."

"slokes","7","1","1","24 September 2015"," Raising Her Game
","There are a lot of money lines in this smart drama about a woman directing a lawsuit against a big corporation that poisoned a community. One of my favorites is when the title character, played by Julia Roberts, complains she isn't taken seriously because she didn't go to law school.<br/><br/>""Law school!"" moans her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). ""At this point, I'd settle for charm school.""<br/><br/>Never mind Masry: ""Erin Brockovich,"" at least the movie, has charm coming out of its ears. From Erin's many abrasive wisecracks to her more sensitive dealings with the good people of Hinkley, California, this is a high-impact touchy-feely drama that works familiar territory in unusual ways, making for engaging entertainment.<br/><br/>Girl-power enthusiasts will enjoy how Roberts inhabits her role with surprising gusto and some jaw-dropping language, coming off a bit like George C. Scott did in ""Patton,"" albeit with a much different wardrobe.<br/><br/>The contributions of two women behind the scenes are equally worthy of note: Screenwriter Susannah Grant and editor Anne V. Coates. Grant capably juggles her two key themes, of corporate malfeasance and personal self-discovery by binding them with a common thread of motherhood. There are cute moments and heartbreaking moments; the strength of Grant's writing is they all feel like authentic moments on screen.<br/><br/>Coates, who edited ""Lawrence Of Arabia,"" keeps the story moving with sharp cuts that invest you in drama without bogging you down in details. Right after Erin first meets Masry, to tell him about her hit-and-run case, we cut to her telling her story in a courtroom (only one of two courtroom scenes in the whole film, both brief.) The whole film moves like that, not rat-a-tat, but alert to keeping scenes tight where they can be, without shortchanging the emotional arc.<br/><br/>As far as guys go, Finney is enjoyably easy-going, quite a departure from his Angry Young Man persona of the 1960s sporting a doughy Texas accent. He's consistently likable as Erin's constructive- minded foil. Aaron Eckhart is also effective playing a character far removed from his usual sinister-smoothy roles. And ""Erin Brockovich"" contains probably the most clever use of character actor Tracey Walter you'll ever see, a tribute to both his acting skill and Coates' cuts.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh may be the most consequential director of the 21st century so far, for the way his films manage to both engage and challenge audiences. Here, the emphasis is more on the former. Still, his use of hand-held cameras for small, intimate scenes, and his refusal to overplay the heavy drama represent significant departures from the usual Hollywood treatments.<br/><br/>""Brockovich"" doesn't make for much of a final statement. It shortchanges the emotional issues it raises, content instead to tout a historic cash settlement that can't help but land a bit flat. The real Brockovich, like Patton, may not live up to the great build-up she gets here. But for at least two hours, Roberts, Soderbergh, and company are too good for you to care about that."
"webbfamily-62063","Null","1","1","17 September 2015"," The unlikely heroine
","The movie Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is based on a real story and gives the audience a heroine version of David and Goliath. Never portrayed as a martyr, Erin, a twice-divorced mother of 3, continues to fight for a job so she can provide for her family. Even though Erin is constantly viewed as unqualified and undereducated, we see a woman who uses her street smarts, quick wit, and sarcasm to level the playing field and be the unlikely heroine. <br/><br/>Injured in a car accident, Erin hires attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who arrogantly reassures her that she would be victorious. But when the judge didn't agree, Erin went to Ed looking for a job. As Erin senses his hesitation, she asks him not to make her beg, and hesitantly Ed hires her as a file clerk. <br/><br/>As Erin eagerly learns the ropes, she tries to understand why medical documents are in with real estate sales. With permission from Ed, Erin goes out into the field. As she speaks to residents and finds conflicting documentation at the County water plant she seeks out a toxicologist at UCLA. It is then that she starts to uncover Pacific Gas and Electric's (PG&E) dark secrets. <br/><br/>Erin overcame judgmental attorneys daily, but it was watching her reaction to her boyfriend George (Aaron Eckhart) that had me rooting for her from the couch. As he blamed her job for his loneliness and taking her time away from her children, George proves he is just like the other men in her life. They all leave when they don't get what they want. Erin sees that the personality traits that have held her back for so long is what makes her the voice for the residents of Hinkley. <br/><br/>The cinematography gives the audience multiple points of view, but it is the subjective point of view that allows the audience to connect emotionally with the residents of Hinkley. As Erin talks to Annabelle Daniels, a 10-year-old girl who is fighting a brain tumor, the camera zooms in for a close-up that shows the suffering and fear that the Daniels family is going through. The use of natural lighting was another effect that added to the realistic setting throughout the movie. As Erin and George drive out to give Donna Jenson the news from the settlement we can see the colors and glow from the sunset as it not only warmed their faces but also the land around them. The sun gave a natural warmth as it radiated off the sand and sparse greenage. The audience gets to see both sides of Erin the compassion and empathy that she has for the families of Hinkley and the brutally honest unfiltered side she uses when she feels that she isn't being respected by co-workers and other attorneys. The natural lighting that was used created a visually soft side of Erin in direct contrast to the tone of the character; as if putting a spotlight on the unlikely heroine. <br/><br/>The character Erin Brockovich is similar to Vivian Ward (Pretty Women), also played by Roberts. Both women were judged by the outside world but used their street smarts, wit, and sarcasm to win over the hearts of the viewers and the other characters in the movie."

She's been divorced two times and has three kids. She is in desperate need of a job before she goes bankrupt. She walks into this attorney's office and basically begs for a job. Despite her style of dress and outspoken personality, she gets a job as a file clerk. While performing her job, she stumbles upon some paperwork that seem odd to her and so begins her quest for her investigating work to find out why people are getting sick and why the Gas and Electric Company are paying for their medical bills.

She goes on against the biggest company in California and almost brings down the company with the biggest lawsuit in the history of California. The little train that could.<br/><br/>The theme of the story is determination. Erin, an uneducated single mother of three. Who needed to go above and beyond in her job in order to retain it so she could pay her bills, was not going to let anyone intimidate her and call her stupid. The more people made fun of her or her work, the more determined she felt. She also had a sense of compassion for the ""little"" people who had been lied to. These people were dying early, kids were having chronic illness all the meanwhile they were being told that there was nothing wrong with the water they were drinking. She felt the need to help represent these people.<br/><br/>Julia Robert's role as Erin Brockivich was outstanding. I loved the part where they met with Hinkley's attorney's for PG&E and the main attorney was about to drink the water and Erin tells her that they had brought that specially for them from Hinsley's well and she puts it down and would not have a drink. This tell you that they knew that the chromium was poisonous to people but they were trying to sweep it under the rug. Overall, the movie has a great plot to it. Julia Roberts, witty, trashy, bite me attitude combined with a sense of responsibility to the people of Hinsley and her children make this a movie to remember and makes you want to go out there and make something of yourself and not just push some papers around but really make a difference. It doesn't matter if you have a degree or not."

""Solaris"", ""Contagion"" and ""Magic Mike"", for example, are normal while ""Lies, sex and videotapes"" is bad in my opinion. Finally, ""Erin Brockovich"" surprised me and I really enjoyed it. It is based on real events. It is biographic. The story is about a young mother who begins to work as a legal assistant. I did not know anything about the real character, but Julia Roberts portrays the best performance in her career, or at least, one of the best ones. Aaron Eckhart plays the part of his new boyfriend (very correct, as well). The other secondary actors did a more than decent job. Performances are clearly a strong point in this movie.

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","1","16 November 2010"," Julia Roberts as the Archangel Gabriel
","Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary.

I know, you're thinking ""Do we need another little-guy-takes-on-the-corperate-giant movie?"" No, of course not. But this film manages to make it interesting again. The human drama, which is of course the centerpiece for any such story, and seemed so forced in films such as A Civil Action, came across as achingly real. And the performances. Ah, Steven, no one call pull a performance out of an actor like you. Having never been a Julia Roberts fan, I was blown away by her in this film. She was... REAL. I was able to forget that it was the ""Pretty Woman"" on the screen. In fact, the whole film was real. The broke single mom lives in a dump of a trailer which is not nicer than my apartment, as I see so often in movies. The woman dying of cancer is emaciated and hard to look at, not Cameron Diaz with a shaved head.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough rambling.

","This was one of the most entertaining and most inspiring movies I've seen in a long long time.  Erin (Roberts) is totally believable as the single mother of three who is struggling to provide.  Just doing her job she discovers information about a big water and electric company that is causing deaths. And, because of her courage and determination - the kind that most mothers and most women have (at least the ones I know)- she is able to expose the truth and win.  Go see it and forget about the language & the clothes - she's like Kitty in Gunsmoke -- she may be tough but this lady has a kind of class that goes beyond language and clothes, she cares and is willing to go all out to save an entire town of people.

"gga","Null","1","1","28 March 2000"," Wow
","After watching Julia Roberts in ""Notting Hill"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", where the secondary characters were the only thing actually worth anything, I was not expecting much from yet another film starring this overpaid actress. Boy, I was wrong.  She deserves every penny of her salary.  With this movie, Roberts strikes gold and, unless several magic movies shows up along the year, she'll probably land her first Oscar nomination.  The same goes for Albert Finney (not his first, but another one). But, just as with ""Shakespeare in Love"", a chick flick that guys could enjoy, the script is the real star of this movie.  A perfectly crafted hollywood product, but with enough surprises, heart and great dialogue to reach out to today's hypercritical audiences. In the hands of the director Steven Soderbergh, who is showing more and more talent with each film he makes (Out of Sight, The Limey, etc), the film never looses its entertainment value. Does it mean that it's a perfect movie?  No.  Things that did not quite work all the time are Erin Brockovich's personal life and romantic relationship (some scenes are extremely touching, others don't ring true), and some of the lawyers that are comic stereotypes. But it is the focus that this movie places on personal conflicts and people themselves that rises this product way and above a similar themed movie like ""A Civil Action"". Erin Brockovich has all the strength of a Norma Rae of the 21st century."

"nunculus","Null","1","1","25 March 2000"," Soderbergh...the Cukor of the Aughts?
","You can't quite always be sure. Is Steven Soderbergh giving us the most radical upending of a female movie star since Godard's TOUT VA BIEN? Or is he just a poor lackey locked under the jail, forced to photograph scenes in which Big Star Julia tells off rich snooty lawyers in glamourous closeups? Whichever--I guess he's both--he's the guy who took what could have been a routine chick-flick script and made it into a nineties ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.<br/><br/>Soderbergh--fast becoming one of our finest directors--is all about the fringes. He's all about the perfect telling throwaway set decoration, the little improv'd moment a kid has that falls away at the end of a scene, the handheld moment that just goes soft a little bit. And it's the fringes that put this movie over, not the rah-rah script by Susannah Grant. (In one scene, Erin Brockovich demonstrates that she has the phone numbers of six hundred plaintiffs committed to memory. ""You want their diseases, too, Theresa?"" Grant sometimes thinks she's doing a rewrite on SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.) It's the Little People that Julia runs into--like Tracey Walter, as a guy who isn't what he seems. It's about the way the DP, the great Ed Lachman, makes everything feel so offhand, so yeah-whatever, and yet so very beautiful.<br/><br/>The producers--Danny DeVito and company--had a smart idea. It takes a Soderbergh to put a movie like this over the top--somebody who'll pull it down into the niceties of lived life, not a Joel Schumacher slickster who'd polish it up to the level of a Grisham movie. And the big payoff is that Julia Roberts gives a performance that's equally movie-star-like and conscientious about keeping it real. She is great at what she does. It's great to see growth in an overpaid movie star. From here on out, the sky's the limit--as, I hope, it shall be for that most modest yet most ingenious and fiendishly inventive of talents, Steven Soderbergh."
"andrealt","Null","1","1","13 March 2000"," One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!
","I caught a sneak preview of this film on Saturday, and I must say I was completely riveted the entire way through!  This is a very compelling (and true) story of a woman who decided to quit letting things happen *to* her, and started to just make things happen for herself.  Raising three children on her own, having less than $100 in the bank, no job, and just having been in a serious car accident, she basically bullies her way into a position at a law firm to work for the lawyer who had been representing her in the law suit she had just lost for said car accident.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts' portrayal of Erin is spirited, real, courageous, and best of all entertaining as all heck to watch!  The entire theater cheered her on as she would let fly with a lethal dose of in-your-face reality and truth.  If you've ever felt like you were at the end of your rope in life, this woman reminds you of it, and then makes your jaw drop as she pulls herself out of a huge pit in her life.  On top of it all, she finds that it is when she dedicates herself to helping others better their own lives that her life becomes far better than she could have ever dreamed.  An object lesson and something to think on far after you leave the theater. <br/><br/>
Erin Brockovich is my new hero!"

"mercury-26","9","1","1","26 March 2000"," Care until it hurts
","Think about the person in your life who's a thorn in your side, that annoying person who knows exactly where your buttons are and when to push them; that person who, no matter how hard you try to refute their words, you have to admit `you're right' on a regular basis.  This person isn't perfect--they too have their weaknesses, their flaws, but whenever you try to throw these flaws in their face, they come up with something even more incriminating about you to throw back.  You hate this person and love them dearly at the same time, because without them, you'd probably be in a gutter somewhere. That person you are thinking of is your 'Erin Brockovich.'  If you see the highly entertaining new Steven Soderbergh film named for her, you'll see my point.<br/><br/>Hollywood does love the underdog.  When we're introduced to our heroine, played to perfection by Julia Roberts, she has no money, no job, and no marketable skills with which to get one.  Here we see the frustration anyone encounters when looking for a job: `If only they would just give me a chance, I'd show them...'  Personality goes a long way, but isn't enough to land a job, even an entry-level one.  Personality's something Erin's got a bit too much of, unfortunately.  Her life so far has been one long disappointment and frustration and desperation has its way of creeping to the surface.<br/><br/>One of the amazing things about Erin is that even when she's hanging onto the thinnest of threads, she never backs down.  For instance, she finally lands a job from her lawyer, Ed Masry (played by the brilliantly-cast Albert Finney), who takes pity on her because he lost her neck injury lawsuit.  Her wardrobe is limited to bright-colored, revealing tops and short skirts.  Ed starts to give her the standard `workplace attire' speech after she's been there a while.  She plainly refuses to change her wardrobe, citing `I think I look good' in her defense.  The way she says it leaves no room for argument, no room to question.  Suddenly, her wardrobe makes all the sense in the world!  <br/><br/>Then comes the PG&E lawsuit.  After Erin reveals her findings to one family who have all become sick in one form or another, many other families begin to come forward.  Masry now has a very large civil case on his hands, and continually denies he has the resources to handle it.  Erin, of course, believes otherwise.  The case will require a ton of research, thousands of signatures, costly expert witnesses.  All Ed sees is money piling up that may never be repaid.  Erin sees people who have been wronged and lied to. She makes her argument and, again, it makes all the sense in the world.<br/><br/> ""Erin Brockovich"" is about the power of giving a damn.  Erin cares so much it hurts.  She knows each face, age, disease, phone number, and address of the people she's fighting for.  The film tells you that this kind of compassion is something that no law school can ever teach.  She's smart, she cares, and she's willing to fight.  That's all she needs.<br/><br/>It's good to see that life under the guidance of a big studio hasn't cramped Mr. Soderbergh's style, at least not too much.  Handheld camera is used almost exclusively, which makes you feel like it's really happening, like you're right there watching it.  This is a simple story and he tells it straight, rarely dipping into his usual bag of tricks.  For my money, Mr. Soderbergh is the best, most vital director working in Hollywood right now. I'm glad he was hired to make ""Brockovich,"" but have to admit I'd like to see him return to the less conventional style of his other recent work, ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey,"" two of the best films of the nineties.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Erin Brockovich: Trying to raise three kids after two failed marriages with no job skills under a mountain of debt, while recovering from a car accident, would be enough to kill the spirit of most people. Not Erin Brockovich.  Gutsy, determined, and gifted with amazing people skills she manages to bully her way into a job at a law firm.   One day while doing some routine filing Erin comes across some information that seems out of place.  Her search to uncover its meaning leads her on a quest with monumental consequences.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, it would have been easy to make a poor-woman-fights-against-system-and-everything-turns-out-wonderful-movie. Thankfully they didn't. Well paced and written, a great deal of time is devoted to character development. I was especially impressed that they did not try to make the main character warm and fuzzy.   <br/><br/>Not since Mystic Pizza has Julia Roberts been given the chance to show that she can act - typecast as the vanilla cute, spunky heroine she has been coasting through her roles for years.  As Brockovich, Roberts is self-assured, dresses like a Frederick's of Hollywood model, throws around four letter words like a sailor, and has a temper worse than a pit bull. Most importantly, she is believable -Roberts slips so perfectly into the character that you almost forget it is her (maybe now she'll get the respect and the roles, that she deserves) some more serious offers.  Albert Finney, who plays her grizzled, cranky boss, is the perfect foil and together they are unstoppable. <br/><br/>A careful blend of humor and drama Brockovich is worth full price."

It's closer in spirit to ""All the President's Men"" than to the movie it's bound to be compared with, ""Silkwood.""  This one isn't in ""President""'s rarefied league, but it puts ""Silkwood"" in the shade, and Julia trumps Meryl handily by being not only fully up to the emotional demands of the part, but by being hilariously funny as well--and physically a dream.  Finney hasn't been this good in years, and Eckhardt displays the kind of charismatic charm one couldn't have guessed he had from ""In the Company of Men.""

"Brogan","8","1","1","21 March 2000"," Erin the savior.
","Director Steve Soderbergh is now three for three on directing both excellent and critical acclaim films, three years in a row!  First was his very witty and super hip 1998 hit, OUT OF SIGHT with George Clooney, and Jennifer Lopez (before she wanted to sing full-time).  Then last year was the stylish and dark THE LIMEY with Terrance Stamp in a role that was at least Oscar worthy of a nomination.  Now there is his newest film, a film that isn't as stylish or as hip as the previous two, but it's still a darn great movie. Soderbergh's newest film is ERIN BROCKOVICH, which is based on a true story.  The real life story has the title character (Julia Roberts) who is a single mother of three, who is looking for a job.  Erin will lie during her interview or anything, just so she can take care of her children.  Erin then goes to her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who eariler represented her in a car accident case, and begs for a job. Ed decides to give Erin a job and wants her to investigate a pro-bono case on a small California town called Hinkley who filed a lawsuit against the Pacific Gas & Electric company for contaminating the town's water supply and are aware of it.  It's so sad that the town's people are getting tumors, degenerative organs, and other freak symptoms; and the company tells the town citizens that everything is all right and the chemicals that they put in the water are suppose to ""help"" the town. Well, Erin decides to investigate this problem, and becomes friends with many of the residents of Hinkley, including Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) who is suffering from breast cancer, due to the posioning of the water. Meanwhile, Erin stirkes up a romantic relationship with a biker who just moved in next door named George, (Aaron Eckhart).  While Erin is looking for the truth with what is going on in Hinkley, George becomes the caretaker of the children, and isn't quite happy about it.  And also, Erin has problems of her own when Ed Masry hires a couple of high priced attorneys, Kurt Potter (Peter Coyote) and Theresa Dallevale (Veanne Cox) to take over the case of the lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric. Before you begin to shout, ""this sounds like A CIVIL ACTION or SILKWOOK,"" well it isn't.  This is more of a movie that focuses in depth of one woman's crusade to reveal the truth, and go up against powerful attorneys, and a powerful company.  ERIN shows what a hard working mother has to go through to raise a family single handed and try to do well in her job.  In one touching scene, Erin is in tears as her boyfriend tells her over her cell phone that her youngest child started to say her first words. But Erin missed it, since she's devoting her time with her work on Hinkley. I was very impressed with Julia Roberts performance in ERIN BROCKOVICH. She isn't much of that ""cute girl next door"" role that she is known for like in RUNAWAY BRIDE or PRETTY WOMAN.  Instead, she's vulgar, loud, and pushy, but also caring, committed, and heartfelt.  This film proves that Juila Roberts is a actress who is willing to take any role that she is given, and I think she should do more great serious acting roles like this one. People and critcs who also see Roberts wearing short and skin-tight clothes, only see this film skin deep. I was also enjoying the performance of Albert Finney, who I was very glad to see in a major film role.  Finney plays Ed very well, at times a boorish old man, at other times, a man who like Erin can be caring and have a heart.  Finney is also funny at times with his facial reactions to Erin's smart aleck remarks on his legal decisions and his own comments to Erin's comments.  It's hard to believe that this is the same man who played TOM JONES thirty-seven years ago. ERIN is a very well done film, in it's own way.  While SILKWOOD focused on revealing the truth, A CIVIL ACTION focused on the legal sense, ERIN focuses on what it takes to get the truth out in the open.  The pacing of the film is fast paced and entertaining (even for a film that is 131 mins.), the acting is great, and the story is very inspiring.  With such films as this one, and THE INSIDER, one wonders on how these big and powerful companies can get away with this illegal activity without being revealed.  Until then, the truth is out there, and it's on the local cinema.  ****1/2 (out of five)"

Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were sublime as Erin and Ed, as was Aaron Eckhart as George.  Marg Helgenberger was amazing as Donna Jensen, the first litigant in the case against PG&E.<br/><br/>The families involved were real. Their experiences were real. Erin's sexy, dogged determination was real.  This wasn't the first movie of its kind, and I'm sure it won't the be last.  But the story's message is a very important one. The huge corporation involved is Pacific Gas and Electric. This is an enormous utilities company that serves a large part of California. There are STILL cases pending against them. I think it's a wakeup call to people that the big guys can be wrong, and must be held accountable for it, and that the little ones CAN do something about it.<br/><br/>The interwoven love story was very well written, and accurately drove home Erin's conflict between doing right by the families affected by the contamination, and doing right by her own family.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie; whether you're a Julia fan or not.<br/><br/>*Not to mention the fact that now is probably a good time to buy stock in the company that makes the Wonderbra!!"

","Erin Brockovich is a terrific film depicting the true life story of a single mother turned law clerk's battle to gain respect and a better life for her children while toppling a power company's clandestine efforts to cover up the poisoning of a small California town.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts portrays Erin Brockovich with incredible, realistic conviction, and this role proves to be her finest one yet.  Roberts is a master now, capable of pulling off diverse roles, and making characters her own in the mold of Meryl Streep.  She deserves an Oscar nod for this, and it can only lead to bigger and better parts.  Albert Finney is in top form as Brockovich's boss, attorney Ed Masry, who attempts to groom the rough, tightly wound (and clothed) Erin, as well as gamble everything he has built to bring about restitution for his long suffering clients.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a fully satisfying movie-going experience, and do not be put off by critics who call it formulaic or ""made for t.v.""  Why?  Because all films are formulaic and more people watch television than go to church! See it because it is a great movie and you will have a good time.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
"Ysman","8","1","1","20 March 2000"," Entertaining if not substantial . . .
","It took the talent of Steven Soderbergh to pull off a successful legal drama in Hollywood.  Coppola failed with The Rainmaker and Steven Zaillian failed miserably with A Civil Action.  Erin Brockovich takes a similar plot outline and wins because it doesn't bore the audience with anti-climatic court room scenes.  Erin Brockovich pulls on all the right strings, manipulating the audience at will.  The audience is more than willing to go along for the ride as the cliches are hidden under great direction and inspired acting and the somewhat made for TV plot is given expert treatment from Soderbergh. Erin Brockovich will give Soderbergh the box office respect he deserved from Out of Sight and may land Julia her second Oscar nod."

","After seeing a brutal Mission to Mars, this film is just wonderful.  I am normally an action movie junkie, but the writing in this film is fantastic. The dialog is witty, snappy, and creative.  It was a very credible movie. Just when I was losing all faith in Hollywood, Julia Roberts pulls out the best performance of her career and brings me back into the mix. I loved this movie.  Go see it. Sit back and enjoy true to life dialog and a great true story. Albert Finney is top notch in his supporting role as well. He fit the role perfectly and his facial expressions make the whole story work.  It is isn't often that the kids are realistic, and these kids must have moved in with Julia for a while because they were so cozy together.  It didn't seem awkward like, for example, Jake Lloyd is Star Wars.  Great JOB by all!"
"localman-2","10","1","1","19 March 2000"," Great Storytelling
","This film reminded me that, despite the attention usually given the stars, the real draw of a film is the director.  Steven Soderbergh knows how to tell a story.  This film worked well for everyone in the theater, which broke out it cheers and applause at several points in the film.  For such a down-to-earth story, the audience reaction was truly amazing.<br/><br/>Although this film is remarkably similar in theme to ""A Civil Action"" and very easily could have fallen victim to the fact that similar stories have been told dozens of times, Erin Brockovich shines.<br/><br/>The entire cast was superb, and Susannah Grant's script was sharp and tight. Soderbergh always seems to bring the very best out of those he's working with.  Although I don't hear a lot about him, I think he is one of the most talented directors around today.  Every time I let him tell me a story, I'm very glad that I did."

","I went into this movie not having a clue what it was about.  All I knew was that Julia Roberts was in it.  I came out with a whole new appreciation for her as an actress.  She brings a depth and conviction to her portrayal of Erin that made me think that maybe there was still a serious actress there after all.  It's been so long since we've seen Roberts in a role that was more than just fluff.  This role signals a return to more serious fare.  And not only did Roberts bring the role to life, she did it clad in the most hideous of 80's fashions.  This movie isn't just about cleavage -- the clothing is representative of the time period.  If you ignore it and concentrate on the story and the acting, you'll be pleasantly surprised, and find yourself watching a well-written, well-directed, well-acted movie that will draw you in and make you want to jump right in and help Erin in her fight against Big Business."

Finally! A movie you can actually sink your teeth into! And one that doesn't need to rely amazing special effects, explosions, car chases and the like to captivate the audience. This film, like many others shows why Julia Roberts is paid US$20 million for 3 months of her time. 'Erin Brockovich' is now one of my favorite movies of all time.

The fact that someone without a degree or higher education can pull off a stunt like this, only looks a little incredible, but aren't many films like that?<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh (King of the Hill,Traffic) did a fine job, Albert Finney (Miller's Crossing,Traffic) was excellent, and so was Julia Roberts.

","""Erin Brockovich"" tells a ripping tale.  Julia Roberts is appealing in the title roll and has never been more charming and charismatic.  Albert Finney as the lawyer for whom Roberts works is, as usual, masterful.  As recent press reports have revealed, however,  the interesting, exciting story the movie tells is only incidentally similar to the events it purportedly depicts.  But that's all right.  This is entertainment, not history.  As we all know, when we hear the term, ""Based on a true story!""  we should be warned that the emphasis is on the word ""based"" and a whole lot of the truth is sacrificed to the needs of dramatic story-telling.

","Very entertaining movie, which held my attention throughout. Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were just outstanding in the lead roles. Only criticisms are two: The ""R"" rating for language was much deserved. The movie could have been just as effective if the language was curbed. The firey personality of Erin could have been displayed just as well, and the movie could have been more available to younger audiences, which would be beneficial. It was disappointing to me to see someone of the stature and appeal of Julia Roberts using such crude language and probably 95% of the foul talk was in her script. The only other negative feature was the tiresome politically correct themes that seem to always appear in Hollywood productions, of the bad capitalist corporations, and the strong capable female and weak dependent males. PC was violated, however, with insults hurled at an overweight female character. With these exceptions, it was in the top category of movies I have seen."

","Part of the fun of going to see a movie in a theatre that is full of people is the amount of response from the people around you. I don't need to be told when to laugh, but sometimes it's still enjoyable. With the excellent film ""Erin Brockovich"", it was fun. Julia Roberts stars as the sharp-tongued Erin B. who won't flinch at screaming ""Bite me, crispy cream"" to an uptight secretary, or ""Fuck you!"" to her boss. She says what's on her mind, and that's precisely why she gets as far as she does. People respect her. Especially those dying or who have dying children due to poisoned water in Hinkly, which is a town that is right beside PG&E, a huge plant. Erin is working for a small law firm and finds the case intriguing, and decides to study up on it. She gets further and further invovled, and spends months and months on the case, while also supporting her three children and trying to pay attention to a devoted boyfriend. Two stiff, cold briefcase-carrying, suit-wearing lawyers are brought in without any consent of Erin's, and she wastes no time speaking her mind. After one of the stiff, corporate lawyers calmly says to her, ""I'm sorry, I must have gotten off on the wrong foot.."" Erin retorts, ""That's all you got, lady! Two wrong feet and some ugly shoes."" She has the upper hand in the entire case because she possesses what the others lack, the human touch. She relates to the dying victims and reassures them she is trying her hardest and most sincere. Julia Roberts shines as Erin Brockovich, and it shows she sincerely believed in the film, the script, and the story, and wanted to get the real deal across about the real town that had a real, severe cancer problem as well as many other diseases creeping into people's homes due to the plant. Wonderful script by Susannah Grant, who above all should be commended, as well as terrific acting by all, especially Julia herself. Excellent film. Smart. Sassy. See it."
"johandutoit","Null","1","1","30 March 2001"," Roberts at her best
","The minute Julia stepped out disappointed from her first jobinterview I knew she was going to be sublime. I should have known. Soderbergh is an complete director not only involved with the technical details of filming, the best shots etc... but he gets the best out of his actors. There's no doubt about Julia Roberts her talent, she has grown so much but with big stars I think it is important to get a performance that makes you sometimes forget that your looking at a star. Personally I believe in underacting. Soderbergh does the same for Michael Douglas in Traffic I think. This could have been a very mediocre film, the subject alone screams movie of the week but it isn't. Soderbergh combines the best Hollywood techniques with  his own vision and insight and incredible talent. He knows what he's doing. Normally after making a critically acclaimed movie, young directors fall for Big Hollywoodprojects and find they can't handle it, probably the pressure of studio's , producers (hey I read Premiere), but Soderbergh stayed underground letting his talent grow while making films like 'kafka' and the sublime 'King of the hill', only recently he emerged into the spotlight with Out of Sight, a film as smoothly filmed as Jennifer Lopez's skin. His talent and films is why I go the movies."

But since it was Steven Soderbergh, I had to see to see it, and I was definitely not disappointed. One of the rare occassions when the theatre burst into applause not just at the end, but at least 3 or 4 times during the show.

"pserve","Null","1","1","10 January 2001"," Good Girl !
","Let me remind you first that the story and the characters are all true. Erin Brockovich exists and did reveal PG & E' scandal. I'll add that, according to witnesses, the real Erin also used to work dressed in very... revealing clothes ! That is for those who would think that Julia Roberts's incredible uplift cleavage is shown here for no other reason than arousing and holding the viewer's interest... Steven Soderbergh is remembered having won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1989, at the age of 26 years old and for his very first film: ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"". The hardest was just starting for him: he had now to prove that he deserved it... He had to be seen as a talented director (""Kafka"" or ""The Limey""), never hesitating to experiment new film genre. With ""Erin Brockovich"", he fits into the current trend of US ""campaigner films"". Are 60's and 70's best hours of US political cinema back to the screen ? Let's wait and see a little more before answering (hopefully) ""yes""... In the meantime, I have no choice but to call ""Erin Brockovich"" a real success. Of course, the story alone (true, then) couldn't be enough. It needed an appropriate direction to make the most of it. Soderbergh's one is precise, sober, fluent and well-paced, all rolled into one. He has succeeded in turning a story with no action strictly speaking, at least in hollywoodian sense of the word (no car chase, no guns, no various violence, etc.), into a... sustained action film the viewer never gets bored with. As in front of a film noir or a thriller. The director's work's best parts can be found in the rythm he gave to his film (and who says rythm does not obligatory means high speed...), in an excellent editing, with no particular effects, without any trick. I would even venture to say that Soderbergh tried to make his direction as invisible as glass, in the same way than George Orwell tried to do with his prose. And let's give thanks to Soderbergh for having spared us the recurrent sequences in US cinema: the ""trial ones"" ! A powerful story, an adequate direction and, of course, great acting. The whole film rests with pretty Julia Roberts. Of course she didn't wait for this film to show her real talents or acting. Hollywood's most expensive star ($20 millions for this film...) had already seduced wild world viewers with various comedies, such as Pretty Woman, Everybody says ""I love you"", My Best Friend's Wedding or Notting Hill. More seldom she had been seen in good drama, Mary Reilly being almost an exception... In the role of Erin, Julia Roberts glows with her dynamism, her obstinacy and, naturally (well, she's Julia Roberts, after all !) her stunning smile. The clothes she wears (tiny-mini-skirts and high-heeled shoes that make her legs looking endless but also lead to a funny walk, all in addition to her cleavage), the way she talks (more vulgar than glamour) could have done a disservice to her. But, by making her more ""human"" and closer to the ""ordinary people"" she defends, by exposing an outward appearance in contrast to the character's pyschology, the  result is quite the reverse. At her side, great Albert Finney is perfect and Aaron Eckard brings humanity to his role... A worth seeing film !"

","Now this IS a film that contains Julia Robert's best performance. Anyway, I can even go as far as saying that it certainly beats the one she displayed in Stepmom.<br/><br/>Robert's portrays a single, unemployed mother of three children who just lost a court case and is now finding it impossible to pay all her bills and expenses. Naturally, she desperately tries to find every job possible in the local newspaper...with no luck of course. So, her only alternative is to try and force her lawyer, Ed, to give her any job available at his firm.<br/><br/>Curiosity finally got the better of Julia, as she goes scurrying around the firm and finds herself glued to an interesting case which involves countless number of people who have suffered from diseases caused by water produced by their distributor. Then the plot thickens, with Julia smelling something illegal going on in the water distributor and ultimately, finds a new case for her new boss (Ed).<br/><br/>I must admit that the setting of an outback America was a bit of a huge letdown for me. I'm the sort of person who's used to a nice, urban avenue filled with typically large American houses or big, meteropolise areas chocked with skyscrapers (i.e New York). However, overall, I was very pleased with the film and this is a must see for all Julia Robert's fans."

If characters could be expressed as well as Roberts's character, we would have a better group of movies, and television series to watch and enjoy.

","""Erin Brockovich"" was a surprise to me. It surprised me of how much this movie pulled me into the story right from the beginning and kept my attention all the way to the end. But most importantly, it features a powerful, knockout performance by Julia Roberts in the title role. Oscar voters if you are reading this take note immediately: Roberts deserves to be nominated for Best Actress and deserves to win. This is probably the best work she's ever done. Roberts dominates this film by appearing in almost every scene. Erin Brockovich is a tough-as-nails mother of three who goes to work for a law firm run by an attorney (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) who represented her in a case at the beginning of the movie. She eventually stumbles upon a monumental law case against a giant corporation (PG&E). Erin decides to take on this company at any cost. She also gets plenty of help from her boss, and the two begin a memorable fight that ends up bringing a small town to its feet and a huge corporation to its knees. ""Erin Brockovich"" not only has a great performance by Roberts, but an excellent supporting performance by Finney as her boss, who early on hilariously tells his new employee about rethinking her wardrobe (love those outfits she wears). He should get an Oscar nomination too. Oscar nominations should also go to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Susannah Grant for bringing this movie to life and telling a compelling story (Soderbergh will definitely get a Best Director nomination but he'll probably be nominated for his current movie ""Traffic"", which is also generating Oscar talk). There are a couple of moments in ""Erin Brockovich"" that I could have done without, and if the movie had been about 15-20 minutes shorter, it would have been a great movie. Nevertheless, it comes close, and Roberts splendid acting here is the driving force behind the success of this movie. If she doesn't take home the Best Actress Oscar come this March and the award ends up going to someone else, I'm going to be very upset. SHE DESERVES IT!!!!! As for the rest of ""Erin Brockovich"", right from its smashing opening to its hilarious conclusion, it's a pretty darn good movie.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"
"Old Joe","10","1","1","18 November 2000"," A Real woman. A real story. A real triumph!
","What more can I say about Erin Brockovich, it was superb. In real life she is a truly remarkable woman and on-screen, Roberts really made me believe that she was Brockovich in a way.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is Julia Roberts' best role. Roles in such movies as Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway Bride don't match this one. <br/><br/>Erin Brockovich brought out the true talent which movie lovers know Roberts has. She acted it perfectly. Being stubborn, hard-working, aggressive emotional and caring, traits I'm sure the real Brockovich has.<br/><br/>
The story of this movie concentrates on  Erin Brockovich, who has 3 kids, divorced twice and a $17,000 debt after she loses her court case after a car accident. So Erin  looks and applies for a heaps of jobs, until she goes back to the lawyer who was representing her in court and begs for a job. After she is finally given a go, Erin searches into a small towns health crisis and brings a billion dollar company to its knees. <br/><br/>The case that made Brockovich so famous was about  a processing plant called PG+E  which contaminated the water of a small town called Hinkley. The water supply was contaminated with Hexavalent Chromium, which can cause many terrible health problems, including Headaches, Nose Bleeds, cancers (of numerous kinds),  liver, heart and reproductive failure, organ deterioration and in bad cases death. So Brockovich, with no legal experience took on the case for the people of Hinkley and helped them win. In a way it was David taking on Goliath. I also loved the relationship between Erin and her boss Ed Masry. They treated each other with low regard, but in the end respected each other for who they were. Ed was played by Albert Finney and was well done.<br/><br/>One part of the film I can understand people not liking is the relationship between Erin and bikie boyfriend George. It was destined  never to work as Erin was focusing more on her work for the case and not him. Maybe he was an unwanted character, but then again I saw George to be a kind man who helped Erin in her greatest time of need. Then we also see that Erin puts her kids needs behind to help others. Erin loved her kids, but her sense of justice meant her family life had to suffer.<br/><br/> There are some memorable quotes in Erin Brockovich, here are a few of my favorites:<br/><br/>`How Â‘bout this for a number. 6, is the age of my daughter, 8 is the age of son, 2 is the number of times I have been divorced and 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.' <br/><br/>`That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In f.....g ugly shoes.'<br/><br/>`They're called boobs, Ed.'<br/><br/>`Seeing as how I have no brains or legal expertise, I just went out there and performed sexual favors. Six hundred and thirty-four blow jobs in five days... I'm really quite tired.'<br/><br/>`Not personal? That's my work in there. My Sweat, my time away from my kids..... if that's not personal, I don't know what is.'<br/><br/>For those who have the facilities to watch DVDs, Erin Brockovich should be at the top of your list, with an impressive amount of special features including a report with Erin Brockovich herself (by the way look out for the real Brockovich in the movie) and half an hour of deleted scenes, which were interesting to see. <br/><br/>All in all,  I hated the case and the pain those people had to endure, but I loved the way this true story was bought to the bigscreen. The courage of a single mother who felt so passionately about people who she had no ties with and wanted to see them have a new chance in life is truly inspirational.<br/><br/>
Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10."

","""Erin Brockovich"" is great Hollywood entertainment.  It's nice to go to a movie and not have to become to cerebral in describing how much you enjoyed it.

","It is a very entertaining and - unlike what many people think - very believable movie.  I was surprised to see very little mention of the feminist implications of the movie.  Erin's genuine compassion can only be felt so intensely by the people she interacts with because she is a woman. Of-course the fact that she is not a perfect career woman, in terms of professional attitude and wardrobe style etc...  adds another element of reality as she is not THE perfect woman - yet she succeeds in a lovely way and with such support from us: people watching the movie! This movie, in addition to the very good performance of the cast and the main idea of the plot, also points out a very interesting point: a woman with a great setback of lack of a qualified expressing C.V. can make some significant changes given her innate sympathy, compassion and emotional intelligence. Very inspiring. i don't know about the majority of people who watched the movie, but it seemed VERY believable to me."

","Wow, what a movie! I was dying to see it, but was prevented from doing so until it came out of video.  Of course, during the movies that actually mean something to me, there are always phone calls, people asking ""Hey, what happened?"" upon return from their twelfth snack run to the kitchen, dogs barking at passers by...  Somehow, I managed to watch the movie through all these interruptions, and come out of it with that rare feeling that this was a GREAT movie.  It was warm, gritty, real and beautiful.  Julia Roberts played the low income single mother to the point where you forget she's Julia Roberts.  Erin is mouthy, ballsy, brash and fun.  It's a story of dedication and a person standing against great odds... it's inspiring, yet not mushy about it, and the many people in the movie are all to be commended for their real-ness.  It's a SUPER movie, and from someone who really dislikes ""tear-jerker-ish"" kind of movies, that means something. It ranks up there with The Green Mile, and the Shawshank Redemption - fresh ideas, reminding us that we have not run out of stories - just the ability to put quality over $quantity$.  A++ to this movie.  Rent/Buy it."

The difference between being a victim and a winner, I think it will be an inspiration to many people that struggle in their lives to be strong and go for it. Show them what you're made of. There should be more people like Erin, willing to take on the big guys. An excellent movie, highly recommended."

Julia Roberts managed to do some acting for the first time in a few years and it paid off.  She made Erin into a believable character who you wanted to see succeed.  She was not perfect and when the movie was over, she had still not sorted out all the facets of her life - something no-one else has ever done, so why should she?<br/><br/>The secondary characters were well defined, being more than just cardboard cut-outs.

","Yes, Erin Brockovich is your basic run-of-the-mill ""David & Goliath"" story of the lone hero (Julia in this case) who goes up against the evil monster (PG&E). Where this story differs though is simply in the performances and how real it makes the characters seem. You absolutely feel for these people not only because we know it actually happened but also because they make you feel like it's really happening to them. Julia Roberts gives her best performance to date by playing this woman honestly. I'm so glad they didn't try to gloss Erin up by making her seem to good to be true. They simply made her a woman of flesh and blood, good and bad. Kudos for all involved in what is the absolute best film of 2000 so far. Great job!!"

"jadzia-9","9","1","1","13 March 2000"," Director Steven Soderbergh triumphs again!
","When I first heard that Steven Soderbergh (my new favorite director after ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"") was directing a Julia Roberts movie, I was worried. Would this be a big sell-out Hollywood picture? I was worried for no reason. Soderbergh comes through once again, and in a very big way. Like he did for George Clooney in ""Out of Sight"", Soderbergh also does for Julia Roberts: making a famed actor step out of their famous persona and instead become a very detailed character. Julia Roberts pulls in a great performance in this movie, for any reason but the fact that you don't get a constant reminder that you are watching ""Julia Roberts"". Erin Brockovich comes alive in a startling way and makes a fine counterpoint to the typical Julia Roberts role: she is brashy, trashy, strong but still utterly likeable. While many of the stylistic editing techniques that Soderbergh has used (most eloquently in ""The Limey"")have been toned down for this crowd-pleasing picture, they are still there. Fans of his previous movies will be pleased, and I daresay that Julia Roberts fans will be as well."
"Foopy-2","Null","1","1","12 July 2000"," Superbly executed
","Well, at first Julia Roberts' character annoyed me.  She was completely devoid of tact.  An early scene in the movie in which Ms. Brockovich goes through a trial quickly reveals most of this negative side and although you understand that she's not in a very good position in her life, you don't have an overwhelming amount of sympathy for her, which is good.  The rest of the film reveals that, despite her flaws, she's quite a humanist and will fight brutally to get what she believes is justice; not only that, but her flaws make her a very interesting and entertaining character.<br/><br/>Unlike more complex law dramas, this film doesn't really get into what the true meaning of ""justice"" really is or any of that philosophical stuff, but then again it doesn't need to.  The story is pretty straightforward, and it's told in a very elegant way.  There are a few holes, such as why it seems as though Ms. Brockovich doesn't reveal to her family that she's *helping* people (as opposed to merely working 24/7) until near the end of the film, as well as a few other odd breaks in communication, but nothing major.<br/><br/>Another thing that sort of annoyed me was the way that Ms. Brockovich is portrayed as the ""genius"" behind the whole case and basically does all the work while everyone else putzes around.  But hey, what can one expect from a Hollywood melodrama.<br/><br/>For me, the most interesting things about the film are definitely the characters portrayed by Roberts, Eckhart, and Finney.  They're all very human, and reveal some interesting things about a person's appearance (including their manner of speaking) versus what they're really like, beyond a merely superficial level.  In particular, I like how the movie makes a point of implying how much of an illusion cuss words are, how little they tell us about a person who uses them, and the way that someone who never uses them at all and speaks in the most eloquent manner can be hundreds of times more cruel and immoral than someone who uses them dozens of times in a single sentence."
"BuddyBoy1961","8","1","1","12 July 2000"," Three cheers for Julia!
","After countless fluffy roles in a number of alternately respectable or forgettable pictures, Julia Roberts has finally been given another substantive character to play, and a true-life one to boot; like the woman she portrays, once she sinks her teeth into something she never lets go. Roberts is a natural to play Brockovich, an effervescent though uncouth woman prone to low-cut tops and high-cut skirts in equal proportion. Struggling to raise three children after her second divorce, Erin's relentless job search is interrupted by a debilitating fender bender. Feeling slighted by her not entirely fruitful attorney (Albert Finney), she transforms his guilt into a full-time clerical position at his law firm. Forming the crux of the storyline is her discovery in a series of real estate case files some hundreds of illnesses plaguing the citizens of Hinkley, a small desert community north of Los Angeles. During her subsequent investigation, Erin's innate empathy and kinship for fellow blue-collar families inspires her to uncover a conspiracy by a multi-billion dollar public utility to dispel its liability for the community's failing health. What could have played as yet another weepy disease-of-the-week telefilm is invigorated by Roberts, Susannah Grant's snappy script and the on-target direction by Steven Soderbergh. Rarely bogged down by lulls of requisite exposition, ""Erin Brockovich"" is briskly carried aloft on the shoulders of no-holds-barred Roberts, who gleefully understands her character's motivation and relentlessly pursues her course, even at the risk of increasingly neglecting her children and current beau. Too-long missing from American cinema, this entry in the ""triumph of the little guy"" oeuvre is too irresistible to dislike and too satisfying to dismiss."

","Why can't we get more films like this, a strong story, based on actual events, excellent performances and dialogue which sounds like it is based on how real people talk to each other?<br/><br/>I don't know how accurate this particular story about corporate deceit and environmental pollution is but, given the track record of big corporations, it should be a rich vein for film makers to mine. 'Erin Brockovich' is very good, a shocking story of  land pollution and resultant death and disease in a community. A story, however, which would not have been told were it not for the efforts of one woman to get behind the obfuscation and at the truth. It's a juicy role and Julia Roberts grabs it for all she is worth, she is superb, full of anger and determination to use the opportunity to make something of her life. This is the strength of her performance, she convinces in showing us a woman in challenging circumstances, on her own with no job and kids to feed who is actually a bold and intelligent woman rather than a victim. There is a real hunger about how she works her socks off to put the case together while trying to balance her other responsibilities.<br/><br/>There are good performances all round and some of the dialogue really crackles, seeing some corporate lawyers put in their place is particularly satisfying. A film well worth seeing and one that is more subtle than it might at first appear."

","Small town and Julia Roberts playing another likeable, all-American yokel - hmm, this seems like a familiar formula.  And of course this is going to wind up being a hokey, humdrum, merely average movie just like Runaway Bride, right?  Nope, not even close.  Actually, it's probably the best mainstream movie to come down the pipe this year.  In fact, it plays off of Julia Roberts' image as this particular type of character, as the movie is all about appearances and the fallacy of catering to those images.  Julia prances around in EXTREMELY tight-fitting clothing while shouting sporadic obscenities, but despite this characterization, she is a wonderful and caring human being that you have to root for deep within your soul, even if you haven't liked a single one of her other films and practically despised her previous acting attempts(like myself).  This is an apparently ordinary person acting in an extraordinary fashion, bettering the lives of hundreds of people without having the audience question her integrity - Roberts is completely believable and lovable.  If you have ever been presented with the complexities of modern life, or seen others experience it and marvel at how they do it, you will cheer for Erin Brockovich.  9/10"

This movie was all Julia Roberts and she carried this movie from beginning till the end. I was hoping to know a little more about her and her family and her new biker boyfriend. If there were no children and she was a hooker off the street that wanted to get a real job then this would have the same plot. Then they could have her getting back in touch with her family that she ran away from and it would be just as interesting. This apparently was a true story so they had to stick to a basic plot. I'm sure the real Erin B. had more problems being respected and given the access to records and in the courtroom, but this was not shown. I am sure that would not make a good movie. I am also sure she was given more grief by her outfits, but that would not make a good movie if we can't see Julia in a push up bra for the whole movie. I enjoyed that acting and the non-traditional filming methods which made us feel more involved in the movie. I would be interested in knowing if the real Erin wrote a book on her rise to glory and I would be interested in comparing that to the movie.

The second being about said single mother transcending stereotypes by discovering and investigating a cover up by a large utility about the damage that their plant has caused local residents. The great achievement that director Steven Soderbergh makes is to combine these two elements seemlessly. Julia Roberts is in superb form in the titular role and her co-star, veteran Albert Finney, turns in an excellent performance. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as Erin's main squeeze, George and Marg Helgenberger as Donna Jensen, the woman whose Real Estate claim starts the whole thing off. The screenplay by Susannah Grant provides Roberts with lots of snappy one-liners, which I'm not quite sure the real Erin Brockovich said. But hey! It makes for more fun in the movie.

","There are truly bad movies. Some of them are at least enjoyable, in a Mystery Science Theatre sort of way. But then there are bad movies that try to pass themselves off as good, in which even the flaws turn out to be flat-out annoying more than entertaining.<br/><br/>""Erin Brockovich"" is of the second type. In fact, it's the worst of the second type of bad films to be released in 2000. Here's a brief summary of some of the reasons why:<br/><br/><ul><li>Six hundred innocent lives are at stake. The audience is supposed to care. It doesn't. That's the first sign a movie like this is in trouble.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Julia Roberts is a good actress, but she comes off as over-acting because of the banal dialogue. No, sorry, ""dialogue"" implies interaction. All we have here is Julia Roberts dishing out lines that basically say, ""look Ma, I'm acting!"" and show off her talent to memorize tedium.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>PG&amp;E is portrayed as an evil, evil corporation. That's not the part I have a problem with. I have a problem with the fact that its representatives are portrayed as drones that serve as nothing more than voices for the evil, evil corporation. Faithful representatives, to be sure, but this was done better with stormtroopers and Star Wars.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Long and boring. This is a dramatized by-the-textbook retelling. ""Gettysburg"" and ""Anna and the King"" also suffered from this, but at least they were visually interesting. Visually (and musically), ""Brockovich"" plays like a Seinfeld episode without the humor. Or the character design.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's just so COLD. And the characters are all flat. (That's right, I called Erin Brockovich flat.) ""Tough biker who likes kids and is a sensitive guy on the inside"" is NOT character development - and everyone else was worse.</li></ul><br/><br/>I gave this an IMDB rating of 2/10. I'm a nice guy."

She is then shocked when she finds out she has been fired and yells incessantly until she gets her job back. <br/><br/>Her boss, played by Albert Finney, has been an attorney for years and has made a living fighting uphill battles on contingency, but he seems unable to deal with people or build a case or even conduct a meeting without the help of ignorant-yet-spunky Erin Brokovich. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a Hollywood film and certain shortcuts have to be made, but . . ."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","6","2","4","28 October 2011"," Soderbergh makes something ordinary quite human.
","On paper, there was no reason for me to love this. A film with Julia Roberts in the title role, playing a loud and brass woman who takes on a court case, filled to the brim with standard moments of the underdog being beaten but refusing to give up and ultimately attaining victory. Somehow with everything going against it, the curveball of Steven Soderbergh in the director's chair got me to really appreciate something I was destined to loathe. Soderbergh is constantly challenging himself as a director and someone with his independent upbringing and sleak, digital style taking on such a plain-Jane underdog Oscar-fare story is probably the most diverse move in his career at this point. He brings a genuine humanity to it that doesn't exist in films like this, treating even the smallest throw-away characters the same way that the title character herself treated them, as if they mattered.<br/><br/>I've never seen a Julia Roberts performance that I've liked, but in this one she was charming, witty and an all-around joy to watch. I don't think she sold the emotional moments as well as she should have, but any moment with her standing up to the fat cats that she takes on is a real crowd-pleaser. The film shines brightest anytime she shares the screen with Albert Finney, the two of them having a love/hate working chemistry that does nothing but delight. Whether they're butting heads or reveling in each other's company, these two are a real treat to see together. Finney takes a stock character and turns him into someone flawed and genuinely human. Which is what Soderbergh does with this film as a whole, taking something relatively standard and somehow adding an authenticity to it that makes it work."

I'm surprised that Steven Soderbergh chose to direct this; it affords him no opportunities to get flashy. Roberts, on the other hand, gets to act all over the place, and it's nice to see her doing well in a role that requires more than just her sass and beauty (except for the final sequence with she and Albert Finney, which is artificial).

","The Nutshell: A feisty young woman, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), arrives at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney) through the forces of Fate. A twice divorced mother of three with no employable skills, she badgers, cajoles and pleads with Masry to give her a job. He reluctantly hires her as a file clerk. After finding medical records in real estate files, she becomes a de facto investigator to uncover a large utility company's cover-up concerning the contamination of a small town's water supply. As the stakes get higher, the uneducated and untrained Erin must use her considerable wits and genuine empathy to the affected townsfolk to stay not only ahead, but in the game.<br/><br/>As is apparent from the description, ERIN BROCKOVICH is film treading on the ground of earlier films. NORMA RAE has given us the gutsy, blue collar woman fighting the big corporation and THE VERDICT has shown us out-of-their-league lawyers having to face very daunting legal challenges. With the Harley-Davidson riding next door neighbor who volunteers (!) to watch her three kids, there's even a shade of MASK's sweet bikers thrown in to boot. When a film has so much past cinema history to compete in the audiences memory against, it has two choices: the minefield or paint-by-numbers. A writer and director could try to approach the story and film in a new way. They can avoid all the clichÃ©s and expectations, and go for something wholly original. But like in a minefield, one misstep and the film implodes from the twin anticipations from both the general audience and the cineastes lead to expect something more.<br/><br/>Or, they can capitulate to the idea that there are few new options in presenting real-life stories and make sure they keep the those audience pleasing moment coming at a steady rate. Steven Soderbergh and writer Susannah Grant go the later, and hence, paint-by-numbers route. This is the Soderbergh who gave us OUT OF SIGHT more than the one responsible for THE LIMEY. There is nothing wholly original here in either the film's story line or how it's presented. In fact, BROCKOVICH is such a studio star vehicle he doesn't employ the non-linear editing of those last two films that was becoming his forte.<br/><br/>Considering his last films and that his announced future projects are a remake of the piffle OCEAN'S 11 and a film version of the BBC TV show ""Traffic"" (about a drug enforcement chief finding out his daughter is a drug mule), Soderbergh seems to be following a one for the studio/one for himself approach to filmmaking. Too bad BROCKOVICH seems to be the studio pic he is doing before starting TRAFFIC. Allowed to work with a more realistic version of Erin (for comparison, pay close attention to the waitress early-on: it's the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo) and not having to deal with the considerations that go hand in hand with working with someone of Robert's stature it would have been interesting see how different (and very possibly better) this could have been.<br/><br/>This is a showy part and Roberts sinks her teeth into it. Roberts here will remind those who remember it of her breakthrough part in MYSTIC PIZZA - a film that had the bad luck of being a movie aimed at women before ""chick flicks"" became trendy recently. Definitely worth a rental. She is caustic, forceful and unpretentious. The only problem is Roberts brings so much baggage with her that she never makes the character seem unique. The part suffers from us never being surprised by a larger-than-life character because, well, it's Julia Roberts. It's a wonder why New Jersey Films didn't opt to try this as a low budget film showcasing an actress not as well known. Janet McTeer, who did a similar no-collar turn in TUMBLEWEEDS that prompted several critics to call hers THE performance of 1999, actually looks like the real Erin.<br/><br/>Beginning what will hopefully be the start of a interesting late middle-aged phase of his career, Finney consistently infuses his character with the quirks and a real human tics that are just as consistently missing from Roberts performance. Those who were unlucky enough to catch the pointless and boring SIMPATICO (was there ever a more egregious waste of a good title?) will be excused from thinking his turn as the race horse voucher in that turgid film was a warm-up for Masry. As a man who has worked hard and been careful to arrive where he is in life, he had a helluva lot more to lose than Brockovich who is acting out of necessity. Instead of sounding shrill and selfish, Finney manages a nice balancing act between grounding him enough to be solid and letting him let Erin befuddle him. Its a shame that if anyone remembers the film next winter when the next awards season starts, it will be for the wrong performance.<br/><br/>Universal left nothing to chance marketing BROCKOVICH, unfortunately for regular movie attendees. Every great zinger and most of the ""You tell'em, girl!"" moments are squandered in the trailers. For those who plunk down their $8.50 to discover what made Erin and her story worth telling find that the awfully nice folk in the Universal marketing department  have made sure there is nothing new to discover. It's not hard to like BROCKOVICH. It moves deftly between the expanding professional life of its title character and the repercussions it is having on her home life. It makes a lot of smart choices in what to play up and what events can be skimmed over. As long as its treated as the feel good, unchallenging mainstream studio star vehicle it was fashioned to be,  liking the film will come easy. Just don't expect anything deeper. As either a safe-bet outing at the multiplex or a rental half a year from now, ERIN BROCKOVICH is worth a look. But just remember Olympia Dukakis' retort to Cher in MOONSTRUCK - ""Playing it safe is the dumbest thing a woman like you can do."""

Not only is it groundbreaking, emotional, and rich with character and emotion, but it also feels genuine and real and Roberts, within every scene, never makes her role seem too small and/or too big. Albert Finney also provides a rather good performance, as well as some decent performances from the rest of the cast. Soderbergh's directing style may feel like a bit much at times, but for the most part, his harsh view on the truth surprisingly works in the film, and provides great clarity for both the viewer and the characters involved on screen. The film is written wonderfully, and it may not be the prettiest film to look at, but it does a good job at telling its stories without relying too harshly on camera work. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, but mostly, it's an entertaining journey of perseverance that demands to be seen. In the end, Erin Brockovich is a very good film that seeks the truth without shoving it too much down our throats. It's message is clear, and not weary, like many other films of its kind- not to mention it's well written and provides a fabulous performance from Roberts, that is much deserving of her Oscar win.

","If you had told me that, years after I last watched Erin Brockovich (directed by Steven Soderbergh) with my mother on VHS, that I would like it more than Soderbergh's Traffic I probably wouldn't have believed you. It's quite impressive that he released both films in 2000 which I didn't know until now.<br/><br/>Directly after the release of 2017's Wonder Woman (directed by Patty Jenkins) there was a general sentiment that women finally had a true female superhero movie, summed up for me by a friend of a friend's post on social media talking about what she saw as the key difference between male and female superheroes; that the former often ""saves the world"" because it's the right thing to do whereas the latter tends to ""save the world"" as a byproduct of maternalistic instincts. For her it implied an ethical inferiority that female superheroes needed an endangered child to fuel their heroism.<br/><br/>At the time I thought it was an over-exaggerated reading of the roles, since it's not exactly uncommon that male superheroes do what they do because of romantic forces driving their heroism. In hindsight I admit that this friend of a friend had a point.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich isn't the story of a superhero but it's perhaps the best example of a female hero doing what's right for its own sake and it goes even further than that because Erin Brockovich does the right thing at the direct expense of her maternalistic instincts. She doesn't fight for an entire community's justice because one of her kids also got sick or anything like that and due to her workload and efforts she risks alienating her children and even destroys a relationship with a man in the process of this story. I don't know of any other film like it, in that respect.<br/><br/>By contrast, Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman had no husband or children and so the fact that she ""saves the world"" for its own sake is made redundant because she has no maternal instinct to ignore and act in spite of.<br/><br/>While Erin Brockovich on its surface is a quintessential 'feminist film' it also turns the 'workaholic husband and alienated wife' trope in on itself, by placing a woman in the role of workaholic and a man in the role of unloved and alienated, which makes for some very interesting material. The film has us so engaged with Erin Brockovich's mission that we're not prepared for when her love interest doesn't understand the importance of her long work hours and why he feels hurt and alienated to the point of wanting to leave her.<br/><br/>This is something very few films try to convey, possibly because most films with this trope are geared towards a male audience and so we're just expected to side with the overworked husband. However, in this film Erin takes George (her love interest) with her to inform one of the sick townspeople that all their work has paid off and they will be receiving a payout of $5 million and before she does so, she tells him that this is what he helped her achieve by staying home and taking care of the kids all those lonely nights.<br/><br/>I wonder how many destroyed relationships would have remained intact if only the workoholic husband had shown his wife what she had helped to achieve by doing what needed to be done to allow him to work so much? People are much more content with sacrifice when they know it was for something, but why would anybody stick around if they think they suffered through alienation just so their husband could help their employers make more money?<br/><br/>As an aside, I really love the tone of this film. It captures a kind of blue-collar desperation and while the feminist overtones are very obvious, what truly resides at Erin Brockovich's core is a tale about classism and overcoming the forces of polite society, summed up perfectly for me when Erin Brockovich is told to wear longer skirts by the women in the office."

","Erin Brockovich is one of those films that without it's star, it wouldn't nearly be as good. In fact I would go as far as saying without Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich this film just doesn't work. Sure the character and Robert's portrayal can be a bit over dramatic at times, but Roberts presence is felt every time she graces the screen.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is widely known as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and probably the most popular female of the last 30 years. But she's no slum acting wise. She garnered her Oscar win for this role, and rightfully so. She has some all-time great scenes, and I mean all-time great scenes. She is great at giving us dramatic moments with a bit of comedy mixed in. Her numbers moment with Aaron Eckhart was hilarious and her 'presents' speech to the lawyers was just as entertaining. Albert Finney had great chemistry with Roberts and gave just as great of a performance, but that's typical for Finney.<br/><br/>With as much as the film focuses on Brockovich's devotion to giving her children the best possible life, I didn't particularly find the relationship fulfilling. I don't blame Eckhart for leaving for awhile either, sure she helped hundreds of people but her family was in need of a mother and she wasn't there for them. Whether or not that was put in the movie for dramatic purposes or not, who knows. There are quite a few really emotional moments that may or may not evoke tears.

","This movie was highly predictable at best. I've seen The Insider, A Civil Action, Lois Gibbs and the Love Canal, Silkwood, and after that, you know what to expect from this movie.<br/><br/>Basically Julia Roberts does a very convincing and talented performance as a harried mother of three, looking for work to support her family, and is unable to find any (she often has outbursts of swearing and such) until she meets a crabby lawyer and he reluctantly hires her. Soon she finds herself in the middle of a dangerous and disturbing case involving a gas company ditching chromium into the water supply of a neighborhood where the residents are suffering from cancer, chronic nosebleeds, all that toxic waste stuff. She also meets George, a biker who at first seems sleazy but turns out to be a nice guy.<br/><br/>Despite amazing acting jobs and good soundtrack, this is a tiring plot done time and time again, environmental paranoia as usual. Although it's based on true events it it highly dramatized and there are various dragged out parts of the movie that could do with some editing. It also really puts corporations in a bad light; how quickly people forget that if they want products and fuel, industry has to come before the planet sometimes, whether they like it or not.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich isn't bad, but it could do with some rethinking."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","0","13 September 2014"," Julia Roberts is hilarious and deep in ""Erin Brokovich.""
","The individuals who make a difference in society are the ones who's get big actors and actresses to play them in films. Erin Brokivch was one woman who made a great difference on our environment. Brockovich is an unemployed single mother, troubling to find a job. Erin also failed a lawsuit against a doctor in a car accident she was in. With no alternative, she successfully convinces her lawyer to give her a job in compensation for the loss. While no one understands her, with her trashy clothes and outgoing words, that soon changes when she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. What she discovers is that the company is trying to buy land that was contaminated by a deadly toxic waste that the company is illegally dumping and, in turn, poisoning the residents in the area. As she digs deeper, Erin finds herself leading point in a series of events that would involve her law-firm in one of the biggest lawsuits in American history. Julia Roberts does great acting by playing this warrior of a woman. She shows different sides of Brokovich while bringing her bravery to life. Julia Roberts is both hilarious and deep by showing what being a struggling person is like. The determination she endures in this role helps bring her characters personality to life. A great role! Steven Soderbergh does a fun job of directing by making this film both enjoyable and moving. He uses the best of his abilities in each shot and brings a true story back to life in different settings and environments. The whole look of this film is so realistic, from the cooperation's to her trashy houses, it's a true story brought to life remarkably. Much credit is given to Susannah Grant fro making a great story that touches something true. I would have liked the film to be a bit shorter and not focus so much on Erin Brokovich's life before the law case. Her character can get a bit irritating at times, but is remarkable for the most part. I also would have liked it to be much more dramatic to really show the gravity of the situation. ""Erin Brokovich"" is a bold true story that shows social bravery and corruption."

","Inevitably, EB will be compared to ""A Civil Action"" since it's based on true David v. Goliath stories; one (of several) is of a small law firm taking on a giant corporation over an issue of toxic waste -- and winning.  But the movie gives a little less than that in some ways and a great deal more in others.<br/><br/>The courtroom side and many of the legal machinations are less emphasized and of more prominence we see: (1) the battle for respect between the lawyer (Masry/Finney) and the single Mom (EB/Roberts), (2) the difficulties of being a poor single Mom (or her kids) (3) the struggle to balance the present needs of children against what performance in this job could do for their future, (4) if children are to be adequately cared for, who's the SOMEone who makes what sacrifice, (5) the battle between being one's self (even if unconventional) vs. what the corporate world demands, (6) the conflict between responsibility to one's family vs. responsibility for the plight of others, (7) how much should we get involved with fighting the system?<br/><br/>All worthwhile themes to explore.<br/><br/>For some of us, it might have been a better movie if the EB character was played by a star less prominent than Roberts.  While it's her best job and most complex role so far (in her view, mine, and many others), I never lost the feeling of watching JR, the star, play this part (at least not in the way I do when seeing Robert Duvall, or Daniel Day-Lewis, -- but that asks too much).  And I suspect that her millions of fans wouldn't want to lose that much sight of her.  So, fortunately, this movie -- showing so much of JR's T&A and laced with zingy repartee -- will draw in far more people and get millions more thinking about some really worthwhile issues than with any other actor in the EB role, no matter how good they might have been.<br/><br/>The film does make some into caricatures as short cuts (e.g., a suited female attorney) but no one expects accurate characterizations of _all_ dramatis persona (after all, even The Bard used buffoons for spice). Finney is superb opposite JR and the interplay between the two is great. All the supporting roles are well-cast and played -- JR's biker boyfriend is especially good.<br/><br/>While it's easy to see PG&E as an ""evil empire,"" I found myself thinking (1) isn't it fortunate we have such a well-developed legal system in the US? Similar things happen in Russia, or perhaps Indonesia or Mexico, e.g., and what recourse do people have?  And (2) will this movie inspire those of us who work for the PG&Es of this world to thread our way between the demands of our personal security, on the one hand (to not jeopardize our promotion, retirement, mortgages, paying for our kids' college, the profit of PG&E's shareholders, etc.) vs. doing right by the people our own PG&E might have injured on the other hand?<br/><br/>I hope so -- wouldn't that be great?"

","I went to see Erin Brockovich expecting another cheap, cheesy Hollywood flick, but was pleasantly surprised by both Roberts' and Finney's portrayals.  Similar to Melanie Griffith's character in Working Girl, Roberts' character Erin Brockovich comes from the wrong side of town and is looking to improve her employment opportunities without the benefit of a college degree.  The big difference is that she does not sell out by dressing to please the Company Man, and her goal is not to make money for the Company, but to make the big-pocketed corporations pay for destroying the lives and health of the little guys.  Hopefully this is a sign of change in the moral climate from the 80's to the 00's."

Her dedication and perseverance results in a landmark settlement.<br/><br/>There's something definitely UN-cinematic about this by the numbers bio, that at times almost seems like a TV movie of the week with big name stars. Yet the films story is not glossed over going into technical and educating detail on not only the contamination part, but most importantly on the legal process and the many 'strategies' needed to make this case a success.  In other words the filmmakers respect the subject and the viewer enough to give you a pretty clear view of what happened. <br/><br/>Has a nice balance between Brokovich's personal and professional life and shows the many obstacles and sacrifices she had to deal with. Filmed with a tinted lens that helps accentuate the dusty,desolate dessert environment and the 'earthiness' of it's citizens.  In fact the actors used to play the average, ordinary townsfolk, look so much like the real thing you hardly believe they are actors.<br/><br/>Roberts has always had the body type of Audrey Hepburns, which at times seems almost to slight.  Certainly not quite the right type for a tough talking, in your face, down home country girl like Brokovich.  Yet she is able to interpret and convey the 'essence' of her character so well that her physical liabilities soon become null.  In fact the glares she gives the opposing lawyers, or anyone else that represents the 'evil' utility company, are almost a treat in itself.<br/><br/>Finney also excels here playing completely against type.  Usually a very strong presence, here he a plays a frazzled, tired, sixty something lawyer just waiting for retirement.  He's pulled back to his fighting spirit by the tenacity of Roberts.<br/><br/>Basically it's ROCKY with high heels, and a short skirt.  It succeeds because it's based, believe it or not, on a true story that truly allows the viewer to believe  that one individual CAN make a difference.

It's essentially a vehicle for her, meaning it follows all the rules of a Julia Roberts movie: Julia Roberts will never wear the same outfit twice, Julia gets all the best lines, no other woman in the film will approach Julia Robert's level of attractiveness, etc. Nevertheless, this is an effectively told story with a good supporting cast, especially Aaron Eckhardt, who astounds me with his versatility. The plot is good but predictable, with a soul-less corporation with robotic attorneys having no chance against the plucky underdog. A feel-good movie for the masses."

","Julia Roberts needs to pick more movies like this one.  It is so much more fun to watch her in a role where (to use a cliche) she lights up the screen. Her better movies are ones where she has this brightness.  She helps this movie because of this.  With her in it, I completely forgot I was watching a true story of people doomed in life because of the carelessness of a large corporation.  The movie doesn't weigh itself down in this tragedy and therefore becomes much easier to watch."
"dave fitz","8","0","0","26 August 2000"," Roberts and Finney shine in inspiring true story
","Erin Brockovich, directed by Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape) is an inspiring true story. Julia Roberts stars as Erin Brockovich, a twice divorced mother of 3. She takes a job at a law office and is intrigued by a certain case. Her further investigation finds evidence of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company letting hexavalent chromium, a poisonous substance, into the local water supply in Hinkley, CA. Many residents of the town are getting sick and Julia convinces her boss (Albert Finney) to take on the case. All of their time and money is devoted to helping the people. It is reminiscent of A Civil Action,  starring John Travolta, another true story about big companies poisoning the water supply in Woburn, Massachusetts.<br/><br/>
Roberts is wonderful in this role. Her chemistry with Finney, who adores her even though they drive each other crazy, is terrific. Aaron Eckhart is good as George, the biker who lives next door and takes care of Erin's kids while she's out of town working the case. Roberts, not a large-breasted woman, provides a great advertisement for the Wonderbra in her low-cut outfits. Overall, a very entertaining and inspiring film with nothing objectionable, aside from Roberts' frequent use of the F-word."

","This is another movie for all the really big Julia Roberts fans. Hey, I like her as much as the next guy. She's easy on the eyes, and never plays dumb. Girls like her, guys like her, and so do parents. Seems like she hasn't got an enemy in the world. We love her. We root for her. We're on her side. We have to get our Julia fix three or four times every twelve months to get through our movie-watching year. Everything you could want in one of her pictures is played for all it's worth in Erin Brockovich.  It's the kind of movie that defines the term `star vehicle.' Not only is she the main character, but she's in every single scene, and everybody else is just there to make her look good. This is the way to market your star-power and rake it in at the box office... again.<br/><br/>It's based on a true story, if you haven't heard, and is about a plucky, twice divorced, mother of three, who dresses like a hooker, but manages to talk her way into a job working for a lawyer, played perfectly by Albert Finney. I guess she figures all women would dress slutty if they looked as good as she does. At work, she finds out there's more to one of his neglected pro bono cases than first thought, and they eventually file suit against a big California power company for poisoning the water in a rural community with hexevalent chromium and trying to get away with it. With no law degree or training, she works very hard and uses her `charms' (""They're called boobs, Ed."") and `people skills' to fight for what's right. She's bitchy to almost everybody (`Bite me, Krispy Kreme!') except the people of the town, to whom she's as sweet as can be. George, played admirably by Aaron Eckhart, is her only romantic interest (next door neighbor/babysitter/biker dude boyfriend) who gets the good and bad of both sides of her personality. The real Erin B. has a cameo role as a waitress.<br/><br/>There's talk about Julia being considered for another Academy Award nomination because of this movie. I don't know, that's a possibility, but I'd rather see her actually win an Oscar in a more complete film. I'm sure she has her pick of scripts. I'd like to someday see her in a gritty human drama where she doesn't care what she looks like and just acts her buns off. I think she can do it. The director, Steven Soderberg, concentrated so much on keeping the camera on her and the wardrobe, that something about the rest of it didn't hold up.  I wonder which is better, getting a 20 million dollar paycheck for one movie, or getting an Oscar. That's something most of us will never know. I did enjoy much of the movie, maybe a little more than when I saw her play herself in Notting Hill. I  never felt it was a waste of time or money. And I did get my Julia fix, and that's the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome."

If that had not happened, we would never have seen or known about this corporate misbehavior at every employee, management, officer level.<br/><br/>You can see that this was a cost driven operation which neglected to install costly liners in the hexavalent chromium containment ponds to safeguard life.

PG&E's officer team, public relations group and legal staff should have been banished to the unlined chromium ponds of Hinkley until this contaminated site had been decontaminated.<br/><br/>To its credit, PG&E attempted to keep the explosive lid on this scandalous issue by compensating the afflicted by buying their land and paying their medical bills.  To its discredit, it didn't rectify the contamination and tried to bury and shred evidence that it knew that it existed.<br/><br/>PG&E stated that this is a dramatization of an event which happened and that it regrets that it did happen.<br/><br/>As it is or was, PG&E was slapped on the hands for its behavior.<br/><br/>What if the legal system had ruled otherwise?

","For me, 2000 has been a dreary year for films so far. The best I've seen was ""Mission to Mars,"" which was good, but not great. Now, after enduring the demolishing, almost painful U-571, ERIN BROCKOVICH arrives like a desperately needed antidote for poison. Meaningfull, well-balanced motion pictures like these always remind me why I love the movies. ERIN BROCKOVICH is an intelligent, wonderfully-developed legal thriller, featuring a very strong lead performance by Julia Roberts and scene-stealing work from Albert Finney, and the tone provides both humor and poignancy that I haven't witnessed since AMERICAN BEAUTY, my #1 film of 1999.<br/><br/>    First of all, anyone who best associates Julia Roberts with crowd-pleasing, gentle romantic comedies will be absolutely shocked here. Brockovich isn't exactly the kind of character one would immediately refer to as ""likable""; she clearly displays a surly manner and profane vocabulary. However, despite this, there are plenty of opportunities to connect with her, and hardly a moment is wasted. Her dialouge with Ed Masry (Finney) sparkles with electricity, even though there's no hint of sexual attraction. Of course, since the characters and their situations are engaging as presented, there's no need for that element.<br/><br/>    One of the things I appreciated the most about ERIN BROCKOVICH was its sense of balance and realism. Often in films like these, when the main character is placed in an extraordinary situation, his/her home life is completely ignored, leaving the viewer wondering, ""Does this person have a life outside of this?"" Not here. One of the film's most affecting moments is Erin's realization that she missed the first word spoken by her infant child. Although her job is earning her much respect, she is away from her children for lengthy periods of time, and this puts a strain on the family relationship. Like many opportunities in life, her job is a double-edged sword, and the film never pulls any punches showing the various conflicts that arise. <br/><br/>    What makes ERIN BROCKOVICH unique is that it traverses a different path from what one would normally expect from a legal thriller. With one small exception, Erin is not followed or stalked by shadowy figures. She does not become the target of violence or threats from terrorists (although the possibility exists). Instead, the suspense here stems from the issue of whether a modern-day David can succeed in today's legal world against Goliath, or as a character in the film puts it, ""what's-his-name's whole family."" Finally, in what may be the most relieving aspect in the movie, there are no huge over-the-top speeches. No big courtroom scenes. No manipulative melodrama. People who love to rant about such problems can rest easy.<br/><br/>    This film really moves; it has zest, hilariously funny moments, unforced emotion, and a cliche-free narrative. After viewing both this and THE LIMEY, I now consider myself a fan of director Steven Soderbergh. I'm heading to my nearest Blockbuster to check out more of his movies. For everyone else, go see this movie, and don't worry about ACCESS HOLLYWOOD's hype about Julia Roberts' wardrobe-- it doesn't serve any real purpose."

I couldn't believe what I was reading. PG&E should have just passed on commenting on this movie...after all, the settlement's a done deal. But Smith had to remind us (as if we don't have a brain in our collective heads) that it 'primarily a vehicle for entertainment'. He goes on to make some extremely lame statements about how PG&E didn't move ""as quickly as it should have to rectify the problem"" but acted in good faith...yada yada yada. Jeez, cut your losses Gordie! Don't make it worse with such lame excuses!<br/><br/>That e-mail piqued my interest in the movie. Although rather formulaic and featuring a few too many cardboard characters and scenes, EB is a very enjoyable movie. There are some hilarious one-liners, particularly toward the end of the movie. Unlike some others, I didn't feel the movie was overlong or slowly paced. However, I would have liked to have seen more on the legal issues and less on how poor EB is struggling to keep her personal life together. As it was, the movie completely skips the entire settlement process. In one scene, Roberts and Finney are collectly signatures from plaintiffs to pursue a settlement and in the next, she's telling a woman that the court has awarded her family $5 million.<br/><br/>All in all though, definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>Oh, and for those of you who want to flame me for working for the big bad oppressive evil corporate empire, save your breath. PG&E is a massive corporation and I work very far from Hinkley (which, ironically, isn't even in the PG&E service area, though Kettleman Hills is). I currently work in the Vegetation Management Dept.

If this performance won't get her at least an Oscar nomination, there must be something seriously wrong in Hollywood. The rest of the cast was just as great, especially Aaron Eckhart as the biker neighbor and Albert Finney as the boss of the law form.

We could have been one of the families hurt by this company's negligence!  I had taped the Oprah Winfrey segment that featured Julia Roberts, the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry.  My husband and I watched it when we got home from the movie.  Erin and Ed Masry both said the movie was pretty true to the real story.  <br/><br/>I like how quirky life is, and how destiny works -- Erin, a single mom with 3 small children to raise, finds herself victim of a car accident that changes her life completely.  She goes to Ed Masry to represent her in a lawsuit, they lose the case and she is without anything -- no job, no money, wrecked car and desperate.  Indignant that Ed told her she would win no problem, she goes back and demands a job from him.  As you will find in the movie, Erin Brockovich is a hard woman to say ""no"" to.  I don't think anyone would have a chance if they tried.  Julia Roberts portrayed her character extremely well -- with heart, intense passion and conviction. <br/><br/>

I think she said) and her whole sense of who she was prior to going to work for Ed Masry revolved around her appearance.  Those clothes were very much the 80s, and she was comfortable enough with her body and sexuality to wear them.  The real Erin is a beautiful woman.  According to the real Erin, her skirts were even shorter than the ones Julia Roberts wore in the movie!<br/><br/>Go see it.  It might make you think twice about doing nothing next time you see someone being victimized.  Besides, like one of the other comments about this movie said -- you want to just see what is going to come out of her mouth next!  This movie made me want to meet the real Erin.  I love people who have no fear, and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe is right.  This is a gutsy movie about a gutsy woman!"

","""Based on a true story"" is a phrase that almost always guarantees a bad movie. Straight from the off there is going to be a problem. If the scriptwriter strays from the truth people will say ""That's not what happened"" - and also, let's face it, if the script ain't gonna stay with the truth then it ain't a ""True Story"". But if the scriptwriter does stay with the truth then the story is likely to be dull because life is mostly dull. That's why we have fiction. Fiction takes the essence of something vital and important and tells it in a gripping manner that reveals all the issues in a provocative and memorable way.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a brash woman - offensive, unpleasant, thoughtless and aggressive. Some people like her. Having the very likable Julia Roberts play her goes some way to softening her. Watching a movie about this unpleasant woman who made herself and her firm a lot of money by suing a power company is not my idea of high art nor pleasant entertainment. She won a big court case - big deal. That doesn't make her interesting. Not does it make her a hero.<br/><br/>I didn't like this film."

I think the viewers will pay more attention to the star than the character's accomplishments. With less than desired education and a lack of social graces; a brash, crude, obnoxious, but savvy young woman takes on a large utility company. Citizens of the small town of Hinkley are struggling with various maladies including cancer. The cause seems to be large amounts of chromium. Ms. Brockovich(Roberts) working as an assistant to a reluctant attorney(Albert Finney), not only becomes savior of the community, but martyr as well.<br/><br/>I found myself bored with this over hyped film. Roberts was nice to watch, but a score of other actresses could have played the part. Conchata Ferrell and David Brisbin also appear. And the real life Erin Brockovich plays the part of a waitress."

","If you were to believe the critics that raved about this movie, you'd think it's a masterpiece.  When in fact, only about the first half hour of it is worth seeing.  Julia Roberts delivers a fine performance at the beginning and then proceeds to become more insufferable and self-righteous as the movie progresses. How many times can the camera cut to a close up of her listening raptly and reacting almost tearfully every time someone else shows up with cancer? It's repetitive, boring and needless and it makes you hate her guts instead of liking her. Aaron Eckhart, the darling, is stuck once more in a thankless role but we should be grateful to Mr. Soderbergh for casting him. A good actor and adorable to the bone.  Everything else is totally fake in this film.  And the critics who must be tired of seeing so much s**t, think this is better than average Hollywood crap. It isn't.

","Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies. Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch. And I don't mean that literally. Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments. But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie. There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way. If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots. But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore. Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film. Don't get me wrong. It's entertaining. But it's formulaic. A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot. The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm. Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car. This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way. They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man. Hip hip hooray! I didn't ruin the movie for you. It's not a surprise. This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on. Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality. Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre. With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone. Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe. Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot. And she won't take none of your lip, neither."

","In all the years that Frank Capra gave his populist films, none of his heroes were women. Back then it was the traditional roles with the men doing the heavy lifting and the women in support as wives and mothers so the men could slay the dragons.<br/><br/>Frank Capra might never have given us a populist heroine, but I think he would have loved Erin Brockovich as much as I did. Although Albert Finney is the lawyer who took on the power Pacific Gas&Electric for the residents of Hinkley, California, the legwork (and what a pair of legs) was done by Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The true story of former beauty queen Erin Brockovich is one of the best roles for a female player in the past ten years and Julia Roberts was so right for the part. Beauty is a start for this part, but Ms. Roberts is also a single mother raising three kids who literally browbeats her way into a job with a law firm headed by Albert Finney that lost a case where she was a plaintiff. <br/><br/>People all her life, and probably the men she was involved with never took her seriously because of her beauty. As Roberts got deeper and deeper into the case involving toxic chromium poisoning from a plant in Hinkley, she felt a lot more self worth and very much empowered due to the good work she was involved in. As she explains to current boyfriend Aaron Eckhardt in my favorite scene in the film, when she goes to Hinkley on any her firm's business, it's not a beauty queen that the people there are seeing, but a savior of sorts.<br/><br/>Roberts puts her heart and soul in both her work and as mother. Some of her best scenes are her domestic ones with her three kids. She's not without weaknesses, she does have a tendency to snap judgments and she's not the most diplomatic of people at times. But a good heart and a good work ethic cover a multitude of sins.<br/><br/>Unlike so many Oscar winning films, Erin Brockovich got a March release in 2000 not a release late in the year to keep the film fresh in Academy voters minds. Obviously no one thought of this film as Oscar caliber. Yet word of mouth spread about the film and it got several nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Albert Finney and others. And it was a winner for Julia Roberts for Best Actress of 2000. <br/><br/>Erin Brockovich was one of my favorite films for the new century and I think it will please every one who sees it."

","These kinds of films are beginning to form a genre unto themselves. ""Marie,"" ""Silkwood,"" ""Afterburn,"" ""Guerin,"" ""Norma Rae"", and ""Brokovich."" Elements, too, in other successful heart warmers like ""Mask"" and ""Class Action"".<br/><br/>The basic idea is to pit a lower-class David against a multi billion-dollar Goliath and have the underdog win. (Maybe I should have included ""Rocky"" in that list.) Well, Erin Brokovich is the real thing, a trailer-park floozy with messy hair, a quick vulgar mouth, and boobs that look like two helium balloons about to pop up out of her push-up bra. No wonder her female coworkers hate her. Not just her looks though. She's a human dynamo at work. She collects something like 640 signed affidavits over a week and the stuffy partners at her law firm gawk and ask how she did it. ""I went out and distributed sexual favors,"" she says. ""Six hundred and forty BJs in five days. I'm tired."" (The camera lingers on her triumphant expression so we can share her joy in humiliating her superiors.) It's very slickly done. Her life is filled with travails. I mean, out of work, three fatherless children, rear ended by some rich dope in a Mercedes. Fortunately there's a guy.<br/><br/>Therein is an illustration of a slight problem. These folks look real enough on the surface but they're actually ringers. Erin, despite her cutting sarcasm, doesn't really speak much like a redneck and neither do the other people of her class. Nobody smokes. (Might drive away the intended audience.) The guy she falls in with is introduced as some kind of biker/doper wearing ragged jeans, a faded bandanna wrapped around his head, a beard, and a pony tale -- revving up his chopper after he moves in next door. But it's all a front. The bandanna is soon dropped and we get to know him for the quiet, quietly reassuring, supportive, child-loving Mensch that he truly is. When the trappings of bikerhood are gone -- and we never see the bike again -- he sits there in silence while Erin pours out her woes and, what with his neat beard, his reading glasses and his serenity and his slight, tolerant smile, he is more a Jewish psychotherapist than a biker.<br/><br/>Of course he has to pack up and leave her at some point otherwise the movie would be absent one clichÃ©. They're both sad about the split, and it doesn't last that long, but, as he explains it, he never sees her anymore because she's always working late. He does everything but say, ""You're already married -- to your job."" There's never a moment's doubt about who is good and who is bad in a movie like this. Erin is authentic and good, like the earth before it was poisoned by PG&E. The fraudulent biker is also good. We know it right away, although she doesn't. Erin's boss, Finney, is good too, although a little gruff at times, kind of like Lou Grant. The victims of the lethal chromium isotope are all good too. None of them is in it for the money. The new partners that Finney acquires to help him cover his expenses are on the right side but they're pretentious. They dress in expensive tailored clothing and are aghast when Erin swears. The poor woman who represents the new partners looks as if she took baths in a mild solution of hydrochloric acid. There is no life either in her or on her. Her hair is pulled back severely, she wears a suit and tie, and her makeup gives her a cadaverous glow.<br/><br/>It's not a thoughtful film by any measure, but it does get the job done. Goliath is vanquished by David and we applaud as the end credits roll. The performances are adequate -- no better than that, but no worse either. Sometimes the film borrows entire modules from other successful movies. The resentment of the antagonistic informant who answers the door when the investigator knocks. (""Verdict,"" ""All the President's Men"".) The heroine caught up in the cause that threatens her love life. (""Silkwood,"" ""Norma Rae."") The script makes fun of a jealous fat woman. (""Kiss my ***, Krispy Kreme."") It's that kind of movie."

They dressed the heroine like a hooker with a foul mouth. We see a lot of Julia Robert's skin throughout the picture. And that's were the film diverts. It's hard to forget that we're seeing Julia Roberts instead the real Erin Brockovich. Even her children are not likable characters. She outshines them all. There's also a lack of suspense. Except for one incident, her life of safety is never threatened. Kind of odd if you're going against such a huge corporation.<br/><br/>If the movie's purpose is to entertain, it succeeds.

"zetes","6","2","5","8 January 2001"," Hard to recommend...
","I think Steven Soderbergh has grown to be a very great director, one of the best living Americans in the business. I loved Out of Sight, and The Limey was really great, too. Traffic was also quite good. Now, only a couple of nights after seeing Traffic in the theater, I got to watch Erin Brockovich. Unfortunately, it was not great. I didn't really expect all that much while watching. I had heard from numerous people that Soderbergh did it just so he could make movies that he preferred to make. I don't think that that attitude is bad. If a good director has to sell out a little in order to make a great film, I say go ahead.<br/><br/>Now Erin Brockovich isn't anywhere near a complete failure. There's a lot to like about the film. Its main problem is its extremely formulaic story (I thought Traffic had a formulaic story, too, but not on this level). Also, the fact that the action becomes repetitive is no help. At first, Brockovich's shtick (i.e., someone p***es her off (when it shouldn't, usually), so she becomes so angry at them that they eventually back off; this happens again and again and again in the film) is entertaining, albeit, not very believable (I did not feel too sorry when she is fired), but after the fifth time, the act becomes frustrating. This is especially true with the final scene, where Brockovich gets paid for a job well done. Tell me that you didn't see the joke coming from the second Albert Finney enters the room.<br/><br/>So let us talk about acting. First, Aaron Eckhart's gentle Harley dude: I like Eckhart in Neal LaBute's films, In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, but I don't know if he works here. Maybe it's not him in particular, but the script. His character is kind of boring. He's not well developed, and he is never interesting. In fact, I think Brockovich's whole domestic situation gets kind of boring as the narrative moves more towards the lawsuit (it begins quite compellingly). The scenes with Eckhart and the Brockovich children are almost all very cliche. None ring true, at least for me. The meet-cute between Brockovich and George (Eckhart) is quite irritating.<br/><br/>Albert Finney: he is quite good in a pretty poorly written role. His character is not complex, but Finney manages to bring energy into the role. I liked him, and if this film is considered for some Oscars, which I doubt it will receive (except for maybe Roberts' role), Finney probably deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Now for Julia Roberts. To speak the truth, I think Pretty Woman is the only other movie I've ever seen her in. I try to avoid her movies. She is so unbelievably beautiful that it is difficult to take her acting seriously at times. And herein lies the difficulty of my rating her performance. I could never take my eyes off of her (and it was not her breasts at all, as others have claimed that they were a great distraction, but rather her face, her lips, her eyes especially). I think Roberts did a pretty good job in the quieter moments of the film. The best scene of the film is when George tells Erin about her youngest child's first words, spoken while she was working. There, I can see that Roberts can act. Also, when she is lying to her children about having eaten near the beginning of the film. She's quite good there, too. And there are plenty of very good scenes where Brockovich forms relationships with her clients, and this becomes quite touching. The problem elsewhere is that Brockovich is written over the top. First off, she is written as if she were a Saint, or at least a Pope, since she seems to be infallible. We as the audience are lead to identify with her at every point, even when she is obviously being rude or cruel for no reason, or just when she behaves stupidly. This is being too kind to Erin Brockovich as a real person, and thus it becomes difficult to take her character or the film seriously. When she would flip out, I would begin to hate her. Her attitude ceases being funny very quickly and just becomes tiring. But I say, although my own heart is with Bjork (Dancer in the Dark), just give Roberts the Best Actress Oscar. Then she will have won one, and she won't have to do serious movies anymore. This film was, after all, produced basically to get Julia Roberts and Oscar.<br/><br/>Soderbergh does three things worth note in this Hollywood: he uses plenty of jump cuts, by which an American audience would normally be disturbed. They are mild, and perhaps they serve to teach the regular moviegoing population about their purpose. Also, it is filmed entirely with a handheld camera. This is good for the same reason that jump cuts are good. And, most thankfully, the musical score is very underplayed, which is rare in dramas nowadays. There is a very good scene near the end when Brockovich tells a sick woman how much money she has won in the lawsuit. Usually, this scene would have been overwhelmed with musical score. But here, there is no music. That is wonderful. It is not missed at all. The only thing we have to suffer through is a terrible Cheryl Crow pop song attached to the end credits, almost certainly shoved in by execs.<br/><br/>This film I give a 6/10. Decent, though it could have been more. It did not offend my sensibilities for the most part."

","Although filmed sixteen years ago, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) was and is the modern day ""badass"" persona that every woman secretly has dwelling inside of her. No filter for her language or sense of professional style, Erin is headstrong, determined, self-motivated, and frankly could not care less about the opinions of others. Based on a true story, I would give the film 3.5 stars and describe it as a drama comedy. Set in Los Angles and Hickley, California, Erin serves as both an inspiration and real life story of the American dream, motivating the viewers that with passion and hard work, anything can be achieved. Erin's cry for financial desperation and her unique sense of humor is portrayed in the opening scene of the film where she is applying to a medical job that she clearly has no experience in, but this shows how much Erin is unafraid of rejection and humiliation. Erin's strong confidence stems from her ability to have raised three children without the support of a man, and it is her confidence that allows her to poke her nose where most people wouldn't dare to. Erin's life is shown as a plummeting spiral that one can do nothing but empathize with or simply laugh at- Erin has no income, three young children, no money in her bank account, a neck brace, and an attitude that has got her nothing but trouble. Simple activities like feeding her children or even just being in the house are over intensified because Erin is so dissatisfied with her life. Erin finally lands a job in Ed Masry's (Albert Finney) office, which is the first positive change in her soon to be completely different life. She seems out of place and disliked, but that doesn't stop her from earning her place of respect. Erin's relationship with Masry turns from disgust and hatred to a fulfilling, meaningful friendship while also being business partners. <br/><br/>Erin's stance for her originality and blunt difference from the other personas in the movie is what makes her such a fascinating protagonist. Even when Masry asks her to rethink her wardrobe, Erin shoots back at him with ""maybe you should rethink your ties."" A love interest occurs, like in all Hollywood dramas, but her boldness aids her in shooting down the bearded biker neighbor by the name of George (Aaron Eckhart) that would like to be more than just neighbors, even though love is the last thing on Erin's mind. Her bluntness is what makes her such an attention grabber and has people listen to what she has to say even though she has no formal professional schooling and acts far from how an employee would act in a law firm. <br/><br/>Erin stumbles upon the records of Donna Jensen, who lives in Hinkley, and is perplexed as to why Donna's medical records are included in her real estate files. Finding this odd and unsettling, Erin takes this task into her own hands. Erin's personal search for Donna turns into something more than just completing her regular reception job, it becomes a passionate obsession that Erin is determined to get to the bottom of. Erin sets out to determine the significance and relevance of the medical records that were correlated with other real estate files. It's not obvious what exactly ignited the passion and concern in Erin to set out on her own to investigate these random real estate files, but this curiosity begins a long journey to attempt to provide justice to the residence of a small town in Hinkley, California. With the help of her wit and feminine beauty, Erin is able to dig through the water records of a notorious company by the name of PG & E, which may have something to do with the health of the residences surrounding the town of Hickley.<br/><br/>As Erin's care for the families of Hickley grows deeper, her own personal life becomes more significant, fulfilling, and mature. Erin develops a deep and true care for the lives and well being of these people, no longer for a need of financial desperation, but for a need to do good unto others that have been unluckily touched by the illegal doings of big money companies. Erin gets to know the residences of Hickley on a far personal level and induces pathos in the audience. The film is not a full five star rating because although it's interesting it is just not a film that I would re-watch years from now or highly recommend to a friend. Although, it does accurately depict and raise awareness to the true events that happened in Hickley, there were many parts that caused me to be disengaged. Overall, the film is much more dramatic than the average documentary but allows the audience to be inspired by the determination of Erin Brockovich to do what's right while also improving her life."
"bazantovaa","9","1","2","9 May 2016"," Very detailed review, contains many spoilers!
","Erin Brockovich is a movie based on real life affair that takes time in the 90' s, but the occurrence of the movie can still happen today.. After watching first few minutes of the movie, you don't really know how can this character, Erin, be one of the biggest icons in civil rights. Erin is a struggling single mother of three little kids, one of them is only a few months old. She tries to get a job, but she's declined after the doctor who needs an assistant finds out about. her background. On the way back home from the interview, she is involved in a car accident where she gets hurt and both her and the other car are seriously damaged. She tries to sue the other person involved, because they made the mistake, but she loses the case. She starts working for a lawyer who lost the case and this job is what changes her life forever. She's not a lawyer, she doesn't have a college degree, but she's naturally intelligent which makes her very popular with the clients.. While cleaning the storage room in the office, Erin finds an odd combination of documents and that's where the whole main part of the movie starts. She discovers that a huge American company is selling people dangerous water that seriously affects health and can lead to deadly illnesses. By physical contact, honesty, and forwardness, Erin gets the whole neighborhood to fight against the company. Her boss, an old average lawyer is doing the case with her, because Erin isn't real lawyer, she doesn't know the whole trial process and all the legal necessities. Later on, when the issue gets bigger and the amount of money they could get gets significantly higher, he gives the case to a much more skilled lawyer, who has more finances and is from bigger company. The new lawyer and his partner don't really give the people in the damaged neighborhood much chance and they don't have as much commitment as Erin, who's deeply hurt by losing the case to the better lawyer. The whole case almost falls apart, the affected people don't like the treatment they are getting from the new lawyers nor from the water company that's trying to get them quiet by buying their properties. At the last minute, Erin and her boss are able to get the people back on their side by being honest and fair to them and in the end, they make the impossible possible and win. The case was settled for US$333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in US history. The main reason why Erin and all the neighbors won was because the water company couldn't refute the evidence of knowing about the issue. The company knew for years and made their old employees burn and hide all the incriminating documents. Erin got her hands on them because of a retired employee, whose brother died of cancer after living in the contaminated neighborhood for several years. The water company went bankrupt shortly after their lost because more issues from different areas came to the surface. The company's violation against civil right was so severe that there wasn't any way out for them. Personally, I think that this movie amazingly shows how normal Erin is. Erin's nobody special, low class single mother and twice divorced. The movie is really great at combining her personal life, work and showing her character. One thing that I liked the most is that she did not change. She never liked lawyers before she worked in a law firm, she didn't like them when she was working there as a normal secretary and she still did not like them after winning the case and being a partner. She stays herself even after winning a huge civil rights case. The neighborhood that had dangerous water was not informed about the chromium in it because the water company was manipulating them. They wanted to buy their houses, but for very low price, and their lectures on chromium were a huge propaganda. If anybody in the area got an analysis of the water and found chromium, they would think it's the good kind they were told about, not the extremely dangerous one and wouldn't try to get more into the topic. The doctors the company provided were bribed to say that the chromium does not have an affect on the illnesses the neighbors kept getting. They knew how dangerous this type of chromium was and they kept it a secret, violating a civil right of public awareness and basically a censorship. This movie definitely proves its point and they did a great job at remaking a real story about legal issue, while still being funny and very interesting. What started as every other romantic comedy changed into a movie where you have to think so you don't get lost in the information. It also touches several civil rights topics, from public information to gender equality. The second one is mainly presented by Erin and her personal life, in which she has to go through many struggles to prove that she matters and has a voice."

Well, you might have heard that some books are to be chewed and some to be digested... Likewise, this one has to be digested! Why? The Story! A single handed mom with a weakness for troublesome romantic relations (to speak of the neighbor biker) who has the best of convictions and a passion to fight for justice. But, this movie is akin to what is reading between the lines in a book.Yes, the movie contains a deeper meaning and our understanding of progress, which is not always right for the best of both worlds. For what maybe progress for the developed may turn out to be a warrant to death for the developing. The so portrayed neighbourhood is a victim to the company's chemicals for decades while little knowing about it. And when they come to terms with the chemicals, the situation is grim and the result: every thinkable cancer. Apply the analogy to countries and you will identify what I was referring to earlier. Erin is hence no short of a messiah to represent as many as 634 plaintiffs and grant them justice. Someone for being what many would called on the lines of a beauty queen, man she has brains. So, this one was an inspirational story to me. And can only be justified with an 8!"

","Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a struggling unemployed single mother of three. She can't even win a petty lawsuit against a doctor for a car accident. So she browbeats her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to give her a job. When she starts poking into a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It turns into much more of a case of toxic waste dumping and one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts delivers a big performance in a traditional under-dog movie. This is definitely well-made by master director Steven Soderbergh. Nothing is left on the table, and it helps to have great actors all around like the great Albert Finney.<br/><br/>The only small problem I had. There is a holier than thou attitude that Erin Brockovich hasn't earned yet in the movie. After all she brings frivolous lawsuits, she needs to show more of her struggles. I think there was a story where she had to steal medicine for her kids. That would be a great insight into her struggles to start the movie with. That would buy credit for all the stuff that follows."
"hall895","7","1","2","19 October 2012"," Unique heroine, uplifting tale
","Erin Brockovich. Starring Julia Roberts. Co-starring Julia Roberts's cleavage. OK that's a bit of a stretch. But not by much. And it begins to tell you something about the woman Roberts plays. Erin Brockovich is not the bashful type. Loud, profane and quick to flaunt her, uh, assets. Erin's quite a package. And Roberts brings that package to the screen wonderfully. The excellent performance of the film's star helps gloss over some of the film's failings. There's a great story to work with here but you get the sense that story could have been told a little better. But Roberts keeps the film moving along best she can, whenever it threatens to veer well off course she's there to pull it together. The end result is a film which is perhaps not outstanding but certainly enjoyable and well worth seeing.<br/><br/>So who is Erin Brockovich anyway? She's an unemployed single mother facing a desperate struggle to make ends meet. She talks her way into a job as a file clerk in a law office. Her boisterous personality and skimpy attire do not make her very popular amongst her female co-workers. And she continues to exasperate her boss, lawyer Ed Masry, who has no idea what to do with her. What he'd probably like to do is get rid of her. But when Erin starts digging into a real estate case which oddly has a slew of medical records tied to it things change. It becomes pretty clear that a massive cover-up has taken place, a huge utility company hiding the fact they have contaminated a town's water supply. Ed realizes Erin has hit on something. And now the two of them are going to form a very unlikely team. Erin hurtling forward at the speed of light and Ed trying to rein her in. Together they can hope to accomplish something quite remarkable, winning justice for a town full of innocent people whose lives have been destroyed.<br/><br/>This film belongs to Julia Roberts all the way. She's on the screen for virtually every second of the film's running time. But in Albert Finney, who plays Ed Masry, Roberts has a very worthy foil. Erin Brockovich is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, full of determination to do what is right and win justice. Ed Masry is older, wearier, worn-down and inclined to do what is easiest. The actors playing the roles, Roberts and Finney, bring the contrast between the characters to life beautifully. It is in their interplay that the film has most of its best moments.<br/><br/>There are times the movie struggles to move its story along. It sometimes gets bogged down in legal procedure. It brings in characters it doesn't make the best use of, most notably George, a biker played by Aaron Eckhart. Erin and George have a romantic relationship of sorts but the movie never spends enough time with the couple for us to really care how that part of the story plays itself out. The movie also glosses over some key parts of the real-life story, including Erin's own illnesses she suffered with during her investigation into the maladies of the townspeople. That was a chance for some dramatic tension which went begging. And there are some aspects of the case which are never made sufficiently clear. For instance there's one woman in the town who Erin works on tirelessly to get her to sign on to the lawsuit against the utility company. This woman is apparently the key to the whole thing. Why is she so important? The movie never begins to tell us. This is by no means the most dramatic of legal thrillers. There are no great twists and turns, no shadowy villains lurking in the corners. But what the movie might lack in dramatic zest it makes up for in heart. Roberts and Finney give tremendous performances and they carry the film along to a satisfying end. Maybe Erin Brockovich, the movie, falls somewhat short of greatness. But Erin Brockovich, the woman, did great things and she makes for a great movie character. And in this case that's enough to make this movie a success."

","I think that what made the success of this film was a combination of two elements:<br/><br/>-an engaging story (at least for the 'masses'), one where an 'underdog' defeats higher powers, out of dedication, lots of courage, lots of humanity, and ignoring threats and personal private life to achieve them. Oh, and that story is real; <br/><br/>-the fact that some 'stars' of the system of stars were in this, and one of them (Roberts) took it as a personal project, something she specifically chose to do;<br/><br/>Starting with these two premises, anything could be done and the film would sell. In this ride, we have Soderbergh, who is a great director. But he doesn't show. The directing is mechanical. In fact every aspect of the film is mechanical, lighting, editing, narrative dynamics. Last week i went to see his new, personal, and very good ""Che"". Maybe that was partially paid for or supported by money raised here. If that's true, this film was worth it. Julia Roberts is OK here, but the part is born, cut, and tailored to her. Her range is small and here she is at the perfect center of it. I think it's intelligent of her to choose what she can do.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is a film about lives that transcend the ordinary curse, and make interesting things, but itself is one in a million. It's ordinary, it goes with the flow, and it will be forgotten. In fact it is practically now, despite the awards and the success in its moment.<br/><br/>My opinion: 2/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","The film is based on a real case and is about real people so to that ends it is obviously simple in structure, and nagging away as you watch it is the fact that the ending is never in doubt, it ""is"" all too predictable. However, what made Erin Brockovich the success it was is that the title character is not only interesting but also, importantly, intriguing. A foul mouthed hard bitten, twice divorced mother of three has to fight her corner just to get an honest days pay. It's a fabulous story backed up by a simply incredible performance from Julia Roberts. Here Roberts has let her hair down, puts on a push up bra and a short skirt, she is clearly enjoying the freedom of the role, and the results are real effective.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that working alongside Albert Finney helped Roberts no ends, but it is her show all the way, and she alone masks over what really is an ordinary film, there is nothing we haven't seen before here, it's just a more modern take on the good versus evil corporate company scenario. It's steadily directed by Steven Soderbergh, emotional scenes are not overstretched to treacle point, and all in all it's good solid story telling. Repeat viewings prove to dilute the uplift factor of the finale, but Roberts' performance certainly holds firm for evermore.<br/><br/>8/10 for the film, 10/10 for Roberts' ballsy show. If only we could have had more of these performances from her."

","Yeah yeah, my review's title is a nice summary about this movie. I wasn't completely sure before i watched it but, then it surprised me a lot, it was a great surprise and i am happy that i watched it.<br/><br/>First of all i have to remark the fabulous performance that Julia Roberts gave us in this movie....This Erin Brockovich had a stubborn personality and was really hot-blooded, she was committed to her job and she didn't quit even in the most difficult situations, and Julia had to be to the height of the character, a really complex one, and she really could handle the character and made it hers, i actually believed Julia could have been Erin. She wasn't a lawyer, luckily, she wasn't in that business of deceitment and betrayal, she was pure and always spoke with the truth, and she cared about her customers, not as people who gave you their many but as people that have a story behind them, she cared about the emotional context, in other words, she treated them as they deserved for the only fact that they are people, not for the money they can or can't give you, and that's great of Erin, that's the most important.<br/><br/>Of course this is an actual case, and i have to say that finally justice rules, this movie should encourage everybody else to see that it isn't impossible to fight against something that is believed to be more powerful than us.<br/><br/>Here it is really good portrayed the situation of justice in the world, the most powerful people gets the better part just because they have good lawyers , and in some cases good legions of lawyers. That can disencourage people, because what is a single person to do against a huge organization?? And besides, judges aren't correct with their decisions, this case was a happy exception to that luckily. Let's pray for all the cases to have an ending like this................<br/><br/>I am forgetting about the guy who played Erin's employer, he did a remarkable job too, and helped a lot to the character of Roberts...he was, the typical lawyer but Erin's goodwill helped to change him.........<br/><br/>Resuming, i love this movie as a nearly perfect portrayal of our decadent legal system, and the message of hope it gives us when you see it isn't impossible to win saying the truth."

","The film is really interesting and touching a situation created by a company without considering the problems it may bring about with its wrong productive process. When a company does what this one did, it is causing a high social cost sometimes with irreversible effects on man health and the environment. Water was contaminated by hexavalent chromium and already affected several people living closely to the factory, my question here is: how long would it take to decontaminate that water? what are the expenses necessary to solve these problems? We live today but the world of tomorrow belongs to our grandsons and granddaughters, are we to leave egoistically a polluted environment to them? The film obviously focused more on the work carried out by an intelligent woman, probably nice one because Julia Roberts was very beautiful playing this role in the film, whose name is Erin Brockovich. The insurance company where Erin works or worked should be feeling happy to have a worker like her. She was able to seriously open this case and demand the company for its deeds. <br/><br/>My congratulations to the director Steven Soderbergh for including an important issue for today and tomorrow, i.e. pollution, in this film, and also to Julia Roberts and Albert Finney for their excellent acting."

","""Erin Brockovich"" is based on the true story of a single mother of three who successfully brought a civil action against a corporate firm guilty of poisoning the water of a small-town community.  Despite a formulaic plot and gathering of near-stereotypical supporting characters, the film succeeds through a good mix of comedy and drama.<br/><br/>The film opens with Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) unsuccessfully trying to get a job at a hospital before breaking her neck in a car accident.  After failing to get compensation, she bullies her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) into taking her on as an assistant at his firm.  Whilst there, she discover some alarming evidence about a gas and electrics company, poisoned water and the illness-stricken residents the backwater village...<br/><br/>Technically, the film works using early Nineties songs to liven up moments where Erin is investigating and enhances the mundane, everyday feel of the picture.  The film is also well-edited, making alot of the scientific and legal jargon simple and digestible.  It is never unclear to the attentive viewer exactly what is going on and why.<br/><br/>Performances are excellent.  Julia Roberts deservedly won an Oscar for her winning portrayal of Erin: she's sarcastic, no-nonsense but not unsympathetic. There are times when she plays character as a little too nasty to the point where she nearly loses audience empathy. She's balanced out by Albert Finney as her harassed but honest boss who's not afraid to put her in her place from time to time.  Aaron Eckhardt turns in a fine performance as Erin's loyal but neglected biker boyfriend.  The interaction between these three characters forms the movie's core.<br/><br/>It is in the script and story that ""Erin Brockovich"" very nearly falls down. Beyond the three central characters, no character is given any degree of depth and come very close to stereotyping on several occasions.  The people Erin helps out are honest but helpless victims; the corporation she's up against composed of and aided by greedy or inhuman opportunists and the lawyers who eventually help Erin and Ed are played as patronising and cynical.  It is an interesting but unambiguous stock of characters.<br/><br/>There are currently allegations surfacing that the real Erin and Ed actually duped the Hinkley residents and the water was not as poisonous as was claimed in the case.  This has created an ambiguity around Erin Brockovich that would have been interesting to explore in the movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you enjoy a good people-power flick, or want an example of some fine acting and drama, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this."

Inhabitants start to get the most terrible infections, parts of their organs rotting away, cancer, etc....and eventually a painful death.<br/><br/>Based on a true story this is simply a perfect movie : it's Hollywood at its best. Everything is 'right on the money' : story, acting, direction, photography,... : there isn't a false note in the whole movie.  They even do not botch up the ending, a rarity in recent Hollywood flicks.<br/><br/>Roberts has her best part ever: she is just brilliant as the supersexy loudmouthed and abrasive but with a heart of gold single mother.

","This story was truly inspiring. I see the real Erin Brokovich hosting a show on Lifetime about women like herself these days. Anywho, the movie was a tad bit too long, but was a good film in itself. I liked the personal aspects of her family going sour as her aspirations and goals move up. That's often very true when a woman is trying to make something of herself with a family in tow. The story was just amazing. I thought Roberts was good, but all she did was cuss a lot, which doesn't take great acting because we all want to sometime. I think the character just allowed Roberts to speak what she would probably say if she wasn't who she was, if that makes any sense. Finney was marvelous and an engaging character who's scared to take on such a big challenge, but rises to the occasion. He kept it very real to me by not all of a sudden becoming all into the case. He took his time warming up to the idea that it could go somewhere. The cut and paste effect was a little lost on me and slowed down the already lengthy movie, but it was altogether good. A great message about not letting people take advantage of you and that there are some who are willing to fight for others. The fact that it's true makes the movie much stronger in its presentation."

","Whatta film, I can't believe anybody could have played this part better than Julia Roberts,she was so vibrant and refreshing, you couldn't take your eyes of her.

But more importantly is the film itself, playing a woman who came from such a disfuncional existance, to becoming such a well respected woman has to be something to admire, her sheer determination and guts to stand up to anyone who questioned what she thought was right is how she became successfull in her own beliefs, and none of this was done for self gratification, but for the rights of the people, and to give her daughter the life she didn't have, good on her"
"Silverzero","Null","1","2","21 February 2003"," Slickly directed and nicely performed, though it is a bit one-sided.
","WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a well done and quite enjoyable movie, even if it does blatantly shout at the screen `give me an Oscar'. It's directed by Steven Soderbergh, who won an Oscar that same year for Traffic. So if you like his cool, hip style of directing then you'll probably like this film.<br/><br/>
Julia Roberts takes on the lead role and I'll give the devil its due, she gives a very convincing performance. But then again she was well overdue for one. Her performances in her usual run-of-the-mill rom-coms were giving me a strong sense of déjà vu. I still think that she's far from being the best actress of all time but this film has brought her one step closer. Albert Finney easily fits into the role of Erin's jolly despondent boss and seems to be enjoying it, for what it's worth. Newcomer Aaron Eckhart takes on a rather unrealistic role but does a good job of it. <br/><br/>I'll admit I don't like films like The Parallax View and Arlington Road where the bad guys win but nonetheless, `Erin Brockovich' could have done with a bit of opposition from the company she was sueing.<br/><br/>
The film isn't exactly complex and lacks emotional power but it's still a brilliant film that holds your attention and has a very satisfying ending."

","Erin Brockovich is a modern day David and Goliath movie, starring Julia Roberts, her cleavage, and 101 streetwalker outfits.  After Erin's bumbling small time lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), loses her personal injury lawsuit, she is back to her cockroaches, macaroni and cheese, and the unemployment lines.  Erin manipulates the lawyer into a job at his law practice.  The foulmouthed mother of three proves that a major corporation, Pacific Gas and Electric, is poisoning the small town of Hinkley's water supply.  After a lot of hard work, no family life, and insulting everyone in her path, she wins the victims 330 million dollars and herself a hefty two million dollar bonus. It was very similar to A Civil Action, also based on a true story, starring John Travolta.  Travolta portrayed a tort lawyer representing eight families whose children died from leukemia after two large corporations dumped chemicals into the water supply in Woburn, Massachusetts. Erin Brockovich is a movie that does not rely on special effects, violence, or car chases to hold our interest.  The movie is not as much about the courtroom battle with PG&E as it is with the battles that Erin was facing in everyday life, a single uneducated working class mother raising three kids on her own in a very uncooperative world.  It is a movie that inspires Americans to believe in the system again.  Erin Brockovich teaches us, that we can all make a difference in this world.  All we have to do is try."
"hartig","Null","1","2","31 March 2000"," It's a shame the filmmakers were not completely honest
","""Erin Brockovich"" certainly earns its keep as an entertaining - if somewhat vulgar - retelling of a David vs. Goliath legal story.  I'm sure everybody's familiar enough with the plot that I'll skip the summary.<br/><br/>My problem with this film is that it lacks the appropriate epilogue.  The Environmental Protection Agency issued a report on Chromium 6 that completely and unequivocally debunks the notion that the chemical was responsible for ANY of those illnesses in Hinkley.  Chromium 6 has certainly been linked to 2 types of cancer - but *zero* of the Hinkley plaintiffs suffered from these types of cancer.  Unfortunately, the report was issued after the $333 million settlement between the citizens and PG&E.<br/><br/>So what this movie basically exhibits is a greedy bunch of ersatz victims, led by Erin ""The world crapped on my doorstep"" Brockovich, who succeeds in putting $130 million into the coffers of a law firm, $2 million into her own pockets, and an average of only $300,000 in the pockets of the supposed victims.  All of this under faulty scientific and medical conclusions.<br/><br/>PG&E and their operating activities were not at all to blame for whatever ailments afflicted the citizens of Hinkley, CA.  But what does that matter? PG&E has billions of dollars and the citizens were poor and sick.<br/><br/>But, in this viewer's opinion, each and every one of those people are only modern day thieves - particularly Brockovich and Masry.<br/><br/>""Erin Brockovich"" succeeds only in celebrating a modern day culture where people deflect the responsibility for their own lives to other parties (particularly ones with deep pockets).  It's a plague of our society that this film not only displays, but champions.<br/><br/>2 out of 10 for sheer dishonesty."

This woman is portrayed to be a dedicated mother but when she's dressed as a tart with bad language when there's the slightest chance she won't be getting what she wants: that's not the greatest nor most endearing role model.

"Deckard-16","10","1","2","17 March 2000"," What will next 4 films to get Best Picture nominations next year?
","The first nominees for next year's Oscars in the Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Original or Adapted Screenplay and Best Costume Design categories have already been secured with the arrival of ""Erin Brockovich"". Julia Roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in U.S. history. She would've stole every scene if it wasn't for her co-star Albert Finney who matches her for every point/counterpoint. He plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight. Although her box office says otherwise I've always thought Roberts was way overrated as a movie star. Now I'm a believer. She is smart, sassy, foul-mouthed, fiery, sensitive, funny and, of course, very sexy. It is one of best performances I've ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy from ""Bull Durham"" in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal. (Of course Annie Savoy is purely fictional whereas Erin Brockovich is not.) I sense that her character may appeal more to men than women (her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film). The reviews I've read have been excellent, but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well. Finney's work is more nuanced than Roberts' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions. Aaron Eckhardt deserves mention too as Roberts' good guy biker boyfriend. These performances are made possible by a superb script from Susannah Grant. Her fact-based tale of a small (hick) town poisoned by a giant utility has ""Rocky""-like satisfactions in it and they feel all earned. The fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings. Director Steven Soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated ""Out Of Sight"". This is an ""adult"" movie in the very best sense of that term. ""Erin Brockovich"" is definitely a big Hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it. It also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly. It is the first Best Picture nominee for next year."

","As you can tell, I am not the world's biggest Julia Roberts fan. I don't hate her guts, or anything, but I generally don't see movies she's in unless they got very good reviews.<br/><br/>When I first saw trailers for this movie, I was like, oh please. Not only was it a Julia Roberts Vehicle, but there was the extra insult of having it be a big novelty that she played a sorta white-trashy, tough-talking, skanky dressing character. Oh, what a departure! Then I read lots of great reviews from reviewers I trusted, and thought again.<br/><br/>I don't think she gives an Oscar-worthy performance, but she did just fine in the role. Erin Brokovich is a single mother who may not have the best social skills, or fashion sense, but her heart is in the right place and she refuses to tolerate injustice when she sees it. Plus, I know how it feels to be in such a b*tchy mood that you can't help wanting to use the f-word in every sentence. She has mouths to feed at home, so she gets a job at a small law firm, and stumbles upon a situation where a large corporation has made a huge mistake, and is being weaselly trying to get out of it.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is based on a true story and the main character based on a real life person really helps. Part of what turned me off in the first place was the fact that I thought the filmmakers made Julia Robert's character dress really trampy just to get attention. Now, I do think they over-do it in parts-no intelligent woman walks around in public with 90% of their bra exposed. Dressing sexy is one thing, but in real life, women know better than to wear a top that is so hideously mismatched with a bra that you like like you were dressed by a blind person. <br/><br/>Also, the main character is not perfect- though her cursing is entertaining, she goes too far in some cases. We all have felt like using 4 -letter words to some of the people we word with to their face, but adults don't do this on a regular basis-or if they do, they are looking for a new job very quickly. Aaron Eckhardt is great in the role of the supportive, yet put-upon biker boyfirend. So nice to see him play a character that is likeable!<br/><br/>A great movie, very entertaining, and actually makes you think that sometimes in life, hard work is rewarded and people get what they deserve-very satisfying."
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","1","2","28 August 2000"," This is one of those films that makes up for its total lack of originality with some fairly respectable acting and a few good cleavage shots.
","What was up with the low cut shirts, anyway? Was there some specific reason why Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) had her push-up bra showing above the top of her low cut shirt in every single scene she was in? In my opinion, if they are going to do something like that in a film, they better have a real good reason for it, and in this particular film, they didn't.<br/><br/>
Julia Roberts plays Erin Brockovich in the true story about a woman who took interest in a particular case she came across at the law office where she worked and ended up as the initiating force behind a tremendous lawsuit. She delivered a fairly good performance, but her personality was badly manipulated for the film. Do you really think that she was able to memorize some 650 different phone numbers, names, afflictions, relatives, etc? I don't think so. Fred freakin' Tate wouldn't even be able to do that. Besides that, her excessively loud streams of profanity grew tiring very quickly.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining film to watch about the corruptions of a huge corporation being thrown back in its face, but the story doesn't have much strength. Despite its good intentions, it gives the illusion that financial gain is the answer if you and your entire family have become gravely ill. In the movie, the settlement to the lawsuit is seen as victory, and no more attention is paid to the sicknesses of the families. Besides that, I find it hard to believe that so many people in the same small town could have gotten that sick for so many years and no one would have even noticed. You'd think there would be some sort of pattern showing up at the local hospitals at least. <br/><br/>Overall, Erin Brockovich is an entertaining enough movie. It doesn't break any new ground or tell anything original, but this is a type of film that is always entertaining to watch. If you're into legal thrillers, watch The Rainmaker. If you like The Rainmaker, watch The Firm. If you like The Firm, watch A Civil Action. And if you like A Civil Action and you just need more more more, watch Erin Brockovich, and watch for the real Erin Brockovich as a waitress early in the film."

","ERIN BROCKOVICH- no introduction needed here, I guess, the enormous publicity campaign has done its job. As most stories which are based 'on a true story', this one deals with a poor woman, who stays herself and is able to do good work and become very rich at the same time. Julia Roberts is finally starring in a film, where the story isn't about being a love-interest or chasing one. And surprisingly she is well cast and doing a good job. She is emotional and aggressive when she ought to be, with the right amount of it, not overdoing, or lacking conviction. Also Albert Finney as the lawyer is at his best. The only thing in this film that raises question marks is Erin Broccoli's boyfriend; what is he doing there, and why does he stick around (he is her housekeeper and nanny)? And perhaps this film is a bit longish to some taste. There is not much what can be said about the film, it has everything one expects from it, a bit of laughter, a few tears, a happy ending.

In addition, the trailer made her look like she'd be playing a stereotype - a one-dimensional talk-to-my-hand-while-you-look-at-my-breasts type of character.  But, most importantly, I was certain that there was no way, under the constant and unalterable laws that hold our universe together, that I would ever be able to sit through a film that associates itself with that accursed ""Everyday is a winding road"" song.<br/><br/>I guess I can't always be right.<br/><br/>I went to see Erin Brockovich because several people whose opinions I value promised me that it was actually good.  Even then, I was skeptical, but I found this to be an extraordinary film.  Far from being one-dimensional, Erin is an interesting, funny, and intelligent character and one of the best written female characters to appear in a movie in a long time.

She has got time to shine in this one. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing, because in this film it is not. Roberts is very charming and actually convincing as Erin Brockovich. The story lacks any depth, but it is still told in a satisfactory way by Steven Soderbergh. It's not his best film, but it's certainly very entertaining if about twenty minutes too long. I have to say, though, as much as I like Julia Roberts in this film, that Albert Finney was truly magnificent as her boss -- truly a great performance. (6/10)"
"Philby-3","Null","1","2","22 April 2000"," True Fairy Tale from Toxic Tort Country
","Lightweight legal drama with a feel-good ending enlivened by a sparkling script and good chemistry between the leads. I say legal drama, though the courtroom scenes are brief, because it is largely an account of the real Ms Brockovich's legwork (in more than one sense) that brought about the largest toxic tort settlement to date. The victims were the unlucky inhabitants of a small Mojave desert town, Hinkley, California, many of whom were seriously affected by the release into their environment of a poisonous industrial chemical, hexavalent chromium. The villain was Pacific Gas and Electric, the power utility. Erin Brockovich, a single mother with three young children who had bullied Ed Masry, the aging accident lawyer who had just lost her road accident compensation case, into giving her a paralegal job, found a file relating to a Hinkley land purchase by P G &E, which had some unusual features, and started digging. She rounded up over 600 claimants, stacks of evidence (including the proverbial smoking gun), and achieved a remarkable reasonably prompt result - $333 million in damages from a $28 billion dollar corporation.<br/><br/>The fictional account of this engaging story naturally goes out of its way to tug on the heartstrings so we get lots of Ms B's private life  financial worries, job-hunting blues, childcare problems and the ups and downs of her relationship with George, a sweet-natured biker. The real interest in the story is in two things. One, her remarkable people skills ranging from flashing her ample cleavage to get co-operation from a records clerk to establishing real empathy with the abused victims of P G &E, a skill few lawyers possess. (Like a lot of good lawyers she does possess an excellent memory.) The second is her relationship with Ed, the old crash and bash man, who she irritates into winning the case of his life, long after it seemed forensic glory had passed him by. Ed is not driven by lust (he's a bit old for that) but is shamed into action, and after a while he realizes that Erin has got what it takes, even though he treats her shabbily on occasion.<br/><br/>
Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed are a curious combination. It was odd to cast Finney, an English actor with a strong regional accent, as a Southern Californian ambulance-chaser with maybe a middle eastern background. Julia Roberts makes the transition from romantic comedy heroine to a more character-driven role with ease and she and Finney bounce off each other very satisfactorily without Finney seeming to want to lay a hand on her, despite her provocative dress sense. Stephen Soderbergh, who dealt with kinky Southern sex in `Sex, Lies and Videotape', has made a pretty orthodox piece here, but it is well done and many of the minor characters are well filled out. Aaron Eckhart is very appealing, if a little too good to be true, as George. One of the real judges in the case repeats his role on film and Erin herself appears briefly as a waitress in a fast food outlet who has no trouble remembering complicated orders.<br/><br/>Poor old P G & E. really get it in the neck. Although they are exposed as having attempted early on to defeat the Hinkley inhabitants' legal rights by a tactical confession of their sins, the subsequent conduct of the matter by their representatives indicates a very stupid bunch indeed  not even smart enough to be called evil (compare `Silkwood'). Unlike John Travolta in `Class Action' who had Robert Duvall as his Big Corporate nemesis, Erin and Ed lacked a worthy opponent. This rather reduces the dramatic tension, but the real-life Erin and Ed obviously know they are on to a good thing  they are now doing their best to drive up power bills even further by suing P G&E over another toxic tort elsewhere in California."

That is why I guess I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>True, there were those classic one-liners and most of the times likable Julia Roberts was there. However, I felt that aside from Julia Roberts' character Erin, all the other characters seem to be cast aside, and honestly, extremely wimpy and instantly dislikable. And, even Julia, at times, was getting pretty irritating with her mood swings and self-pity fits. The head lawyer, Ed Masry, seems like a very unlikely person to have been a lawyer, being the big softie that he is in the movie. The movie was also a little long, with many long stretches where essentially, nothing happens, or it is a repetition of other events.<br/><br/>Having gotten that out of my system, there were of course some redeeming qualities in the movie. Julia Roberts' character is strong, fun and likable most of the times. Her lines when she is telling off her boss or enemies are very funny and quite enjoyable! The essential feel-good feeling the audience gets of having won against the big bad corporation was definitely felt in the crowd and that is a definite plus.

","The idea that this film is exceptional or that Julia Roberts' performance is exceptional is just another Hollywood snow job. A very surfacey look at the story of the woman in the movie's title. To separate his work from appearing like that of, say, Penny Marshall, Soderbergh seems to insert long, boring parts into his movie so that people will see him as an auteur. ""Ain't he deep?!"" You can load a movie up with all the film school smoke you want, but I've watched enough Nick at Nite to spot bad '70's TV when I see it and let me tell you, kiddies, in Erin Brockovich I see it! Also, a very lousy job of balancing the love part of the story with the big bad corporate part. If Julia Roberts wins the Oscar for this I hope she forgoes thanking her agent, her eighth grade drama teacher and God and actually thanks the one thing that got her nominated for this role to begin with...her push-up bra. And if for some reason she's unable to attend, maybe her bra can accept the award on her behalf."

","What was this?  Nominated for best picture, best screenplay, Julia Roberts won the academy for her portrayal of Brockovich?  I don't think so.  See, this is where the wonderful world of entertainment and myself have a little differ of opinion when it comes to good movies.  THIS was not one of them.<br/><br/>I will never understand why celebrities are paid these big bucks just because they can memorize some lines.  You throw in some movie previews that you think the public should see in order to waste seven, eight dollars, and suddenly, you have a money making picture all because you had the brains to hire one of the biggest (and overrated) actors in the show business.<br/><br/>Why did everybody, and when I say 'everybody' I mean the academy awards association, think that this picture was deserving to be nominated for an oscar?  I suppose I should have seen this one coming considering that they gave the lousy 'American Beauty' the gold statue the year before. <br/><br/>
I think that I am about the only person who doesn't like Roberts.  I don't like the roles she picks, her acting ability isn't exactly golden, and I hate how everyone thinks that she is the number one actress around nowadays. Will somebody explain to me why she was exactly nominated for the best actress award?  You got her running around like a hooker for two+ hours.  I thought that we had already covered the whole hooker thing in 'Pretty Woman.'  She goes prancing around the town in heels that she can barely stand up in.  And the thing that made this story look bad was that no matter how tight the money was and whenever times got tough, we never see Brockovich wear the same outfit twice.  Here she is looking all over for a job and complaining that she's got three kids to feed but just how poor was she if her wonderful wardrobe of mini skirts and tank tops never came to a repeat?  There went the movie.  <br/><br/>I can't really comment on the rest of the cast because there wasn't any! Yeah, sure Masry was a good size part but scene after scene I had to put up with looking at Roberts' face.  <br/><br/>Brockovich's snappy come backs and rude one liners began to run dry during the first twenty minutes of the film.  I'll admit that some evoked a slight laughter from me but not a whole lot.  I got a little tired of hearing f___ this and f___ that, but what can you do?  <br/><br/>I'm just wondering that if another actress had portrayed Erin Brockovich, would this movie have gotten the same amount of publicity?  The story line, even though it was based on a true story, was very bland.  All you have here is a non-educated mother of three who is trying to support her family when she comes along a case of water contamination and decides to bring it to the surface.  She wins, the water drinkers get a pay off, she gets a pay off and we're all really happy.  The movie ended too quick and then I was forced to listen to that dumb song by Sheryl Crow.  <br/><br/>Just some last comments:  The problem the movie crew had here was that they tried to make a movie out of something that didn't need to be made.  There wasn't enough information given about the case and it more or less focussed on Roberts playing a half dressed lawyer-type.  The lack of music was another thing that annoyed me.  How could they possibly make a soundtrack? And somebody want to tell me what they spent their $51 million budget on? The most creative thing that this movie had was the real E.B. in a cameo named 'Julia.'  Oh, how do they come up with these things!?  Final words: This movie was given too much credit all because it had the overrated Julia Roberts in the lead/only role.  Critics never know what they're talking about and I should never listen to the academy again.  Don't watch this!"

"stamper","8","2","9","14 December 2000"," Julia Roberts' best performance ever? Sorry, NO!
","Many people have said this film contains Julia Roberts' best screen performance ever and I must say I do not agree with that. I do not agree, because it kind of insinuates Julia has been doing crap out there on the big screen for years and that definitely is not true. What is true though is that Julia Roberts is an actress that brings really every character to the screen and the viewer as realistic possible and therefore she is always believable. The only difference with this film however is, that this is not a lighthearted comedy like Notting Hill, but a real life drama that calls for artistic acting instead of just an easy' romantic / comedy performance. That is also the reason I feel that this movie might actually get Roberts an Oscar nomination for best actress, because characters like this fall better with the critics than the characters she played in Notting Hill, My best Friend's Wedding or The Runaway Bride, for the critics seem to think that being able to be believable is not as much of an achievement, but rather having depth and strength and character is. That Oscar nomination I mentioned, could it be endangered though by the amounts of profanity in this picture? I hope not and I do not believe so, for if the critics would also react on profanity, where would Pulp Fiction have gotten? That profanity is one thing I liked too, I mean never have I seen such an adorable b..ch' on the screen. I mean you just have to love Brokovich (Roberts), for she is so true and right out and says whatever she wants, whenever she wants to whoever is in the room in her, it wouldn't matter if it were the Pope or the President of the USA. Oscar nomination, that's all I'm talking about, well will she win it? NO! And why not? Because she is too big a star, look at Carrey and Willis. Well what about Hanks you say. Well Hanks is a different story, he is known to star in films that require acting and he got famous with those acting roles, like in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump and so on. Plus his comedy's never were as kitschy' as Roberts'. But as long as Meryl Streep or Kate Winslet are not out there, to get the Oscar Roberts' has a good chance. On and on I go about Roberts' great performance (again), but what about the other great performance I saw, coming from Albert Finney, who plays Roberts' boss. He was great too, but you know it was not all his achievement, just as Roberts' greatness was not all her achievement. The two just were unbeatable as a screen couple' and if there were prices for best on screen duo's they'd win them all, but since there is no such award I know (almost) for sure that Finney will win the Oscar. A few other Oscars the film will get or be nominated for are Best screenplay, Best Director and Best film (first one is a winner, the others are losers). But you know that's only how I think it will be and my opinion is not a good one to believe, since I thought Shakespeare in Love sucked big time and it got so many awards. But I am pretty optimistic, for I have not seen such a good artistic' movie this whole year. I mean it may not be fast paced or so, but it holds your attention and it is not too dramatic despite the fact that it is based on a true event which took place not even so many years ago and that is what I really liked also about this film. You really have to see this if you like these kinds of movies, whether you like Roberts or not, for her part is unlike anything she has ever played before cause I have never seen Pretty Woman' (sorry Mrs. Roberts) yell and curse like this before. No more nice girl, now it is tough, single, 3 children raising woman who knows what she wants and also how to get it so I suggest we stop calling Mrs. Roberts Pretty Woman', for there is so much more to her to all of you who didn't notice that after seeing The Pelican Brief, Sleeping with the Enemy, Flatliners, Conspiracy Theory, Mary Reilly or Stepmom. If this one can't convince you of Julia Roberts' acting quality a gun to your head couldn't do it!<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"oOoBarracuda","5","1","3","17 May 2016"," Erin Brockovich
","As much as I try, and as much as I appreciate the movies she's in and the roles she takes on, I am simply not a fan of Julia Roberts'. Steven Soderbergh's 2002 feature Erin Brockovich was another good role for the star Roberts, but just one I couldn't sink my teeth into. Along with Roberts, Albert Finney also stars as the unlikely duo that brings down a multi-million dollar water corporation. The story of a single mother of three who will stop at nothing to provide for her kids and the vulnerable people she encounters is one that has settled into the hearts of audiences years after its release.<br/><br/>Single mother, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is unemployed and desperate for a job. When she unsuccessfully pursues an insurance claim in which she was hit, she stumbles upon the notion that she could start working at the legal office that was chosen to represent her. Thankfully for Erin, she encounters Ed Masry, an overworked kind-hearted lawyer that gives Erin a chance to work for his law office. Ostracized from the office for her revealing wardrobe, Erin must learn the ropes of the law office herself, having no legal background or experience. Throughout her research, Erin stumbles upon many inconsistencies in retail deeds and health records. Once she is granted permission from Ed to further investigate the inconsistencies, Erin uncovers that powerful California water company, PG&E have been dumping toxic chemicals into the ground water sources in Hinkley California. When more and more residents are diagnosed with illnesses corresponding with the effects of the chemical being dumped into the water source, Erin brings the issues to Ed's attention and the two voraciously go after the water company, resulting in the largest class-action lawsuits in American history, at the time. <br/><br/>Nothing too innovative happens throughout the film, Erin Brockovich, and it doesn't have to, the story is compelling enough to drive the issue for the audience. I wish I could have seen this movie before the water crisis in Flint, Michigan; I think I have been desensitized to the thought that financial gain could encourage a corporation to poison a water supply. Regardless, this film portrays a nice David v. Goliath where we get to see an endearing couple of Davids beat the monster."
"paul2001sw-1","6","1","3","19 February 2010"," Caring too much
","My favourite film about a corporate lawsuit is Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter', which features a shifty, self-hating lawyer and a tragedy where it's very unclear whether anyone is to blame, and even if they are, whether anything is to gain by holding them to account. Stephen Soderbergh's 'Erin Brockovich' is a rather different story, in which Erin (played by Julia Roberts) brings a multi-million dollar corporation to its knees through a simple combination of loving her kids, wearing short skirts, swearing a lot and above all else, by caring too much. The latter is really her trump card - whenever there's a dispute about any point in the case, the corporate lawyers are always wrong and Erin is right because she cares. The film is based on a true story, and maybe this is actually how it happened, but it certainly doesn't provide any moral ambiguity to interest the viewer. In true American style, the happy ending is that all the good characters make several million dollars."

","Erin Brockovich is Julia Roberts best performance.I think Steven Soderberge directed this movie well. The writing is good. Julia Roberts won an Oscar for her performance as Erin Brockovich. The first time I saw Julia Roberts was Flatliners, then I saw her in Hook and I finally saw her in Pretty Woman. Her first film she did was Mystic Pizza. I have never seen it. I think Albert Finney did a good job. I like the cinematography. This is one of Steven Soderberge's best films. I hope Julia Roberts keeps getting better roles. She is one of the best actresses.

It's well-scripted, well-captured, well-acted (especially by Julia Roberts, but I'm sure I'm not the first to say so), well-staged, and well-decorated. There's a level of realism here not seen in a lot of movies, and I suppose that's something that gives the movie credit. But the truth is there's not much here.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is marvelously natural, and Albert Finney complements her well, though, truth be told, he only has one scene where his acting can really show off. There are touching moments between Brockovich and her kids and between Brockovich and George, her main squeeze during the movie. Marg Helgenberger gives a nice turn as a depressingly disparate victim of the company that Brockovich is attacking. But it all adds up do a genuinely moving but formulaic film that seems to add nothing new to the genre but one more movie.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to lift the movie up because of how brave its main character is and what she stands for. It's a worthy cause, to be sure, but is it cause to label Erin Brockovich as a great movie? I don't think so. It's good, I enjoyed it, but it's nothing special."

She achieved so much during this time when she was dealing with this situation. There was only one thing that I didn't like about this movie and that was there was so much swearing in it.

","OK, so Julia Roberts is not the best actress, and, admittedly, this probably doesn't contain the best acting she has pulled off in her career, but I think she does good enough in this movie. She plays a nearly totally independent woman who fights for a cause, that she feels is right, which costs her a lot of time away from her three kids. The plot is pretty good, and it develops at a good pace, keeping you interested in it for the duration of the film. The actors do okay jobs in portraying their respective characters, though I found a few of the minor characters to be played by fairly inexperienced actors, who didn't perform terribly well. The child-actors performed pretty good, though. The characters are well-written, but since it's based on a true story, I don't know how much of it had to be made up. The humor in the movie is quite well-placed and often very funny. The character that Julia plays is a symbol of independent women everywhere; she's intelligent, she has female intuition and she knows how to use her attractiveness to get what she wants. Granted, a part of the movie concentrates a lot on Julia's curves, or, more specifically, her breasts. Personally I think that as long as it's in context, which it pretty much always is here, it doesn't really matter; also, if the real Erin acted like that, shouldn't the movie have the fake one acting like that too? Overall, a pretty good authentic drama. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys dramas, independent women and authentic movies."

It seemed like this year's Oscars were more of a popularity contest than accolades for true accomplishment. Ellen Burstyn was no doubt robbed of her Best Leading Actress Oscar for Requiem for a Dream. The other 2 actresses who I felt won premature, undeserved Oscars were Gwyneth Paltrow in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love and Helen Hunt in 1997 for As Good as It Gets. Don't get me wrong: all decent performances but all in all pretty ordinary. Who was most deserving of the Best Actress Academy Award in the past decade? Without a doubt, Jessica Lange for 1994's Blue Sky, followed closely by Susan Sarandon in 1995 for Dead Man Walking and Kathy Bates in 1990 for Misery. Don't want to get off the subject, but might as well point out how I felt about Best Actor. Russell Crowe---Best Actor? I thought I'd puke. Kevin Spacey, Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, and Anthony Hopkins---all undeserving. Most deserving??? That would be the brilliant Nicolas Cage for 1995's Leaving Las Vegas, followed closely by Al Pacino for 1992's Scent of a Woman, Roberto Benigni for 1998's Life is Beautiful [which I feel sour that it didn't win Best Picture], and Geoffrey Rush for 1996's Shine."

I'm sure this story would have made a nice 30 minute documentary on PBS, however, this did NOT make for an entertaining movie. Sure Julia was abrasive and carried her torch relentlessly, however this movie was simply dull.  There were no unexpected twists of plot, no unforgettable scenes, and the few moments of levity were forced in a cut and paste sort of way.  I'll spare everyone a plot summary because how much can one say about another tired, overdone story that centers around the common man standing up against the mighty corporate giant.  At least The Rainmaker had some excitement and didn't plod along in a boring, linear fashion like E. Brockovich did.  Frankly I don't know why Julia won an award for this role.

Everything about her, as a middle-aged, twice-divorced mother of three who fears her life may be slowly going down the drain, is beautifully performed for the screen.<br/><br/>An excellent cast and wonderful--if obscenity-laced--screenplay make up for a storyline which is not too entirely original (small lawyer firm vs. big business).

","Erin Brockovitch is a real person, who quite by ""accident"" (car) ends up retaining a lawyer who apparently does her no good. When she can't find a job to pay her bills, and care for her 3 children by two different former husbands, she goes back to the lawyer and refuses to leave until he gives her a job. Simply because she is very smart, and very inquisitive, she and her firm end up representing 600+ families in a hexavalent chromium pollution case.<br/><br/>(A detail that seemed sloppy editing or filming - we see early in the film that her ""accident"" is caused by the other car running a red light and broadsiding her. When she is testifying in court she says she was pulling out and he rounded a corner out of nowhere. The description did not fit what we saw.)<br/><br/>Anyway, Julia Roberts does her usual superior job as Erin, and Albert Finney as the lawyer. The real Erin even has a small part, playing the waitress in an early scene. It is a good story, and a well-done film, but ultimately all I can rate it is a very strong 7 of 10. No where near the impact of recent films like ""Music of the Heart"" or ""The Insider"", both based on true stories. Maybe because Erin was treated all the way through as a very ""over the top"" character with a dirty vocabulary, and that got tiresome.<br/><br/>
I saw the DVD version of this movie. To me, the most interesting extra was the interview which included the real Erin and the real lawyer. Also some interesting facts on the location and shooting.

I think it might have been more affecting to have the real Erin Brockovich play the part.<br/><br/>I like Albert Finney, but he seemed less than convincing in this. In a scene where he is standing on a stage before a large audience trying to convince them to sign on to a deal that was probably in their best interests, but that many did not take to, he was not convincing to me.

Julia Roberts' performance was...fine. Nothing to write home to mom about, and even more, why in the things of all that is Holy did she win an Oscar for this? Was the Academy saying this is the best she can do? I doubt that. Anyone could have done this film, Big whoop. A nice film, but nothing more than that."

","Erin Brockovich was an entertaining movie that rewards viewers with the standard hollywood theme of down and out little guy (in this case, Julia Roberts) triumphing over powerful big evil guy (a big powerful polluting corporation).<br/><br/>Julia Roberts was very colorful, her language was too which was a bit of a turn off for me, and Albert Finney's performance was excellent. Because this was supposedly to be a true story based on the TRUE story of the real Erin Brockovich I deducted a couple of points points for deceiving the audiences with the incredible number of factual inaccuracies."
"rtheerman","5","1","6","31 July 2001"," Roberts poorly cast, but does her best with T.V. material
","I must have missed something here.  I saw this movie when it was called ""A Civil Action."" But wait, let's add a new twist, let's use somebody's t.v. movie of the week true story, alter some facts therein, and make it the next Julia Roberts movie vehicle.  I don't understand movie reviews that say ""Julia has done it again.  She has played against type and succeeded."" Wait one hot minute here.  If I'm not mistaken, she really has only played Julia Roberts in every movie.  Sure she squints her face, makes a goofy chuckle, walks as if she's prettier than she actually is, and sheds a tear for good measure.  I've seen this in every movie she's been in.  Possibly she could have won a lifetime achievement award, but at such a young age?  The Oscar should stand for an individual performance, not for slack in the rope that needed to be tightened for past efforts.  I think roles like Sigourney Weaver's in Aliens, for which she was nominated and lost far exceed the range of drama than in this picture.  Erin seemed beaten down by her own life.  But that alone is not deserving of a reward.  The character seemed like a bitch to be honest.  Let's see, no manners, an awful attire, a foul mouth, an ignorant mother-who leaves their kids with a biker she just met-no matter how desperate?, and money driven.  There are many people in tough situations who don't have the best of resources.  Maybe if the movie centered on why SHE merits such an opportunity to rise above the mess instead of manipulating those around her by promising things she cannot/will not produce, it might have been compelling.  If it wasn't for the money won at the end, the movie would not have been made.  And that is the saddest truth we learn from it.  It is not compelling to watch someone who gets $20 million a movie console someone trying to get money because they got cancer from a corporate giant.  The paradox is too evident.  The film has a moment where they argue about the necessity for a trial, because it will make the bad guys admit what they did was wrong in court.  But we never actually see this.  Only a settlement was actually reached.  This kills any moral drive the movie has.  So what is the movie trying to focus on?  The trial, her life, the outcome, the money.  Who knows?  Julia is a fine actress, I have enjoyed her since Mystic Pizza, thru Flatliners, and Pretty Woman.  It's great that she does entertaining funny ""date movies."" But she did not deserve the Academy Award."

","Erin Brockovich offers a classic tale of the little guy (in this case, gal) going up against the system. What makes this story somewhat more appealing than the usual fairytale is that it is based loosely on a true story about a real woman. The script is linear, with much slapstick-type humor and nearly non-stop footage of Julia Roberts´ barely clothed body.<br/><br/>Everyone likes the underdog to win. It gives us hope that the human spirit can prevail even against overwhelming and seemingly insurmountable forces. There is some attempt at romantic comedy here and there, but mostly the failure of Erin´s relationship reveals why she is twice divorced despite being gorgeous and sassy.<br/><br/>This movie is okay. Nothing to rave about, and nothing I will ever watch again, but it had its moments. And the little guy (gal) won. The End."

","Erin Brockovich is a strong and likable woman not because she is calm, polite or rich; it's due to the authenticity of her character that makes her so adorable. She feels like a REAL woman, who albeit having some bad qualities, never gives up on her desires. Julia Roberts does, in here, one of the best performances of her career, which is the main reason why this film works. The plot, on the other hand, is sometimes a little too long, which made me think there is no need for two hours of length. Also, I expected a little more intensity in the outcome, since I expected it to be the movie's climax. However, in fact, there is no climax at all. ""Erin Brockovich"" is a good storytelling and has a great acting, but never tries to provoke strong emotions, so don't expect it to be a tearjerker and you'll probably have a good time."

She is a beautiful woman just like Julia Roberts but the type of beauty that Julia brought to the film was one that comes from an attachment to some values that are part of American history and society. Julia played Erin character in a way that gave it a freshness and vitality that were necessary to show a story that reminded us a bible tale of a small David that faces the enormous Golias. In fact, the main character had to face two dangerous environments: big corporations and law courts. Erin Brokovitich fought for justice to a small community of residents in California that live closer of a Power Plant that poured the poisonous Chromiun 6 in the water in order to cool its generator discharging the contaminated water into the underground water sources.

"ElMaruecan82","7","0","1","27 September 2013"," A ""Norma Rae"" and ""Silkwood"", it ain't ...
","In 1974, in ""A Woman Under the Influence"", Gena Rowlands gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn, a struggling mother in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"".<br/><br/>In 2000, in ""Requiem For a Dream"", Ellen Burstyn gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Julia Roberts, a struggling mother in ""Erin Brokovich"".<br/><br/>Hollywood must have a thing for struggling mothers, I guess. But Julia Roberts' acting didn't convince me on that particular area, call it the anger from knowing that her performance beat up Ellen Busrtyn's heart-breaking performance, I call it the 'boobs' effect. Once we got that Erin Brokovich was a free-spirited single mother who loved to dress with tight skirts and deep décolleté highlighting her beautiful assets, could that be made a little bit less distracting, for plot's sake? <br/><br/>The film had the premise: an uneducated woman crusading against a California power lawsuit accused of poisoning water's supply and ultimately triumphing, far from the tragic heroine figure sacrificing herself, she gets the largest settlement ever paid in a direct action and her life financially improves (I hope her wardrobe tastes did too, from what I saw, it did, sexy outfits, but expensive ones).<br/><br/>Anyway, that kind of 'David vs. Goliath' story is pure gold for Hollywood, and Steven Soderbergh was right to believe in it, even 'Erin Brokovich' sounded more cinematic than any fictional name. But since the story is already phenomenal, why make Erin such a 'remarkable' woman from the very start? Why not allow Julia Roberts' undeniable charisma to disappear within her character?<br/><br/>I supposes Soderbergh tried to show some three-dimensionality and even succeeded by questioning whether Erin was motivated by justice or by the selfish desire to be the one (and only one) who pulled the giant on his knees, to prove herself capable. But damn, I couldn't get my eyes of Roberts' breasts all through the film, using Peter Griffin's vocabulary, as far as breasts (and legs, too) were concerned, ""the film insisted upon itself"", so much it even diminished the merit of Julia Roberts who's precisely supposed to play that kind of woman, at one point, I wondered whether it was Erin or 'Pretty Woman' I was watching.<br/><br/>Burstyn diluted herself in Sara Goldfarb's personality; Roberts relied too much on that superficial facade, as if she (or writers) thought we would only 'love' that she could outsmart smarter people unless we get the total opposite feeling from the beginning. I know this film is supposed to make you feel good for the victims of one of the most disgraceful injustices ever, well, I felt good for them, but that was the predictable emotional pay-off, everything that happened before was handled like 'obligatory plot devices', each time, in an over-the-top way.<br/><br/>Starting with the heroine: the struggling mother, the ultimate female 'underdog' figure, she lives alone with three children and doesn't trust men, because they all treated her like crap, and women in her office aren't any kinder. Maybe we're supposed to empathize with Erin, while we know every single woman who appears with these outskirts would not be watched with trustful eyes. But that's okay, she has the right to be the way she is, no matter how hypocritical it is to flash her (beautiful) body so eagerly and then wanting to be judged for smarts.<br/><br/>The irony here is that her clothes do make a point sometimes. For instance, when she goes to the water company and tries to flirt with the guy behind the counter to get some incriminating files, it makes sense, but she's always dressed like that, so, the point is lost. Let's get back to the clichés' department, at one point, Erin falls in love with George, a tough biker, but the guy doesn't provide anything to the film apart from being a plot-filler. Just compare Aaron Eckhart's role with Sam Elliot in ""Mask"" and you get the idea, the screenplay turned realistic stuff into pure fictionalized drama.<br/><br/>That's not even the worst, George pushes her to abandon the case when she's threatened. Maybe that's what happened in real life, but the way it was handled in the film was painfully unrealistic. Couldn't Erin tell George what her fight was about? I would have believed such a considerate man would respect Erin's efforts and even try to help her but no! He was selfishly complaining about the time she spent outside, and naturally, when he left, I don't know who couldn't see that coming.<br/><br/>The same unrealistic stuff happens again with Ed Masri, her employer played by Albert Finney. He fires Erin after three unjustified days off. He could have asked for explanations, or she could at least tell him, it would have cleared the misunderstanding. No, that was too convenient and we had to wait for five or ten minutes again. And I can go on and on, when the case is given to a bigger lawyer's office, one of the new assignees try to get in touch the plaintiffs, we know, it's a matter of time before Erin gets back on the road again.<br/><br/>The material wasn't revolutionary, and the film is relatively honest in the way it handles the case, no surprise witness, no spectacular revelation, no physical threats apart from the phone call. But the writing, directing and acting should have learned one thing or two from the 'New Hollywood' era. Something like ""Norma Rae"" or ""Silkwood"" for instance, but there's a quality in Sally Field and Meryl Streep that lacks in the 2000's Julia Roberts, and this is not a critic, Roberts is superb, but for once, she's victim of her superbness."
"sddavis63","7","0","1","31 March 2012"," The Best Performance I've Seen From Julia Roberts
","I have to right off confess that I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts. As an actress I think she's OK but not much more than that, and I personally don't think she's the raving beauty that a lot of people think she is. That, of course, is merely a matter of personal taste on my part, but perhaps it makes my assessment of her work in ""Erin Brockovich"" even more interesting. I really liked her in this! I have no argument at all with her Oscar for this role! I thought that she really got into the part of Erin and seemed to nail it - and I'm impressed by the fact that the real Erin Brockovich was involved with this film and even played a small role in it as a waitress - thus suggesting that she, too, felt that the portrayal of her was fair. In fact, on her website, the real Erin says that the movie is 98% true, with some dramatic licence taken in the other 2%. That was important for me to know, because, while Erin is the hero in this, it's not an altogether flattering portrayal of her, especially in the movie's early stages. Somewhat trashy I would say. Uneducated (which is actually not accurate), unemployed, foul-mouthed and living as a single mom to her three kids in a bug-infested home, her prospects don't appear very promising. But after being involved in a car accident, she hired lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who was also quite good in his role) to sue the other driver. Masry loses the case but apparently out of guilt hires her on at his law firm. Erin becomes involved in a case against a large corporation accused of causing serious health problems to residents around its plant by polluting the water with chemicals, and the movie follows the development of that case.<br/><br/>Yes. I liked Roberts, and I liked Erin Brockovich - both the movie and the person as portrayed. This is a classic ""underdog overcomes"" story. Erin obviously grows in confidence and ability as the movie progresses, and as she has to fight for recognition and respect from the families involved in the lawsuit, her fellow employees at the law firm and the various lawyers she has to deal with. At the same time, we see her struggle with the cost involved with all this - an increasingly distant relationship with her children because she's away a lot due to the case, and her inability to maintain a relationship with her neighbour George (Aaron Eckhardt) - who loves her but is increasingly resentful that she seems to view him as little more than easy child care. Good character development, well portrayed by Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The legal drama (although very much front and centre) is not the engine that pushes this movie forward. That's very much the portrayal of Erin the person. But the portrayal of the drama does point out the challenges involved in taking on a large corporation that has both lots of money and lots of lawyers. As you learn the stories of the affected families, you develop a sympathy for them. And yet, in some ways, the legal aspects of the film slow this down a bit. I mean, it's a true story. We pretty much know how it turns out. That takes some of the drama away from it. It does have a nice, heartwarming ending though as Erin reveals the terms of the settlement to one of the more pitiable of the plaintiffs.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, and definitely one of Julia Roberts' best - and this from someone, as I said, who's not generally overly smitten with Julia Roberts.

"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","30 September 2010"," Rather an enthralling film covering a woman on the brink, effectively covering her aiding the victimised and then coping with her own life.
","Erin Brokovich is the remarkable true story of a beauty pageant contestant turned legal expert whom very gradually uncovered levels of corruption within a California based power company. One of the many joys of the film lies in how director Steven Soderbergh takes what should be the ultimate tale of a character or person well out of their depth and integrates them into their new surroundings so much so, that it turns out they are both infinitely more qualified and more able in dealing with the situation than some of their contemporaries. The film has all the charge and dramatic punch of a scuzzy, hard boiled revenge film as it covers an enraged lead on a mission in which no one will get in their way; its Conservitive core isn't heavy handed and the film's documentation of a tale dominated by themes of female empowerment is, pleasingly, never for a second interested in the objectification of its lead, despite the field from whence they herald and despite their more usual attire. One of the key exchanges highlighting the lead's newfound sense of identity within the world of law and investigation sees her speak to some of the victims of a power company's leak of some toxins into the local water supply, an event which happened some years ago. The child of the family can speak to our lead, they can speak to her in a way that they couldn't when a suit-clad, official, law degree wielding individual would come round to visit. The fish is most certainly out of the water but finding life easier and more digestible up on dry land, it seems.<br/><br/>It is Julia Roberts playing American jobber turned beauty pageant competitor Erin Brockovich, the divorced single mother of three children striving to get by after a car accident and the loss of a consequential lawsuit leaves her with seventy-five dollars left. One of the very first instances we have of Brockovich engaging in official office-talk in a strictly business-like fashion is when dialogue with a doctor plays out, his background out of a nearby window occupied by tall, domineering buildings with a lone empty alcohol bottle occupying the space immediately behind Erin as suggestions of dishevelment draw in. While Brockovich herself was never an alcoholic, subtle props placed to reflect a respective situation work well; this early defeat aiding in getting across a sense of magnitude later on when we realise how far she's gone in taking on the nature of situations such as these and the officials at the core of these predicaments.<br/><br/>Erin is supported by her lawyer Ed Masry (Finney), a man whom grants her a job at his small law firm when an outburst in court following the aforementioned car accident and consequent injury sees that particular claim fall through. From the bottom working upwards, the film is a joyous and deeply captivating tale of a woman on a road she had no real idea existed, ploughing onwards towards a hopeful victory. The sense that Brockovich is out of her depth or isn't immediately of the law firm ilk is effectively dealt with early on. Whilst working at the offices, Erin doesn't go to lunch with the other girls because ""she's not like the other girls""; her attire and informal mannerisms as she scoots around the office, verbally badgering Masry on occasion puts her in stark contrast to the other woman of the office whom spend most of their time passively occupying a space behind a desk and possessing a thoroughly different overall stature.<br/><br/>Oral and visual confirmations of her respective situation as a person there are behind us by the time the tale has taken centre stage, an uncovering of some menial files which launches Erin into her quest the catalyst. The film is a superb documentation of this case involving injustices to a number of people in a small Californian town named Hinkley, as an electrical company and a water supply occupy the forefront of the case. The film very cleverly has a child take centre stage when Erin visits one of the victimised families, and that sense of the corporation being of an even nastier ilk than to how we may have previously felt, is slyly hit home by the film when it transpires an infant has been severely wronged by these people. On another strand, Erin's private life creeps into proceedings as neighbouring Hell's Angel biker George (Eckhart) becomes somewhat of a love interest, while her children become disenchanted by their mother's full time work; George being another character whom, like the loose, extroverted and former beauty pageant contest entering Erin, is granted a deconstruction of sorts and documented as anything but what prior conceptions we may have of them. It turns out he's good with her children, a kind man and is apologetic during their first encounter when he revs a motorcycle on his driveway too loudly, too late on.<br/><br/>Indeed, the film pokes fun at how it could've used both Brockovich's demeanour and appearance. Allowing the fact this highly attractive woman, whom in usually on show in a vast range of cheap outfits, is at the centre of this really fascinating and humbling story, but only once uses her sexuality or 'to-be-looked-at-ness' as an example of principal involvement. The amusing sequence briefly hands Erin a seductive characteristic when she manages to con her way past a young male desk clerk and into an archival room doubling up as a mine of gold for the prosecution. As the clerk watches The Wheel of Fortune on a television, Erin spins the proverbial whilst somewhat illegally accessing the files she'll need. The film is refreshing and immense fun; Roberts, through her character, capturing a real sense desperation mixed with dedication blended with eccentricity as she soars on integrating with all around her, in what is an unremittingly engaging text based on true tale."

","Erin Brockovich is a film based on the legal wranglings headed by Erin Brockovich representing residents of a California town against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a down on her luck former beauty pageant winner who is a twice divorced mother of three small children. She is trying her best to find a job and put food on the table when she is involved in an automobile accident. Erin hires Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to represent her in her lawsuit against the other driver. Because of her scantily clad wardrobe and smart mouth she doesn't win the lawsuit but she is able to win a job in Ed's law firm.<br/><br/>The first big assignment Erin is assigned is researching a pro bono real estate case. Erin stumbles across medical records in file and begins to dig deeper into the situation as to what the significance of medical records are in a real estate file. She finds out that PG&E has been illegally dumping a very toxic chemical into the town's water system. PG&E had been secretly trying to buy all of the real estate surrounding their plant. Erin ends up meeting numerous people who had become ill because of the contamination. This leads to one of the largest lawsuits against a corporation and ended with a record $333 million reward. Although things work out in the end for Erin, she researches and fights this battle for two years. Missing out on milestones that her own children attain and possibly sabotaging a good relationship.<br/><br/>The movie was nominated for over 40 awards in 2000 and 2001, wining approximately half of them. Julia Roberts gave one of her best performances to date playing the sympathetic law firm employee who had the clients' best interest at heart. She was adamant that these citizens needed to be compensated for the lifelong health problems they now have because of the carelessness of a PG&E. The movie shows that there are people who are willing to fight for the rights of others even if their own life is briefly interrupted to do so.<br/><br/>Both the lighting and angles give this movie a warm feeling and help you feel like you personally know the characters and the problems they are going through. You can't help but feel sorry for them when you hear their stories and be happy when they finally win their case.<br/><br/>If you like movies with the same theme as Erin Brockovich, which is helping others, you may also like A Time to Kill (1996) about a lawyer who puts his family life on hold and in danger to represent an accused murderer. As well as Patch Adams (1998) about a doctor who only wants to help his patients any way necessary much to the dislike of his colleagues."

","Erin Brokovich is a movie based on a true story centered on Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) about how she was living her life as a nightmare to how she was living in a dream that she thought would never happen. Erin was driving her car and got hit by another car and took the man to court. No one in the court house believed her story because they thought she got hit on purpose to get money because she was a single mother that was hurting for money. She went to a law office to get a lawyer who was Ed Masry (Albert Finney). Ed took Erin to court and ended up not winning the case. Erin still was a jobless single mother with three children that could barely afford to pay for her bills and to put food on the table. <br/><br/>At this point of her life she was living in her nightmare. She was very determined as the film went along to find a job as of which she did. She demanded that her Ed gave her a job at his law office which he ended up doing. She started at the law office as his ""secretary"" filing his papers away and just doing the normal office job. She really didn't know what she was doing and she really wasn't liked in the law office just because of her attitude. Erin was the best looking lady in the office and offended many of the other women in the office because of her clothing. Erin really didn't get any help from anyone else in the office. While Erin was working full time, her next door neighbor watched her children while she was at work. The next door neighbor ended up moving away and a ""Harley man"" who Erin got a bad vibe from ended up moving into the house next to her. They really didn't get along too well but then became really close as he watched her children while she was at work and pretty much became boyfriend and girlfriend. <br/><br/>When Erin was filing papers at work she came upon a lawsuit for the PG&E water plant. Erin got very involve in this case and spent lots of her own time on it. When Erin knew that PG&E was wrong of what they were doing she had to do something about it. Erin did a lot of prospecting around the town where all of these people were sick. She spent a lot of time with mainly this one family. Ed and Erin ended up going to court with PG&E and ended up winning the case. Ed and Erin won millions of dollars with the case and help out the family to pay for their medical bills. Ed ended up giving Erin a huge bonus of 2 million dollars and Erin could not believe it. At this point of the movie this is where Erin began to live her life like it was a dream. She probably would have never thought that she would have ever had this kind of money. <br/><br/>Film elements that contributed to the movie were dialogue and motif. The film element dialogue contributes to the theme through characterization. Dialogue is important to the theme of the movie because it shows how Erin was characterized throughout the movie. Dialogue shows what type of character Erin was in the movie by explaining her attitude and her willing to work for what she needed to do to better herself and her family. Motif contributes to the theme of the movie because it has a recurring element that has symbolic significance which would consist of Erin throughout the entire film. Erin would be the recurring element of the film that has a huge symbolic significance in the film.<br/><br/>The film showed how Erin was a go for it woman.

","""May contain Spoiler information"" <br/><br/>The film is a story about overcoming odds, environmental pollution, and corporate deception. It is also about the persistence and struggles encountered in uncovering and exposing the truth. The central insight of this film pits right against wrong and a huge corporation against a couple individuals. It's the David vs. Goliath of corporate environmental contamination where power and influence are annulled and the truth eventually triumphs. <br/><br/>Down on her luck and down to her last dime Erin Brokovich (played by Julia Roberts) a twice divorced single mother of three is involved in an automobile accident which leads to meeting attorney Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney). After losing her case in court and not receiving any type of settlement, Erin basically extorts a job from her attorney Ed Masry. Erin is asked to review some pro –bono files for Masry. While reviewing these files she is puzzled as to why medical records are being kept with real estate files. As she uncovers these answers Erin begins her long and tireless quest becoming the unlikely advocate to the citizens of Hinckley, CA in her epic fight against Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) a powerful multinational corporation. <br/><br/>Directed by Steven Soderbuergh and written by Susannah Grant this film is based on the true to life story of Erin Brokovich and the landmark case of environmental contamination and corporate cover up. The film focuses on the good vs. evil and the David vs. Goliath struggle where one, down on her luck uneducated girl through her passion, and tireless pursuit of truth, brings down one the country's largest corporations. <br/><br/>This film in broad context is similar to other films such as ""The Rain Maker"" ""the entire President's Men"" and ""The Firm"" Where individuals face great struggles as they battle against and overcome insurmountable odds. <br/><br/>By using various techniques Soderbuergh builds a relationship with the viewer where it is difficult not to cheer for Erin and her clients. As a viewer we watch the action through an objective view point as the plot develops. Soderbuergh uses a subjective view point in establishing and building the relationship between Erin and her clients. This perspective brings the audience in closer and forces us to experience the intimacy and intensity of each moment. Sounds effects were used effectively to subconsciously instill or associate the feeling of danger and suspense. I believe the music, sounds and editing were all carefully constructed to create a feeling with the viewers to relate to Erin and her clients and build on that desire to see them succeed in the battle. <br/><br/>I believe that the film works because the writing, directing and acting is believable which allows us to identify and side with the little man. We want this woman, who has had a hard life to beat the odds and succeed, and we also feel for innocent victims of the town and we hope that they win their battle against their illness and against the evil big corporation.<br/><br/>I enjoy this film and would give it 9 out of 10"

","Erin Brockovich is an inspiring movie about a single mother. The movies theme is that no matter who the opponent a person should stand for what is right. Erin has three children and is jobless and twice divorced and trying to make something of her life and provide a good life for her children. Erin Brockovich, Julie Roberts, is a stay at home mom who has no job skills because of her early marriage and her decision to stay at home with her children while her husband(s) worked and provided for the family. Six years later she is divorced and looking for a job to be able to support her three children.<br/><br/>After being involved in a car accident she hires a small firm lawyer by the name of Ed Masry, Albert Finney, to represent her. The lawsuit does not go as planned and she is back to square one with not job and medical bills piling up from her injuries. She decides that she is going to talk Ed into giving her a job and accomplishes this by demanding that he hire her in front of the entire office. After working for Ed's law firm for a few weeks, Erin stumbles across a real estate case that has medical records in the file and decides to dig deeper.<br/><br/>She discovers a cover-up that a large corporation, PG & E, has been trying to keep quiet while their statute of limitations runs out on their incident. The company had discovered that one of their plants has been leaking large amounts of a toxic chemical into the ground water and it has poisoned a whole town near the plant. PG & E has attempted to cover this up by attempting to purchase all of the land surrounding the plant that is now inhabited by the poisoned individuals. Erin pushes and researches this case. She fights for the people of the town. Ed's law firm takes on a big name partner and the two firms are able to bring a lawsuit against PG & E which is settled for an amount of $333 million. The amount was a national record for a settlement. The settlement is divided amongst the plaintiffs and Ed is able to move his law firm from their tiny little building into a downtown suite because of this case that they spearheaded. Erin fights for the people of the town throughout the film because it was what was right. To help convey the serious nature of the film lighting was vital for this movie. The lighting in the movie is very natural using high-key lighting thus making the film more real. The camera angle used through the majority of the film was medium shot. The medium shot also aided in the serious nature of this film. While the medium angle was used for the majority of the film for the intense debates between Erin and Ed, close-up shots were used to show the emotional responses of the characters (Boggs, 2008).<br/><br/>A film with a similar theme is Legally Blonde. Even though these films handle their stories very differently in the end the themes are very similar. Both of the films focus on a woman who goes against the odds to take on a difficult challenge. They both take on the challenge because it is what is morally right and they will not bend. Both of the main characters are continually underestimated by people given their image and both prove them wrong.<br/><br/>Resources Boggs, J. M. & Petric, D. W. (2008). The art of watching films.

"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","10 April 2010"," While the beginning is a little unsteady, this is mostly an unforgettably captivating drama
","This was a very successful film based on a true story, and the lead actress, Julia Roberts, even won an Oscar for her performance here. I remember being shown over half of this biopic in my high school career studies class, since it was relevant to the subject, but do not recall seeing it all the way to the end. That was seven years ago, and three years after this ""Erin Brockovich"" film was released, so it has been out for ten years in total and I finally sat down to watch it from start to finish this month. Even though it took years for this to happen, and I don't think I was expecting to be able to give it a rating higher than 7/10, this 2000 drama certainly didn't fail to grab me. I guess my expectations were slightly surpassed, since I'm giving it an 8.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is a single mother who has been married and divorced twice and is now desperately searching for employment, but is having no luck, lacking the experience required for the jobs she applies for. After a failed lawsuit against a doctor who crashed into her car on the road and left her injured, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry, to give her a job at his law firm to make up for the loss of the case. She gets to work for Masry as a clerk in his office, but her revealing attire and aggressive demeanor lead to conflict in the workplace. After getting this job, it isn't long before she begins to investigate a real estate case involving the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in Hinkley, California. She soon discovers that the company is responsible for the contamination of the water in this town! The hexavalent chromium that they dump is going into the town's water system, leading to serious health problems for the townspeople, and PG&E has been lying about it! This leads Brockovich and her law firm into a challenging fight against a multi-billion dollar corporation to try and bring them to justice!<br/><br/>I'm can't remember exactly what my thoughts were as I watched this film seven years ago, but when I started watching it this month, it didn't look so great at the beginning with the job interview, but it quickly improves, perhaps starting with the part where the lawsuit fails. For the rest of the film, it's very intriguing for the most part as we watch the protagonist attempting to put an end to PG&E's crime against the people of Hinkley, and the problems she faces with her kids, her boyfriend George, her boss, and others. The film can be somewhat moving at times with scenes involving seriously ill Hinkley residents. Julia Roberts does a decent job playing the protagonist, even if her performance is not amazing, and I don't know exactly what the real Erin Brockovich is like, but the movie version of her is a short-tempered and often rude individual who also proves that she is caring and clever. Albert Finney also stands out as Ed Masry. He's an English actor and does a great American accent here. Not everything about this film is perfect, there is some fairly weak dialogue and maybe some unconvincing parts, but apart from that, I can't complain much when it comes to the film's quality.<br/><br/>Since this is a movie based on a true story (there's even a cameo appearance from the real Erin Brockovich-Ellis as a waitress named Julia), it doesn't surprise me that there has been controversy over how accurate it is, and some people have trashed the film for its inaccuracies, some of which I have read about. I really don't have much to say about this, but at the beginning, it does say it's BASED ON a true story, it doesn't say it IS a true story. Even if this biopic is very inaccurate, it's still a very effective and memorable film. With all the language, it's not family-friendly, and all the swearing, a lot of it coming from Julia Roberts in the lead role, is apparently the reason for the film's R rating. There are also adults who can't stand constant profanity in movies, and if you're one of them, ""Erin Brockovich"" is not for you, either. However, if you're old enough to watch this film AND you can take the language, you could find it to be a very satisfying drama."

The realism it portrays is strong and can be associated with any viewer and the fact that this is based on a woman's personal experience may have people shedding a tear or two, which is helped along by a bravado Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The actress at present in 2000 was in a run of a conventional romantic roles. My best friend's wedding, Notting Hill and Runaway bride had all appeared on the star's CV in recent years and here she branches out into a harder dramatic role that enables us viewers to truly see her full potential, which in turn was noticed by Hollywood who won her an Academy Award for her portrayal. I confess to never being high on her fan list but here we do see charisma and a no holds barred approach to truth telling and appetite for enthusiasm. One scene near the end where she is sitting with her boss and two lawyers is brilliant when she challenges her rival to name people and numbers, moment of the film.<br/><br/>The supporting collection of actors lend subtle support to the main star. Aaron Eckhart is brilliant if underused as George the biker whilst Albert Finney is a revelation as a man who knows too much.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh, beaten at the Oscars by his other work in Traffic, supplies the necessary dramatic styling of a plot not too high up on action and containing enough dramatic controversy and suspense to see us through. The scenes in the record offices are a bit stretched whilst seeing George with the kid is a bit of an overstep. However he more than makes up with it in the slightly humorous town's meeting and office sessions.<br/><br/>This film, though smart in its casting and directing has a certain lackadaisical approach to story telling. Though based obviously on a true story there is a lack of pacing a stretching of scenes, a feeling of repetitiveness that you can never shake off. Whilst the ending intends to be a feel good motive you don't ultimately feel rewarded at the arrival and to the point in which it got their.<br/><br/>And yet this is a good picture.

","I remember watching this movie back in 2000 being ten years old and understandably I didn't appreciate it for its technical brilliance at the time but still simply loving every moment of every scene. I watch this movie now and fall deeply in love with every line that comes out characters mouths.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts has her ups in and downs but her acting in this movie has given new meaning to the term respect. Roberts portrays a single mother who through desperation works her hardest to put food on the table for her children and not for one second did I doubt her acting. This coming from a guy who looks at most top end actors and see's the actor not the character.<br/><br/>Albert Finney, this wonderful man once again proves why it is he has constantly been praised with his Oscar nominations. This man puts the Act in actor. Finney plays the small time private lawyer who is responsible for giving Roberts character the job. Given that Finneys character was neither in dept nor well written (but not in a bad way) Al makes the character shine and brings the viewers into the story with his constant facial expressions and his expansive hilarity, all in all Finney plays his part perfectly as the supporting character.<br/><br/>Aaron Eckhart plays the ""house husband"" nanny who looks after the kids for most of the movie. He doesn't have a major role but plays his part well and was nicely suited for the task. He also brings a nice side story to the major plot.<br/><br/>All in all this is a very well written adaptation of the life of Erin Brockovich. The characters are lovable and progress nicely throughout the film. This movie will keep you entertained and have you laughing your ass off one minute and have your lunging for your hanky the next.<br/><br/>Do not miss the Beauty that is, Erin Brockovich.<br/><br/>I don't even know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it. ~J.D.

","In general, legal films are either grand courtroom dramas or films about how the system has failed someone, or how it has been construed to bypass justice (which, I guess, is the same thing). ""Erin Brockovich"" is neither. Instead, it's about a woman who uses her personality to accomplish what many people with legal degrees cannot, and in the process, dealing a record-breaking blow to a company who cut corners and left many people very sick.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is in a deep rut. A former beauty queen, she is nearly penniless after two failed marriages that left her with three kids, and she's unemployed. After she demands a job from an attorney named Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she uncovers a huge corporate crime almost by accident, and it turns out to be a lot bigger than she or Ed ever expected.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts is the perfect choice to play the title character. Roberts has made a career out of playing sunny and extroverted characters, and that quality suits her well. Erin doesn't know anything about the legal system, but she has amazing people skills, and ultimately that's what really makes the case work. The people of Hinckley don't trust the lawyers, but they trust Erin. For lack of a better analogy, she's the Moses guiding the people to the promised land.<br/><br/>However, Roberts has more range than she is often allowed to show. Working on the case takes a heavy toll on Erin's family life, and we see her pain from being away from her family. Some of these scenes are heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The supporting cast members are great as well. Albert Finney is great as Ed Masry. He's got the brains, and knows he's in over his head, but he knows that attempting to fight with Erin about taking the case is utterly pointless. They may not like each other at times, but the two make a good team. Aaron Eckhart is also good as George, Erin's boyfriend. He's the voice of reason for Erin. However, while he loves Erin, he's not going to be a doormat. There's one performance that has been overlooked, but is nonetheless effective: Scotty Leavenworth is great as Matthew, Erin's son. It is through him that we see the effect that the case has on her family, and Leavenworth perfectly illustrates that. There's no sense of artifice in his performance.<br/><br/>""Erin Brockovich"" is filled with bit performances, and all are excellent. Hinckley's inhabitants are extremely sympathetic, and we only want the best for them. PG&E, the evil corporation, is represented by some of the nastiest people ever. They wouldn't bat an eye to the plight of Hinckly's population if they hadn't sued. They thing that the plaintiffs are worthless, and that because they are poor, they don't matter. The viewer's hatred for the greedy corporation is instantaneous. However, the film is all Roberts.<br/><br/>2000 was a great year for Steven Sodebergh. He came out with two hit movies (""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"") that took the Oscars by storm. Both earned Best Picture and Best Director nominations (he won for the latter film). His skill as a director is clearly evident (he hasn't done work this good before or since). The cinematography is desert-like: bright and grainy. Hinckley is not a happy place, but the people are nice.<br/><br/>Although ""Erin Brockovich"" deals with some heavy material and contains some powerful moments, that should lead one to think that this is a depressing movie. On the contrary, there are many amusing moments, and two scenes that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Sodebergh finds the right balance between drama and comedy (although calling the film a comedy is not necessarily truthful).<br/><br/>There are a few flaws, but overall, ""Erin Brockovich"" is a wonderful film."
"crosales11","9","0","1","5 July 2009"," Movie Critique connecting Justice to the Film
","WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS. This film shows what hard work and determination can accomplish. Erin Brockovich (played by Julia Roberts) is a true advocate for justice. Her persistence in trying to achieve justice makes others try to achieve it as well. This film does justice to the issue of mandatory minimums by showing that the ""small"" person can rise up and make things happen. Just like Erin Brockovich, Julie Stewart was someone who rose up to a challenge and has been fighting for its just resolution. Erin was the main character and therefore provided the strength for the film. Her fiery demeanor gets the audience riled up and interested in the film and her cause. The basic plot of the film is that while working at a law firm, Erin tries to win a case concerning a water contamination scandal. Every time you hear victims of the contamination speak about their illnesses, it moves your heart. Some of the victims are even children. One scene that truly portrays Erin's determination is when she climbs down into a well to gather water samples. She is risking a lot by doing this because she could get arrested and the evidence she acquires could become voided. Nevertheless, she evades the men that chase her off the property. After going to PG&E, the water company of the film, she and her family receive a threatening call. If she did not have devotion to justice, Erin could have stopped investigation on this case, but she continued to investigate because of her dedication to bringing justice to the people affected by PG&E. Another compelling scene involves a lawyer, Theresa, and Erin. Theresa insults Erin's work involving the case. She says that Erin had holes in her investigation, but Erin insists that her investigation is more than thorough. Theresa claims that Erin is missing six hundred and some odd telephone numbers, but what she does not know is that Erin is so connected to the case that she memorized all of those numbers. She also memorized all of the illnesses and things that the contaminated water had caused. Erin has formed relationships with the people who were affected by the contamination, and this case became personal to her. Her commitment to justice is just as passionate as Julie Stewart's devotion to bringing mandatory minimum to an end. Erin was just doing her job to try to provide for her family. What she did not know was that she would become so passionate about this issue that she would neglect spending time with her family. She also missed the chance to develop a relationship with a man named George who had been so good with her children. While she was at work he always watched the kids. He eventually left Erin because he could not stand not being able to spend time with her. This multi-million case caused Erin to spend over a year investigating, and she missed her youngest daughter's first words. A very powerful scene is when George goes into detail about her youngest daughter's first word. Erin begins to cry as George sounds so excited about Beth's first word. Erin wanted to bring justice to this case, but in the process, she missed spending time with her family. She had to sacrifice time, and her son began to resent her for that. Near the end, though, Erin's son was able to understand the significance of this case, and he no longer thought that his mother was abandoning him. George also came back. The very end of the film is the scene that best encapsulates the lesson of the story. At the very end of the movie, Erin's boss gives her a very large amount of money, two-million dollars. Her boss at first said that the sum of money that they had both agreed on was inappropriate. Erin thought that he was screwing her over and that he meant he was giving her a lesser amount of money. She begins to yell at him but she stops when she picks up the check he put on her desk. It is a check for two-million dollars, and Erin is speechless. Her boss says that he felt that her work deserved more, and the initial amount proposed was inappropriate. Thus, he gave her more money. She was rewarded for doing justice. The reward for doing justice may not always be material, but highly valuable. With this one case, Erin learned work ethic, perseverance, and along the line, self respect. She gains a sense of self confidence after she works on this case, and she feels that more people respect her as well. Although she lost some time with her family, Erin learned many life lessons. Justice in this film is very apparent through Erin's devotion and connection to her clients. Dedication to justice, perseverance, relationships, and a willingness to help others at all costs allows Erin to close this case and bring justice to her clients."

","It was my father who recommended me to see this film when it premiered on the television. I knew that it was supposed to be marvelous and therefore I had high expectations right for the start. And, thank God, I wasn't disappointed at all!<br/><br/>Julia plays a stalwart, authoritative, somewhat arrogant woman with amazing adroitness. She is so good in this role that you ignore all her cursing and yet love her. Albert Finney too plays his role well though I thought that he could have been better in some shots. Eckhart too does a really good job as a 'maid/lover' of Erin .<br/><br/>What I feel that could have improved was the character development. I felt that nothing changed in the character's traits. Also, some of the sub-plots could have been handled better. Its a monster of a story and that's why probably it wasn't possible to focus on all the characters and give them more attention.<br/><br/>The story is absolutely tremendous with fabulous and witty dialogs. The ""It's called b00bs"" line is my favorite. The ending is satisfactory. The main punch of this movie is that it never gets dull even though its a bit long. Well, to be frank, I felt that they could have increased the pace in some of the scenes but that didn't make it completely unenlightening.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm going to give this an eight. Don't forget to catch it on the television. If this 15 year old loves it, then I feel that it would be relished by almost anyone."
"Benjamin_Cox","8","0","1","7 October 2008"," Roberts & Finney superbly lead this true-life drama - 84%
","If you were to ask my Better Half what her favourite type of movie is, she'd probably say ""true-life movies"" but personally, I have a very real problem with movies of this type. Most are made for TV and decidedly crummy, for starters, but seeing as they are also as predictable as your average Nativity play, there is no attraction in watching it in the first place unless endless stories of how odds are overcome are your thing. You'd think, therefore, that ""Erin Brockovich"" is not what I would consider a good movie and you'd be right. But like that other great ""true-life"" movie, ""Alive"", this is one film which has rock-solid performances from the leads and an almost documentary feel to it. But after being paid $20 million for her appearance, I'd expect nothing less from Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>Roberts plays our erstwhile heroine who has reached the bottom of the barrel. Struggling with her three kids and no man to help her, she even fails to win suitable compensation after being involved in a car crash. Desperate but determined, she forces herself into the employ of her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) but with her foul language and slutty clothes, she can't help but make the wrong impression. But after stumbling across what appears to be an administrative mistake, Erin's curiosity gets the better of her and she soon uncovers a huge hushed-up industrial accident by Pacific Gas & Electric which polluted the water supply of a nearby town to such a degree that it causes a variety of life-threatening conditions in the townsfolk. Enraged, Erin and Ed decide to take on the corporate giants with the help of the townspeople but sometimes, doing the right thing isn't always the easiest thing.<br/><br/>There can be few who'd argue that Roberts didn't deserve her Oscar - watching the extras on the DVD, you can see what a great job she did of portraying Ms Brockovich. But the actor who impressed me the most is Finney, giving the sort of performance that has me scratching my head wondering why Hollywood isn't using him more often. He is faultless and together with Roberts, they dominate the picture with the ease of two professionals at the top of their game. By contrast, Aaron Eckhart (who's no amateur either) looks flat and almost uninterested in proceedings as Erin's biker boyfriend George. And however well publicised the story has been, you still can't quite believe that it all actually happened. It did feel slightly sugar-coated at the end as I felt it didn't reflect the true outcome of the case (a quick look at the trivia section of IMDb or Wikipedia will explain all) and I also would have liked some feedback from PG&E themselves but the story won't allow it, instead permitting the sort of one-way information traffic normally the preserve of Michael Moore.<br/><br/>But all things considered, this is still a fine example of a true-life movie that doesn't suck. It can be easy to dismiss stuff like this as lazy movie-making that only geared towards making Oprah talk about it but that's doing ""Erin Brockovich"" an injustice. Brilliantly performed with enough good lines to keep most viewers interested, it's another reminder that even the loneliest individual can make the biggest impact on the lives of so many. Roberts may take the plaudits but Finney is every inch as good and if you're looking for a film with two fantastic leads then either this or ""Training Day"" are pretty much as good as you're going to get."
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","7","0","1","22 June 2008"," Great, just great. Mrs. Roberts is outstanding.
","Much will be made of Julia Roberts's wardrobe in Erin Brockovich--a brash parade of daring hemlines and Wonderbra confidence. Roberts is unabashedly sexy in the title role of this fact-based comedy-drama, but she and director Steven Soderbergh are far too intelligent to rely solely on high heels and cleavage. Susannah Grant's brassy screenplay fuels this winning combination of star, director, and material, firing on all pistons with maximum efficiency. With Ed Lachman, his noted cinematographer from The Limey, Soderbergh tackles this A-list project with the fervor of an independent, combining a no-frills look with kinetic panache and the same brisk editorial style he used in the justly celebrated Out of Sight. Broke and desperate, the twice-divorced single mom Erin bosses her way into a clerical job with attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who's indebted to Erin after failing to win her traffic-injury case. Erin is soon focused on suspicious connections between a mighty power company, its abuse of toxic chromium, and the poisoned water supply of Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a legacy of death and disease. Matching the dramatic potency of Norma Rae and Silkwood, Erin Brockovich filters cold facts through warm humanity, especially in Erin's rapport with dying victims and her relationship with George (superbly played by Aaron Eckhart), a Harley-riding neighbor who offers more devotion than Erin's ever known. Surely some of these details have been embellished for dramatic effect, but the factual basis of Erin Brockovich adds a boost of satisfaction, proving that greed, neglect, and corporate arrogance are no match against a passionate crusader. (Trivia note: The real Erin Brockovich appears briefly as a diner waitress.)"
"so_original","8","0","1","19 May 2008"," Entertaining Vehicle for Julia Roberts.
","Julia Roberts is the star in this based-on-a-true story film, ""Erin Brockovich"". It's a classic ""David and Goliath"" tale, that pits one woman against a huge corporation. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three, with little money and plenty of attitude. As she takes a job as a secretary in a law firm, headed by former lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she discovers the horrors taking place in the small town of Hinkley. The water has been contaminated, and has altered the lives of these working class people. Brockovich makes it her mission to take down PG&E (the corporation responsible for the contamination) and she and Masry, with the 637 Hinkley residents, go toe to toe with the corporate giant in court.<br/><br/>Clearly, this is a vehicle for Julia Roberts, first and foremost. The character of Brockovich, the journey she goes on and the growth she experiences from helping people and making a difference is the main focus of the film. However, Roberts truly proves her acting skills and that she's more than a box office draw and a megawatt smile. Julia is known for taking on the ""girl next door""-esquire roles. Even her breakthrough role as a prostitute in ""Pretty Woman"" was written as the nicest prostitute you'll ever meet. But, Erin Brockovich is a grittier character. She swears and struts her way through the scenery, chewing out those who challenge her and shocking more conservative types with her revealing wardrobe. Although she often comes off tough and provocative, it is also made clear that Erin has a warm heart. Her determination and defiance comes from an honest desire to help make her life and her kids' lives better. She also makes an emotional connection with the plaintiffs, seeing them less as clients and more as an extended family. The way Julia creates a nice balance between Erin's strong and soft side and makes her a complex character truly proves her talent. Her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Of course, there are other well played characters in this film as well. Albert Finney makes the contrast between his Ed Masry character and Erin Brockovich clear. He's conservative, she's over the top. He plays it safe, she makes her own rules. He thinks in a more business-like lawyer fashion, while she distrusts lawyers and tends to think with her heart (which helps her relate to the plaintiffs). As Erin's foil, it is clear that these two can learn from each other and as the film progresses they do. Aaron Eckhart is Erin's boyfriend George, who begins to feel inadequate when constantly playing Mr. Mom to Erin's kids, and Marg Helgenberger as one of the standout Hinkley plaintiffs. It is Erin's show, but the supporting characters help her to figure out more about herself and the world around her.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is a pretty standard genre. Even the director, Steven Soderbergh, shoots in a straightforward (but visually rich) fashion.

","This is a wonderful movie and a great performance by Julia Roberts. Clearly the true story of Erin Brokovich has been given a good dose of the Hollywood treatment here, but I don't know why other people have felt the need to complain about this  it's a mainstream movie with a story and a message that has universal appeal, so why wouldn't you want to sprinkle some of that Hollywood stardust and get as many people into the theaters as possible? <br/><br/>All in all, I think the movie might be clichéd in parts but it is funny and heartwarming and it has a great message. It's always inspiring to see that one person really can make a difference, against all of the odds. Even though we know how it's going to end, we still root for Erin and for Albert Finney  who was also brilliant."

","You've seen this story before, but Steven Soderbergh pumps real life into Erin Brochovich, a movie on the verge of really breaking ground. What makes EB so worth watching is the sheer passion and cinematic ingenuity that shows up in performances, editing, camera-work, and pacing.<br/><br/>Soderbergh finds a great middle-ground for his characters, especially Brochovich, played by Julia Roberts, an actress I've never really liked, but liked a lot here. Roberts is so angry and skanky that you're almost unwilling to become emotionally invested in her. She is terribly damaged and hardened, unwilling to cut anyone around her much slack. Her behavior, from the incessant cursing to the whorish wardrobe, is offensive enough that her character has to earn your respect first. I really liked that, not being immediately sympathetic.<br/><br/>The story itself is not so much unimportant as is secondary (I know it was based on a true story, but bear with me on this) to the real power of the movie. Watching Soderbergh manipulate the physical aspects of film and sound and elicit great, flesh-and-blood performances from actors and actresses made this movie for me. I know I'm describing a heartless, policy-wonk movie, but I don't mean to.<br/><br/>Erin Brochovich is 180 degrees off heartless. I'm just impressed with how a tried-and-true story can be retold so effectively.<br/><br/>My wife loved it for the getting back at Pacific Gas and Electric and Brochovich growing into and relishing her success with the role of a respected, crusading mom who doesn't give a damn about social and fashion conventions. I appreciated those things, but it was the artistry of the tale-telling that kept me watching.<br/><br/>If you combine the two, you've got a helluva good movie. Erin Brochovich has been out for seven years, but if you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend being dazzled by it."

It exists solely as an opportunity for Julia Roberts' devoted fans to see her tear up the screen and give anyone standing within 20 feet of her on screen a what-for, but it doesn't really ask her to act. Roberts is further indication that someone's star power is in inverse proportion to his/her talent (see Halle Berry, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston). Roberts would be nothing as an actress (as evidenced by her recent panned Broadway debut) without the fakery of cinema. She needs good lighting, clever editing, expert hair dressers to tame that lion's mane of her's. She's at her best when a director clears everyone else out of her way and lets the camera linger on her in close-up, which is what Soderbergh does here. Compare her's to the feisty performance delivered by Sally Field in ""Norma Rae"" to see just how unconvincing Roberts is.<br/><br/>But, and this is a big ""but,"" all of that aside, ""Erin Brockovich"" is enormously entertaining, as these liberal fight-against-the-system movies always are.

","I thought the movie was very good. I also admired the work and dedication of the real-life Erin Brockovich. What I didn't like was the scene where the other attorneys are asking about information that should be in the files. The female attorney says to Erin, ""That's okay, you probably just didn't know what questions to ask."" Erin proceeds to shred her by revealing that Erin has all of the correct information...in her head. Instead of writing the information in the files, which is what 999,999,999 people out of 1,000,000,000 would do, Ms Erin Brockovich MEMORIZES the information. I guess this is supposed to show how dedicated Erin is to her clients and how much smarter she is than snooty people who went to college. I guess we, the little people, were supposed to be cheering during this scene. When the lady attorney tries to apologize, ""Look, maybe we got off on the wrong foot..."", Erin cuts her off with ""That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet and f***ing ugly shoes."" At that point, I stopped liking Erin Brockovich, the person. That attorney didn't deserve that.

","Based on the true story of a woman who overcame all adversity and single-handedly dragged down a power company, Erin Brockovich tells the story a single mother (played by Julia Roberts), rejected from yet another job, but after an unfortunate car crash, she manages to argue her way into a job at Albert Finney's law firm. She soon discovers murky goings-on regarding a small town's water supply, causing disease and death. Most people would sit back and leave it, but Erin doesn't, instead, she dedicates the next few years of her life to righting the wrongs.<br/><br/>Many have found Roberts' performance grating, but I personally thought she was excellent in the lead, embodying all the key qualities of the character, both good and bad; she is caring and determined, yet impatient and foul-mouthed. Unlike many of the female leads presented in films today, what is so appealing to me about her performance is just how human it is. Her role is one very far removed for her usually romcomy turns, and all for the better. In the support, Albert Finney is amusing in a bumbling yet togethered role, and the two make a fitting pair. Donna Jensen, Aaron Eckhart and Cherry Jones also give notable performances.<br/><br/>Their work is made much easier with Steven Soderburgh's capable yet efficient direction, and some nimble dialogue, supplied by Susannah Grant. Even if we do have a good idea about which direction the movie will head, the cast and crew work deftly to make us experience the movie as well as enjoy it, so that the redemption, when it comes, means even more. The modern-day atmosphere is also captured well, in background design, as well as a catchy electro-funk soundtrack from Thomas Newman.<br/><br/>Fuelled mainly by its excellent performances, Erin Brockovich is a strange combination of genres. It is a biography of a woman that nobody had heard of. It is a drama as far as the seriousness of topic. And it is also a comedy, in how it so effortlessly captures the essence of a determined, brave, and kind-hearted woman. But essentially, Erin Brockovich is a feel-good David and Goliath story, of how the weak defeated the strong. It has its flaws (a slow middle act, some sketchy characters, as well as the question of how true to the facts it plays), but generally, it handles its subject matter with appropriate integrity, yet making it accessible to cinema-goers. Uplifting, engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable, Erin Brockovich is not to be missed."

I've missed big movies and I'm from somewhere between Generation X and Y.<br/><br/>Every actor plays a great role in it. I don't know much of each one past works, but even Julia Roberts seems like she is playing the first role in her career this time. Except she is now 30 and not 20 anymore.<br/><br/>It starts showing, quickly, how bad she was in life in that moment. Not one second she gives up, but specially in the beginning, not one second she stops smiling at life even while life throw her away to the dump. That's until she gets of a job interview, broke, with 3 kids, divorced twice and suffer a car accident. Now she can't smile that easily anymore... But, that's one thing in the movie... She doesn't know what's going to happen, but definitely never give up. And that's just the first 7 minutes.<br/><br/>The movie has 2 sides. At one side, there is a big case of corruption in PSE&G, the American supplier of gas and electricity. At the other side there is a bright woman, fighting to stay alive and getting life to push her in the hard way into solving that case. And she proves to be able to do the job and still keeping herself as a pretty woman, as she likes that.<br/><br/>Along with that, there is, in each part of the movie, smart words being used. It starts pretty fast, then it slows down a little to normal to show details about the story itself. But while it slows down, it still keeps with some details about how's a good way to live life, specially added by Charlie, who seems like an angel, plus the smart way how Erin moves her life, almost unconsciously.<br/><br/>--- spoiler --- While watching the movie I've cried, without knowing the reason, for the first time in my short 24 year old life. Other than that, I've only did it in funerals. It was when her child asked what was going on, why she was out of home for 18 months, and they could understand each other by using just a few words. Amazing kid.<br/><br/>Despite of how real the story evolving PSE&G really is the movie gives one feeling of evil company. But I rather see it the other image the movie also shows which is PSE&G just acting as a big company who has human making mistakes, blinded by money and by keeping distance from reality. There's no specific scene showing that, but the movie as a whole does."

Erin Brokovich is a crusader movie in which David takes on Goliath, the little guy stands up to the evil corporation. Although the message of the movie is very serious director Steven Soderbergh keeps the film entertaining. The relationship between Roberts and Finney is well-done and their bickering is amusing.

","Erin Brockovich [2000] with Julia Roberts in one of her most stellar roles.<br/><br/>Erin the Heroine<br/><br/>Erin shows two main things: a. the persistence of a way of being in the world; b. how surface characteristics quickly change as the structure of the person's external world changes. Erin grew up as a small town beauty queen feeling like she was 'somebody', confident, spontaneous, in command, and had a birthright to win in games of one-up-man-ship. After two failed marriages, she realizes the cultural stereotype of marriage is stacked against women. She won't have any more of it. Now, after repeatedly being devastated by the ravages of a male dominant society, alone and penniless with children to support, she is up against that wall of bias against women again. <br/><br/>In the middle of her current gloomy circumstances, she decides that this time she is going to go at it like a she-bear with cubs. Like competitive men who take a no holds barred approach to life, her inner resolve is saying, ""Everybody better look out, here comes the old, bold, Erin"". She finally scraps her way into a penny ante, food on the table, job. <br/><br/>In her new, menial job in a small law firm, her implicit, strong, trust in her fortitude, intelligence, and judgment causes her mind to pause during the perusal of some legal gibberish. She notes an odd and incongruous conjunction in the information. With her revived naturally spontaneous and assertive self, she seeks validation of her suspicions of a cover-up conspiracy by visiting the actual defendants sited in the report. However, she finds the victims hostile to outsiders and oddly beholden and loyal to their corporate patrons. Rallying another side to her earlier resourcefulness and maturity she confronts the diffident victims with compassion, empathy, and humble eye-to-eye persuasiveness. This opens all the doors to the hearts of these fearful employees in this closed, ravaged, and emotionally depleted corporately sustained community. Her approach turns out to be a knockout combination of punches and she gains their confidence in her.<br/><br/>Soon, her own life circumstances begin changing. As a male admirer enters her life, she holds him at bay while she thoroughly tests him. She hesitates because she does not want a repeat performance of her former relationships with men. When he proves to be genuinely supportive and kind, she finally, but gingerly, allows him into her life. He is truly helpful and patient, especially with her children. She feels the gods must be promoting a happy serendipity since this is just what she needs to give her the backup necessary for her to unleash her enormous but dormant combination of talents. <br/><br/>As she succeeds with what has become a huge lawsuit over lethal damage caused by the pollution the corporation had been successfully covering up, the head of the small law firm calls in big legal guns to take over the case. In a conflict of her two most dominant traits, not to be bested by anyone and a level-headed maturity, the latter wins out. In a verbal contest with one of the legal experts brought to help insure their victory, she clearly demonstrates that she is not a woman to be discounted, regardless of the fact that the experts' credentials outclass her. She concedes that the experts should be allowed their role in the case, but she is remains the incumbent. Like a bull dog with its teeth sunk in a bone she will not relinquish her hold on 'her' case to the 'interlopers'. She proves to be as formidable as a gladiator when it comes to being a mental and verbal combatant, whether she is an expert in legalese or not. <br/><br/>Erin's force-of-nature demeanor crashes through the legal establishment's protocol and causes enough dislodging of their composure to interrupt the judicial monotony. Her unconventional, countervailing mode-of-procedure forces the court to weigh the case on its inherent merit and overrides usual imbalance of powers favoring top-dollar law firms and rich corporations that typically holds-court! <br/><br/>The injection of Erin the she-bear into the intransigent legal culture became the catalyst that cracked the defense and won the day for all of the exploited underdogs she so heartily and gallantly championed and for Erin, herself, as well. The citizens she victoriously fought for feel their esteem rise along with their 'Erin the hero'. <br/><br/>Women of the world, take heart. When a fortuitous crack opens in the masculine wall within structure of the world, be ready with your marching boots to charge through it!"

","The story behind this movie is one that just had to be filmed. This is the kind of true story that appeals to so many people that there is absolutely no-one who would dare NOT to make movie out of it. So there were two options, either it would be filmed with a rather big budget, getting a chance in the cinema's, either it would end up as a cheap TV-drama. The makers chose the first option and that's a good thing...<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich is an unemployed single mother. She's desperate to find a new job, but every interview ends up in disappointment because she doesn't have the right qualifications. And to make things worse for her, she also loses a lawsuit against a rich doctor who hit her in a car accident. She has no alternative left but to go to her lawyer and to 'ask' him for a job (threatening is a better word for it). She gets a job and while no-one takes her seriously, because of her trashy clothes and her lack of manners, she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Soon she discovers that the company is trying quietly to buy contaminated and polluted land in a residential area. But as she digs deeper, she finds enough evidence so the law company can sue the million-dollar corporation.<br/><br/>Normally I would say that the underdog is a likable figure and most of the time that is true, but not in this case. A woman that swears as much as the Erin Brockovich in this movie and who doesn't mind to be so aggressive to so many people, really isn't very lovable. At least not in my opinion. OK, she may have had a hard time, but that still isn't a good reason to act the way she does. (I really hope the real one isn't like that, because you can't buy style and class and this is really about as low as you can get).<br/><br/>About the acting I can be rather brief. Julia Robert's performance was decent, but certainly wasn't good enough to win an Oscar with it. Sure, it's the perfect role to seduce the Academy with, but all she really did was showing a lot of cleavage and talking dirty (which sometimes was really funny, but not always). All the other actors and especially Albert Finney, as the lawyer and head of the company, were OK. I don't really have any remarks on their performances. They weren't spectacular, but did what they had to do.<br/><br/>All in all this isn't a bad movie, but it certainly isn't worth all the awards that it received. This rather thin and, if I didn't know better, unbelievable story is pure TV-material. A bigger budget wasn't enough to make me forget about that. In the end this movie is worth a watch, but it certainly isn't as great as some people want you to believe. I give it a 7/10."

","This film really takes the best out of Julia Roberts: normally an awfully bad actress, she is, in the role of this bitchy, tackily-dressed proud mother-of-three, almost (but not quite) sort of good. The film is also a revelation in that it is the only Julia Roberts film with a somewhat sensible plot: amidst the wan (""Pretty woman""), banal (""Notting Hill"") and thoroughly idiotic (""Sleeping with the enemy"") movies in which we are used to see her, ""Erin Brockovich"" shines like a beacon. Still, there is far too much single-mother act, and far too much shrew-act in this movie for it to be thoroughly enjoyable, or even original. Some details are cute, though, like the abominable bad taste with which the protagonist is systematically dressed; the plot is mildly interesting, but its development is far too legal-oriented (a very common fault in Hollywood movies) while it could be a bit more centered on the human and ecological aspects of having an entire town poisoned by chromium VI. Altogether, this is an educational movie, which people with too much trust in corporate America should see, and which is certainly more interesting than the latest serially produced action movie. But don't expect a classic or anything like that: this is strictly a watch-once film."

","I think that it is safe to say that life kicks in many ways.  Ups and downs, sideways, even extreme left and right.  Julia Roberts in a biographical role was delightful!  There were many comments about the rough language, but let's face it....this is the language of the new millenium.  We ALL swear at some point.  Robert's portrayal of Brockovich can be summed up by saying that no matter how much life kicks you down, and no matter how hopeless the outlook may look....KEEP TRYING.  Don't give up without a good contestation. That being said, it is very admirable to see someone leading a hard knock life and realizing that there are people out there that have it much worse. Rather than in passing say that is sad, Brockovich set out to try to right a wrong that has been plaguing our entire country for decades.....destruction of our natural environment that brings on massive illness to a population. She enlisted help of professionals, and acted as a go between with each party lending encouragement, and relentlessness in the pursuit of justice--for lack of a better term.

","In all seriousness this film works because Julia Roberts shines in this role, in fact I don't think any other actress could have pulled it off. Now, I'll be the first to admit I never thought much of her. Aside from pretty woman, I thought she was over rated, but here she shows me what she can do. I couldn't help but fall in love with the sassy, humorous, intelligent, powerful, determined, character she portrayed. I think she and Albert Finney (always amazing) lift the film to heights it would not have reached. Director Steven Soderbergh holds this movie together well, though at times it seems to be losing the narrative momentum. The screenplay is laced with wonderful dialogue and the relationships are well thought out. Overall it works thanks to Julia, who puts it all together and turns in the performance of her career and creates one of the screens most memorable female roles since thelma & louise."

","2 1/2 Stars (out of 4):<br/><br/>      This film was greeted with a lot of acclaim and it was even nominated for an oscar, but I personally found it a little slow and boring. Julia Roberts' role as Erin Brockovitch, a poor but assertive single mom, earned her an oscar and I don't disagree that Roberts did a really good job. Based on a true story, Roberts plays the character with unusually dark notes in her crusade to win a lawsuit for a town who's suffered the side effects of pollution. However, Julia's frustration and anger at everyone else in the world for all her stress, got too repetitive for me. The element that kept the movie from not boring me out completely, aside from Erin Brockovitch's aggressiveness, was her relationship with eventual boss Ed (Albert Finney). Initially,  Ed is a lawyer who fails Brockovitch and enraged at being screwed over she forces him to give her a job there, so she can earn the money he owes. He reluctantly agrees, partly because of a thin layer of compassion under his inhumane lawyer mentality, and the working relationship between the two is very interesting and warm. In short, as a star vehicle for Julia Roberts to do something serious, yes, this works, but as a movie itself, only partially."

","We've all heard the story of Erin Brockovich by now: a plucky, down-on-her-luck single mom takes on an evil corporation, gloriously beats all the odds to avenge the humble townsfolk, and lives happily ever after. ""Kind of like David and what's-his-name!"" she exclaims at one point, and yes, a straightforward David and Goliath story is exactly what it is. The good guys are very very good; the bad guys are very very evil. There is no moral ambiguity here. ""Erin Brockovich"" is as black and white as an Oreo cookie, and as sugary.<br/><br/>That said, it isn't a badly made David and Goliath reenactment -- on the contrary, it is as polished and professional as a movie can get. Susannah Grant's screenplay is dutifully by-the-book in its tidy structure; setup, confrontation, and resolution are laid out with a correctness that would make Syd Field proud. Stephen Soderbergh's direction bathes everything in a comforting sunny glow. The good guys are played by attractive actors; the bad guys are all ugly and say things like, ""You can't scare us, we're a twenty-seven-million-dollar corporation!""<br/><br/>Julia Roberts as the eponymous heroine sure is plucky. She may be down on her luck, but she's got pluck coming out of her ears and cleavage. That's why she's able to curse so boldly at her evil male oppressors, even as she cares for her three obnoxiously angelic blonde children and wanders around doing what I guess is supposed to be housework. We know that a girl like that can't possibly lose in a movie like this, so all we have to do is sit back and wait for her to overcome her obstacles. Ms. Grant has, of course, kindly written in a love interest for her as a diversion from her relentless overcoming.<br/><br/>Ms. Roberts isn't exactly a brilliant actress. She's not, for example, Julianne Moore, who conveys infinite depths of subtle emotion with the tiniest twitch of her face. And I'm yet to be convinced that Roberts has any range. Still, I can't imagine anyone else in a role like this, because Julia Roberts can do what few actresses can: she can carry a movie. Erin Brockovich occupies every single scene here without a single consistent partner, which would be daunting for anyone, but Roberts confidently yanks hold of the screen and lets the movie hang on her like a flattering cashmere sweater. And she looks great in it, almost too great -- ""I can't even pay for my phone,"" she whines in one scene, but the camera is too busy noticing her gorgeously leggy figure to sympathize much. On the other hand, it would be nice to see a movie about the adventures of an average-looking middle-aged woman who actually does look like she's had three kids. (Shirley Valentine, where have you gone?)<br/><br/>The strange, nagging element of weirdness to ""Erin Brockovich"" is its unapologetically capitalist worldview. In this movie, litigation is presented as a means to an end, and the end is money. Mr. Soderbergh seems to assume that the proper response to any form of oppression is to press charges, and that enough money will assuage even the most grievous of injuries. Look at the face of that teary, frail wisp of a housewife (Humble Townsfolk Exhbit A) in the end, when she learns how much money she'll be awarded. The score swells; it's a glorious moment. Apparently she's forgotten that she and her entire family are still dying of cancer. Ah, the American dream."

Very watchable, but in my opinion, not deserving all the Oscar attention it got in 2001.<br/><br/>My gripe is two-fold. First, there is no real drama, no tension. Everything the heroine attempts works out great. Finds a job, finds an understanding boyfriend, gets the bad guys, gets rich. Maybe that's how it went down in real life, but it's not very dramatic (or comedic).<br/><br/>Secondly, even though this is not a romantic comedy it is still very much a Julia Roberts flick. Her smile and body (especially her breasts) are on constant display. This flick is her show through and through and everyone else is just a prop. <br/><br/>So, does this make it a bad movie?

","Erin Brockovich ,undoubtedly ,is one of the most amusing movies of Steven Soderbergh which I have ever seen.  Although it is still a Soderbergh movie with his familiar qualities.  And for those viewers who are not used to his slow-beating style of narration, it can be a little boring.  But if you put trust in his fame and glory as a new director who really has something to say, you may begin to feel more comfortable with his style.<br/><br/> Although I'm not one of the Soderbergh's fanatics, I admit that he has done a well job specially when considering the genre of the movie which is potentially a boring one.  Success of the movie in keeping the audience entertained is not only the result of directing but also that of screenplay which is a well-developed one.<br/><br/> Julia Roberts is astonishing. This time she comes out of the foolish girl personality of her romantic movies. Although The scene where she's discussing about her salary with Finney is full of nostalgia and takes us back to 'Pretty Woman' and her dealing with Richard Gere, here, we can see a mature woman in her. Lines of a mother's pain are quite visible in her face. In spite of some critics' anger, I believe she was well deserved of the Oscar that she received as the Best Leading Role actress.<br/><br/> The interesting thing is that the movie is not totally dependent on Roberts, since one man named Albert Finney makes one of the best supporting role performances ever.  He is very experienced and it's obviously visible that Soderbergh should have been quite satisfied. Finney has the role completely under his control.  Even if you are not much into Julia Roberts, Albert Finney's performance in Erin Brockovich is a must-see.  Aaron Eckhart is also fitted in his role and adds to the flavor.<br/><br/> Thomas Newman's rythmic theme is quite suitable for the atmosphere of the movie and remains in your ear at least for a couple of days and who knows maybe more!!<br/><br/> Erin Brockovich has 3 believable performances from the actors I've mentioned above.

I wouldn't call this film a ""legal"" drama, and I know it didn't actually attempt to be like Civil Action or a John Grisham film. But if failed as a film in my point of view.<br/><br/>First I didn't believe in Juila Roberts' character Erin Brokovich. The script centered around her and her actions in the film were very rich-characterized, but Julia Roberts looked like she was being thrown all over the place by the script, rather than actually being the character. The chracter seemed like a stereotype ditzy-mother-of-three-self-made-determined-foul-mouthed-character. It looked as if Julia Roberts was just trying to catch up to the script, rather than running nicely along with it. Juila Roberts just played the emotions of what the character went through, but she didn't play the character well.<br/><br/>Second, the stereotype issue came up again when the big-time-evil-corporation PG&E came up and their lawyers, and then the Viotelli(or something)who was another big time lawyer that Ed Masry had to join up with. The characters were very, very stereotyped that it was not believable that this was a true story even though it was, and it stated in the first frame of the film that the following story is all true.<br/><br/>Now, I'll just say something nice about the film. I loved Albert Finney! As a matter of fact that was the only good thing about the film. The film had its moments with snappy lines, but they and Al couldn't hold the film all by themselves.<br/><br/>Anyway, In the final verdict, I'd give this film two stars out of four. It had Al and snappy lines(actually there were a bunch that I liked, but anyway...) those two gave the two stars. But if you don't analyze the film into its core but just go with the flow type of movie-goer, this will be a descent choice to watch, but don't waste good money on this if you're like me or Roger Ebert or something. <br/><br/>** out of ****"

","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>ERIN BROCKOVICH is an overlong, routine star-turn for Julia Roberts. As Brockovich, Roberts shows the fashion sense of Cher, the vocabulary of Madonna (or Whoopi Goldberg), the sanctimony of Alan Alda, and the belligerence of Robert DeNiro (or Jack Klugman as QUINCY). A single mother with no education and trying to raise three children, Roberts/Brockovich struts around with a perpetual chip on her shoulder. To Roberts credit, she makes Brockovich understandable, though not overly likable (WAY too beligerant).  We also learn two heretofore undiscovered things about Roberts. She has a beauty mark (lovely spot, by the way), and she should NEVER again wear platform shoes.<br/><br/>Brockovich intimidates herself into a job as a legal aide, and quickly uncovers a coverrup involving Pacific Gas & Electric, horribly polluted water, and people dieing of cancer; all the while, PG&E is consciously covering all this up.  During the course of her crusade, Brokovich succeeds in neglecting her children and driving away the only worthwhile man in her life. And what about the people made sick by PG&E.  They are portrayed and whiny and passive.  Hasn't anyone ever heard of a picket line?  NOTHING would get in and out of the gates of PG&E if it were MY family dying from their criminal activity.<br/><br/>The movie reveals Brockovich received a $2,000,000 bonus for her work on this case.  Roberts received 20,000,000 to play her on screen. Couldn't these two great ""consumer advocates"" get together with their Hollywood friends and petition both California and the Federal Government to CRIMINALIZE the kinds of activities committed by PG&E?  Aren't there laws against reckless endangerment and fraud?  Oh well, enjoy the movie."

","A car accident propels the main character of ""Erin Brockovich"" into a legal crusade in the style of ""Norma Rae"" and ""Silkwood."" Julia Roberts plays Brockovich, who antagonizes everyone in the film except her kids, a saint-like Harley biker named George (Aaron Eckhart) and the people she represents for her law firm. Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Susannah Grant make amends on the acid Brockovich, who slings out foul language like a Richard Pryor album from the '70s. Just so you don't totally hate her character, Roberts gets sensitive and cries a lot when bad situations occur. The plot concerns Roberts, cussing her way as usual, into a job at the law firm of Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who delivers a veteran actor's performance). Once employed, Roberts uncovers disease and birth defects attributed to a large utility company in a small Southern California town. Eckhart, a good actor in this film, does not play a believable character. Supporting players are Marg Helgenberger, Cherry Jones, Tracey Walter, Jamie Harrold, Peter Coyote, Conchatta Ferrell and Mimi Kennedy.<br/><br/>Helgenberger is in need of more direction during her first scene in the film, but she later delivers a very convincing performance. Harrold at first delights as a Gen-Xer with sideburns down to his legs. Walter and Ferrell, both gifted actors, are sadly there just to move the plot along, and Coyote takes a break from commercial voice-overs to actually appear on-screen somewhere. Thomas Newman's music and Soderbergh's direction are low-key, manipulating every scene to the sympathetic Brockovich character. Julia Roberts fans will not be disappointed. Non-fans might be surprised at her acting skills."

Such is the case with Erin Brokovich.  What a woman!  As portrayed in this film Erin Brokovich ( Julia Roberts) has a great figure amply displayed to the other employees and clients and commonly referred to as her secret weapon.  Julia Roberts gives a whirlwind performance as a single mother punctuating every outburst with repeated expletives.<br/><br/>I do doubt the probability of a mother with three very young children allowing a biker with a Harley Davidson to watch over her children during her working day.  And what private  or government authority would allow a stranger to spend hours looking through confidential documents  held in their filing system.  But it makes a great story and the odd characters that pop up in various parts of the film give little gem performances.<br/><br/>Serious aspects of the film involve a court case about compensation for the horrible deaths of people exposed to contaminated water in their daily lives.  We get a chemistry lesson too about the various forms of chromium and their relative biological toxicities.<br/><br/>But when the film is over and the credits roll it's Julia Roberts as the central character we remember.

This is by no means to say that Erin Brockovich is a bad movie, in fact it's a pretty good one, but I'm still not sure it was worthy of all the acclaim it got.  My main problem  was there were no moments that were really defining or dramatic and although at the end the evil corporation has to fork out almost $400 million (the largest ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit), that would mean nothing to a $28 billion company.  There's not much courtroom drama, in fact there's hardly any, director Steven Sodenberg chose to focus on Robert's character and the people she affected.  The one thing that really impressed me about this movie was Julia Robert's performance.  We are so used to seeing her play the same innocent characters in all of her films, that it started to seem like that was all she could do. With this role she proves she actually can act, and does it quite well. She is thourally convincing as Brockovich and is the main reason this movie works (she's also the reason why it made so much).

","Steven Soderberg's extremely satisfying film about an unlikely crusader pitted against a mammoth corporation that has lied to its neighbors about their well-being may seem like a Julia Roberts showcase but Soderberg manages to use Roberts as one of many colors in his pastoral of an America where justice can be served. Not that Roberts is ignored or wasted: unlike 1999's manipulative ""Notting Hill"" she is forced to shed her star quotient in order to let her beauty serve the film's main character. As a put-upon former beauty queen desperate to find meaning in her life while trying to impart social values on her children, Roberts' feisty, no-nonsense determination becomes such an admirable quality that it actually makes her more beautiful than she's ever seemed; the film's last shot frames her in such a devastating way that you can't help but be swept away by such a complete characterization. Susannah Grant's sarcastic but perceptive screenplay gives Roberts the lines needed to make her be absolutely inspiring.

Warning: She does have an acid tongue though! She says whatever comes into her mind, and is very ambituous in her job, she literally pours herself into this case. This film was much more convincing that ""A Civil Action"" in the way that it was not too bogged down with unnecessary emotion and characters and the story was more believable. The direction and plot follow very smoothly, and you feel sympathy for Erin. She has no education, 3 kids, has been divorced twice, and is $17,000 in debt. However, she gets involoved in this case, and makes a difference in her life and the lives around her. This is Julia's best performance in the last few years and she should feel proud of herself for playing a real-life woman with just the right emotion, character and believeableness.

Ms. Roberts leans and lifts, stretches her range from push-up to maidenform, flirts with lycra and beaded fringes, and quite early in the story bravely takes on a very tacky cardigan.  She thrusts her talent into prominence, in a performance which must certainly be a Golden Globes contender.<br/><br/>Don't expect more from this movie than Sports Illustrated with a social conscience, and you won't be disappointed.  It's well-made, underlining director Soderbergh's talent, and the two hours running time never flags. Sadly nothing in either the script or main character really demands big screen attention.  It's an issue-of-the-week TV movie raised mysteriously beyond its slender substance into an A-list star vehicle.  If you remember Michael J. Fox's comic turn in ""The Hard Way"", you might take a guess at the behind the scenes story of a popcorn movie megastar who wanted to play a ""real"" person.<br/><br/>To be fair, the story does touch on some genuine issues for working single mothers, although I'm not sure many would agree swearing like a trouper really gets to the heart of their situation.

","I cannot believe the abomination that is Erin Brockovich. This is a $100 million+ grossing wretched trash catered to the audience in the same fashion as Patch Adams. Anybody who loathes the manipulative, vulgar  and sentimental Patch Adams will hate Erin Brockovich as well.<br/><br/>Steven Soderbergh directed this saponaceous and sanitized Hollywood version after his botched effort The Limey and he does with his annoying guerilla cinematic gimmicks as usual -- which is also an irritating factor of the film.<br/><br/>What really grates my nerve the most is not only Julia Roberts' bizarre and over-the-top portrayal of the real-life Erin Brockovich whose attitude and lifestyle are rude, irresponsible and repugnant but also the fact Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter seem to believe this is an important ""message movie"". If that's the actual intent of the film, then it fails because it definitely isn't the emotionally intense and sympathetic movie unlike Michael Mann's brilliant film The Insider. It just ends up cumbersome and retch-inducing with the forced ""stand-up-and-cheer happy ending"" that borders on utter audience manipulation. These and the steady stream of coarse and vulgar language throughout the movie -- especially in the scenes where Erin cuss at her kids and desecrated over 600 clients with her ""sexual favor"" reference intended as a sarcastic joke -- made me despise the movie with vehemence. If this movie was meant to reflect the exhibition of the vulgar attitude by the real-life Erin Brockovich, then I have no respect for her as an intelligible human being whatsoever.  <br/><br/>Any movie glorifying the cynical attitude of the characters and screwed-up lifestyles like the ghastly overrated American Beauty do not deserve my respect. This movie is an insult to my perceptive sense of common sense, decency and intelligence."

And then their biker friends just vanish? This all seemed awfully conveeeeenient. Then the movie trotted out the cliche that corporations are evil and that an in-your-face attitude is worth more than an education and practical experience.

"FlickJunkie-2","8","0","1","16 August 2000"," Julia Roberts gives a breakout performance
","Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that utility giant PG&E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.<br/><br/>The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.<br/><br/>Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in `The Limey'.  His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says ""DIRTY"") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.<br/><br/>Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Albert Finney also gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific chemistry.<br/><br/>Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his rebellious culture. However, I put more of the responsibility for this on the director than the actor. <br/><br/>This is an excellent story that is well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity, I recommend it highly"

","There's no way you could fail to be aware that this is a 'well meaning' movie. Unfortunately it's also a badly scripted, sloppily directed movie, which completely destroys its own credibility in the first ten minutes, and then does absolutely nothing to re-establish any credibility for the rest of its excessive length. Let me make myself quite clear here - I'm not commenting whatsoever on the facts of the ""true story"" on which this movie is based... that's another issue entirely (but listening to the real Erin Brockovich on the DVD... now I don't claim to know all the facts or anything... but she was sure infinitely more credible than anything in the film itself). The movie doesn't need any facts to refute it - it's so flawed that it thoroughly refutes itself. If you're the kind of person who finds the incoherent and self-contradictory ramblings of drunks on public transit entirely fascinating and believable, then this movie is for you. Everyone else - forget it... unless you really need another reminder of how obscene it is that Julia Roberts is pretty close to being the highest paid actor on the planet (not that she can't act - she can, up to a point... she's just nowhere near that good). And just in case you saw the trailers and the posters and were wondering - no Ms. Roberts' stunt mammaries are not enough to save the picture."

","Nice entertainment, but junk science. Story of a crusading paralegal (Julia Roberts) who convinces the residents of Hinkley California that they should sue Pacific Gas and Electric Company for poisoning their water supply with hexavalent chromium. Tries to exploit the emotions of the audience. The whole story is not very credible. For example, the Erin Brockovich in the movie acts, dresses and speaks like a street hooker (look at the side bar picture of Julia Roberts on the IMDB web page). What kind law firm would hire such a person?  Unfortunately this film has been put out as a true story, it uses the names of real people, and targets a real company. The real Brockovich writes letters to newspapers reasserting the truth of movie. When watching a movie one's critical faculties are generally suspended, otherwise you can't be entertained. But stop and think about a few things. Could hexavalent chromium really cause such plethora of different diseases? Usually a toxic agent causes a specific disease with an incident rate proportional to the dosage. What about the incidence rates of these diseases in Hinkley, how do they compare to communities with uncontaminated water? What dosage would specific organs get from waterborne contamination of hexavalent chromium at the concentrations asserted in the film. In real life the law firm got about 1/3 of the settlement with PG&E, around $130 million, how many hours did they work for that bounty? Erin got $2 million for a couple of years work. How much did the sick people get? Unfortunately people will take the film as more than a piece of (pretty good) entertainment and form opinions. Another disservice to the viewing public from Hollywood."

"mjanky","6","0","2","13 June 2000"," Plenty of eye candy, but not enough meat.
","I went to see this movie because of all the buzz about Julia Robert's Oscar worthy performance. After it was over, I believe Albert Finney was better. Not that Julia's bad, but we've seen this character before, Sally Field in Norma Rae and Meryl Streep in Silkwood, come to mind. The only difference is the southern accent that Julia Roberts smartly declined to use. Even the plots are similar; White trash woman, ignores her kids and her man because of her cause against the big mean Corporation. I do think that Julia is by far the most attractive of the bunch however. Out of the 50+ costume changes she makes in this movie (with only $74 in the bank I might add) all but two of them have her breasts popping out at all angles. I think the makers of the film made a conscious decision to have Julia parade around in sexy outfits to keep our mind off of the boring plot-line. There was never a doubt in my mind how the movie would turn out, and the fact that it was based on a true story didn't make any difference from the re-treads coming out of Hollywood for a while now (look for the real Erin Brokovich doing a cameo as a waitress in a restaurant. She's no Julia!). Erin Brokovich's cause was to bring suit against a power company for contaminating a community with chemicals it uses in its plant. The problem is the movie attempts to show you almost every victim of the contamination until the audience gets jaded and numb and it loses its impact. The movie would have been better if it had focused on one family or victim, like the child who is suffering from cancer. I wanted to feel for the victims, but it's hard to give emotion to 600+ people in a two hour movie. The sub-plots were weak as well, although the character of George, the Harley riding, lover/baby-sitter/maid was refreshing. I gave this movie a rating of 6 because of the performances and in spite of the story. I think by year's end there will be performances by actresses more deserving of the Oscar than Julia, but she should get a special award for most frequent use of the ""F-Word"" by an actress."

","[MILD SPOILER MAYBE]Big evil corporate America abuses little guy America.  What a novel concept, I hadn't heard that one before.  Perhaps we should plum this line of inquiry to see if there are other examples.  Once again Leftywood shows us just how lucky citizens of Mother Russia (until that stupid revolution), Red China, North Korea, Cuba, and other bastions of enlightenment really are.  There are no evil corporations or corrupt businessmen to harm anyone in those safe havens.  The fact their citizens risk limb and life to escape paradise and come to abusive America not withstanding.  If you read any defense of P.G.& E. and the corporate executives responsible for the portrayed acts and subsequent cover up in these remarks, don't.  Is it even necessary to say that these criminals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law?  No mercy.  No how. Well.then why.make such remarks? Would this be a sufficient reason?  ERIN BROCKOVICH is a silly and mindless one dimensional (poor people are good, rich people are bad) claptrap of a film that uses manipulative emotions, a rude and vulgar antihero, lies, and cleavage to tell it's tale.  The manipulative emotions are hardly worth exploring since they fairly drip off the screen in every scene.  It turns what could have been, no, should have been, drama into sap.  If our hero is not rude and vulgar then I'll just eat breakfast.  When you don't have much else going for you rude and vulgar is good cover.  Apparently kidnapped early in life by the CIA, or some other nefarious arm of American injustice, she was forced to marry a worthless man who beat her.  It gets worse.  After escaping this terrible fate (I think he left her) those same evil brutes tracked her down and make her do it again (Bastards!).  They also made her have three children, which she could not provide a proper home for.  Hey it wasn't her fault.  She was in no way responsible for her lot in life.  I'm even sorry I brought it up. Fortunately, she meets her prince charming (the slacker biker who doesn't work 'cause he don't by god have to) and he saves the day.  Well.for a while anyway until nature (the road) calls.  Before prince charming goes split-city we are treated to some tender moments of passion twix the two lovers.  One line I found particularly poignant, not to mention prophetic was ''Please, don't tell me that you are somebody I'm going to have to get over"".  Gag me with a spoon.  Did I mention the cleavage?  I like to think of it as the glue that holds the whole work together.  If God had created Woman with three breast instead of two this movie would not have been made for 200-300 years.  It would have taken that long for camera technology to catch up.  In sum if you are sympathetic to the political, social and cultural underpinnings of this film you will leave the theater a happy camper, if not proceed with caution.  You have been warned."
"Shawn Stingel","10","0","1","3 May 2000"," Julia Robert's over-the-top portrayal of the real Erin Brockovich, which could land the actress her 3rd Oscar nomination
","The pretty woman's portrayal in this true story about a woman who discovers that an industrial plant is secretly polluting the residences' groundwater in Hinkley is nothing short of spectacular. Boasting with sex appeal, a million dollar smile, and an enhancing bra, Roberts delivers a performance that shows off her ubiquitous talent, which could earn the runaway bride her third Oscar nomination. ""Brockovich,"" helmed by acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh (""Out of Sight""), benefits as well from being based on a true story that doesn't wander off into an oblivious fog, a very difficult and controversial subject to handle (see ""The Hurricane"" and ""The Insider""). Although Roberts' role may be the film's selling point, the fact that she is portraying a real woman with a profound livelihood deserves a little more attention than her wide grin. Erin is a torn woman, one who has been stretched to the brink of exhaustion as evidenced by her struggling attempt to keep food on the table for her three kids while fumbling through job ads. We can relate to people like Erin, and it's because of her willingness and ability to project a rather intimidating image that she is able to get what she wants and not take 'no' for an answer. She's a true inspirational hero, a woman who crosses the boundaries for a people suffering from the suit-driven executives of a billion-dollar corporation. Julia Roberts, tell Benjamin Bratt you may have to cancel dinner; you just might have a date with a stud named Oscar."

PG&E have been polluting a small town in the California desert for years, and it's time to pay.  More enjoyable even than Roberts' performance is that of Albert Finney as the head of the law firm.

Plot perfunctory but fun, acting, especially Julia Roberts, a surprising joy. Main reason the film is a must, of course, is Steven Soderbergh, catching up on Tim Burton as America's greatest director, here enjoying flexing his considerable creative muscles in a populist woman's picture - his 'cubist' editing; his sense of the wide American outdoors and minutae of domestic life (in a hilariously Hollywood version of the working class); his sardonic visual jokery (those skyscraper shots); his continued interest in parents and children (see THE LIMEY, THE GREEN ROOM); his refusal to patronise his heroine."

But, it's not all wrong with this picture. At the end it gave me a good feeling, but it still looked a lot like A Civil Action.

Erin discovers some old case about some former client wanting to get more money for her house that the nearby watertreatment wants to buy.

Hollywood loves these movies.  It seems this role was perfectly tailored for Roberts.  Finney is good a her boss too.  The movie is somewhat interesting but I didn't feel the need to route for the good guy, or get seriously pumped or motivated by the film.  I didn't find it that humourous either considering that Erin is portrayed as someone with a very short fuse and acid-tongue.  The only scene I got a good laugh out of was when the legal team from the chemical corporation was coming in to the small private firm.  In some quick thinking to show that the small firm wasn't going to be bullyed, they get half of the clerical staff to dress up like lawyers and walk in the meeting room as a combined show of force.

Well, nothing bad if that's what you're wondering. Julia Roberts' enormous on screen presence and her trademark billion watt smile could have potentially overshadowed the story and everyone else in this movie...but it didn't. This movie was entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>Erin Brockovich (played by Julia Roberts) is a single mom down on her luck. Despite repeated efforts to land a job she always ends up being rejected. She has a very minimalist way of dress and her skills in the social graces department are a little on the lacking side but her determination and resourcefulness ultimately land her a job with a law firm. Not too soon after her employment she begins to work on a case. What should have been a routine file/case prep turns out to be something more. After a little research, Brockovich discovers many peculiarities about the case and, with her boss's permission, begins to look into matters a little deeper. Despite her appearances, this woman is obviously very bright. She is not above using questionable means to get what she needs and will not take any bullying from anyone, including her boss. As her investigation continues she discovers that a large corporation is trying to cover-up their illegal dumping practices by offering to buy all the property surrounding one of their plants. Hundreds of people who live in the area are inflicted with life threatening diseases and Erin discovers that the two are not unrelated. The rest of the story depicts the progression of the case but beyond the case, you will find yourself riveted to this woman's dynamic and interesting character.<br/><br/>Although the movie focuses around Brockovich's work on this case, the director does an even better job showing this woman's personality. You see this woman pass through the whole gamut of emotions and her effect on those around her. Having never met the real Brockovich, I have no frame of reference but if Roberts' performance is any indication, this is one interesting lady. I've seen most of Roberts' films and I have to say without a doubt, this is her best work yet. Unfortunately this movie came out a little late or I believe you have seen Julia Roberts' name listed as one of the Oscar nomination for ""Best Female Actor"".<br/><br/>This movie wouldn't have been anywhere near this good if Roberts' didn't have an excellent supporting cast. This is especially the case for two actors, Albert Finney (plays Ed Masry - Brockovich's boss) and Aaron Eckly (plays George - Brockovich's boyfriend). Quite a bit of the more emotional scenes that Roberts is involved in includes one of these two actors and I found them to be very well done. Especially the chemistry that supposedly exists between Brockovich and her boss, Masry. This definitely shone through in the movie in particular the ending. You'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie.
