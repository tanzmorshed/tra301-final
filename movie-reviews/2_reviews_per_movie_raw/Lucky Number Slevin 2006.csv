","I've never been motivated to leave a review here based on reading others, but the slamming of LNS is beyond accepting. The movie has a style that may, if fact, be borrowed from many other sources, but when it's on the screen, it feels complete as its' own. While the connections are not as surprising as some may say, they are certainly not spelled out for the viewer.<br/><br/>The dialog is a bit kitchy, but there in lies the movies' charm. Reviewers stuck on the believability factor of such dialog seem to be limiting themselves to one cine-style that we'd be limiting ourselves to only 5% (I'm making up that number) of accessible films.<br/><br/>LNS is a fun thinking mans' thriller that is witty, fast fasted, stylishly interesting and ENTERTAINING!!! That's what I want out of a movie, entertainment.... for those who are looking for reality, read the papers, watch CNN, take a walk in somebody else's' neighborhood. For those who like slick mysteries with interesting dialog rent or buy Lucky Number Sleven"

","I really felt i needed to write this comment, because the one just before made me so angry. If the prior user had paid a little more attention to this film he would have noticed how intricate and brilliant the plot was. I don't want to give anything away of this film, but i strongly recommend this film to anyone. I would agree that you spend the first 20 minutes in confusion because of its fast paced plot, but by the end, your sympathies for individual characters are all over the place. ALl i can say is go and see it, and give it your full attention, then you wouldn't be on this website, saying ""it doesn't make sense"". Enjoy the film, 10/10"
"Youkilledmypine","8","298","440","2 March 2006"," A welcome surprise, Slevin has appeared as if from nowhere.
","Bruce Willis, Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci and Josh Hartnett fill a cast line up every bit as impressive as say, Sin City. Leaving behind the sour taste of Wicker Park, Scottish McGuigan follows the likes of his own Gangster Number 1 with this incredibly cool, at times funny thriller that has somehow sneaked into the cinemas without much of a fuss. Supporting cast includes a very welcome cameo from a Jackie Brown star and a bunch of UK actors imitating their US counterpart's accents to perfection. The pairing of Sir Ben and Freeman alone is worth the price of admission, but this is Hartnett(as Slevin)'s film and perhaps it should not be too surprising that he carries it off effectively. In fact, none of the cast really put a foot wrong and even Lucy Liu is pretty adorable (against type if you believe the all the press).<br/><br/>Despite a reasonably confusing series of opening events, Slevin is essentially a straight forward, neat black comedy of errors(mistaken identity for one). The dialogue is at times razor sharp and the action is well shot. The body count climbs steadily as the movie progresses at a cracking pace that never becomes dull. Slevin is thematically similar to a few other choice stories, but like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang - Slevin should be enjoyed more for the ride and the audience should try not to guess ahead of the plot and let it unfold naturally. There will still be some surprises appearing even for the most avid film fans but like so many thrillers Slevin could be ruined from word of mouth. If it weren't for the warm, familiar feel of similar films, this little gem would be rated higher. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing, wrongly compared to the legendary Usual Suspects - it's a league apart from the mess that was Revolver and doesn't outstay a welcome.<br/><br/>Oh, and Willis gets to call someone a 'f*** head'. Great stuff."
"wmjaho","8","350","523","22 January 2006"," Wow! Great Noir Caper Flick
","2006 Sundance Film Festival From the opening scene in Lucky Number Slevin, you will be straining to keep up. People are getting killed left and right, and it's never clear until the end of the movie how they are all connected. But you know it fits somehow and Scottish director Paul McGuigan (Wicker Park) manages to keep you guessing while firmly grabbing your attention and holding it with hardly a second to take a breath.<br/><br/>In the film noir tradition, but with the intense and graphic violence of the Lock Stock and Layer Cake genre, Slevin is really a caper movie, and frankly reminded me more of The Sting than anything else. It dances nimbly from grisly stomach-churning action to clever and light-hearted banter. This could only be accomplished by a truly incredible cast, led by Josh Hartnett in an outstanding performance, great work by Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis doing his thing, and supported by the always excellent Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. There's even a little time for Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>Liu plays Lindsay, the next-door-neighbor/natural sleuth/coroner/love interest who discovers Slevin in her neighbor Nick's apartment. They mystery that immediately engages her is what happened to Nick, who never shows up. However, plenty of people do show up, mistaking Slevin for Nick, and before long he is neck deep in murder contracts, called debts and warring gang factions. Hartnett plays the role to perfection. I've never seen him this good. He is both convincing and empathetic as a glib, fearless victim of mistaken identity, yet filled with confidence that he can make his plan work.<br/><br/>This is a terrific film, assuming you can stomach the bloody violence. The pieces fit neatly together (well, I have one bone to pick with the scriptwriter, but it would be revealing too much to share it). I highly recommend Lucky Number Slevin."

","The subject says it all...<br/><br/>This is a good, fast paced thriller... It would have been a really good thriller if it were not for the graphic scenes at the start of the movie, but once you get through that and a little bit of the confusion, this movie picks up very well...<br/><br/>I don't want to mention any thing about the story, I think there is enough mentioned already at the plot summary and that's all you need to know.<br/><br/>But trust me, do not believe people that say this is a bad movie... it is better than the many garbage movies that come out nowadays.. the acting and suspense is solid across the board. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are good, but the trump has to be Josh Harnett. He was good.<br/><br/>Like I said, the only bad point of this movie are the graphic scenes at the start..

"mikehammond8","8","153","236","17 July 2006"," Nice one Bruce. And the rest.
","Impressively cast, well acted, funny and cleverly written dark comedy that is definitely worth a look. Keeping company with legends such as Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis (who has been taking more and more great roles recently), Josh Hartnett takes the lead in the title role and plays it well. Freeman and Kingsley are as ever faultless and brilliant. Willis is fantastic in this kind of role. The dark, understated, non-action-blockbuster, big cast thrillers suit him well. Keep it up Bruce. To top off this top-notcher, Lucy Lui is looking gorgeous in her role as the love interest. I look forward to watching more films by Paul McGuigan, a director I'd previously been unaware of. Rent it as soon as you can."
"tburke85","7","36","51","17 June 2009"," Lucky Number Slevin An Impressive Action Crime Thriller
","Lucky Number Slevin is an impressive action crime thriller with some flaws but the good outweighs the bad in this one. Director Paul McGuigan is admirable in making this movie about a guy named Slevin who after a case of mistake identity finds himself caught in the middle of a war between two rival crime bosses known as The Rabbi and The Boss. Josh Hartnett is good as Slevin who may know more about his situation than he's letting on or maybe not. Hartnett proves to be effective in the role. Morgan Freeman is great as The Boss but he isn't given much to do. The same can go for Ben Kinsgley as The Rabbi but he like Freeman still make the best of their villain roles. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, and Bruce Willis as a hit-man are solid as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The few action sequences are well executed and the intricate but not too complicated plot keeps your interest. Despite some flaws with character development, this movie was better than expected. Overall Lucky Number Sleven is a good action crime thriller with an interesting premise and exceptional performances by the cast who making it a movie worth the time to watch."

","If you like movies that make you think you will enjoy this film. Josh Hartnett stars as ""Slevin"" a guy who is down on his luck and gets mistaken for someone else, or does he...from the moment that the mob bosses get a hold of Slevin the movie turns into one big guessing game. If you are like me you will find yourself thinking and trying to figure out what exactly is going on, but you probably will never understand until all is explained in the brilliant climax ending of the film. I honestly can say that when you walk out of the theater you can say to whomever it is that you went to see this movie with that it was truly a great movie. Now I was lucky enough to have seen this at a screening back in December, and the entire theater started to applaud at the conclusion of the film. If you like mysteries definitely check this one out...and just by the slim chance that the reviews are mixed or not that great I will at least tell you from an avid movie lover to give this a chance and you will not regret it"

","Our story began in the mind of writer Jason Smilovic and later directed well in the movie called "" Lucky Number Slevin "" by Paul McGuigan. It relates the story apparently initiated through mistaken identity. A traveler visiting a friend accepts an invitation to stay at an apartment in another city. Once there however, he meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu) a sexy next door neighbor, is slugged and mugged in broad daylight just before he is kidnapped and threatened with death if he doesn't pay a great debt and do a favor for The 'Boss', a local Godfather (Morgan Freeman). However, he also realizes, in order to fulfill the command, he must kill a total stranger for 'The Rabbi' a rival Godfather (Ben Kingsley). The reason for the duel threat dates back some twenty years and involves a professional Hit-man named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis). The film is briefly confusing and further muddled if the audience doesn't pay close attention to the interesting players. Although a serious feature, the inclusion of dark comedy makes for a black situation which is flavored with fast action and hard hitting excitement. Josh Hartnett, plays Slevin Kelevra and holds his own against the heavyweight stars of the movie. All in all, an unexpected and wonderful movie recommended for the thinking audience. The result, . . . a Classic in the making. ****"
"blairgallop7","10","8","10","25 August 2007"," The Wrong Man is the Right Movie
","Lucky Number Slevin(released as the Wrong Man in Australia) is a brainteaser of a crime-thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end about what is going on from the start.It is about a guy by the name of Slevin Kelevra(played brilliantly by Josh Hartnett) who gets confused with a loser gambler by the name of Nick Fisher.Because of this mistaken identity crisis,Slevin is immediately found in a long standing feud between two crime lords known as The Rabbi(Ben Kingsley) and The Boss(Morgan Freeman).Slevin also has to deal with the likes of Detective Brikowski(Stanley Tucci)who is trying to put all the pieces together,Mr.Goodkat/Smith(played by Bruce Willis)who is also involved in all of this and Lindsay(Lucy Liu)who is also trying to figure what is going on as she is an amateur detective/mortician and she usually gets the dead bodies to investigate in which Brikowski sometimes overlooks her duties.But it was a great film nonetheless as it makes references to other films,etc."
"Clownbaby124","10","6","7","6 January 2016"," Ten years later and I still love seeing this film
","Much like Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) Slevin tells the story about an average man (Josh Hartnett) who gets caught in an intricate and equally deadly web involving rival gangsters (Freeman, Kinsgley), a shady detective (Tucci), a world-renowned hit-man (Willis) and an irresistible girl-next-door type (Liu). <br/><br/>I first saw this film when it was released on DVD. The sad part of it being that it was in the Wal-Mart discount bin, A display that everyone knows is filled with either really old movies or really bad ones. Being equipped with a five-dollar bill and no knowledge of the movie, I decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few hours later, and I was taken aback by what I had just watched. Lucky Number Slevin completely took me for a ride.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in an isolated airport terminal, with a wheelchair bound Bruce Willis telling a bystander a story about a horrific crime that took place years before. The story of the past crime deserves your attention as it will set up the rest of the movie and the events that unfold. <br/><br/>There are a lot of elements that make this movie a joy to watch. <br/><br/>First off, the acting talent. Hartnett didn't play his typical teenage heartthrob role, Freeman played a cold-blooded gangster opposite of Kingsley's conflicted Rabbi gangster, Willis did his thing and blew stuff up and Tucci played a hard-boiled detective with a shady past. And then there's Lucy Liu. <br/><br/>Secondly, the direction. Paul McGuigan used his trademark style and perfectly blended action with suspense, mystery and the right amount of wit. Anyone who isn't familiar with his work should take a few days and binge watch BBC's Sherlock as he has been the one to helm a majority of the episodes. <br/><br/>Lastly, the writing. Jason Smilovic, who has done only television before and after this film, really knew what he wanted to accomplish with a premise that's been played out. He successfully wrote a complex tale that includes the the twists and turns one would expect in a movie about mistaken identity. He was also able to pull off writing an ending that comes full circle without confusing the audience. <br/><br/>In summation, Lucky Number Slevin teaches an old dog new tricks. The acting style of Hartnett is greatly complimented by two Oscar winners (Freeman, Kinsgley). Stylish action scenes don't seem over the top and aren't used as a filler (cough Michael Bay cough) and lastly the ending, while dark, will surprise and please the audience.<br/><br/>IMDb gave Lucky Number Slevin a 7.8 out of 10. I'll agree with their score but why not just give it an 8? While it may have won the praise of critics, it was given a limited release that didn't allow the film to be properly recognized.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie before I highly recommend you do, it's a blast. This movie is definitely worth your time."

"maxwellsmart","5","133","247","11 April 2006"," Another case of Usual Suspects Syndrome
","Lucky Number Slevin is the latest in a long line of movies that try to outdo everything else out there in the cleverness department and as a result, seems overdone. Ever since The Usual Suspects, it seems that more and more movies have become too desperate to trick or mislead the audience, and it seems that the people making these movies usually fail to realize what made the movies they're trying to emulate effective in the first place. The Usual Suspects was effective in misleading the audience because the plot is free of holes, and there is one well thought out twist that is believable and makes for a great ending. What happens in Lucky Number Slevin is that the twists are too plentiful, and the ones that aren't predictable are often trivial; they end up having very little impact and aren't satisfying. <br/><br/>The ending to Lucky Number Slevin is given away very early on. An astute viewer who has become used to seeing this type of movie will pick up on it right away. All that's left to us is to figure out which piece of the convoluted puzzle will be laid down next.<br/><br/>The dialogue tries relentlessly to be witty, to varying degrees of success. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's downright tedious. The first scene in which Slevin meets the Rabbi is an example of the high, the first scene with Slevin meeting Lindsey is the low.<br/><br/>Director Paul McGuigan emulates Guy Ritchie's stylish visuals to some success, and guides the film about as well as the material allows. The saving grace here is the characters. Slevin, The Rabbi, The Boss and Goodkat all stand out, and Hartnett, Kingsley, Freeman and Willis all turn in commendable and charismatic performances. But by the end, particularly if you've figured out the scam from early on, the movie becomes a bit tiresome, not offering up any real surprises. While Lucky Number Slevin is not without its good points, at the end it seems like another case of a movie trying to be too clever for its own good, another movie with multiple twists that fail to result in any real surprises, and that just aren't that satisfying. As a viewer, the final result is ""a been there, done that too many times"" feeling, even though the film is not without its moments"
"PersianPlaya408","10","7","9","17 October 2007"," Amazing film from McGuigan, 3 thumbs up
","Everything about this crime/film noir/comic adaptation by Paul McGuigan is what its supposed to be. Don't be mislead by the IMDb rating of 7.8... it should be higher. I liked this film way more than even Sin City (one of my favorites) or 300 (which i rated at 9/10). This film was directed very well, written superbly by Smilovic and shot very well stylistically by Peter Sova. I thought Hartnett was good in the lead but the standouts were Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as mob bosses from two rival families (blacks and jews), and also Bruce Willis as hit-man, Mr. Goodkat. Lucy Liu was also surprisingly not annoying here. THis film is one of my instant favorites.<br/><br/>--- IMDb Rating-- 7.8, my rating: 10/10"

You may be surprised of what you have been missed.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis was the coolest of the bunch. Josh Hartnett was the biggest astonishment. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley are on top form.

"barrettashby","10","21","35","28 June 2010"," Slevin vs. Suspects
","(one quick thing when watching: don't make the same huge mistake Roger Ebert did and expect Lucky Number Slevin to be a serious movie, the triviality of the characters is meant to be that way)<br/><br/>Almost every thriller is set up so you know there is a twist coming. What makes a thriller stand out is when you forget it's a thriller. Fight Club is just an epic fighting movie. Memento makes you concerned with figuring out what's going on, much like he is trying to do. The Usual Suspects has you guessing at how the boat incident came to be and who Keyser Soze is. All of them make you forget you're watching a thriller, and just leave you concerned with what is happening instead of what will end up happening. Lucky Number Slevin does this brilliantly. With one of the best scripts I've ever heard (the film style and transitions are just as poetic), a very unique and entertaining set up for a story, and a constant introduction of interesting characters, it makes you forget why any of it is related to the opening scenes. Whether or not you love the movie, you must respect what a masterpiece it is, the amount of thought that went into every line and transition is impressive and if you consider yourself a critic in any sense you won't be let down.<br/><br/>Now as far as Lucky Number Slevin being compared to The Usual Suspects, I think Slevin trumps. If any comparison is to be made, it's that Slevin fixed all the problems with Suspects. In the first five minutes I knew who the mastermind was because they showed him and had him talk, one of the most obvious things I've ever seen. Slevin doesn't do that, only one face is shown and that's because he is telling the story. Also, Suspects doesn't have anything really unique to it, the structure isn't that special, and besides a few good quotes it can't compare to Slevin. Slevin and Suspects are completely different, and I would never think judge one from the other. If you want to see a pioneer for thrillers, see Suspects. If you want to experience a script, story, and film style come together virtually flawlessly, see Slevin."
"arichmondfwc","5","113","231","8 April 2006"," Josh Harnett vs The New Trend
","""Lucky Number Slevin"" feels like the thesis of a promising film student from the P T Anderson/ Quentin Tarantino school of smart ass film-making. To tell you the truth, I'm getting a bit too tired of this clever, oh so clever style of narration. The dialog, coming out of Freeman and Kingsley mouth is as fun as it is meaningless. Absurd without being Ionesco absurd. Absurd but self consciously so. After a little while you're way ahead of the characters - not plot wise naturally, but style wise. You know is going to be one of those movies trying to be those other movies. That in itself makes the experience rather frustrating. Thank God for Josh Harnett. He is an actor that manages to remind you of all those greats icons of the past and at the same time he's an original. The fact that I could actually see this movie again just to look at him, makes me think he'll be a huge star. The kind of star the people remember and loves, generation after generation. I wish he manages to find his Elia Kazan."
"tributarystu","6","79","160","29 June 2006"," Connecting the Dots
","Like any sweet, short story about murder and revenge, ""LNS"" likes to connect the dots. It's a healthy principle in screen writing (and in the writing of any sort of story) as long as one knows how to achieve a desired effect. And the desired effect is generally the long lasting effect.<br/><br/>LNS is a cool little joint of a movie, studded with stars galore. Which, of course, makes it a pleasurable view. Or at least for me it always does; how else could you define a film with Bruce Willis, Ben Kingsly and (the ever present, if I may say so) Morgan Freeman? Yeah, sure, stars generally ruin movies by being a part of them. But that's only the case if the movie tries to be a serious lesson of morale and virtue. Which LNS does not.<br/><br/>And that's why it's cool. A very well conceived popcorn flick, which connects all the dots in their eternal shallowness in the way it should. Nothing too fancy, nothing too subtle. Just enough for a good time. That is, if you enjoy having a good time without thinking too much about it and if you don't let yourself distracted by the twinkling bloody frames."
"Angelus2","10","12","19","13 May 2008"," The Kansas City Shuffle.
","I admit I was turned away from this film simply because it didn't look that interesting with the trailers, and seeing Bruce Willis play yet another Hit-man.<br/><br/>But finally I decided to watch this simply because Josh Hartnett was in it and Lucy Liu.<br/><br/>I expected a comedy.<br/><br/>The opening story about the 'The Kansas Shuffle' was an eye-opener. It tells the tale of a man who makes a bet which he cannot pay off, if he was to lose. In return the gangsters he owes money to, kill his whole family.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett seemingly plays the friend of 'Nick' and finds himself in a case of mistaken identity where Nick owes money to, two very dangerous criminals. The Boss and the Rabbi.<br/><br/>Josh's character Slevin begins to fall for Nick's neighbour Lindsey (Lucy Liu) and so he must find a way to play the two gangsters and a mysterious hit-man known only as the ""GoodKat"".<br/><br/>The film has some great lines and plays on words perfectly. Josh Hartnett plays his part well. While Bruce Willis plays the silent hit-man. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley shine more then ever while Lucy Liu plays an adorable and bubbly character who sizzles sexy in every scene.<br/><br/>The films is full of comedy yet it has a surprising element of action and keeps audience members on the edge of their seat. Bits are complicated but the characters take their time to explain what is going on.<br/><br/>The best scene in my opinion was the bed scene were Lindey and Slevin talk about Bond. Just a great moment were nothing else matters, no gangsters no debts or deaths.<br/><br/>A great movie."
"Lord_Crypto","10","6","8","8 November 2007"," Totally Surprised Me!!!!
","This film took me by surprise. It is an excellent movie with a compelling story, wonderful acting, and brilliant direction. I have not seen this intense a movie since The Departed.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett is excellent in this film. One of the best performances I have seen him in. Sir Ben Kingsley is terrific as well. The character he portrays is outstanding. Lucy Lu seems somewhat annoying although that can be said about her character more than herself. Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci deliver good performances but overall, I think Bruce Willis came out on top. I will be using the nickname Goodkat for a long time to come. His character is terrific and no-one but Willis could play that character the way Willis does. He has such a serious and laid back attitude for such a deadly assassin.<br/><br/>The story sucks you in brilliantly. Just like The Departed, I was compelled more and more to continue to watch. The story had grasped hold of me and I could not stop watching. Of course, more and more became revealed which built it up for a shocking turn of events (if you did not see it coming). Don't try to guess ahead of the film, watch in unfold and enjoy where it is going.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action in this film. Bruce Willis shows us again why he is a brilliant action star and why he is a natural born on-screen killer. I also had a fond liking of the music in this film. The opening sketch is now one of my all time favorites.<br/><br/>I really don't know how to describe this movie except as Outstanding. Paul McGuigan has created a masterpiece in my opinion.

","Because of mistaken identity Slevin (Hartnett) gets caught in the middle of a war between 2-crimelord rivals (Freeman and Kingsley). This can't be good.<br/><br/>This is one you have to stay with and watch everything because the things you may miss will show up later on and you will be lost. This is a little short on action, but the story itself and the acting make up for that. This throws everything at you and you think you know what is going on because everything makes sense. You might say this is a larger variation of the Kansas City Shuffle as Goodkat (Willis) likes to point out. Have I said too much? I don't think so. This will rank as a classic along with Pulp Fiction, and Sin City and yes, The Usual Suspects. The cinematography isn't as good as in the movies just mentioned but it is good nevertheless.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue all around is excellent. You will enjoy the New Jersey almost Brooklynese accent coming out of Ben Kingsley (The Rabbi). You are amazed because you still remember Kingsley as Gandhi and how could this be? As for Josh Hartnett, I still say he looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones and acts like him too. Good job. I have new respect for Lucy Liu. She really is good, and I fell in love. As for Willis and Freeman (The Boss) what more can be said about them? They are perfect.<br/><br/>This is an excellent cast along with a very good supporting cast giving us an excellent thriller."

Loved the comment one user made about how the dialogue in this movie is comparable to that in ""Gilmore Girls."" The script is cringe-worthy, which for me, was enough alone to dislike this movie.<br/><br/>However, I will give kudos to the actors. They did the best they could with such boring, one-dimensional characters. I feel the only people who changed at all by movie's end were Freeman and Kingsley--and they end up dead! That's also assuming their characters learned the error of their ways right before Slevin kills them, and even that assumption is probably a stretch.<br/><br/>This A-list cast was wasted. I felt no emotion toward anyone involved and was relieved when the movie finally reached its only somewhat unexpected conclusion.<br/><br/>I give this movie three out of ten stars, for a script that is borderline insulting and for a typical, not-so-memorable-or-exciting story of revenge.<br/><br/>To its credit, it is mildly entertaining and worth at least some of your time and money. We saw it at the dollar theater last night, if that says anything."

","When i was reading through the comments below, i was really disappointed by the comments and reviews people gave. They just don't understand the purpose of this movie. It is true that this movie doesn't contain any moral values, but the question is, SO WHAT? A good movie doesn't have to teach us morals or give us a lesson. Since when do you guys watch movies to learn about morals? Even though it will be advantageous to watch a movie that has a message, it is not required for a good movie. The reason why i give this movie 10/10 is because the plot was very witty and entertaining. The ending was very unpredictable and very satisfying. It is one of those movies that you will not understand the whole plot or the genius of the movie till the end. It's the very end that makes the movie exceptional. In most movies, you will be able to guess the ending, or the ending won't be that shocking. But this movie brings out a different approach. It is only one of its kind, so if you like movies that keeps you thinking, you don't want to miss this one."

","I seldomly give a 10 because perfection is rare.

The acting was great, the lead actors were excellent, I was most impressed with Hartnett, whom up until this movie I had in the goofy teenage actor starring in simple minded comedies drawer  not anymore! He has earned his merits to be considered a great / serious actor in my point of view.<br/><br/>The characters were great too, for example: bodyguards and henchmen share the same characteristics and ""modus operandi"" in every movie but this film manages to give some fresh air even to accepted and universal standards. Stylistic devices add the icing on the cake: Great angles, comparisons, repetitions and (outstanding!) the overall frame structure which is revealed in the end (I don't want to give away spoilers but you'll know what I mean when you watch it) which enriches the movie with a substantially satisfying moral essence.<br/><br/>All in all: fantastic.

"seymourblack-1","8","8","12","8 March 2014"," A Very Twisted Revenge Thriller
","""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a stylish revenge thriller with an incredible number of twists, a high body count and a collection of characters who are almost all totally amoral. Its strongest feature is its script which is sharp, witty and extremely funny with lots of quick-fire dialogue that perfectly complements the fast-moving pace of this highly entertaining movie. The Hitchcock and Tarantino influences are very apparent throughout and the combination of a mistaken identity story with colourful anecdotes and amusing banter provides plenty of humour, suspense and intrigue.<br/><br/>When two strangers meet in an almost deserted airport waiting area, the man in a wheelchair tells a younger man a story about an ordinary guy at a racetrack, twenty years earlier, whose decision to put money on a horse which was supposed to be a sure-fire winner, led to his own violent demise and the deaths of his immediate family. After completing the story, the wheelchair-bound raconteur suddenly gets up and kills the younger man.<br/><br/>A short time later in New York City, Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) is staying at his friend's apartment because, after having come to visit Nick Fisher, he'd found the door unlocked and Fisher had disappeared. In a conversation with Nick's neighbour Lindsey (Lucy Liu), he explains how recently, he'd experienced a lot of bad luck, including losing his job, finding his girlfriend in the act of cheating on him and getting mugged. More bad luck then follows when a couple of heavies who mistake him for Fisher, take him to meet a gangster called The Boss (Morgan Freeman) who demands that he repay a huge gambling debt. The Boss then explains that his son had recently been killed and as he believes that his rival The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) was responsible, he would be prepared to overlook the gambling debt if Slevin would agree to assassinate his rival's son.<br/><br/>Slevin's decision about what to do next is made easier shortly after when a couple of The Rabbi's heavies (who also mistake him for Fisher) take him to their boss who demands repayment of another large gambling debt. Slevin agrees to carry out the hit for The Boss but there's also a hit-man called Mr Goodkat (Bruce Willis) who strangely seems to be working for both gangsters and is under orders to eliminate Slevin after he's killed The Rabbi's son. When Slevin subsequently carries out his contract for The Boss, a connection between Slevin and Goodkat is revealed and the two men surprisingly go on to capture the two gangsters before a series of additional twists and revelations (including the relevance of the anecdote that was told at the airport) follow.<br/><br/>A wonderful cast of very talented actors who genuinely seem to be having a great time add enormously to the enjoyment of watching this movie. Josh Hartnett perfectly displays the reactions of a man who's faced with some terrifying situations but also weirdly suffers from a condition which leaves him free from worry or any other troubling preoccupations and Bruce Willis is great as the mysterious, smirking hit-man. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are on form as the crime lords who used to be partners and Lucy Liu is scintillating in her supporting role as a funny James Bond fan who also works in a mortuary.<br/><br/>Considering the convoluted nature of the plot , director Paul McGuigan also merits recognition for the slick way in which the action is presented and the level of clarity that's brought to a tale that, in the wrong hands, could so easily have degenerated into a confusing mess."

","Lucky Number Slevin  no, that's not a typo  will easily be dismissed as Tarantino-esquire. Starring Josh Hartnett as the unlucky title character, the film has more twists and turns than a high-tech roller-coaster, but it's just as much fun (and almost as immediately forgettable).<br/><br/>Directed with breakneck technique by Paul McGuigan from a clever though highly implausible script by Jason Slimovic, the film is cast, with one minor exception, impeccably. It marks the first role that justifies Josh Hartnett's hype, and bestows Lucy Liu the most normal  and incandescent  part of her career. It's a bonus that they have palpable on-screen chemistry, as well as great foils in the guise of Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman (though Ben Kingsley's high-strung performance as The Rabbi is a miscalculation). The film itself is stylized  written in high gumshoe/screwball mode, with a guided tour of ugly wallpapers throughout history as part of its hard-boiled milieu  though the actors' convictions root the topsy-turvy narrative in recognizable human terrain.<br/><br/>At its best, Lucky Number Slevin has the feel of a minor John Huston caper directed, with prankish glee, by Brian DePalma. It's a blood-revenge thriller with no depth, though there are reservoirs of feeling in Hartnett's and Liu's performances, as well as wit. Liu seems to the screwball manor born. And Hartnett prances around for nearly 30 minutes of screen time in nothing more than a long purple towel and a quizzical expression. He's such a game actor that his performance is both a put-on and homage to the long line of Macguffins in film noir. With, of course, a twist."
"noodles-13","3","45","94","29 August 2006"," So script and logic are no more issues in film-making
","Slevin sets a new landmark in tasteless film-making, being a foolish mix of tones and genres which actually leads nowhere. Within the frame of a tragic bloody revenge, the movies gives us a pointless love story, ultraviolent pulpfiction-like gangsters, corrupted cops, an ironic international killer who is eventually discovered to be happy at playing the father figure. The story starts as a tragedy, the climax scene (which is not the real end, of course: plenty of endings in this movie) ends it as a tragedy. In the middle we have all the above and maybe more, without a choice of style and taste. I rated it 3, but it is hard to rate a movie which is completely wrong."

Nick's next door neighbor, Lindsay, who works in the morgue, tries to help Slevin. Meanwhile, a mysterious man is secretly plotting to kill Slevin and Slevin is under constant surveillance by the relentless Detective Brikowski.<br/><br/>From the first five minutes of the film, about five people die but you're not so sure. Mainly, you're not so sure of anything because this film is trying to be clever, trying to run you into false conclusions. On top of that, the film goes in a fast pace, so you will have to keep up (I didn't, though).<br/><br/>This film will keep your attention from top to bottom. If you're one of those people trying to look for a thriller that tries to keep you guessing until the end, you will like this movie. If you're a mainstream audience member, then you should watch another movie.<br/><br/>Some might say this film tries too hard to be clever like a ""Pulp Fiction"" kind of way and that it succumbs to a convoluted plot. Others might think this movie works the way it tries to be and the way it turned out. I loved this film, by the way. I love how the film plays out and tries to keep you guessing until the end.<br/><br/>What I also liked on top of that are the performances by these great actors and actress. Apart from Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis, the performance by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are really good. I also liked Lucy Liu's character as a fast talking, intelligent person.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film other than a film that spoon feeds you, # Slevin should be on the top of your list of intelligent and ingenious thrillers. If you're not that smart to follow a fast plot, like I, you might still end up liking it or you should just watch another movie."

","Although this movie leaves viewers in the dark for about 2 hours, it all makes sense in the last five minutes and leaves you completely satisfied. The first 20 minutes involve Bruce Willis telling the story of a brutal murder involving a fixed horse race gone wrong. Right away, you begin to feel for the characters, although they all end up dead in the first half hour. After this, we meet the real characters. Slevin (Josh Hartnett), is a seemingly harmless guy who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Lindsey (Lucy Liu) is a quirky neighbor we're initially annoyed with but learn to love. The two rival mafia leaders are The Boss (Morgan Freeman), named because he's the boss, and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), because, of course, he's a rabbi. ALthough it starts out bloody, ""Slevin"" is actually pretty hilarious, and confusing, but ultimately satisfying. Throughout, the characters interact seemingly randomly, but smoothly, sarcastically, and often in a way that makes you laugh out loud.

","Wow, this is a great movie. No one should be surprised that this movie is so great because it has great, great actors involved. This is a wonderful Mystery movie with lots and lots of twists and turns. You really will not guess what happens next. This movie is just a huge puzzle that slowly gets put together, but it's like the puzzle is getting put together with pieces missing. Then by the end when those missing pieces are revealed, it's just amazing. The dialogue in this film is absolutely incredible. You can feel the emotion pouring from every scene. The greatest scene in this movie is at the end with Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley. These two guys are such great actors; this movie is worth watching just to see this one scene. Not that all the other scenes aren't great, but this one is in a class all its own. Everyone should see this movie for all the great acting. Here's a little on the major actors in the film: Slevin(Josh Hartnett): I'm not a huge fan of Hartnett, but it seems as though this role was tailor made for him. I honestly don't believe they could have picked a better person to play Slevin. Hartnett's personality and charisma fit this role really well.<br/><br/>Mr. Goodkat(Bruce Willis): It just seems that Bruce Willis plays an excellent hit-man. When he gets into these hit-man roles, you can just look at him and see a stone cold killer. I wonder if he has ever really killed a man? It sure seems like it in this film. He seems like an old pro when he's got that look in his eye like he wants to kill you just for the fun of it. Great casting choice.<br/><br/>Brikowski(Stanley Tucci): Brikowski is the lead detective in this film. Brikowski is quite eccentric and a little obsessive compulsive. He has to have control of everything; he can't stand for something to out of his control. Tucci was a great choice because he seems like a guy who always need to have order and control in his life.<br/><br/>Lindsey(Lucy Liu): The girl next door. Adds a little comic relief to the film, but also kind of holds the film together as well. I really don't think this movie would have been as good without this character. Lucy Liu fits the role well because she has the spunky, peppy personality just like Lindsey.<br/><br/>The Boss(Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi(Sir Ben Kingsley): It's freaking Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Any role they play is gold. Enough said."

","I pretty much went into this film with little by way of expectations  the reviews I remembered suggested that it wasn't all that good. However, I was pleasantly surprised by what I got. Sure, the all star cast were maybe on cruise control (although Hartnett and (particularly) Liu were moderately sparkling) and maybe the 'twist' was blatantly telegraphed ahead, and maybe there was nothing new, and maybe the attempt to justify one of the murders is a little shaky (as the protagonist could not have known what we learn  it was a murder of expedience. Watch out for it), and maybe it wasn't half as clever as it thought it was, but sometimes a movie can just be a movie without pretensions to being art, and can be no less enjoyable for that. This is a decent little film which may not be anyone's favourite film of all time but at least it isn't Speed 2. And that, of course, is a very good thing."

Back in the day, I sat through more than a few. And I'm not just talking about that one with Charlize Theron. Anyone remember Bulletproof Heart or Love and a .45? <br/><br/>Needless to say, my hard-won innocence was betrayed. To the writer Paul Porizkovich, or whatever your name is, wheedle as many lunch offers at the Ivy as you can, because you'll be back in whatever bilgewater you crawled out of soon. I'd have more respect for someone who went around spray-painting babies than I do for you. Are there really still people walking around Hollywood thinking, ""I have a great idea! I'll make a gangster movie like The Usual Suspects or Pulp Fiction, but in this one the wallpaper'll be really funny!"" When are those Iranians going to enrich their uranium already? Oh, they just did.<br/><br/>The only member of cast and crew who comes out of this one unscathed is, shockingly, Josh Hartnett. He's also the only one who is still building a career and can be forgiven for appearing in such roadkill. The one smart move the director makes is to have his character's nose broken so that Hartnett's resemblance to Jean-Paul Belmondo becomes unmistakable. My girlfriend says he's the only male actor that she has a crush on, resulting in much scoffing from me -- too bad she refused to see this movie where she was unexpectedly vindicated. He gets the full star treatment here and pulls it off as well as anyone could under the circumstances. Despite his reputation as a grunting caveman with a unibrow, even Woody Allen couldn't have recited this verbal diarrhea any better. And I'm talking lines like, ""It's a condition I have called ataraxia"" and ""Did anyone tell you should never put the word you're defining in a definition?"" and ""On your face, there's a nose, and underneath that nose, there's a mouth."" <br/><br/>Everyone else looks like a waxwork in a museum about to be burned down for the real estate. Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman do their overrated shtick which basically amounts to rolling vowels around and being poised and boring to show their almighty experience before the camera; both of them need to either take a huge risk or go away fast. A facelifted Bruce Willis brings back horrifying memories of Billy Bob Thornton's uncreased new visage in The Ice Harvest ( their faces now resemble children's hindquarters. ) And Lucy Liu goes for Young Shirley MacLaine but, flitting around the decade-younger Hartnett, comes off more Old Asian M.I.L.F. <br/><br/>Without breaking a sweat, Hartnett wipes the floor with all of them -- and if that isn't more tragicomic than anything else going on in the story, then I'm Paris Hilton's latest conquest."

The script is so full of holes and cartoony stereotypes that one is tempted to think of it as some sort of fable or allegory - but it has no message at all. Armed criminals are displaying a hot young man with a beaten-up face in only a towel on crowded Manhattan streets and nobody notices? A major crime boss with megabucks has former Mossad agents guarding his son in a specially-secured room and they have no closed-circuit monitors and must protect him by blindly busting through a plaster wall? Both crime bosses have sentinels posted on the terraces outside their windows that just happen to vanish when they are assaulted by a strange young man that they don't really trust? Most disturbing is the awfully bigoted stereotyping... the African Americans who are all in crime, especially the two Amos and Andy style thugs who first kidnap the lead.... the Jews, who only use their religion as a front for evil, with Stars of David everywhere, almost like villains in a comic book... and of course, the crooked Italian cop. Just to avoid being called on their prejudices, the producers gratuitously throw in an Asian woman (who is culturally very assimilated, except when she eats noodles in one scene). All very cynical and very Hollywood. What is the moral of this film? Nothing - the good white gentile killers blow away all the evil ethnic killers. Great, guys.... another uplifting addition to Western culture. The only good news about this film is that apparently it didn't do well at the US box office... hope the same happens here in Europe."

","John Hartnett secures the record for Longest Period of Time Wearing a Towel and Nothing Else in ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" a groan-inducing title for a groan-inducing movie. After what seemed like at least a good half-decade of hibernation, yet another hack filmmaker has emerged from the bushes and taken his suck-pump to dredge the remaining puddles of silt at the bottom of the now-drained Tarantino Lake; Jason Smilovic penned this too-familiar tale of criminals with oh-so-enigmatic names (The Boss, The Rabbi, Slevin) speaking in a torrent of pop-culture clichés (James Bond, Norman Rockwell, Andy Griffith, and Alfred Hitchcock get shout-outs), involved in some oh-so-wacky, oh-so-ironic, oh-so-postmodern shenanigans, and director Paul McGuigan put the frantically-edited mess up on screen for all to see. When you notice the missed beats in the dialog between Bruce Willis (whose persistent smirk seems to be holding back laughter) and another character during the opening scene, it doesn't bode well for the remainder of the film...and ""Slevin"" just gets progressively worse. The characters are a collection of pretentiously self-aware ciphers, and following the plot is pointless, since the film uses the LAST 30 MINUTES to tell us what the hell is going on (via dialog and flashbacks where--yup--information that was withheld is now revealed!), because its structure is so tediously contrived. In any other case, ""Slevin""'s unusually excellent cast would (at least somewhat) redeem the film, but veterans like Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and Willis seem to be going through the motions of a flat, unmemorable script; meanwhile, Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett radiate youthful cuteness, but precious little sympathy. Actually, the one smidgen of talent on display in ""Slevin"" might be McGuigan's ability to squander a cast most directors would kill for--now THAT is a true achievement. For those who have never seen a good crime thriller and would like to look 'hip' and 'with it,' have a ball with ""Lucky Number Slevin""; the rest of us will be re-watching ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction."""

","I must say that I am doubly deceived by this movie: first, by the movie itself, with a plot that could be good but in the end gets too uselessly complicated and ""Tarantinian"" to satisfy, and secondly because of the very high rating this movie has received by the voters of the IMDb. In fact, I think that the ""moral"" level (please don't misunderstand me, I'm not a moralist, but I think that a movie should be a bit careful in presenting as a positive character a man who is such a complete monster as the main character of this one) is alarming, to say the least. And what is worse this movie presents the most brutal vengeance as a perfectly justified and empathic reaction (weren't we supposed, after Eschylus, to think that the strong man is the one who resists the temptation to repay an eye for an eye?). So I could hardly believe my eyes when I watched the happy ending, where the guy gets the girl and lives happily ever after, in the most traditional and soppy happy ending one could imagine, as if he were an ordinary movie hero and not a (very improbable, by the way) cold-blooded and almost superman-like killer. In fact, he not only finishes off the two men against whom he has to avenge his father, but also (and this is the thing that has disturbed me most) the son of one of these two killers, a perfectly innocent guy who hasn't done anything except being gay! and making him a gay character, I sadly suspect, was a genial solution on the part of the writers not to make the public too sorry for him... yes, b-series human beings may well be killed without too many compliments, who cares after all? the important thing is that the gloriously heterosexual hero may get the girl, and live happily ever after?

","Narrative games are played throughout here, this is one of those movies where nothing is as it first appears to be. The pretext though is that Josh Hartnett is ""Slevin"", a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time who gets caught between two rival gangland bosses.<br/><br/>Very similar to THE USUAL SUSPECTS, though that was better plotted and a slyer game all around. Hartnett is a vacuous bowl of suck stuck right in the center of this, a good example of how bad casting can hurt a film. I suppose as an amiable doofus he's okay, but once he has to become effective he's pretty laughable.<br/><br/>Structured clunkily, with the big reveal taking up far too much time (as Hartnett has to actually explain to us the plot -- most of which we've figured out, thank you very much). The script bounces around from the well written to the not-so well written: in general it suffers from a kind of self-regard or self-importance that afflicts a lot of Tarantino imitators. (It's interesting that Tarantino's imitators have never understood Tarantino's light touch.) On the other hand, it's mostly very well acted (outside of Hartnett) and that alone lifts a lot of it. Willis is becoming iconic, Freeman and Kingsley get to chew the scenery enjoyably, Lucy Liu is surprisingly winningly girly (a nice break from her Dragon Queen persona). Nicely cast even in small parts, too, with Stanley Tucci and Danny Aiello is small roles.<br/><br/>I wouldn't search it out, but it's the kind of movie that, if it's playing on cable in a hotel room, you won't feel embarrassed about using it to kill some time."

","Lucky Number Slevin was another nail in the coffin for my cinema going life. It was the last in a long list of 'whack' movies that i wasted my money on. Admittedly, i am very bad at choosing which movies to go and see, a trait i attribute to my eternal optimism (""Posioden? well, the original was a classic... so the remake must be good then...right? Wrong! Apparently i never learn) but i think its fair to expect that when u get a group of good actors together and a bunch of professional filmmakers and millions of dollars that they'd manage to make something at least a little bit good. But they consistently don't. Lucky Number Slevin is, i think, a classic case of style over content. The poster promised so much - slightly obscure title, Bruce with not 1 but 2 guns, all star cast. Actually, if the poster hadn't looked like so much fun maybe i wouldn't have been so disappointed that the film was so pointless - but it looked like it might be a cheeky little surprise of a movie that all these great actors signed onto because the script was just so gosh-darned good! And the annoying thing was that it kept threatening to suddenly make sense. When all was revealed - the moment we had all been inexpertly manipulated into waiting for - it was just so ridiculous that it was hard for me not to scream ""What?!?!!!?! he was the son of the man who... and now you get revenge on... by waiting 20 years ....and killing the guy who ....to get to the bosses of ....whaaaa....?"" just way too far fetched and stupid. its just stupid. the writer is stupid. the director is stupid. they are all stupid! except Lucy Liu. I think probably in her case her agent made her do it against her will and she kept trying to tell them where they were getting it wrong but nobody would listen! I know it wasn't your fault Lucy. The point at which i could take no more and walked out of the cinema? When - oh dear - she gets shot and - wait for it -it turns out she's wearing - did u guess yet? - a bullet proof vest! i felt i had to leave then on principal. i'm thinking of starting an Anti-Bullet Proof Vest Coalition and making a blacklist of movies where this happens and scribbling on the front of the DVD covers in the shops - Don't Worry - They're not really dead! they're wearing a bullet proof vest!<br/><br/>if you like this movie its because a)have a mental age of 14 and thought this one was really clever and twisty b)have recently woken up from a coma and are still in that 'everything is wonderful because i'm alive' phase c) are as stupid as they say you are. to all the people who gave this a high vote - Shame on you! because you're only encouraging them."

","In 'Lucky Number Slevin' Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, a guy who has just run into some bad luck. He has lost his job, his apartment is being condemned, his girlfriend is cheating on him and he gets mugged. But that is nothing compared to what is about to happen. When he goes to visit a friend in New York, he is the victim of mistaken identity. Not one, but two powerful crime lords think he is Nick, the guy that owes each of them a lot of money. Slevin has to do what he is told or else. But things are not always what they seem.<br/><br/>This movie is awesome. It is a cross between, 'The Jackal' and 'The Usual Suspects'.

","Lucky Number Slevin starts out innocently enough. Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis) introduces the film with some snappy lines, smoothly finds itself in an exposition with some more witty dialogue from Slevin (Josh Hartnett) and the slightly obnoxious Lindsey (Lucy Liu), a couple of gangsters break in and threaten Slevin - with clever style.<br/><br/>If that sounds condescending, it should. Lucky Number Slevin is clearly a product of the Pulp Fiction generation, and like its brethren, it lacks absolutely everything that made Pulp Fiction appealing in the first place. Characters toss off pop culture-enhanced monologues, regardless of actual character. Toss motivations out the window, these gangsters are classy! Even worse, the pop culture references are so forced, so unnecessary, just so... bad (Slevin and Lindsey's discussion on James Bond is the worst thing I've heard at the movies this year).<br/><br/>The direction is horribly confused. It is comical? Is it serious? There is no clarity in what the atmosphere is supposed to convey, so you can't connect to the situations. Well, that and the fact that Slevin also has some particularly dreadful pacing, culminating in a seemingly hour-long plot twist revelation, where the twist is revealed by detailing every little thing about the story. Scenes are repeated. There are nauseating jump-cuts. You learn more about the story than you care to know. Hell, you know more about the story than you do about the actual plot progression, if there was any at the endpoint. And that's how it ends. It just does."

","In this movie that tries so hard to be ""cleverer than thou"", Josh Hartnett as Slevin leads a cast of actors who all speak in pretty much the same voice. That voice, of course, being the faux-hip Tarantino-light, 'hipster wit' that writer Jason Smilovic unwisely chooses to imbue them with. As the disappointing, yet not unforeseen, outcome of that is one is always keenly aware that one's watching a movie. In that I mean that because the writer is too busy trying to be hip and clever, tat I never was drawn into the film whatsoever and even found it to be a tad on the annoying side. Perhaps I'm being too tough on the film as the tale of mistaken identity, mob hits, and the twists and turns therein is serviceable enough, if on the highly derivative side. and Bruce Willis is, as always, highly watchable. But as a whole the film fizzles out in a sea of pomposity.<br/><br/>My Grade: D+ <br/><br/>Eye Candy: Jennifer Miller bares her breasts..or does she? hmmm<br/><br/>DVD Extras: Audio commentary by director Paul McGuigan; Second commentary with actor Josh Hartnett, actress Lucy Liu, and writer Jason Smilovi; 13 minute making-of featurette; deleted scenes; Alternate ending; Theatrical trailer; and Trailers for ""Kill shot"", ""The Protector"", ""Pulse"", ""Clerks 2"", and ""Scary Movie 4"""

","This film is crammed with too much hipster language. Perhaps it's being used as a device to camouflage a very poor film. It's trying so hard to be witty and funny, but fails miserably. The sex and violence were very graphic and not in an artistic way. It certainly didn't help the story and just seemed to be stuffed in everywhere to fill plot holes.<br/><br/>Lucy Lu needs an acting lesson and the script was written by someone who must have just read the book ""Writing Monologues for Dummies."" How someone could enjoy this film is beyond me. If there was a sequel to Pulp Fiction that was made by a third-rate writer and director with ADHD, Slevin is what would have been produced.<br/><br/>I'm not going into the boring and predictable plot here. I'm just going to highlight two points.<br/><br/>1) Any film where the characters start quoting/summarizing plots from classic films is trying to ride on the coat tales of greatness. In this mediocre film, Slevin (the main character) compares his life to Jimmy Stewart in Hitchcock's North by Northwest in a long, stupid monologue.<br/><br/>2) Have you ever seen The Simpson's episode where Lisa discovers she's a vegetarian and insists on a veggie meal in the cafeteria? To squash her opinion, the school shows a Troy McClure video that promotes eating meat and claims that anyone who is a vegetarian is a moron. Lisa exclaims at the end of the film ""Are you really going to swallow this tripe?"" to the other students. The teacher responds by asking the student to help themselves to some tripe that was donated by the meat council.

"adamricha","1","31","73","24 February 2006"," Move along, REALLY nothing to see here!
","So, where do I start when describing how bad this film is? I'll start by talking of its good points. Somehow an amazing cast was put together and, for the most part, they make the best of what they have got.<br/><br/>So ends the good points. And onto the bad.<br/><br/>Have you seen Yojimbo? Or its remakes, A Fistful of Dollars and Last Man Standing? Have you seen the Usual Suspects? Have you seen Snatch? Yes? Then you really don't need to see this film.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, this film is basically Yojimbo, with elements ripped off from the other two aforementioned films, just not done as well. It is made apparent early on that we have some twists in store at the end, but any film-savvy viewer should be able to guess these by the end of reel two.<br/><br/>But, you can forgive a bad story if it is supported by a great script.<br/><br/>Oh, dear.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it seems the writer has watched a lot of noirs in preparation, but really hasn't the talent to back it up. If you are masochistic enough to want to watch this film, here is an example of the type of dialogue you're going to ""enjoy"" (I must stress, this is not actual dialogue from the film, merely an example of the style of dialogue):.<br/><br/>Person A: So, how are you feeling today?.<br/><br/>Person B: How am I feeling today?.<br/><br/>Person A: Yeah, how are you you feeling today?.<br/><br/>Person B: I'm feeling fine.<br/><br/>Person A: You're feeling fine?.<br/><br/>Person B: Yeah, I'm feeling fine.<br/><br/>This, and other padding-out techniques (for a great example, watch the scene where the Rabbi's henchmen pick up Slevin for the first time), makes me think that the first draft of the script must have come in around sixty pages. Then the writer panicked and what we're seeing is the second draft. If, after listening to this repetitive, irritating nonsense for ten minutes, you don't want to choke the living crap out of the writer and director, you're a better man than me.<br/><br/>Add all this to cinematography that seems to have been put together by a 5-year-old with ADD and you have one of the most irritating films put out this year (I know it's early, but I think this is a safe bet).<br/><br/>How they managed to pull this cast together, I don't know. And you would have thought Willis would have steered clear, regardless of the quality, as he was the lead in Last Man Standing, a much better telling of this type of story. And seeing Mykelti Williamson and Stanley Tucci take the roles they have in this movie just makes me want to cry. These are two highly underutilised actors who deserve a lot better.<br/><br/>Take the above ingredients, sprinkle with continuity errors, and you have the recipe for one bad movie (and that's bad-bad, not good-bad).<br/><br/>Avoid."
"Devizier","5","21","47","7 April 2006"," Mediocre
","I saw this movie during a brief stay in London, approaching it with guarded skepticism, given that the mud season is when Hollywood ushers its ""second tier"" to the markets. The beginning of the movie is promising enough; the opening scene is loaded with atmosphere and brutality, and is followed by some effective set up scenes that outline the plot. That plot, however, turns out to be weak, contrived and predictable. I emphasize the last point, because with a little imagination, the viewer can frame the entire story within twenty minutes of the opener. Not a good sign for a film that relies on twists to entertain its audience. <br/><br/>The weak plot is not the only indictment against this movie. In a deliberate effort to mimic the ""cool"" of that famous auteur (you know who) of the nineties, the movie relies heavily on irreverent dialogue and subtle pop culture references. Derivative can work - plenty of others have taken the same tact with some success - but in this case it does not. Virtually all of the dialogue is mere filler; there isn't a single memorable line in the movie. The characters, in an obvious nod to Reservoir Dogs, are referred to by (not so) clever nicknames. This attempt at garnering cachet is fitting, because none of these characters amount to more than the vapid stereotypes that such nicknames inform them to be.<br/><br/>That's not necessarily terrible, because a great actor can make such contrivances work. Incidentally, there are certainly plenty of recognizable actors in this film. The problem is, the pieces don't fit, and at no point in the movie are you left with the impression that anyone is trying very hard. Morgan Freeman in particular seems perfectly content to continue the ten year campaign against his acting reputation. On the flipside, Lucy Liu does a credible job as the love interest of someone ten years younger than her, and Bruce Willis is certainly wooden enough for the part of a stoic assassin.<br/><br/>This movie isn't beyond redemption. I didn't walk out of the theatre, and you can kind of enjoy it, so long as you're content to space out for the duration. Its got plenty of flash, but not much else. Its an effectively meaningless exercise and nothing about it changes my impression of spring movies. Just not very good."
"guitarra89","3","26","61","11 April 2006"," Awful and Infantile writing/directing/acting
","I went to see this movie cause I like a good assassin flick. I checked its rating and it was above 7 so it seemed OK. However I will be less fool hearty next time around. I didn't factor in that the film is still fresh and that its current rating is not a true representation of the movie watching populous. This is the movie writing debut of Jason Smilovic. He comes from a glorious position of writing for 'Karn Sisco', a bad TV show. And that is what this movie resembles most, TV quality writing with so many one/two liners it makes me sick. The writer makes many references to good films in the movie via characters referencing them themselves, which shows he fancies himself a film buff, but too bad he cannot write a good film himself. Over all, half the dialogue was unnecessary and is there just for show. I felt like I was watching Gilmore Girls. WAY too much banter. The plot itself is an elaborate 'revenge fantasy' type movie. With so many twists that by the end you stop caring about them. There is fad growing in movies today where producers think twists=good. Too many movies have this elaborate plot where you think something is going to happen and when it doesn't the movie takes all this time to explain how they 'fooled you' in flash backs(ie. see it wasn't really him, he was over here so he didn't die and then.......). The directing was not very effective either. The movie relied on editing effects that would wow the hip-hop generation who are easily amused with fast motion photography, different filters and stupid little cgi trickery. Furthermore, I hate Josh Hartnett, I didn't know it till today, but I do. What an awful actor. He belongs on TV where he will fit in better. His 'acting'is especially awful when put alongside Ben Kingsly and Morgan Freeman. He is just awwwwwwful. I am sure the movie is OK for those who will like anything with guns in it, but I am not so simple(minded). Mostly I am just mad that I was duped. I should have known better. Usually I trust my instincts but I didn't even use them this time. Poorly conceived and poorly executed sophomoric crap."
"willcundallreview","8","5","8","13 May 2014"," A very good Crime Mystery
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin is a film that contains a bunch of elements that a gangster film needs, and also a dash of comedy that brings it all well together. With a big cast of familiar faces and performances to match really, I really would recommend this, if not only to prove the critics wrong who don't like this film. I felt this film was safely very good, and here is why below.<br/><br/>The story is serious at most times but also doesn't mind being comedic and this makes it much more fun as you really get more interested in the plot. It starts to get complicated towards the end but in a good way actually as the whole mystery and shocks that go on are revealed in a simple and easy way. It contains fun moments too, unpredictable and throws a few curveballs it just makes a very good piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Joh Hartnell in the main role is good, maybe not the best that could have been done of this role but he works it well, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as the two mob bosses are good as well but yet again they never seem to do the role as well as it COULD be done, although it is steady going by all three. I did however think Lucy Liu fitted her role very well and portrayed a character that you didn't know much about really.<br/><br/>It is written well and the script is the probably the strongest thing about this entire project. Directed well too the more technical side of this deals it's strongest cards and is why I rate as I have, the sets though are dizzying and never seem to fit what is going on, or any serious note the film is trying to find, but they don't ruin this films credibility. <br/><br/>Apart from the sets the main problem with the movie is that It wraps itself around itself in a sense and becomes very confusing at times, mostly is isn't but it happens at certain parts which niggle down it's rating. I said about the acting which I did say wasn't bad but what I will say is that Bruce Willis completely wastes his talent in this with a bad performance that somehow never fits in with this piece.<br/><br/>Those who like a good old action and mysterious plot should enjoy this as that is exactly what it turns out to be by the end and can be hugely enjoyable. It isn't the best of gangster film but could serve to please a fan of that type of film with it's two rival crime families, although the comedy may take some gangster film fans away from this one.<br/><br/>Overall I give this an 8/10, it is a Safely Very Good movie but maybe not quite enough to be rated as Great. With this you seriously have to ignore the critics who don't like this because it is hugely enjoyable if you just watch it straight, enjoy the curves it throws at you and you will pleased by it hugely, If you start to look into this well then you may feel it isn't quite up to scratch with others like this movie."

Sometimes there are on screen detectives and discoverers as well. We have those here in Tucci's detective and the ""girl next door."" And then there are the marks. When you have all these folks as discoverers of the real story, there are all sorts of opportunities for us to be fooled. Its the detective genre with multiple facets. <br/><br/>In order to be effective, you have to have some things be very ""readable"" and others unexpected and novel. In this case, you have at least 5 cons, possibly seven. But they simply aren't fun. I think it is in part because they aren't different enough from each other. More important is the apparent rule that when you have several ""semantic distances"" (that is: the distance between discoverer and the discovery), they all have to be the same. Lest you think this is something impossible to see or measure.<br/><br/>In this case, all the cons are of similar types (bad) and different semantic distances (also bad).<br/><br/>""Old Boy"" despite its other flaws, got this part right, the distance part. Its quite similar in its con(s) but understood this notion of watching and equal distance.

What we have here is smoke and mirrors and more smoke and mirrors, a screenplay oh so clever that it winds up on itself, destroying all sense of commonsense. Too focused on being clever, too focused on deception, the movie fails to keep an eye on the peripherals, things viewers observe that don't tally, things that make some of us say, ""how did he know that?"" Of course the answer is: Because the writer says so."" Case in point, how did Josh Hartnett know the assassin would shoot Lucy Liu in the chest?"" You mean assassins don't aim for the head? Actually, in this movie they do; we see that early on. Of course it's hard to fake death with a bullet in the head. For the larger picture, the entire concept of mistaken identity, the linchpin of this movie, is a farce. Hartnett's character hardly spends any time protesting the mix-up, and when all is revealed the mistaken identity ploy makes even less sense. In the real world would anyone go to such great lengths? Of course not. You wouldn't need to; you'd just place yourself on that list of deadbeat gamblers by gambling. There again, if the writer stuck to a more believable set-up, there would beyou know, if grandma had balls she'd be. . . . I guess somewhere along the production path of ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" something unusual and magical must have happened. This project must have looked like an Academy jewel and actors of great stature congregated upon the set, their eyes aglow, hypnotized by the jewel. Was there not one who saw that it was naked?

","""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a film I'd only known about in name for years. I'd wanted to see it for years, but because I had no idea what it was about, I never took the time to see it. Besides Bruce Willis being in it, I had no background information to go off of when I rented it.<br/><br/>The film is about Slevin, a normal everyday guy who goes to visit his friend Nick Fisher in New York. When Slevin is mistaken for Nick by two rival gangsters, the Boss and the Rabbi, he has a double ultimatum issued: to get $33,000 dollars for the Rabbi, and to kill the Rabbi's son for the Boss. With the help of Nick's neighbour Lindsay, her and Slevin try to figure out what all is happening and how to get Slevin out of his predicaments. That's about as far as I can get into the plot without spoiling the hell out of this movie. Believe me, this is one of those flicks where if I spoiled it, you'd hate me forever.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett plays Slevin. You instantly like this guy. He's a relatable, funny, wise ass, down-on-his-luck guy. Everything he says is either funny or very intelligent. One of my favorite tidbits is when Slevin questions how the Rabbi can be a religious man and a gangster, without conflicting his religion. It's little bits like this that really make you like his character.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also great. Morgan Freeman plays the Boss. I don't even know what to say, it's Morgan Freeman being awesome, what more do you want? Ben Kingsley plays the Rabbi. I've never been a big fan of Kinsley, especially of late, but I thought he was great in this film. He does the Jewish accent perfectly and it sets him apart from practically every other part he's ever played, where I always think of him as ""that British guy"". As for Lucy Liu, she's kind of just there, but her character is still very likable. When she starts talking Bond trivia, that's when I was in nerd heaven. Seriously, if I ever meet a chick who knows every actor who ever played Ernst Stavro Blofeld, I'll marry her on the spot.<br/><br/>""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a film that was obviously inspired by Quentin Tarantino's work, mainly ""Pulp Fiction"". It has all the makings of a Tarantino film: complicated, intelligent and fast dialogue used to discuss such simple topics, constant references to classic cinema, non-linearism, and characters overlapping into each other's stories. It's a great formula that I wished was used a bit more often, but I'm glad it's saved for films that really deserve to use it.<br/><br/>""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a great film. With some Tarantino-esque flare and some great characters, you'll definitely enjoy this, especially if ""Pulp Fiction"" is up on your list of 'Best Crime Films Ever', in which case, this movie will probably join that list."

The comparisons Tarantino and the like immediately got me thinking though, Im no fan of Tarantino but I've seen enough of his movies to know that even though he trys to do something different every time his movies are actually quite predicable, further comparisons to other great movies had me convinced that this movie is not as brilliant as it seems but is in fact blend of many vintage wines (or malts) and such efforts are usually quite futile, yet I was hooked so I lowered my expectations and rented the movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts of brilliantly but when the first sequence is over you already know that this is a significant part of the movie (as the filmmakers makers want you to know), however even the less die-hard movie goers will easily be able to predict the final outcome of the movie, and have a very good idea about the flow of the movie just based on this sequence, I'm sure the filmmakers didn't take that into account while making the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has Tarantino-ish flow about it, in fact most of the elements are inspired from other brilliant films:- <br/><br/>1)The warring gang bosses are as old as the hills.<br/><br/>2)Playing them against each other is just as old (spagetti westerns).<br/><br/>3)Bruce Willis is a cool assassin (need i say more).<br/><br/>4)A movie that starts with one event and culminates into another.<br/><br/>Sound familiar these concepts are just some of the concepts that have been used in this movie and have been the premise of many super-hit/ cult favourites etc etc of our times.<br/><br/>Like I said such mixing of vintages has generally resulted in disaster (AVP) but in this case surprisingly the end result is actually quite pleasing in fact the movie borders on brilliant for the most part, HOWEVER PREDICTABILITY ENSURES THAT THIS MOVIE EASILY FALLS SHORT OF BRILLIANT, and Hollywood's obsession of love to has a strong part to play in this department.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant all around, the effort to be cool in every scene which is the greatest acting flaw in many such movies (Samuel L Jackson prime candidate in many of his latest movies) is not noticed here.<br/><br/>It has however become annoying to Bruce Willis in the same cool and silent role, I don't think id want to see him in a similar role again.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing is again top notch and matches up to many other brilliant works.<br/><br/>The background score is hardly felt and hardly needed.<br/><br/>On all technical aspects this movie is nearly flawless ( initially i wasn't to happy with the casting of Lucy Lu but I've changed my mind since).<br/><br/>There are a couple of minor plot holes but these are insignificant.<br/><br/>There is a constant feeling of humour in this film, much like the Protagonist's are experiencing despite the graveness of the situation (this is something i always identify with and enjoy so i may be biased).<br/><br/>In the end you cant help feeling that even though you enjoyed the blend (movie) there were really nothing new about it, all the flavours were known to you, you knew what to expect, and the after taste (climax) which is what this movie is all about is almost lost because you are so familiar with it.<br/><br/>This is a rare case of a great blend (Black Label?) and for that it will be cherished.<br/><br/>A must watch if you are a fan of Tarantino, Westerns, Crime, Bruce Willis or any other concept or actor involved with this film.<br/><br/>+s a rare great blend, flawless technically, superb acting, good humour.<br/><br/>+/s great blend but blend nevertheless, does the effort show (i don't think so).<br/><br/>-s predictable, never really hits you, why does it always have to involve love.<br/><br/>total 8/10 (in absolute terms its more like a 7/7.5 but really I expected less plus I always enjoy humour in grave situations hence the higher rating)"

","This movie is very out of the ordinary i don't know quite whether to classify it as a thriller, action or drama i feel as if it has all components which makes it a great watch.<br/><br/>This is a movie about mistaken identity. Slevin (hartnett) finds himself mistaken for somebody else and is cornered by two rival crime bosses in the city. He finds himself having to figure out a way to get to the crime bosses before they get to him.<br/><br/>This is a very good movie. It is very unpredictable and is filled with great actors.

"Joshwahr","8","4","6","5 February 2011"," The Kansas City Shuffle
","Let me get this out of the way first. Wow! I mean this movie blew my mind!<br/><br/>The Wrong Man (if you live in Australia), or Lucky Number Slevin (if you live in the states) is a thriller starring Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu and Stanley Tucci. Directed by Paul McGuigan, The Wrong Man was released in 2006 and seemed to miss Australian cinemas all together and came here direct to DVD. Now normally, that indicates that the film will be a bit of a waste of time. But in actual fact, this is far from the truth. With an all star cast and well known director, The Wrong Man is one to definitely watch.<br/><br/>The story revolves around ""The Kansas City Shuffle"", explained by Bruce Willis' character, which is ""When everybody looks right, you go left."" The story is a well crafted thriller, that provides a breath of fresh air from most Hollywood films as the writer didn't presume that his audience is stupid. This film makes you think and just when you think you have the story figured out, the story takes a sharp twist and sucker punches you where you least expected it to. The story is a Kansas City Shuffle in itself.<br/><br/>The Wrong Man is a real credit to the screenwriter's talent, Paul McGuigan's ability to direct films and the cast's ability to act unlike most others in Hollywood can.<br/><br/>To say that this film is awesome doesn't even begin to explain it.<br/><br/>When you're next at your local video rental store and can't find anything to watch, I strongly recommend that you go to the Thriller section and hire The Wrong Man/Lucky Number Slevin.<br/><br/>Find the review and more at:<br/><br/>http://ingloriousfiction.tumblr.com/"

","Been meaning to see this film for a while now and it was definitely worth the wait to see it on DVD cos i'm deaf and need the subtitles.<br/><br/>As much I respected Josh Harnett but I was feeling a bit doubtful(was very good in Black Hawk Down though) as to whether he'll do the job in 'Lucky Number Slevin'. Fortunately, everything he did in the film was right on the mark.

","I heard a lot about this movie so I decided to see it. I was wise enough not to buy the one, I just rent it, but still was prepared for a couple of hours of breathtaking experience on my sofa (at least from what I heard from guys at rental store).<br/><br/>What I got was a great disappointment. While movie starts as a mystic thriller and action unveils in a mystified dark way, the watcher expects to see the underlying reason, or the driving force of it. He sees nothing. Intead, the sheer revenge is all they have. The connection between Bruce Willis and the young guy (Slevin, or whatever) is the worst outcome the one can predict. And the sea of blood the two of them make becomes just boring. This is all in addition to numerous cliché, that film has in abundance. One out of one."

","LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN (2006) * Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci. Horrendous slice of pulp fiction neo-noir with the miscast Hartnett as a hapless schmuck in a mistaken identity caper involving long feuding crime bosses (Freeman and Kingsley should be ashamed for this malarkey), a taciturn assassin (Willis, ditto) and a comely coroner (Liu who is too kinetic for this stillborn pap) mixed in for (bad) measure with its too-in-love-with-itself-""ain't-I'clever (YOU'RE NOT!!)"" screenplay by Jason Smilovic and overwhelmingly directed by Paul McGuigan as if attempting a hybrid of Tarantino and Ritchie. I really hated this film and if you can't figure out the convoluted 'gotchas' then you deserve this curdled tripe."
"pyrocitor","8","17","39","7 May 2006"," Snatch meets the Usual Suspects - and what a great result!
","Don't be thrown off by the terrible title and tagline - Lucky Number Slevin is much less gratuitous action movie and much more of a clever thinking than it wants to let on. The latest installment in the ""Usual Suspects syndrome"" of thrillers, Slevin subscribes to the ""plot twist every thirty seconds"" theory in order to keep its audience guessing. As such, we spend most of the film continually left in the dark, but rest assured that it (mostly)all comes together and makes sense in the end. <br/><br/>The script, penned by screenwriter Jason Smilovic, makes it very clear that it is trying hard to be incessantly clever - and it actually succeeds for the most part, blending a dark humour (having warring mob bosses have their headquarters across the street from one another) with the suspense, action and continual audience confusion, as Slevin has to make his way out of more and more perplexing situations and constant cases of mistaken identity. Director Paul McGuigan indeed seems to have taken quite a bit of influence from such films as Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, early Tarantino movies and of course, Brian Singer's classic thriller The Usual Suspects, but it comes together as a savory, well made and very clever film. <br/><br/>The wonderful cast are what take the given material, and take it from very good to excellent. Josh Hartnett gives a satisfying performance in the lead as the constantly hassled Slevin. But it's the supporting cast which really bring the film to life, with wonderful and often hilarious performances. Bruce Willis is a strong and mysterious presence as infamous assassin Goodkat, and although it may seem that each of his appearances seems to make less sense than the last time his purpose finally is revealed. Lucy Liu is adorable, bubbly and very funny, finally a love interest who actually captures our interests and never comes across as clichéd or pointless. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley supply class aplenty to the film, and of course both give excellent performances as would be expected. Stanley Tucci is also a wonderful addition to the film as determined detective Brikowski. <br/><br/>Overall, Slevin is actually one of the most interesting and entertaining films of this year so far - suspenseful, cryptic, often very funny, and oh so clever. Be warned that director Paul McGuigan certainly doesn't skimp on the blood and violence, especially right at the film's opening, as if to catch our attention with a bang. But the script and concept are very intelligently done, even if they do occasionally stumble on drawing the line between clever and just plain confusing. Despite this, Slevin is a wonderful and very entertaining movie, one definitely worth seeing!<br/><br/>-8/10"
"claire-banks","4","18","42","11 March 2006"," Totally Predictable and Disappointing
","I was quite excited at the prospect. #1. I love gangster movies and #2. it has a cast with impressive CV's. What looks good on paper and previews doesn't always materialise in feature length. Story is predictable and dialogue is lazy and in places cringe worthy. Josh Hartnett is flat and unconvincing, Lucy Lui gives it a try but she's just annoying. The supporting cast were reliable but it was just wrong to hear substandard lines coming out of the mouths of likes of Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. It proves that it takes more than big names, a babe, action and violence to make an enjoyable movie. I wouldn't waste the minutes of your life watching this. You could be doing something so much better."

"slcagnina","5","10","21","1 December 2008"," Fatally flawed
","This is one of those ""screenwriter"" movies: It is written from a formula of introducing characters and situations which will be doubled back on in the last reel revealing the twist. It's all about plot, colorful characters (as opposed to characterization) and something violent/or plot driven happening once or twice in each reel. Mood and subtlety it is not about.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin is OK by the above standards. It has too many clichés from Pulp Fiction (main characters discussing movie-references as defining character traits, etc) but it keeps interest as passable entertainment. However, it falls apart when it is revealed to be a revenge drama and the Macguffin of Nick Fisher is shown to be a real person that Slevin's partner (Willis) knocks off because Slevin needs his identity. Apparently Fischer is a gambling loser that no one would miss. But the revenge is based on Slevin's own father being a gambling loser who gets killed by those who believe no one will miss him. Bad irony, huh?<br/><br/>So, we watch a revenge movie that goes to pains to reveal that everyone killed deserved it (except I didn't buy that the Rabbi's gay kid deserved it, but I digress) -- except it never establishes the plot-driver Nick Fisher deserved it. Why not just have him kidnapped? Or have him be a phantom? Killing him makes this a movie full of people who don't deserve revenge. For a movie that cries out look at my screenplay! it should have noticed that some of this doesn't make any sense in a revenge drama. Unless it wasn't meant as a pure revenge drama. But then, what is it?"
"BA_Harrison","5","10","21","15 August 2006"," Not as clever or as stylish as it thinks it is.
","This makers of this film really wish it was Pulp Fiction. They've tried to emulate Quentin Tarantino's non-linear story telling, his staccato rapid-fire dialogue and his offbeat characters...hell, they've even got Butch on board, with old Bruce playing a Tarantinoesque assassin. What they haven't got, though, is the ability to take all of these ingredients and whip up a feast for the eyes and ears the way old QT can.<br/><br/>Writer Jason Smilovic's best moments don't even rival QT's worst, and the overcomplicated plot isn't half as clever or as slick as Smilovic obviously thinks it is: a case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (played by Brad Pitt-alike Josh Hartnett) in the middle of a gang war waged by two crime lords, The Boss and The Rabbi. Slevin must use his wits (and the help of a feisty neighbour, played by Lucy Liu) to ensure his survival.<br/><br/>What Smilovic obviously thinks is witty and clever, sounds stale and hackneyed, and Paul McGuigan matches the writing perfectly with a half-assed attempt at 'stylish' direction, in which he incorporates every contemporary (and overused) trick in the book. A great cast, which includes Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci, struggle to make the script work, but even they can't save this wannabe from being anything other than average."
"snow0r","9","14","32","24 February 2006"," really enjoyable
","Lucky Number Slevin sees Josh Hartnett play Slevin in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity in a movie that easily skips between wry one liners and bloody violence that keeps you thinking until it's well-done conclusion.<br/><br/>First off, the film looks great. It looks noir, complete with clever camera angles and smooth transitions, creating some very stylish cinematography and some brilliant scenes. The chess scene, which sees Slevin take on The Boss (Freeman), pretty much sums this up, using smart camera angles and stylish transitions while drawing the audience in and further complicating the story. The violence is well done, and the contrast it creates reminiscent of last year's Sin City (2005). The soundtrack also effectively contributes to the style, as it doesn't take over and you don't really notice it's there, but gets the job done.<br/><br/>A film is however nothing without its cast, and Lucky Number Slevin is blessed with an amazing collection of actors and actresses. Hartnett pulls out a brilliant, if somewhat surprising performance, playing the wise-guy who cant keep his mouth shut who draws us in, before switching to the ruthless anti-hero who kills his way to the top at the film's conclusion. Morgan Freeman, The Boss, and Sir Ben Kingsley, The Rabbi, take to their roles perfectly, Freeman playing it with just the right amount of intelligence and cruelty, while Kingsley's role is more calculated and comic. Lucy Lui also does well as the girl-next-door/coroner, and her character moves the film along quickly with a touch of the film's more obvious humour. Bruce Willis' performance is probably the best out of the supporting cast. There doesn't seem to be much to it, but he dominates most of the scenes he's in (except that one where he's got a mullet) thanks to his understated cold-blooded killer acting mode.<br/><br/>The plot keeps a hold of you throughout too, and prevents its audience getting lost as the conclusion explains it all for you, cleverly shifting from scene to scene as the pieces of the puzzle come together.<br/><br/>There isn't really much more I can say. It looks great, the performances are great, the story is good, it's a bit violent, and it's still funny. I really enojyed it."

","I was honestly in disbelief when I found that this film was not in the top 250 with a low, low rating of 7.8. This is almost certainly my favourite film of this genre easily contending with the likes of Snatch, L4yer Cake, Brick etc.<br/><br/>It is essentially perfect. <br/><br/>Any close analysis would give away certain features of the film because everything is linked; it features countless nuances, being endlessly intricate. The best thing about this film is that it subverts expectations: it does not conform to any one genre and it will always have you on the edge of the seat, assuming of course you pay attention and give it the respect it deserves. Organised crime, love, relationships, comedy; this movie has it all and I would heartily recommend it to anyone."

","Alright - Good points first: Hartnett is vaguely likable. Right... now that we've got that over with. This movie is a heap of junk, no redeeming qualities. Bruce Willis revisits his 9 yards persona of annoying grin hit-man (for about 5 minutes - he's not really in the fricken film - lucky him). Apart from that, the rest of the film made me want to feed my I.Q. to any available dog. Freeman should be ashamed. Kingsley shouldn't be able to look at people. Hartnett should get some sense.

","This film is one of those films that can't work if just ONE of the unbelievable setups doesn't happen. This film tries to entertain you by twists and surprises in the plot. For the first hour one wonders what is going on and how this whole movie will tie together. However, as the ending approaches and the plot is revealed, one cannot help realize how impossible the whole story is. There are so many times where one wonders how did they know that was going to happen that exact way. For example, when josh Harnett explains to Lucy Lui how Bruce Willis will shoot at her and at what part of her body, she's all ready for it---she plans to fake her death with an elaborate death scene. He shoots at her body exactly how they thought he would---how convenient for the progression of the plot!"

It had enough elements to make a decent movie but apparently the filmmakers don't have the courage of some of their own character's convictions."
"whit0055","1","17","42","18 May 2006"," Watch the trailer, not the movie
","Thee are a couple of good one-liners in this movie--they are in the trailer, so you can save your $8. For the rest, it's one of the most irritatingly stupid films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The basic problems are: 1) Really, really annoying main character. He gets punched around a good deal in the movie, but he's so snotty that I actually started rooting for the thugs to beat him up after about 20 minutes. The writer probably thought he was adorably brash, and I imagine a few 14-year-old girls will agree, since he does spend a lot of time wearing a towel.<br/><br/>2) Insulting the audience's intelligence. Many plot elements are predictable, but instead of supplying the viewer with just enough information to put things together, the movie provides extra hints, followed by tedious explanations from the characters, topped off with a replay of scenes from earlier in the movie, just in case you had nodded off for a critical scene. This is _The Usual Suspects_ remade for people with the attention span of Beavis and Butthead.<br/><br/>3) Completely depraved. The ending makes no sense from a human perspective; it only works if you think of characters as automata driven by cheesy genre conventions."
"zanity","3","10","22","11 July 2006"," One for the 'short bus'
","Here we have a so-called thriller that tells us exactly what the conclusion will be in the first few minutes of the movie, and then painfully and tediously crawls to that conclusion as if some how we are supposed to be surprised.<br/><br/>Worse, near the end, the director forces us to sit through the longest and most unnecessary explanation scene any movie of this genre has ever had. In words of one syllable, spoken loudly and slowly, the director provides a denouement longer than the combined length of all such scenes found in the complete collection of Scooby Doo cartoons. However, unlike the kids cartoon, 'Slevin' offers no intrigue or unexpected twists.<br/><br/>Now, in the film 'Click', we know the very ending from early in the film as well, but that forms part of the purpose of the movie, because it is the journey that matters, and the lessons learnt by the 'hero' along the way. It is impossible to offer the same explanation for 'Slevin'.<br/><br/>Instead, 'Slevin' offers sets that are pretty at first, but soon become tedious through absolute repetition. 'Slevin' offers dialogue that seems passable at first as a (very) poor man's attempt at 'clever', but soon becomes extremely tedious through very mechanical over use. Worse, unlike 'revenge' movies of the 70's that would often use very similar plots, the body of the movie contains no gratuitous thriller action. Watching paint dry would give you more of a thrill.<br/><br/>To be honest, the beginning of the film convinced me that I was watching some kind of clever joke, with the transparent nature of the plot serving to set up the real story. I was left speechless by the end.<br/><br/>Willis, Freeman and Kingsley are every bit as bad as one might expect in this kind of production. Hartnett and Liu are pleasing eye candy, but nothing else. The minor characters are VERY minor characters, though a couple, Missick and Williamson, come closest to some 'Tarantino'-style fun. Beyond the sets, the film is 'amateur hour' to the max.<br/><br/>Will you like this movie? If 'Layer Cake' was a winner for you, go for it. If, on the other hand, 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' floated your boat, stay well away. I rate this film 3 only because it was quite easy on the eye."
"emaan","6","7","14","4 November 2006"," Not bad but writers need to try harder
","The twist and reveal plot is definitely entertaining but all in all, it feels like a lesser effort trying to ape non-linear action-thriller hits like Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels, etc. The way this film reveals important pieces of the puzzle through flashbacks is inferior to the above examples because they feel more like 'the butler did it' cop-outs instead of integral story moments... again, these are signs of a not-so-well thought out script.<br/><br/>Another element that isn't strong enough to warrant a 'keeper' rating of 7 or better: weak dialogue. It's all very mundane and nothing really makes you feel the characters are interesting individuals with their own motivations. Nothing really dark or menacing to drive up the tension (the set-up murder was OPERATIC in the victims' hysteria and emotional), and hardly any comedic moments, except those meant to play off Mr Slevin's ""I'm a nice guy, why are you doing this to me?"" schmuck facade.<br/><br/>This one does better than the other try-hard movie in my book - THE BIG HIT - purely because the director and actors are more confident and capable. They saved the writer(s), really."
"vainani","6","7","14","8 July 2006"," Fun But Predictable.
","I think this movie is the victim of many very clever movies before it. It's difficult to mislead an audience and have a surprise ending that actually surprises any more. Unlike many recent great 'surprise ending' movies, like Usual Suspects, Sixth Sense, Memento and Seven, I was always one step ahead of guessing what was going to happen next in Lucky Number Slevin. Had Slevin come out before any of those others I mentioned it might be in the same category. Unfortunately it is not. <br/><br/>The style of Slevin is very nice and there are some great clever moments. I found myself entertained by it. But I felt myself entertained in the same way as watching a movie I've seen several times already, detecting early on the clues that would eventually reveal the big secret at the end. And the reveals were slow enough that even if you're not looking for them you can see them coming. <br/><br/>Because of this it feels more like a rental than a gotta-go-out-and-see-it one.

It was in the premiere category with Thank You for Smoking and Little Miss Sunshine, so it definitely has strength.

","A case of mistaken identity throws seemingly ordinary man Josh Hartnett between two ruthless New York City crime bosses (the always priceless Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). Now he has to dodge police detective Stanley Tucci and shady hit-man Bruce Willis while starting a hot love affair with the super-sexy Lucy Liu. But in a picture like this you know that nothing is quite as it seems as a dizzying final act turns the very foundation of the entire production on its ear and gives the audience a wickedly twisted conclusion that will make earlier trivial situations come to the forefront. Amazingly slick and well-crafted mind-bender that toes the line of obscurity throughout its early parts and then finally finds its way late and becomes a nice little success. Hartnett continues to impress when given the right material (like he had in ""Black Hawk Down"") and the other mainstays are generally constant guarantees. Patience and attention to small details will help you greatly in this flawed, but highly ambitious teaser that finds its legs and runs strong as it progresses. 4 stars out of 5."
"jhopkins-8","3","14","35","19 April 2006"," Weak plot and characters
","I'm not really sure what all the hype is about this movie. Sure it has a fantastic cast, but everyone is phoning in their performances on a weak script and cashing their checks.<br/><br/>The whole Boss/Rabbi feud isn't fully vested and it's explanation is weak. No one explains how they came into power in the first place, a nagging itch that's never scratched. The James Bond references were ridiculous and unnecessary. Lucy Liu seemed to think that talking fast is the same as actually acting out her part. The cop's involvement with the Boss and the Rabbi is never fleshed out either.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this movie plays up the sadness and intensity in the beginning and expects us to get sucked into the revenge theme without giving us motive for anyone but Slevin. This feels like just the summary instead of an actual film."
"nixtotherdpower","1","13","32","7 January 2007"," Why is six afraid of slevin? He isn't, cause slevin SUCKS.
","The first half of the movie is retarted. With a montage of scenes flashing by, that make no sense until the very end of the movie, to a bunch of gangsters and cops talking as though they have a degree in copying quentin Tarantino's writing style. From then on, it was just one stupid scene after another. Hmm, she was wearing a bullet proof vest, and it turns out he really wasn't nick fisher, or that the black boss didn't actually kill the son, OH NO. Also, the dialogue is so unrealistic, i almost puked. People talking back and fourth with extremely heightened banter? That was probably the worst part of the movie.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, lucky number slevin is horrible. All the writers gave the characters a degree in copying quentin Tarantino's writing and directing style, and the first half of the movie makes sense at the end, but just seems like a space filler upper, to make the movie feature length. This movie gets an A for effort, but an F for delivery."
"MovieManMenzel","7","12","29","6 May 2006"," ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is like a puzzle however when you put all the pieces together it seems all too easy.
","I was supposed to see ""Lucky Number Slevin"" a week before it was released in theaters at the Philadelphia Film Festival but oddly enough the night of the screening I couldn't attend because the film was sold out. After that night, I wanted to see ""Slevin"" but for some reason I never got around to seeing it. So today finally I decided to head to the theater and see what this ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was all about.<br/><br/>""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a movie about mistaken identity in which Slevin (Josh Harnett) gets mixed up in a war involving two of New York's biggest crime bosses. The crime bosses are the Rabbi played by Ben Kingsley and the Boss played by Morgan Freeman who as I am sure you already guessed are arch rivals. Unfortunately for Slevin, he is now in the middle of this mess and has to find a way out of it before he ends up dead. A somewhat clever crime thriller ensues <br/><br/>Coming out of ""Lucky Number Slevin"" earlier today, I really didn't know how to feel about it. So like most movies that I don't know what to think of after I see them, I decided to think about the film and then read some viewpoints on the film. By doing this I have come to the following conclusion, there were several aspects of this film that I really enjoyed and some that I did not.<br/><br/>So what worked and what didn't work you may ask? First off, I felt that most of the characters were all very interesting and well crafted especially Goodkat, the Boss, and the Rabbi. I also have to admit that this film was very suspenseful and kept its audience pretty much engaged throughout its entire running time. However, the first 20 minutes of this movie before Josh Harnett's character came into the film was the best and most interesting part of the film. Also if you actually pay close attention to the first 20 minutes of this film you will be able to figure out the entire movie which I am not sure is a good thing or a bad thing at this point.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film for the most part was very poor. I feel that the writer Jason Smilovic was trying too hard to be creative. The whole back and forth dialogue of ""Why do they call him the Rabbi? Because he is a Rabbi"" was rather lame. I think Mr. Smilovic wanted it to come off as funny and clever but instead it just seemed really stupid. This is just one example of the silly back and forth dialogue used but there is a lot more of it all of which I feel is unnecessary and dumb.<br/><br/>Also I think Lucy Liu's character was pointless. I think they just threw her in as a love interest because she really didn't seem to play an important part at all. With that being said, the ending which involved Lucy Liu was way too typical and mainstream. I felt if the movie ended just a few minutes earlier, it would have been a lot better or if the ending didn't seem like such a Hollywood ending it would have been better as well.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you really think about the film, it tries to hard to be clever. Thinking back a lot of this film is just too ironic for its own good. It's like the pieces of the puzzle go together too easily. I don't want to spoil this movie for anyone but if you keep your brain on during it or really think about it afterwards you will understand what I am saying. Both the writer and the director think that they are doing something very clever with ""Slevin"" but looking back, it wasn't really as clever as I think they intended the film to be.<br/><br/>Many will say this movie is like ""the Usual Suspects"", ""Snatch"", and ""Pulp Fiction"" and I would have to agree with that to a degree. The differences is those films especially ""Pulp Fiction"" are truly unique and very clever, where ""Lucky Number Slevin"" when all is said and done is just a good movie that will be forgotten by most in a few years. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie because it is entertaining and is somewhat clever; however the movie has its share of flaws but then again most movies do especially with crime thrillers.<br/><br/>In the end, I was expected a lot from ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and I can't help but feel a little disappointed by it. As I already said, I think this movie tried to be a little too clever for its own good and that wound up hurting it. Plus, the fact that everything just came together so nicely made the film a little bit too typical. But when all is said and done, ""Slevin"" is what it is, a somewhat clever crime thriller with decent performances and a pretty decent storyline. I remained entertained throughout the entire running time and while I wasn't blown away in the end, I was satisfied nonetheless.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a 7/10"
"johnnyboyz","6","12","29","26 February 2006"," Just above average
","With a good cast, a stylish looking trailer and with an interesting plot looking like it was in store, this film seemed like it was going to raise some eyebrows, unfortunately it didn't. The narrative is actually rather weak, despite the interesting twist at the end, it revolves around the case of mistaken identity for far too long early on to want to warrant multiple viewings; it was very frustrating to see the plot seem to just stick where it was. The editing added to this frustration as the quick cuts and sharp one-liners seemed to be, in a strange way, sarcastic to the viewer.<br/><br/>The acting was sharp and spot on from the two crime bosses Freeman and Kingsley and Tucci's policeman character added to the menace the antagonists carry with them through out this film. Bruce Willis is, as usual, on top form this time as an emotionless and professional killer. One problem with this film is that it seems to want to be numerous other ones already made. Most noticeably, it has the witty sharpness twinned with a simple but effective crime element as seen in 'Snatch' and the technique of making one character looking like the victim the whole time before flipping it on its head just like in 'The Usual Suspects'. These aspects aren't badly done, they just seem 'familiar' and it's truly frustrating.<br/><br/>I really tried to like this film as it falls into my favourite film genre but on the whole, it was just stumbling over its self at various points and doing the build up to the twisted climax no favours at all. The film is by no means bad but it is far from good with numerous flaws in the way it hangs about meaninglessly early on and draws out the whole thing in a slow manner. The one-liners get tiresome and it is relatively action starved on the whole. I'd recommend it, but only just. Go to see it for the dizzy array of stars on show and if you're feeling like seeing a crime film which will by no means leave you gasping for breath, but will leave you relatively well satisfied at the same time."
"Tom-AVA","10","6","12","23 June 2007"," One of the best films i've seen recently
","OK, so it is the summer of 2007, as a movie lover you would expect me to be at the cinema watching one of this years summer blockbusters that people have been going on about for a fair amount of time. However, aside from the fact that I've already seen all this years summer blockbusters (excluding Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which isn't yet out), you have to realise that this summers films haven't quite been as good as we expected.<br/><br/>So this evening, i sat down, turned of Sky Movies Premiere and watched Lucky Number Slevin. I'll be honest, i really thought this film was gunna be bad, which was the main reason i hadn't bought this film on DVD or even watched it in the cinema last year. But for the first time this summer i was truly blown away by a film, and this one wasn't even a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>This film us truly phenomenal. Its pacing is fairly quick and it always keeps you interested. The characters are all brilliantly played, especially Slevin by Josh Hartnett. He is a truly great character and really well acted. His small, one liners will really make you laugh, but when you see him being a lil' bit serious, he is serious. The story of this film takes many twists and turns and through the whole film you will sit there trying to think of what could happen next and what he twists are going to be. The killings are brilliantly done, perhaps even Tarintino-esquire.<br/><br/>I highly recommend that this summer, if your bored of the rubbish summer blockbusters and you haven't seen this film before, maybe you should, cos its just brilliant and one of the best films i have seen in a long time."
"griffinmill","4","6","12","24 August 2006"," It might have worked, just...
","While many of this film's components were well chosen, and the script kept the story rolling at a reasonable clip - the casting of Mr. Hartnett in a critical role ruined the entire enterprise. Whatever his virtues, Mr. Hartnett comes across as an overly-confident Jr. high school drama club member who's able to match wits with experienced veterans. If you buy that conceit, enjoy the ride. Carrot Top might have been a better choice if the producers hadn't been trolling for - uh- I don't know WTF motivated the Josh call. Moist pre-teens? There was PEARL HARBOR. Hello. Anyway, LUCKY NUMBER... will more than recover investors' costs. They should lose massively for backing a cheaply conceived, badly cast bore."
"libero-9","1","19","51","3 March 2006"," Dire wannabe Tarantino/Ritchie rubbish
","Please don't watch this film - its terrible! Doubtless, the very simple-minded will love this ""thriller"" which all begins to unravel when a horse ridiculously pulls up for no apparent reason in a race-flashback sequence. When we're introduced to Hartnetts character the film thinks its a smart-ass goofball comedy, but tries to switch into a serious Guy Ritchie style caper with the most ridiculous plot twists and turns you could imagine. By the time they're revealed you'll have stopped caring anyway. Stupid boring dialogue, unfunny gags, so much borderline plagiarism it's ridiculous. It's a relief that some influential critics from some esteemed organizations (BBC, The Guardian etc.) have highlighted how weak this film is.<br/><br/>Now allow me to elaborate on my 'wannabe Tarantino/Ritchie' and 'borderlne plagiarism' comments with some examples; the business of the watch passed from father to son (Pulp Fiction), the inconsequential dialogue referencing other films (Pulp Fiction), the James Bond dialogue and Connery impersonations (Trainspotting), the casting of Bruce Willis and Robert Forster (Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown), Willis shoots with handguns in both hands (Reservoir Dogs), the comic pairs of hit men (Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock Stock...), victims shot through a car windscreen (Reservoir Dogs). I could go on. Its a fair point that even Tarantino borrows from other films but not as clumsily as in this case. Director McGuigan and writer Smilovic should be banned from making movies forever. So much about this film that makes no sense at all. It really is utter nonsense. The amount of rubbish they try to make you believe is insulting. If you'd like to see a more intelligent crime piece, many TV channels show Scooby-Doo re-runs. I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this but now I can save others. You can too. Spread the word."
"robsterdude","9","4","7","17 December 2008"," Probably one of Hartnetts best films, alongside a brilliant cast of actors.
","Lucky Number Slevin is directed by newish director Paul McGuigan. This is his third film since Wicker Park and The Acid House, alongside some programs he worked on for television, this movie boasts to be one of his best yet. Paul alongside a quite large list of top class actors/actresses, manage to create this absolute gem of a film, with a magnificent plot and twist to keep the viewer entertained until the movie has finished.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is quite humorous; mostly every character is introduced, and the scene has been set, Slevin (Hartnett) has been thrown into a case of mistaken identity. Slevin is visited by two rival gangs, one led by The Boss (Freeman) the other by the Rabbi (Kingsley), and assuming Slevin is someone called Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher is a regular gambler who has a lot of money in the minus column; therefore Slevin is blamed for this. There is a story set also for the two gangs, they both live across the street from one another, both The Boss and The Rabbi are prisoner to their own home, fearing what one man will do to the other. The Bosses son is assassinated, so the finger is clearly pointed at The Rabbi.<br/><br/>When Slevin comes to meet the boss, Slevin owes The Boss, $96,000 and of course Slevin would have trouble coming up with the money so The Boss sets down a proposition, for Slevin to assassinate The Rabbi's son ""Yitzchok the Fairy"", as a retaliation. After this meeting Slevin is collected once again but this time by the Rabbi's men, and then being told he owes The Rabbi a significant amount of money. Slevin now has a choice, if he doesn't kill the Rabbi's son then either way The Boss or The Rabbi will get to him first so he decides he will say yes to The Bosses offer. As somewhat unreal the story set in the first half seems, all of Slevin's choices lead up to the fantastic climax of the movie.<br/><br/>The whole movie is made with a sense of style, dark humour and wit and a feeling that you are in touch with the actors playing the roles. It's how the characters interact, especially the chemistry between Hartnett and Liu, the love story behind it all is heart warming and pleasant, it isn't soppy it's more... friendly. Goodkat (Willis) plays a vital role on the sideline, apart from him being a world class assassin his part in the movie isn't truly revealed until the plot twist is.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie works, though it may well borrow certain aspects from other movies. People sometimes call the twist the ""Usual Suspects Effect"", for it having a similar plot twist, though don't be fooled, it's not an easy thing to figure out unless you happen to be extremely observant. It's the little things that count in this movie, the love for the characters, the sudden change between a humorous first half into a dark and gritty second half, I can almost guarantee you will be entertained. Josh Hartnett fits the role of Slevin better than anyone of the other young talent around in Hollywood, Affleck or Damon would have probably ruined the role since Hartnett has that cockiness about him, along with the right sense of charm that makes Slevin who he is. Lucy Liu, who plays Lindsey, plays a clever and funny ""Girl Next Door"" character, which is almost in a way like a female version of Slevin.<br/><br/>The film boasts an amazing soundtrack, which after listening to it for a few hours is very impressive. They soundtrack really shows the mood of the film, the first half of the album being very much more upbeat and slightly jazzy, the second half being much more minor, using more strings and with a slightly more inspirational sound.<br/><br/>Conclusion  McGuigan is sure to be one of the next big people in movie making, everything about the film just works, as well as the big talent that's on screen at one time. In my own personal opinion its one of my most favourite films of all time, though of course this movie isn't to everyone's tastes purely due to the familiarity it has to other films, but there is something unique about Lucky Number Slevin, something that stands out above the movies today, a real gem of a film. It has to be viewed to be believed, and is definitely a movie you have to see ""Before You Die"".<br/><br/>-Fin"
"wraith6000","10","4","7","17 November 2006"," Have you ever sat down for a film and just asked yourself whats the point half way through?
","I remember back to a time when the idea of going to watch a thriller was preparing myself for a predictable experience. Films like The bone collector were easy to guess the outcome even before all the details were laid out. Don't get me wrong these films are great, if you prepared yourself not to expect too much. Lucky Number Slevin is different; the film starts of like all others in its genre, however don't be fooled by its seemingly hapless continuity. If you wait through the apparently mediocre beginnings you will see how these ideas combine together with a fast paced progression revealing a traditional 'vengeance' plot. All of which is conveyed under a perspective that makes it impossible to predict the outcome. The characters are well thought out; even the minor roles are somewhat influential, from the street-smart detective, and to a mobster's homosexual son. This film is masterful experience one for those willing to think."

The story itself has twists, the dialog itself has twists, and you can't really find anything that is disturbing you except the fact that you liked the movie, even though you didn't catch it from the beginning. But lighten up sunshine cause the movie will grow all the way from the beginning till the end.

","This movie is great for several reasons. It has a few tricks in its bag, but its not a one watch wonder. The action, the comedy, and that lock stock style of character coolness makes this movie worth watching over and over again. The movie has lots of star-power which is often bad thing, but this is one of those movies where you feel like the stars were cast very well and they're doing the movie b/c they like it versus to make the big bucks.<br/><br/>Also, before this movie, I've never been a particularly big Lucy Liu fan. I've only ever seen her in either serious or corny fighting movies. In this movie, she is intelligent, quirky, cute and ultimately comes across as having a great personality. I personally think this type of role plays to her strengths more so than the other movies I have seen her in. Hopefully, in the future she gets an opportunity to be more than a corny or essentially mute Asian action figure."

I would advise anybody interested in seeing this movie NOT to, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES read any spoilers for this film.

I kept wanting to give this film a chance so I would try and try to give it my full attention in the event that the plot was good, and even though the acting was good, it still fell short, and the focus just bothered me way too much.

","First off, let me announce that even fans of this film agree that it contains the worst interior decoration/wallpaper in the history of the cinema.<br/><br/>Now, after the first 15 minutes of the film (entirely pointless because Bruce Willis tells a man a story for 15 minutes and then kills him (WTF?!!!)), it becomes evident as to the tone and direction of the film. But after half of it goes by it becomes morbid and overly violent; a polar of it's first half. That's a no-no.<br/><br/>The acting makes this to be a kitschy dark comedy but it eventually transpires into a bloody mess that was evident from the start (literally, I knew where it was going to end 20 minutes into it). No sympathy for any of the characters is acquired because they do not ask for any. Also, the lack of a linear storytelling style destroys all hope of a ""proper"" catharsis. Or even a remotely satisfying ending.<br/><br/>I hated almost every minute of this film and if you want to see a ""real"" revenge film watch South Korea's ""Oldboy"" or even QT's ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"".<br/><br/>D."

","Lucky Number Slevin is witty, funny, entertaining, with amazing performances and excellent dialog.<br/><br/>Slevin Kelvara (Josh Hartnett) is not the luckiest guy in the world.He just lost his job, his apartment, and caught his girlfriend cheating. If that's not enough, two rival crime bosses, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), both think Slevin is someone else and start looking for him. And when a world-class assassin, Mr. GoodKat (Bruce Willis), shows up in New York for the first time in two decades, a police detective (Stanley Tucci) starts to wonder what's going on.<br/><br/>We didn't have a mistaken identity thriller in quite some time, and fortunately, Slevin was a worthy addition to the genre. Jason Smilovic's script was witty, sharp, and full of twists and turns to keep the viewer interested. The dialog was very funny, and I loved the word playing between Slevin, The Boss, and The Rabbi. My only complaint with the story was that some key plot elements could be predicted way too early in the film. Anyway, that didn't stop me from enjoying the show.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is great. The sets, cinematography, costumes, and soundtrack are all top notch. Director Paul McGuigan, clearly influenced by Tarantino, was very good. He really knew how to switch smoothly between dark and funny scenes. He could use more editing though, as the ""explanation"" scenes near the end were longer than they should have even. But maybe he had to do that, because the story was somewhat complex.<br/><br/>I was very impressed by the acting in the film. Each actor was original in his own way. Freeman, finally playing against type (When was the last time he was a baddie?), was menacing. Willis, totally comfortable with taking a back seat this time, was funny and cool. Kingsley was able to overcome his recent duds and gave an amazing performance. His accent cracked me up several times. But the real surprise here is Harnett. After his, ummm, not so good performances in Pearl Harbor, Halloween H20, and 40 Days and 40 nights, he shines in Slevin. He was likable, without losing the character's edge. I really wish he works with McGuigan again in the near future.<br/><br/>So, I'd definitely recommend Slevin. It was the best thriller I've seen in quite some time."

Ben Kingsley was in that too. Was that a reference to a film that's only a few years old or a mistake? I honestly think it was a mistake.

My guess is they knew the story wasn't very strong so they decided to load it up with big name stars, who have all done much better work.

"brenttraft","4","11","27","15 April 2006"," SLevin Reasons Why This Film is Disappointing
","1. The script is not as clever as it wants to be. The script is an Elmore Leonard wannabe. It tries to have slick, snappy dialog, but always falls short of the real thing. The basic story is okay, but some of the twists are more contrived than they need to be.<br/><br/>2. The directing is not as slick as it wants to be. Last month's ""Running Scared"" was a similar type of film and was done much better. ""Lucky Number SLeven"" is crude by comparison.<br/><br/>3. Great cast, but little screen time. Sir Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are great, but they are not in the film enough. Bruce Willis is not given much to do but smirk. Stanley Tucci has a small, thankless role. Lucy Lui is great and has the luxury of being the only female character in the film.<br/><br/>4. Josh Hartnett ruins every film he is in, and this is no exception. The movie producers must have thought if they got some really good actors for this film, nobody would notice how bad Josh Hartnett is, but it's the opposite. Having good actors only intensifies how bad Josh Hartnett really is.<br/><br/>5. This film is designed to be a ""guy flick,"" but we see Josh Hartnett in a towel for half the film while Lucy Lui is fully clothed. By doing that, they do not really appeal to anybody.<br/><br/>6. The music sucks and is not memorable.<br/><br/>7. Josh Hartnett ruins every film he is in. I couldn't think of any other reasons, so I thought I would overstate the obvious. It's too bad, because this film had potential, but they really screwed it up. Even so, it will probably make a decent rental."
"bastetg4","4","11","27","10 March 2006"," Derivative and boring
","The dialogue was laughably bad, and the acting (from some of the best in the biz) was sub-par for the most part. I recognize this is a ""thriller"" and that doesn't always mean good dialogue, but there were far too many lengthy pseudo-intellectual scenes with no action to excuse bad dialogue. Oh, and of course, a chess game--the universal symbol for a complex sub-plot. I did enjoy Hartnett's character, but when I can see the end coming from a mile away it really takes a lot out of the movie for me. The ending was far too much like The Usual Suspects without being nearly as surprising or complex. If you see it free, like I did, it's not that bad, but don't waste money on it."
"tubby1","5","5","10","11 December 2008"," Top Cast - Mediocre Film.
","Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis...A fantastic cast. How it managed to bring these fine thespians to a film that is a rather poor 'Lock, Stock/Snatch' imitation is rather bewildering. The film follows Josh Hartnett as he is inadvertently employed by two rival mob- bosses (Freeman and Kingsley) in their escapades against one-another.<br/><br/>It is not ideal to tinker with the mood/tone of a film, especially when they are never interlinked or brought together in a logical and practical manner. For three-quarters of the film it bumbles along in a cheery tone and then it gets rather serious. The last 20 minutes turns into a 'Usual Suspects' mêlée of cuts and edits. These edits are meant to convey how slick and clever the film has been but its poor, not because of the way it is done but because of the ambiguity of the script. <br/><br/>The film is nothing more than average and was 'Lucky' to be bolstered by a great cast, which would have given it box-office clout, and to some degree a meager helping with reviews. If you are a fan of Kingsley, Freeman or Willis be warned this is one to forgo."

","I just watched Lucky Number Slevin and at first I admit that I was watching, but it seemed like one of those confusing movies I'd never get, but my mom said to just sit tight and wait for the great ending, and everything just made sense from there and it turned into one of the best thrillers I have seen in years! It was very funny because this movie reminded me so much of North By Northwest, and they even mentioned that in the middle of the movie! I mean, what's not to love about this movie? <br/><br/>Basically it starts off as your typical mob type of movie, a murder here, a murder there, but that leads into the main plot that takes us to Josh Hartnett, who plays Slevin. Slevin is staying with a friend and gets taken away when he is mistaken for being Nick Fisher, the friend he's staying with, and he's been asked to not only kill a mobster boss's rival, another mobster boss's son, but he owes the mobster boss, the man who's son he's going to kill, $33,000 and must get it in 48 hours. He and the girl across the hall he's fallen for try to figure out what is going on and keep landing back to a man called Smith, played by Willis. Surprise twists and turns take it from there.<br/><br/>This is a very exciting movie, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone. The acting, the sets, the action is just incredible and keeps you looking at all times. I am really impressed that there was an actual good thriller of 2006, this one keeps you guessing and will have you surprised from beginning to end.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Too many things seen in other previous movies; the cast is definitely over the average but this revenge thriller is on the whole a little bit too forced, its dialogs sometimes too obscure. Could say it's kinda disposable flick, a lot of analogies to Quentin Tarantino's productions. By the way Quentin looks like a genius by comparison; to sum up might it recycles too much (also has some Guy Ritchie's atmospheres), although a movie starring Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, along with Bruce Willis, must have something interesting. Found a bit disappointing Josh Hartnett's performance, nevertheless it's compensated by other stars"

It was a trite, contrived plot, with two super egos, with matching fantasy penthouse apartments, who have a grudge match which our character, Slevin, becomes involved with. Basically they used tried and true techniques for making a movie, so it seemed like a movie, but the story, the script, the plot was unbelievably stupid! Just drek, a waste of time, a total Hollywood mind F$#K.<br/><br/>This movie was meant to be important and deep and it was just plain idiotic. I rarely give negative reviews, in fact this might be my first, but I cannot recommend this film.

You feel betrayed and dumber after watching this film. It takes part of your soul with it, as you watch, sucking out your intelligence.<br/><br/>This is a horrible waste of time of a movie.

Lucy Liu is the girl next door who Josh Harnett falls in love with. I been waiting for this movie to come out in theaters for a while I the waiting wasn't worth it. I thought this movie would be like the classics pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but I was wrong. The movie didn't suck it was funny some parts, had a little action, but it was missing something. I do have to say the ending is amazing and will blow you away. The ending is amazing and it makes the movie a little better.

A young kid (Hartnett) who gets his identity confused is brought and mixed up with two mob bosses (Freeman and Kingsley). This movie was far too complicated to even enjoy, you have about five things all clustered together. ""Slevin""'s whole story line is what you've seen before, perhaps a nice slice of FICTION. By far one of the years most forgettable and worst films"

Anyone who has seen any of them play their previous roles can appreciate THESE ARE NOT THE RIGHT CHARACTERS to a gangland drama.<br/><br/>I half expect Kingsley to come out with some ""lets make peace"" metaphor when he starts ordering the executions, and Freeman to start narrating some penguin march when he starts threatening in such a mediocre unbelievable manner, I can imagine all 4 of them laughing all the way to the bank as they took the producers money for a half arsed job. The 4 of them should know better than to take on such a cliché script with ""I wannabe gangster"" written all over it.<br/><br/>The violence is so unbelievable, the fight scenes seem comical, the film set looks cardboard, everything from the clothes down to the props just looks so out of place. It was painful to watch it for more than 30 mins. Its almost like they tried a Sin City type of atmosphere by using cheap sets and unrealistic acting roles. I still cant decide if they used cardboard or CGI for the sky scrapers. Its REALLY that bad."
"the_way_of_the_future","3","8","19","1 March 2006"," A Poor Movie
","Do not let this all-star cast charm you into seeing what I believe to be a poor movie of this kind. Morgan Freeman's undertaking of a New York City crime boss is unconvincingly played and even the likes of Lucy Lui give an embarrassing attempt of acting. By including a 'Charlie's Angel' in the cast and a great actor, who we have seen playing better roles in characters on the other side of the law, is this really such a surprise?<br/><br/>With edited camera shots whilst the conversation is in a continuous flow, the directing in many parts is over-elaborate and greatly confusing. Scripting also leaves a lot to be desired. Dialogue ranges from short, sweet, but never really to the point, to long profuse sentences that fail in any attempt to create humour.<br/><br/>To give this film credit, the last 20 minutes is one of the best endings I have seen in a movie of this genre, comparable to the likes of The Usual Suspects. The story ends with all corners covered so that no member of the audience is lost in its revealing climax, which is very cleverly written. This finale certainly awoke me from what I was beginning to believe would be a complete disaster.<br/><br/>One must ask themselves whether or not 85 minutes of filming mumbo jumbo is worth the wait for 20 minutes of one truly great ending. It is a chance I took, but one which I am unlikely to take again."
"zardoz-13","9","3","5","29 January 2014"," An Engrossing Revenge Epic
","Bruce Willis plays a world-class assassin with a soft spot in ""Gangster No 1"" helmer Paul McGuigan's ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" and he wears a hairpiece, too! This complicated, flashback-riddled, surprise-laden, revenge thriller co-stars Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu, Robert Forster and Stanley Tucci. McGuigan and ""My Own Worst Enemy"" scenarist Jason Smilovic keep you guessing throughout their elaborately plotted film's 110 minutes. The humor as well as the quirky dialogue stand out. One gangster lectures our hero about horses: ""My father used to say: 'The first time someone calls you a horse you punch him on the nose, the second time someone calls you a horse you call him a jerk but the third time someone calls you a horse, well then perhaps it's time to go shopping for a saddle."" McGuigan stages everything with a fresh eye for detail. For example, consider the way that the baseball that strikes bookie Bennie Begin in the eye and kills him is handled. Sometimes, it is just the crazy wallpaper that McGuigan uses that catches your eye. Essentially, the filmmakers orchestrate the action around their own clever gambler's maneuver known as the Kansas City Shuffle. According to murderous hit-man Goodkat, ""Kansas City Shuffle is when everybody looks right and you go left."" You can never take anything literally in ""Lucky Number Slevin."" The hero is not who he really appears to be, and we're the only ones that know it. Nevertheles, even we don't know everything, and McGuigan created considerable tension and suspense by withholding this information. In some ways, """"Lucky Number Slevin"" is comparable to the ""Usual Suspects."" Like Tarantino, McGuigan enjoys making references to popular movies, and Hartnett and Lucy Liu converse about the James Bond characters. Later, one of the mobsters makes small talk with our hero and refers to Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest."" ""Lucky Number Slevin"" unfolds with an intriguing tragedy involving a racetrack wager on an ill-fated horse back in 1979. It seems the horse was shot up with drugs and was supposed to win a race but died instead before it reached the finish line. One young fellow's entire family pays for his egregious error, and they suffer death by shooting. The man who sought to exploit the secret of the drugged steed has to wait years before he is eliminated, too. Nick Fisher is sitting in a depot when he meets Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) sitting incongruously in a wheel chair. Later, we are introduced to the actual protagonist (Josh Hartnett), who finds himself in an interesting predicament in another man's apartment. Our hero spends the first half of the action on the wrong side of the eight-ball before he surprises us with his actual identity. Every character possesses something interesting about them. You'll meet a Hassidic Jewish gunsel who never says anything and it makes him singular. The ending appears to come out of left field. On the commentary track, McGuigan said that he likes to keep the audience confused. Josh Hartnett spends about a quarter of the film wearing nothing but a towel. Lucy Lui is cast as a sexy coroner.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, a young man's life (Josh Hartnett) is turned upside down after he loses his job, his apartment, and catches him girl cheating on him. This is a really amusing scene. His girlfriend is having sex with another guy. She is on her hands and knees and the guy is doing her doggie style when Hartnett walks in on them. Despite being caught in this humiliating position, she carries on a conversation with him. He cannot leave town so he visits a friend's apartment and encounters a pretty lady, Lindsay (Lucy Liu), who showed up looking for sugar. Eventually, because he inhabits the apartment of Nick Fisher, two rival gangsters make some outrageous demands on him. The Boss (Morgan Freeman) wants $96 thousand, while his competitor the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) wants $33 thousand. These two men were once friends but now they are enemies. They live across from each other in Gotham high rises and can see what each other is doing when they stand at their windows. In a sense, this enmity resembles the competition between the opposing sides in the town of San Miquel in Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars."" About a half hour before its finale, McGuigan's film begins to yield its secrets.<br/><br/>Enigmatic but exciting, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" will keep you involved from fade in to fade out with all its twists and turns. The violence earned ""Lucky Number Slevin"" an R-rating. For the record, Hartnett gets punched twice in the nose, and later Stanley Tucci wallops him in the stomach. Several characters die in a brutal manner. Indeed, the first character that we see is shown as he is about to enter his car. We are looking at the scene from inside the vehicle when we see the man approach his car and then the driver's door window shatters with blood and he smashes throughout it. The second man dies when a baseball is hurled at him. This occurs moments before the second man's bodyguards are injected with poison before they realize they have been stricken. Two criminals suffocate in a barbaric death with plastic bags over their heads that are taped snugly around their necks. For the record, McGuigan abhorred the title ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and said Kansas City Shuffle would have made a better title."

It is funny is all the right places, it has action , and again the acting is the best part. Most people forget to mention the acting of Stanley Tucci, and maybe he is not the best from this one, but his character and acting really holds it all together.<br/><br/>When you are having one of those days where you don't feel right, and you just don't know what movie to watch (a comedy? action? horror?) just put this one in and enjoy.

With amazing plot twists and enthralling performances by Hartnett, Kingsley, Freeman, Liu, and Willis, I would definitely recommend this well thought out and incredibly put together film to anyone.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is slightly confusing, but comes together at the end incredibly. I must say, I didn't see the end coming whatsoever. The violence was absolutely perfect- not over dramatic, and every bit of it was necessary with the perfect amount of gore.<br/><br/>Monologues from Kigsley and Freeman spice up the dialog, and Hartnett plays a very good, witty, smart-ass character.

The fast editing in this film is real teenage hormone stuff, meaningless. The violence is not effective, again its all fast editing to cover up a low budget. The supporting actors are not that good but they don't need to be for this rubbish. The dialogue continues to irritate with the Chinese girl who whitters and twitters on throughout the film, even Ben Kingsley's at it. The film tries to be funny but I guarantee you won't leave the cinema hall laughing. I couldn't get out quick enough. I really don't want to say much more about this film because I'm getting bored just thinking about it. Oh yeah, should mention the meaningless James Bond homage dialogue with the Chinese girl and Slevin, whats that all about. I thought the film was trying to copy Casino and Goodfellas at first with the narrative intro, this fizzles out into a comedy film and then the film snaps into cold psycho mode at the end. Did I mention the dialogue?"

You can see why this is out in Europe before it opens in the US- the film company obviously has no confidence in the film.

With all the inventivness this film had, all the dei ex machina, all the do-what-you-want-and-nobody-will-notice, they didn't have to kill that guy so gratuitously. Well, you say, Bruce Willis was that kind of guy. So, okay, this film glorifies murder, then. Just shock, that's all that this film was about. The two guys living opposite each other in penthouses?

He's too plain white bread in a sea of crazy wacky characters. He needs more presence of his own. This is a fast talking twisty complicated convoluted story. Everybody is talking a lot for the sake of talking a lot. The writer is trying to be too clever.

How it escaped my radar is a mystery as it has some of my favorite stars and some surprising performances.<br/><br/>First, Lucy Liu (Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Charlie's Angels) gave what I consider the best performance of her career. She was absolutely adorable and really made this film entertaining.<br/><br/>Her performance, combined with Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down), someone I never paid any attention to in the past, made me think that this was something of a comedy. Harnett played the mistaken identity to perfection and was cool and funny.<br/><br/>You always had to wonder what was going on with Bruce Willis in the shadows. It was driving me nuts. But then the direction changes and you know it is not a comedy but a revenge movie and your jaw drops at the cleverness with which this film was made.<br/><br/>Big Kudos to director Paul McGuigan, an unknown to me, but who is working on a film version of one of my favorite old TV shows, The Equalizer; and to writer Jason Smilovic.<br/><br/>With those already mentioned and Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci, this film is worth everyone's time and a must see.

"archiecm","6","4","8","24 December 2006"," Marred revenge flick
","It took me two screenings of this film to discover the major flaw. I was OK with most of the ""mistakes"" other nay-sayers mentioned: plot, acting, dialogue, Lucy Liu, and the violence. I don't think revenge solves anything (see the Middle East) but strangely, I like movies about revenge when the wronged party is the one seeking it, e.g., Denzel Washington in Man on Fire. But sometimes the avenger kills innocent people, e.g., Gregory Peck in The Bravados. And this is not good. It creates fertile ground for another revenge movie (innocent bystander's kid hunts down and kills his Dad's killer).<br/><br/>In Lucky Number Slevin, the innocent guy is Nick Fisher. Nick is killed simply because Sleven (Hartnet) needs his apartment and ID. So Slevin becomes pretty much the same kind of person he's attempting to wipe out. <br/><br/>Therefore his happy ending with Lucy Lui isn't all that happy in my book. And what about those bookies who had to die? They had no part in the killing of Slevin's Mom and Dad. They died for their books that helped Slevin target poor Nick Fisher. See? I have the story down after two viewings."

With Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley in it, well, need I say more? You know there's going to be great acting. There are a few twists, but nothing that's going to have you saying ""what the hell happened"" at the end of the movie. The surprise ending is fully explained (which at my age is always a plus).

"DICK STEEL","10","4","8","16 August 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Luck Number SLevin
","YES! For most parts in the first half of the movie, that's just how the dialogue is gonna get, in some of the banter between characters. However, fret not, the movie is extremely engaging, but only if you hang in there and keep the faith. There are plenty of moments where scenes are just seemingly disparate, but knowing that this is Hollywood, by the time the movie ends, it'll just about explain everything to you as it lays the cards on the table.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett plays Slevin Kelevra, a man who thought his day could get no better when he lost his job, and got home finding his girlfriend tripping over and another man bending over her, doggy styled. He takes flight and is supposed to meet a friend, but ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Soon enough, he gets unwittingly embroiled in a deadly game of hired guns, between two of the largest crime bosses in town, known as The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), in gangs formed between racial lines. He's caught in Catch-22, Hobson's Choice and Murphy's Law situations all rolled into one, as engineered by a professional killer called Goodkat (Bruce Willis), and his only consolation in all this madness, is a chirpy neighbour Lindsey (Lucy Liu).<br/><br/>It's a snappy, snazzy movie with a very slick plot, and I'll not discuss any more of the movie, the premise, nor the themes, otherwise it'll be a dead giveaway. Suffice to say that I'm quite impressed by the way the movie unfolded, and how the editing kept certain key scenes under wraps. However, it is difficult to stop eagle-eyed viewers whose brains are working in overdrive, to figure out the entire plot before the midway mark.<br/><br/>The cast provided this movie with the additional power of attraction. Josh Hartnett is sure to draw in his female admirers, and both Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley bring some regality into the picture even though they're playing veteran rival crime bosses. Bruce Willis seemed to be taking on more supporting characters, but still stereotyped back into the usual cop, or killer roles, though his Goodkat character here is uber-cool.<br/><br/>One of the must watch movies of next week, full of genuine fun! Be sure to catch it!"

The music adds to this style successfully. The acting is also superb. Freeman and Kingsley make an excellent performance that is widely different to anything they have done before. Willis is excellent as the super intense Mr Goodkat. Liu is also very good at adding comedy to the film. However the best cast member was Josh Hartnett who played both the comic and noir lead convinceingly. The story is the film's greatest strength with a clever plot that keeps you guessing. Although you can guess the ultimate ending about ten minutes in, how you get to that point is tough to work out. It is also very clever by turning from a comedy into a dark drama without you even noticing."

","I enjoy quick movies, heist movies and smart movies with great dialogs. I expected to see something like that in this movie, although I didn't knew the director's nature nor career.<br/><br/>Boy, was I disappointed. Isn't this a real wanna be movie? I did understand it from head to bottom, but It didn't impress me at all! Maybe it is because of the poor intensity with which the characters were written. I never felt nothing for either Slevin nor her fast-talking Chinese neighbor. He could die and I wouldn't give a thing.<br/><br/>The plot left me a huge taste of deja vu. Seen it, and enjoyed it. Basing itself on stereotypes, characters that draw themselves on unfunny fast conversations; with a humor that's far from universal. It's not even humor. Less if pieces of board with no common sense like the characters in the film digress into them.<br/><br/>The twist disengages you completely from the movie, thinking that with the poor story awfully developed into snoozing stages we will be interested into it. The character explaining it all to the camera did it for me. Didn't have fun, didn't bring me anything new. I really ask you to rent it if you are in a HUGE crave of fun, and all other options are exhausted. Watch ""The Usual Suspects"" instead. A lot more mature."

","In New York, when the unlucky newcomer Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in the apartment of his friend Nick Fisher for a leisure time, he is mistakenly taken as being his friend, who debts money to two powerful bosses of the criminal world. He is pressed by The Boss (Morgan Freeman) to kill the gay son of The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley), as a payback for the death of The Boss's son. Nick's next door neighbor Lindsay (Lucy Lui), who works in the morgue, tries to help Slevin and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, the cold-blood killer Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) is mysteriously helping both crime lords, while Slevin is also pressed by Detective Brikowski (Stanley Tucci), who is chasing The Boss and The Rabbi. In the end, revenge is a dish best served cold.<br/><br/>""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a surprisingly great movie directed by Paul McGuigan, the director of the good ""Wicker Park"", the excellent ""The Reckoning"" and the underrated ""Gangster No. 1"". Many readers may not be familiarized with his name, but he is an excellent young director. The story and the screenplay have many plot points in the end and pays a great homage to Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"". The story is funny, gore, and has great moments, and I believe that intelligent viewers that can understand non-linear screenplays will love this film.

It's not your ordinary genre- biased movie, but something new. The storyline, which appears quite overwhelming at first works out perfectly throughout the movie. I've always loved non-chronological movies, and this film pulls it off wonderfully.<br/><br/>What struck me the most was the Tarantino-esk dialogues in this movie.

","I've been studying screen writing by tearing apart screenplays while watching the movies. This is a terrific screenplay. It is almost too intricate at times because if you miss some of the dialogue you might miss part of the story. The only weakness it had was that I knew something was up with the Slevin character not being who he said he was because some of the dialogue wasn't logical (he wasn't behaving like someone who was terrified for his life). But that could be overlooked due to the great sets, acting, tempo, twists, and humor. Writing serious scenes with humorous dialogue is an art and I hope we see more movie scripts from Jason Smilovic."

","Lucky number Slevin is a case of justifying the unjustifiable using ""surprising"" flashbacks. That film has an obsession trying to surprise the spectator, doesn't matter if there is no connexion with the plot. You are constantly, and all the time, exposed to flashbacks that try explain things of the immediate future, even if they are irrelevant. We can see the surprise factor used in no less than 10 times along the movie, loosing completely the effect.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the screenplay is forced and absurd, all the characters use ""cool"" sentences every shot, that kind of sentences that worked in the past with little doses, but that loose all effect in the ridiculous story of Lucky number Slevin. <br/><br/>The main character wants to be like similar characters done in the past by Brad Pitt. It is sad to see such a clearly failed aim. Although Josh Harnett is a good actor, he sees himself doing such absurd things like being half naked during the whole first part of the movie, unnecessary, unjustified again.<br/><br/>It deserves also a mention the funny character performed by Bruce Willis (Mr.Goodka), who arrives repeatedly with a ridiculous terrific sound, as he would be Darth Vader, explaining mostly senseless things.<br/><br/>In my point of view there is no main purpose, no connexion, nothing new able to impress us in that movie, we are simply talking about a bad movie that even its good cast and good music can't hide a big problem of intentions."

","Akira Kurosawa's film Yojimbo involves a samurai that plays off two rival criminal clans against each other until they are both annihilated. Sergio Leone made almost a shot for shot remake of Yojimbo unofficially (Kurosawa sued him and won out of court) to create Fistful of Dollars, the movie that made Clint Eastwood a legend. In that movie Eastwood played a gunslinger playing two ranchers against each other and, you guessed it, both of their crews get annihilated. This movie is heavily influence by both of those films. In it Josh Hartnett plays off Ben Kingsley against Morgan Freeman and destroys them both. Hartnett gets a lot of help by a mysterious hit-man. The hit-man is played by Bruce Willis, in the last film he actually bothered to care about and act well in. His character is reminiscent of Willis' Butch from Pulp Fiction. The Wrong Man (also known as Lucky Number Slevin) is a compelling fast paced action thriller in it's own right and its probably a good primer for the two older films I mentioned."

I found it a little disappointing at first but with the Lucy Liu part embedded to it - it turned out fine.

","I'm not sure I heard a single good thing about this movie when it first came out. When I finally happened to catch it on cable, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>With the exception of his brief role in the opening of 'Sin City,' I generally find Josh Hartnett to be a pretty bland and unexceptional presence on screen. But he's incredibly charming, fun, and likable in this movie and it makes me wish he would take on more of these kind of roles and material in the future. He really shines and shows some genuine star potential here. He pulls off some tricky and fast-paced dialogue banter with humor and ease and manages to hold his own very well while on screen with big-hitters like Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>The twists, turns, and reveals in the movie, particularly towards the end, start to feel a little forced and contrived. Entire sections of the movie lack focus and urgency in the story telling. But the overall tone and vibe of the movie is so breezy and genuinely fun, it's easy to overlook these flaws and just go along for the ride. As long as you go into this movie with moderate expectations, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. And whether you're a Josh Hartnett fan or not (and I'm generally not), this is easily some of his best work and the only time I've ever seen him bring any real charm, fun, personality, and/or something special to a role."

","Lucky Number Slevin (2006): Dir: Paul McGuigan / Cast: Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu: Divert yet clever film about luck in many forms. Josh Hartnett plays Slevin who is mistaken for someone else and is forced to eliminate victims from two opposing factors. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play mob related characters at war. Freeman wants Kingsley's homosexual son eliminated while Kingsley wants a large sum of cash. Hartnett is placed in the middle without question. Great setup and clever plot twists although one wonders whether the outcome does justice or is just a fancy form of violence. Director Paul McGuigan keeps viewers interested with stunning locations, innovative shots, and a production that works. Hartnett plays off the circumstance with bemusement while being pulled in two directions. Freeman and Kingsley are fine as opposing factors who will reap the blood shed they sow in a low blow shot at justice. Bruce Willis plays an assassin playing off both sides. Lucy Liu plays a mysterious woman whom becomes entangled into the plot when someone goes missing. It all spirals out of control leading to more violence that is a low counter to superb writing. Several themes play out here such as the sudden presence of trouble as well as the ultimate end destroyed by vengeance when one's lucky streak is up. Score: 8 / 10"
"pfgpowell-1","7","1","1","14 January 2014"," Gets a 7, but grudgingly - read on to find out why
","I first saw the trailer to Lucky Number Slevin and was intrigued enough to watch the film itself. In many ways that trailer suggested the film was a 'comedy/drama' (as those who like to categorise would have put it) and so does the first half of the film. After a rather bloody prologue which sees something like four or five gruesome murders, we are presented with another intriguing sequence which also concludes with a murder.<br/><br/>None of the foregoing was particularly funny, but when we get to what seems to by the nub of the film, Scottish director Paul McGuigan does most certainly seem to be playing if for laughs: naïve chap turns up in New York to see a friend, and after the mugging to which all naïve young chaps are prone on their first time in New York, finds his friend's apartment empty and no sign of his friend. Never mind because he is immediately adopted by his friend's 'kooky' neighbour, and then just as quickly is visited by two black hoods who drag him off to see their boss.<br/><br/>The inane banter between the two hoods and the fact that nabbing our naïve young hero is so obviously a question of mistaken identity, as well as the 'smart' dialogue between the grizzled old black gangster boss all do signal – in film terms – that we are watching a comedy, or at least a comedy of sorts. The hero gets to meet another gangster, the deadly rival of the black boss and by the end of the day is tasked both with killing the second boss's son and finding $30,000 to pay off a debt.<br/><br/>And so it goes on, from one mistaken identity to another with an added layer of complication in that boss gangster bosses are under surveillance by New York's finest who are baffled as to who this chap is. It rambles on from one 'kooky' set-up to the rest until it all takes a rather darker turn which took me rather by surprise and will probably do the same for you, too.<br/><br/>In the end everything is explained and – at least in its own terms as a film – there are no loose ends. I have to admit that it is all rather well done, with some great actors – Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley (sorry, Sir Ben, Sir Ben Kingsley) and that old trouper Stanley Tucci (who, in my view, never gives a bad performance, by the way – and some intriguing scenes. And yet . . .<br/><br/>The film is most certainly not a comedy/drama by the time the credits roll – there is nothing very funny about the murderous violence that takes place – and for me at least the whole initial comedy schtick left an odd taste in my mouth, and the whole plot's resolution was, for me, just a tad too contrived: not just neat, too neat.<br/><br/>Still in the first instance Lucky Number Slevin is intended as entertainment and it most certainly does entertain, though it has to be said, more in the way of a comic book than a serious thriller. But then that is what it is all about. I have given this film a 7 – it is handsomely made – but in an odd way a little reluctantly. Yes, it's good, but I have a sneaking suspicion it might well have been better had a little more thought been given to the script and had everyone involved just been a little less pleased with how clever they are (because that's the feeling I get.)"
"JolinKnight","8","1","1","6 September 2013"," ""It is never late to revenge ten years later""
","Actually, the secret behind the story is not so hard to guess. So it is not very impressive to me. However, maybe the last thing I can talk about is the story. All the gang films have the same feature I mean almost all, there will be always a guy who can draw nobody's eyes putting the trigger, and every time they will plot a perfect revenge plan, of course some of them will fail. The reason why I said the story is not good enough is because I guess the whole trick the boy plays, the only thing I missed is Bruce Willice is on his side. After that I made my mind clear and found that actually the guy Bruce plays can be anyone, even he can stand on the opposite side against the boy, it is acceptable. If the plot was like that we can just watch one more gun fight. However when I took a second thinking about it I found I destroyed the integrity of the story. Here we go, if it is not Bruce, Selvin would not get a chance meeting the boss of the gangs, so he cannot get close to his foes. So thinking like this everything makes sense.<br/><br/>I don't know why, it is just a feeling that something is not perfect, I mean I cannot find where making me feel that this film is not a perfect one. Usually, when i saw a master piece, I can feel a strong exciting making me emotional even feel shivering or burst into tears sometime. But for this one it just finished nothing special nothing familiar happened. Also I found the leading actress is totally unnecessary in this movie, maybe without her we can feel more tense moment which I think can make this film better. Anyway, actors in the movie did a good job, also they are all very famous. One more thing this is still a creative story although I got almost everything before the truth told. LOL cheers"

Pairing Morgan Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman is enough to leave you dazzled and that's leaving out Bruce Willis who gets to play something a bit outside his usual realm. For a film that revolves mainly around a case of mistaken identity the plot is not as simple as it sounds and from the very opening leaves you wondering how it's all going to work out. With good action, a healthy dose of violence, and a dash of black comedy Slevin is an underrated film which doesn't disappoint and deserves more."

In an effort to look and and feel cool, it negates that one thing that makes a cool film, which is a great plot line with some snazzy unforeseen twist(s) and witty dialogue. However, within the first twenty minutes, the plot and twist was obvious to anyone with half a brain, leaving the slickness of the film to pick up the slack but without one notable line of speech by any of the great range of actors, by the time the ""revelation"" is revealed at the end of the film, you just want let out a sigh and wonder why Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsly, Bruce Willis and Lucy Liu have put their names to such trash."

","Following the recommendation of a friend of mine I wound up watching this ""brilliant"" crime drama. Having barely resisted the temptation to walk out, I felt like warning others to stay away from this ordeal. As suspected this is yet another movie with plenty of violence, complicated plot twists and a barrage of dull characters from the seedy criminal underworld of New York city. But what worked rather well in the Guy Ritchie films completely backfires in this film, making it the biggest flop I have seen in quite a while. The attempt to capture the sharp and cool dialog of said films is pitiful, and listening to it resembles being whacked in the head by a blunt object. The film is edited in an apparent pretext to increase suspense by hiding critical information from the viewer, this was done however in a terribly annoying manner. By the second half of the movie the plot twists cause one to loose all remaining sympathy for the characters, and replaces it with pure disdain. I can not help but wonder how great actors like Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman got mixed up in this embarrassment. My guess is currency had something to do with it. In short save your money for a more enjoyable activity, like going to the dentist."
"panicoma-1","10","8","22","5 March 2006"," The Boss: Why did you think I was him? Slevin: I didn't, I thought he was you.
","Seen very soon after a belated watching of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, with the eminently substantial Crash (2006) in between, this movie had to earn its place amongst the most valuable cine-memories for almost 8 people on a depressing February Wednesday in a little town on a tiny island off the coast of a small country that has, let's face it, seen better days. And earn it did! Having only seen Josh Hartnett in Black Hawk Down, I was confident of an adequate performance in what I had been led to believe by the local press -(one edition PER WEEK)- was going to have to be a 'word of mouth' success if it were to make the big-time.<br/><br/>The pick of a bad bunch, (I thought), we decided to see it because we could get an Orange Wednesday half-pricer, at the same time checking-out how Bruce Willis is doing these days. (Incidentally, a couple of elderly ladies in front of us had got their money back after ten minutes of The Producers because they didn't like the language. They chose this instead).<br/><br/>Obviously not a star vehicle for Bruce, what a jolt to the system to find an intelligent, funny, sharp, fresh, offbeat and exhilarating performance by him and by all involved! The opening scene reminds us that nobody does it better than Bruce, even with his vest covered and a nerdy side parting in his hair. He's the backbone of the movie, even though you sense from early-on it ain't gonna be an easy ride. Josh underplays his role just enough to send a message out that there is always a bright young thing snapping behind the heels of every established star who can carry a movie on their own. Lucy Liu, showing a strong but sympathetic personality, is engaging, and here is evidence of that old chemistry Hollywood wastes so much time and dollars trying to invent!<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman must have come aboard on the strength of the team already proposed, and a script that leaps off the screen. You could be forgiven for having thought it was all too damned cool for itself, if it hadn't been so thoroughly enjoyable and commendable at every twist and turn. Once every couple of years, you see a bit-part performance that defines the word 'breakthough', and I've yet to find out the name of the black guy (Elvis' buddy), with the teeth, who steals the first scene he's in and invokes an underlying regret that you don't see much more of him. The progress of the plot is many-layered, and the drive of the main character reveals itself through the eyes of an innocent-abroad. I was telling myself this is the sort of movie Hitchock would have been making were he still alive (107 next August), when Ben Kingsley made much the same point. Josh's hotel room is dressed in unfashionable retro, not so much an attempt to remember the good old days as remind us that neglect in updating decor gives off a smell of decay that doesn't need Odourvision to make it potent in an auditorium.<br/><br/>You can't help thinking Tarantino, though this didn't have the 'gloss' of Pulp Fiction, the coldness of Reservoir Dogs, or the inconsequential dialogue of either. Yet, the cool is there, and like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang it advertises that really good movies don't have to have Superheroes and Extraspecial Effects. I suspect audiences twig the plot a little earlier than desired by the director, but ENJOY for goodness sake, the film's not trying to make a point! In fact, credit to Paul McGuigan, for holding back from a handful of more traditional twists, and for keeping himself under control to finish this effort with superb standards in look, sound and feel. Special credit to Jason Smilovic fresh from television writing for an ambitious debut into the world of quality features.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett follows this with The Blue Dahlia, a Brian De Pamla/James Ellroy concoction, hopefully launching himself thereafter successfully into the role of Chet Baker as The Prince of Cool. On this evidence Brad's position in the Hollywood hierarchy is in his sights, maybe De Palma will be the one to pull the trigger. ..... Oh, and the elderly ladies in front of us? They f*****g loved it!"
"gala0008","7","7","19","7 April 2006"," Proof that 2006 is a Good Year for Movies
","I just returned from seeing ""Lucky Number SLevin"" and I can honestly say that this puts to rest the fears I held that Hollywood was running out of movie ideas. Despite having one or two slow moments of pointless rambling (namely Leslie's introduction to Slevin) this is a fast paced movie with clever dialogue and plenty of realistic action. When people are shot it looks real, as blood flows from the wounds and is oftentimes black or a dark red you don't see in most movies.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is good, as always, as the man who kills with style yet necessity. Morgan Freeman was a great villain and went all out in his performance. I don't have much experience of Lucy Lui's works, but she tried very hard and managed to pull out a decent performance here.<br/><br/>Now to those of you angry that this movie is a ""cliché"" of all other ""avenging the death one's parents"" movies, you have to look beyond the outer shell of SLeven. I'll admit that as I was watching this movie, I was reminded of the time I read ""The Count of Monte Crsito"". Though the plots are two totally different things, the avenging the ruining of one's life by killing innocent family members of the guilty party is a big role here. Sometimes the henchmen can be a bit overdone (as well as Slevin's lines), but at the same time it is pointed out by The Boss that the entire situation seems like a cliché.<br/><br/>Adding to this, SLeven goes even further beyond other movies. Though it is predictable that SLevin is the child mentioned in the story early on, the intricate details of the plan aren't known until much later on in the film. It's also interesting to see how everything falls into place, from Willis' part in the scheme to how Slevin gained the eye of The Rabbi and The Boss. A weak aspect of the movie, however, is the reason The Boss and The Rabbi became enemies in the first place.<br/><br/>In closing you should definitely see this movie if you don't mind thinking a little during a movie and can stand seeing blood and gore. This is an intense, funny, and clever experience, more than worth the ticket price. If you enjoy/enjoyed this film I also suggest seeing ""Inside Man"" as it offers an identical amount of cleaver plot twists without as much blood."

","I thought that this movie was absolutely brilliant. I went in just expecting an average action movie, maybe with a bit of humor as well (judging from the trailer). What i got was something completely different. In the best way possible.<br/><br/>The whole movie all the way had me engrossed entirely in the film. There were twists and turns galore. The entire time your watching you think you can predict things that are going to be revealed later. The results are completely different and mezmerizing. At least in my case i got surprise after surprise. Bruce Willis was the show stealer as World Class Assassin Mr. Goodkat. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley were brilliant as always. Not to mention, surprisingly, Josh Hartnett hasn't been this good since i can remember. He was great.<br/><br/>So if your looking for a movie with twists and turns galore, great action sequences, witty dialogue, and is a film you'll have in your mind for weeks to come. All i could think about after watching it is how much i wanted to see it again."

I've also heard it being compared to the similar film of last year revolver, but I haven't seen this one yet so I cant comment on this.<br/><br/>I saw this movie last week, and I must say cant really remember a lot of it (which isn't really a good sign). What I can remember is the cast performances were actually quite good. John Hartnett made a good job of keeping the main character funny and interesting. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both played their crime boss parts well. If nothing else, Lucy Lui is very nice to look at, and although it was obviously not his best performance ever, Bruce Willis did a good job of playing a world class assassin who is more involved in the stories events then you might first think.<br/><br/>I cant really remember anything at all about the soundtrack, editing or direction apart from the fact there was nothing we really haven't seen before, as most of the films appeal lies in the cast and complex plot.<br/><br/>I think Lucky Number Slevin is just another case of a decent crime-mystery thriller which we have seen pulled off in better ways before. You could certainly find worse ways of spending a few hours, and make no mistake, this film is a lot better then most Hollywood action-thrillers that spoon feed the plot to you, and leave you to just turn your brain off.<br/><br/>If you really want to see a perfectly crafted crime thriller that will have you guessing the plot till the end, you may want to rather watch something like L.A Confidential, or the brilliant Usual Suspects. But if you like the look of this film, don't listen to a lot of the critical abuse it has been getting, and give it a go. You might be pleasantly surprised."

","Lucky Number Slevin started out as a very likable, well written movie but disappointed me with its only motive being revenge. The movie first starts out as a tragic, the beginning is always a crucial moment in movies and this one really sets a great pace, flashback where several people are killed. My sole problem with L#7 is that these two rival gang bosses who hate each other get killed for a motive that we really don't recognize until its to late, i found that revenge as a motive never works. First we're cheering for a this character who seems to have gotten himself into a predicament, but only lenient. You then realize that his whole life as a fake one we were lead to believe. Bruce Willis is as stiff as usual, barely making facial expressions, being the ""cool"" sly specialist who aids Slevin in his quest for revenge. It leads you down the same road as ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" but turns sharply and ends up in a dead end. Both had great writing, being quite funny at times, but KKBB withstood everything to come out on top while this one fell. Can anyone relate to this? I believe revenge isn't the answer and this is why this movie disappointed me, maybe i was looking for a character to follow and i guess i felt lost."

","So what's the first impression of this film. You see well made short scenes, with the oh so cool guys shooting with silenced guns. You might like the groovy music and the camera job and think ""this has some style, let's admit that"". You hear dialog spoken by famous actors. Although the talk is just these average ""clever"" one liners, you go with it. After all, at this point the movie might feel almost like a comedy as it rolls on and the spectator is happily oblivious to the true suckyness of it.<br/><br/>But then something happens. As usual, the plot is revealed fully only at the last moments. By then you have already guessed it so you are more interested in how they are going to bring it out so it doesn't seem totally implausible. They don't. Good guys kill the bad guys, the boy gets the girl, end of story. Now if you portray Bruce Willis and Josh Hartnett (who is really out of place here) as your world's best hit men who shoot everybody in the head, why do they even need to do all that plotting that could go wrong in any of the movie's wonderfully clever plot twists. In the end they just walk in to those towers and blow the sh*t out of everyone. Where do you need the one liners, just do it and end the movie. 5 min job.<br/><br/>Right right, now all you think ""these movies are not meant to be taken seriously"". Then why does the makers want us to swallow the serious feelings about the dead family, the gruesome violence or the mob bosses' tormented pasts. Every emotion feels faked (well lets face it: the dialog, characters and the action kinda feels that way too). The romance is as shallow as ever, even though that too is portrayed in the frustrating touchy feely way.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, the movie's basic plot line does have a striking resemblance to both ""Fistfull of dollars"" and ""Once upon a time in the west"". There're a few problems though: Josh Hartnett is no Clint Eastwood, Jason Smilovic & Paul McGuigan are no match for Sergio Leone and you're missing Ennio Morricone's music."

This movie is definitely not what it seems, and that is what makes the movie come to life. It is the perfect balance of plot, great actors, and a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>Lucy Number Sleven is one of those movies, that makes you believe one thing, then has an unexpected turn. This happened multiple times in the movie. I thought of one thing, and then in the next five minutes, I was incorrect. This concept is likely what made the movie such a success.<br/><br/>Starring Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman, and Sir Ben Kingsley, Lucy Number Sleven has the best cast any thriller could have. Josh Hartnett is already known for horror films(Halloween H20) and action/war thrillers(Black Hawk Down). Cast him with Bruce Willis(The Fifth Element) and Morgan Freeman(Se7en), and the movies becomes fantastic.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for the movie was also amazing. At first, Kansas City Shuffle didn't seem to fit, but after watching the film, the song put the film together.

He's just lost his job and his apartment, and found his girlfriend in bed with another man all on the same day. To top it off, he gets mugged, has his nose broken and loses all his ID cards when he comes to New York City to stay with his high school friend Nick Fisher who fails to meet him at the airport, disappears in the thin air and leaves Slevin stuck in a mafia-war between two families respectively headed by the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, and he is the Rabbi and the gangster) and The Boss (Morgan Freeman as regal as usually. OT: just before we began watching ""Lucky Number Slevin"", we returned from ""Evan Almighty."" It was a double treat to see Morgan Freeman playing God and the mafia boss at the same day). A mysterious assassin Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) seems to have plans on how to use Slevin as a ""body"" (does not sound too promising for Slevin if you ask me) for his present job. A tough NYC cop (Stanley Tucci) does not want a wild card Slevin in his city. The last thing Slevin needs is a romance with the Nick's next door neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who happened to word as a coroner for NYCPD while he tries to turn the tables on the gangsters. Yes, of course, the movie brings to mind the classics like ""North By Northwest"" with the case of a mistaken identity, ""Pulp Fiction"" (with its style, coolness, and sharp dialogs, and with the small details like a family watch with a long history, and three stars of three Tarantino's movies), ""Usual Suspects"" (with the way the story has been presented), and ""Professional"" (well, sometimes the world class assassins have hearts and feelings that they are not supposed to have) but the movie is very entertaining - it is paced extremely well, the use of flash backs is most effective, and the actors, all of them bring style and grace to their roles. Just to see the only scene between Freeman and Sir Kingsley is worth the price of renting. Between my husband and myself, we figured out the story and the secrets behind the lucky numbers rather early into the movie but we still enjoyed watching it and were riveted to the screen until the very last moment, and that's the sign of a well crafted and interesting movie for me.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

The supporting cast kills. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are wonderful as cold-blooded crime lords. Lucy Liu continues to show strong range Hartnett's perky, impromptu gumshoe of a love interest (they must be paying her the ranch to mark time as one of those lead bimbos in the ""Charley's Angels"" franchise) .

","This movie is of a genre I guiltily enjoy, hence my generous 6/10. This movie is something of a Usual Suspects wannabe, and serves as a reminder of how brilliant Suspects is! In this case the ""surprise"" twist (the main one) is unsatisfying because it doesn't really make us analyse what happened in a different light. The boy was brought in to kill, and that's what he did. The ""twist"" simply changed his motive from fear to revenge. Furthermore there was nothing clever about the twist. The movie did entertain me in a shallow fashion with it's protagonists comings, slaughterings and goings, their shenanigans were amusing, and Kingsley's dialogue was fun, in fact he was the only interesting character. However the culmination was deeply disappointing as mentioned above. The movie cheated too. The splatter of blood on a child's drawing (if I remember correctly) implied that the little brat had bought the farm. Major spoiler - he had not, of course. But that scene was a lie, so the twist was a fraud. The ""mugging"" scene was also fictional, and showing that fraud visually was also cheating! This is because if you show something visually, you are stating it really did happen. Otherwise you end up with a movie where every scene may or may not have happened, which is, bluntly putting it, an easy cop out at best, cynically cheating the audience at worst. Finally every scene with the prattling Lucy lulu drove me nuts, I was at one point I exasperatedly pleaded to the screen, ""stop ruining this movie!"" And her fake death plot twist was the most annoying ""twist"" I have ever scene. For when she was shot, I cheered, but the hag was cruelly resurrected. Bad bad writing. Admittedly, I do find the actress grating too. And that plinkety comedy music that accompianied her ridiculously unrealistic dialogue-laden comedy relief (lord help me) added to the woe. Yet somehow the movie was just entertaining enough to be fun, I took the thing at face value, a drivelly Hollywood movie, even if the outcome was hideous."

","First off, I have to confess that if my Bank Manager hadn't lent it to me, most probably I would never have watched this one  given my aversion to both Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis! However, I was pleasantly surprised  as much by the film itself as by Hartnett's wholly agreeable contribution (though Willis was as stolid as ever): this is a violent yet tongue-in-cheek gangster thriller in the Tarantino vein with a similarly convoluted, clever and witty script filled with genre references and, more specifically, features three actors who had previously appeared in his films (Willis, Lucy Liu and an uncredited Robert Forster). Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play mobster enemies and Stanley Tucci a cop  all three share a guilty past which connects them to both Hartnett and Willis who, for plot purposes, act like they're complete strangers while pitting one gang against the other YOJIMBO (1961)-style. McGuigan's direction is predictably heavy on flashbacks, jump-cuts and other disorienting narrative techniques  all of which used to be a monopoly of Alain Resnais in the 1960s, but is now the stuff of every other self-respecting thriller in this post-Tarantino age of film-making!"
"AKAJEF","10","3","6","2 January 2007"," - Film facts
","For the film geeks, I got some interesting facts about this film...<br/><br/>On promotional material for the film, Ben Kingsley's credit included his honorary title. At first, the actor was singled out for some criticism as they usual are, from professional credits especially. It transpired that this was a mistake by a studio executive, who was unfamiliar with the British honors system. The movie's violence and style earned it comparisons with the work of director Quentin Tarantino. <br/><br/>In Australia the film's release title is ""The Wrong Man"". This is the title of a 1956 Alfred Hitchcock film in which the lead character has a case of mistaken identity, a theme which many Hitchcock films as well as Lucky Number Slevin share. In fact the main character's plight in ""North by Northwest"" is referenced in the movie as being similar to Slevin's. The film shares many similarities with Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", where a samurai plays two rival criminals against each other. Yojimbo was remade as Walter Hill's ""Last Man Standing"" which also stars Bruce Willis in prohibition-era America. Bruce Willis' character Mr. Goodkat is also referred to as Smith, perhaps as an allusion to Willis' character in Last Man Standing, John Smith. This film is so genius that I can't write any more about it really.<br/><br/>Written by, AKAJEF"

The people giving this movie a 10/10 (at last count, 25.2% of IMDb voters who rated this movie gave it a 10) are morons with bad taste who need to watch more movies, plus they are liars because even a mongoloid could tell you that this movie wasn't anything close to a masterpiece. But dumb people will love this movie and confuse its idiotic and convoluted plot for brilliance. On the other hand, I liked the cast. However, Oscar winners alone do not a good movie make.

","Two aging gangsters, once partners, have become rivals when Morgan Freeman's son is assassinated. It's thought that Ben Kingsley had it done so Freeman has who he thinks is a bookie named Nick Carter, Josh Hartnett, to murder his son in retaliation to cover an owed debt. Bruce Willis is Mr. Goodkat, a world class assassin who seems to be working for both Freeman and Kingsley..what his chief motivation could be is a mystery at the offset.<br/><br/>The key to the whole movie comes in a story Willis tells to an unfortunate who listens intently about a kid's father who borrowed from gangsters 22 grand for a horse bet he heard from his uncle(the specific horse, with an ironic name synonymous with the film, has been shot up with tranquilizers). That father and his wife are assassinated because of the bet, but we're not exactly sure about the boy child.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci portrays a cop keeping a stake-out on both families, quite curious about why Hartnett seems to be in the hip pocket of both Freeman and Kingsley. How Hartnett is able to evade certain death is an unraveling of secrets that'll point out a lot of the mysteries concerning not only Willis' unusual behavior, but the reasoning behind his own.<br/><br/>Is Hartnett who he says he is or merely someone completely different than we could possibly perceive? Lucy Liu has an entertaining, but key role as a snooping coroner who falls in love with Hartnett as she tries to ""help"" him find out where his old buddy Nick Carter is.<br/><br/>You see Hartnett tells Liu that Carter offered him a place to stay after some catastrophic happenings in his life prior to the invite. Liu takes it that Carter has set Hartnett up for disastrous occurrences stemming from unpaid debts. The film plays on that for quite a spell.<br/><br/>This film has dialogue too smart for it's own good, but is entertaining to listen to. Everyone talks in riddles and seem to enjoy themselves, though the tone gets quite serious at the end as retribution regarding a past horror story is acted upon. Twists abound and there's violence aplenty. The whole last fifteen minutes consists of back story explaining every aching minute detail regarding the whole film's odd mysteries..almost everyone comes out corrupt, even those you don't think would be behind such murderous deeds.

I've never been so close to walking out of a theater mid-show in my life. I think the main problem is the self- conscious writing. The whole movie is just so in love with itself. I don't mind a little banter or a clever jab here and there, but when a script starts to evoke a bad Gilmore Girls episode, you have to question its quality. Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett were dreadfully annoying together, especially in the ""which James Bond am I?"" scene. The twist was also predictable. While I admit it was different, the whole movie seemed to build around an invisible tower of a twist from the very beginning. That structure combined with the fact that the kid in the beginning looks a lot like Josh Hartnett really pointed to the outcome. I guess Josh and Bruce kicking butt was entertaining for around ten minutes, but the rest was torture.

","Lucky Number Slevin is a film that only comes around once in a long while. The writing is original and snappy, and humor works at times when you think it wouldn't. The characters, although not all of them are original, are each entertaining in their own ways. The cast gives great performances. While most people talk about how bad of an actor Hartnett is, he gives a very good portrayal of a man stuck in the middle of a mistaken identity crisis. Lucy Liu, for once, is enthusiastic in a good way and adds her own attitude to her character. Morgan Freeman, as usual, is very good, as is Sir Ben. Bruce Willis, even with his strange hairdo, does a very good job in perhaps his most intimidating role. Although the plot seems a bit confusing at some times, it all comes together when, of course, the twist ending is revealed. All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is humorous and thrilling, and for anyone who likes crime films that have originality and attitude, this is a must see."

","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Snatch"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Four of those movies were my favorite of their year and they are all movies that ""Slevin"" is being compared to. Sorry to say, but it is nowhere near that level and, at times, it is downright annoying how hard it tries to be clever. If you are paying attention at all, the mystery of the film is over within the first 10 minutes. At that point the only fun lies in putting the pieces together.<br/><br/>A tremendous cast of veterans such as Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis and Sir Ben Kingsley do an admirable job of creating the underworld tension necessary for the story. Lucy Liu plays, for the first time, an appealing character who actually laughs, smiles and speaks coherently. Josh Hartnett is well cast as the supposed down on his luck, you got the wrong guy, placed in a no win situation. The problem lies with Hartnett's (Slevin's) dialogue. No one in his situation would wise crack like this. The Boss (Freeman) and The Rabbi (Kingsley) call him on it, but never take the next step. This was the biggest obstacle I couldn't overcome. If this guy can't fool me, how does he fool mob kingpins? This movie tries so hard to be in the class of the aforementioned, but that makes Hartnett's lines even more painful to listen to. On the plus side, the set decoration is outstanding. It is a cross between ""Laugh-in"" and ""The Brady Bunch"". The wallpaper looks like something from a mid-60's Peter Sellers comedy.<br/><br/>It does have some fun moments, including the scenes with Freeman and Willis, plus Kingsley realizing at the end what all has occurred right before his eyes. Overall, it appears many are overrating the film, just because it wants to be better than it really is."
"lay_zboy","8","5","14","1 March 2006"," Review
","Having read The Times review of the movie by Cosmo Landesman after seeing the movie it made sense that he hated the film. One of the lines that stuck in my head was 'it succeeded in every way revolver failed' or words to that effect. He was right in a lot of ways as it didn't contain much of the psychological thrilling (or lack of) that revolver tried to inject into the movie in massive doses. That fact to me gave it a much better score as it kept the viewer intent on the story, and thus go you focused on the character development and the progression of Slevin's journey through 'mister nice guy' to the evil vengeful perpetrator of the bosses deaths.<br/><br/>I'm comparing it to Revolver because to me they were similar in many ways ranging from the sets to the plot and given a few allowances they were basically built on the same premise. The reason i mention the sets was because i couldn't help but notice the wallpaper patterns being more or less the same but in different colours of tessellated patterns. There again bringing the relationship from Revolver because form what i can gather Guy Ritchie tried to make a strong statement of the mood of the film and the role of the characters in the movie by using colour and environment. Now i couldn't really gather at all what the relevance of the colours and sets meant but i definitely think they added some sort of subliminal undertone to the movies mood which given the end result of the movie worked very well.<br/><br/>Of course not missing out the fact that the cast played a pivotal role in the 'success' (yet to be decided though) of the finished product of the film and I'm pretty sure that with average actors cast instead of the ones you saw there would have been a whole other film to watch. But it overall i think gave the viewer and without a doubt me a pleasure to watch as it had an intriguing plot, great cast, tasteful and graphic violence and a good old twist to throw you off the scent, given though the twist was if not a little blatant but ill let that go because the rest of the film made up for it in abundance.<br/><br/>Its definitely going in my Top 250 thats for sure!!!"

","how do i start? there's so much to say. first of all every piece of dialogue was unnatural and forced. good actors with bad acting. it attempted to by witty, clever, and hip, but failed. its weak canned attempts to be humorous was stiff and unoriginal and just made the movie unrealistic and corny. so once the ""cleverness"" of the whole plot came to a head it didn't hit you hard cuz there was no real build up to it (i could see it coming a mile away regardless of how bad they try to confuse you). i know they thought switching the mood along with the last minute uncoverings would make this original and different but it really just didn't work. in a good mystery they keep you on your seat as they reveal things, this tried to keep you confused until it reveals it at the last minute for a big mind blowing twist. it didn't work because the bulk of the movie fails for lack of overall quality and the pressure of the big ending builds to a disappointingly lame head. if the movie was more realistic the few violent scenes in it would have been more powerful (something that blood and gore cant do on its own) instead they seemed out of place in a corny movie, where they were supposed to be some of the saving grace when the realism was sacrificed for the sad clichéd humor and super villain crap. this movie was a pot of gumbo that didn't end up stewing well, maybe because its gumbo from applebees or denny's (corprorate money maker) instead of some homemade from the soul mix (independant). i'm just saying that it is a big budget movie that attempts to look original, entertaining, unformulaic, and fresh but it ends up being the opposite of all those. its get shorty 3 mixed with some the unusual suspects, with a dash of horse manure. i was watching it as a movie to pass some time, and i still feel like my time was wasted. smart film consumers please watch with caution or avoid."

","Scot Paul McGuigan's 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a sharp, funny, quick witted little movie populated by character actors who are fully engaged in their script and characterisation. It's by no means perfect  certain plot points are glaringly obvious, as indeed are continuity errors  but it is a film which requires audiences to pay attention as double-crosses pile on top of one another.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley (sorry, Sir Ben Kingsley, he seems to have grown a little pompous in his old age to insist on such on-screen honorifics) are amiably malevolent as the warring gangsters at the heart of the story, and Lucy Lui and Josh Hartnett make an engaging couple. The script is, however, the film's strongest point, the dialogue is snappy, though at times it verges into near parody of Ellroy Leonard.<br/><br/>The designer, however, needs to be shot. Every set is cursed with either '70s wallpaper or decorative tiling inspired to foster migraine.<br/><br/>Hartnett's best film so far, and huge improvement on Paul McGuigan's previous directorial efforts."
"vostf","4","3","7","4 April 2014"," Wants to be a clever cool movie. Fine images, poor despicable story.
","I was curious about this movie that went right below the radar and ends up with a big score on IMDb years after release. Usually when a movie nears 8.0 stars on IMDb you can expect a sure amount of quality. Now if quality is the good start it is not sufficient to make a good movie.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin has many qualities: high production values that translate into fine photography and direction, with a great cast. The editing is precise and smooth to blend all this too. Now you start a production with a script and I very much doubt that the script for Lucky Number Slevin was ever that great. I have a name for that narrative category: Pretty Clever Whodunnit. It is a tired plot device to draw an apparently convoluted story where you only tell what it was all about at the very end.<br/><br/>I know that most people are suckers for this kind of a story, especially when it is very well packaged such as in this movie. Personally I find this to be more deceptive than really clever. I enjoyed Usual Suspects on first viewing but I cannot stand a second viewing. I enjoyed Sixth Sense too but I would never watch it again. Obviously not everybody is able to come close to Psycho in the sense that the point of the movie shouldn't be concentrated in a final bang.<br/><br/>Aside from that, Lucky Number Slevin has a tonal problem. It has a cartoonish approach to characters (especially with Morgan Freeman as The Boss and Ben Kingsley as The Rabbi) that is really at odds with the core story of a mistaken identity case that implies lots of - cold blood and gratuitous - murders. Does it aim to be a light realistic Tarantino endeavour or a dark thriller? It does not choose, it wants to be a funny and cool story where people happen to go murder somebody else just like that. And this puts the movie very low on my scale."

Why oh why oh why was Harnett in a towel for 40 minutes and why oh why oh why was it so irritating to see him eating a sandwich with bread that white. Ugh, I'm shivering.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this thing, are you kidding. This movie feels like a cross between Tarantino and that young guy who was in Die Hard 4 and who's in those techie computers. The result: Annoying! How could I possibly care for Slevin in this movie. The sensibility where the 'good guy' won't take any lip from the bad guy and is instead a 'conundrum' does nothing to make me ally with him, to care about what happens to him. And I don't blame just the actor - this is also the directing.<br/><br/>The way they use sound in this movie can be insulting, too, along with the editing. Well, what isn't most concerning here is how bad this movie is, but it's the high reviews its getting, for the most part. Oh, man, I give up ..."

","Paul McGuigan's ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" starring Josh Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis, and Lucy Liu, was awarded Best Film at the 2006 Milan International Film Festival. Internet Movie Database user BigStuff2020 reports, ""I was lucky enough to have seen this at a screening back in December, and the entire theater started to applaud at the conclusion of the film."" You'd think that the critics would have liked it, too. But no.<br/><br/>""'Lucky Number Slevin' is a crime thriller-plus-con job that might be too slick and clever for its own good,"" according to Hollywood Reporter's Kirk Honneycutt. ""The movie risks alienating its audience initially with a welter of confusing story lines, dead bodies and random characters.""<br/><br/>So the movie's beginning is problematic. <br/><br/>""The performances are juicy,"" says Rolling Stone's Peter Travers. ""But the convoluted ain't-I-clever script by Jason Smilovic has a cheat ending that makes you want to do a little torturing yourself.""<br/><br/>So the movie's ending is problematic. And the script is too clever.<br/><br/>Stephen Holden of the NY Times characterizes Slevin as a failed Pulp Fiction wannabe. ""From its sly, amused performances to its surreal comic book gloss to its artfully nervous camera-work 'Lucky Number Slevin' sustains the blasé tone and look of a smart-aleck thriller that buries its heart under layers of attitude. When the movie makes a belated stab at sincerity in the closing scenes, it's too little, too late.""<br/><br/>So the ending is not only a cheat, it's disappointing as well. And the movie is too darn artful.<br/><br/>Unkindest cut of all, Roger Ebert gave Slevin a thumping thumbs-down. ""'Lucky Number Slevin' is too clever by half. It's the worst kind of con: It tells us it's a con early on, so we don't even have the consolation of being led down the garden path."" <br/><br/>So the beginning is also problematic because it gives the audience a hint as to what the movie is really about.<br/><br/>Ebert goes on: ""'Lucky Number Slevin' goes to some pains to make it clear it is only an exercise in style."" <br/><br/>Why ""only""? What's the matter with an exercise in style? <br/><br/>Ebert sure exercises his own style: ""Here we are looking at a crime mystery involving warring hoodlums and beautiful neighbors and a confused guy from out of town and a gunman and a cop, and the movie knows we're deluded and they're all just conceits. It's smarter than we are. Well, it must be, because it got us to watch it."" <br/><br/>""Just conceits."" Ebert is smart enough to know that ""conceit"" is a literary-criticism term meaning, ""an elaborate, usually intellectually ingenious poetic comparison or image."" And of course he's accusing the movie-makers of conceit, too. Too clever by half. But, again, why ""just""? And if literary ingenuity is okay for a film critic, why is it out of place in a film?<br/><br/>Ebert continues grinding the unlucky Slevin under his thumb: ""When a movie makes it clear that its characters are going through a charade for the amusement of the director (and when the characters themselves make it clear they all but know they are actors in a movie), I get restless: They're having such a good time with each other, why do they need me? Then when there's a level of trickery even beyond the apparent foolery -- reader, I feel like they're yanking my chain."" <br/><br/>Wow. Actors, director, smarty-pants script writer  the whole merciless gang - yanking Roger's chain.<br/><br/>As for me, I'm reminded of a Shakespeare article, ""'Hamlet,' Mirror for the Critics."" Its point was that criticism of a work reveals at least as much about the critics as it does about the work. Critics are a literary lot, perhaps vain of their own cleverness. Along comes a movie that reminds them of that common failing  We all think we're smart, right? And out come the knives, ready to carve that turkey in the mirror. <br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Lucky Number Slevin."" I'm with the IMDb User from Romania: ""A very well conceived popcorn flick, which connects all the dots."" And IMDb User Matt Cub from the UK: ""Great stuff."" <br/><br/>Popcorn flick. Maybe all those problem-hunting, hyper-critical critics should have been given a big tub of popcorn when they came in. And a big dose of common sense, too. When an experienced director, three mega-talented actors, and two gifted newcomers all read through a script and decide that it will make a first-rate movie  then that is exactly what it might turn out to be."

Funny, witty and as sharp as a razor blade. Every single word and phrase is strategically placed for maximum effect, whether that be with its habitual dry and sardonic mutterings throughout or the moments in which it harks back to archetypes and or conventions of crime capers from yesteryear. The script and its dialogue provide nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it does an exceptional job of developing characters, tear away any feeling of apathy one may initially have toward the primary protagonists, creating the plot's undercurrents and providing the dark comedic aspect that the movie is built upon.<br/><br/>I could delve deeper into my analysis of the flick and hark on relentlessly about cinematography, editing, music, specific performances and so forth, but time is currently at a premium and life, I'm told, is very short.

","Slevin arrive in town and stops at his friend Nick's. Meeting his perky neighbour Lindsey, Slevin relates how he had his wallet stolen within minutes of arriving in town, an act which also involved getting his nose broken. While waiting for Nick, Slevin is picked up by two goons looking for Nick who have decided that he is indeed the man he claims not to be. He is taken to The Boss who decides he is Nick and thus owes him $96k  a debt he will cancel if ""Nick"" kills the son of rival mobster The Rabbi. Later Slevin is also picked up by The Rabbi's men and taken to see him and so Slevin finds himself drawn into a game between the two bosses with a shadowy killer in the background.<br/><br/>With the terrible (in my opinion) title, I didn't have great hopes for this but heard reasonably good things about it so one tired evening I decided to veg in front of it. From the deceptively slow opening, the film picks up with a good pace and energy that continues for the majority of the film. Ironically the film slows a little in the second half but by this point the energy has done its work and the plot developments have replaced them as the main hook. This is not to suggest that the plot is deep but it certainly is not, instead it is slick and fun. It helps if you can take your style with a hefty dose of violence but most modern viewers will get off on this updating of noir staples (dialogue, girls, twists, crime bosses) and delivers in a fresh-feeling package. The final sections (the reveal) are clunkier than the fresh majority would suggest.<br/><br/>The direction suits the material and is done in a manner that brings out well, with McGuigan uses his camera and editors well, not to mention the cool set design and visual construct of the whole affair. Smilovic deserves credit as writer as his dialogue is fun and sparky while also building a nice solid mystery. Hartnett is great for the most part but when required to have depth in the later stages I found him a bit lacking. His time spent in a towel perhaps explains why my girlfriend enjoyed the film more than I did. Willis is a stiff presence but then that is the point and he does that well. Liu is wonderfully bubbly and I found her sexy and cool in contrast to her usual cold and unattractive performances  the film asks her to do little but she is fun. Freeman and Kingsley (sorry, ""Sir"" Kingsley) are both class and quality support. The support cast features some nice touches from Tucci, Williamson and Missick.<br/><br/>Overall then a very enjoyable caper film based on a good story that is good in the telling rather than the detail, with sparky dialogue and slick delivery. It is very superficial and will put off some for this reason but if you get caught up in the pace and energy earlier on it is actually a fresh and enjoyable, albeit in a modern and violent manner."
"theshadow908","6","3","7","15 September 2006"," Entertaining, but kind of flat.
","Lucky Number Slevin tells the story of a man named Slevin Kalvera, friend to a man named Nick Fisher. One day Slevin is at Nick's apartment waiting for him when two gangsters show up informing him that he owes ""The Boss"" all kinds of money. No matter how much he explains that he's not Nick Fisher, ""The Boss"" won't let up. He wants Slevin to kill a rival gangster's son. Unfortunately, this rival gangster, ""The Rabbi"", wants something from Fisher as well. Throw into the mix a legendary hit-man and a curious girl next door, and you're well on your way to discovering the mystery behind the movie.<br/><br/>The first thing that threw me off about Lucky Number Slevin was how misleading the trailer was. The trailer made it look like a happy, purely for entertainment popcorn flick, but it ended up being a gangster drama. The writing was really good. I enjoyed listening to the characters talking back and forth because the dialogue was so snappy and precise. I had to laugh at how great it was. The movie contains a fair amount of action, and as things unfold leading up to the ending, it's fun to try and piece the puzzle together. However, at the same time the plot is kind of flat and underdeveloped. I don't really know how to explain it. It's a contradiction. Cool things happen throughout the movie, but the plot isn't that deep. The movie starts, some cool twists and turns occur, and it ends with no character development or anything.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good. Ben Kinglsey, Morgan Freeman, and Bruce Willis are good no matter what role they're in, and they're all great here, although Bruce Willis didn't really have a whole lot to do in the movie. It was nice to see Morgan Freeman play a real bad guy for once (unless you choose to count Hard Rain and Shawshank Redemption, where he plays a bank robber and a murderer). Josh Hartnett was pretty good as Slevin. I'm not a huge Lucy Liu fan, so she wasn't very thrilling.<br/><br/>Overall, this is good for one viewing, because it has some great twists and turns and a good ending, and some really good performances. It makes you think, but the plot is kind of flat.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"ClassicMovieFans","7","3","7","9 September 2006"," Pieces fall into places only near the end
","The movie starts off with loose leads, leaving the audience guessing what's actually going on. Bruce Willis is the mysterious factor and the impostor Nick Fisher seems helplessly involved with two rivals Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Lucy Liu, as the neighbor, looks beautiful. The movie intrigues with its twists and turns. It is successful because the intricate plot has everything perfectly explained in the end, which builds up to a climax in the last 15 minutes. In addition, it has a star-studded performance. With Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley facing off one another, not knowing they both fall in the same trap. For people who like Ocean Eleven, Inferno Affairs(Hong Kong), this is a film they will thoroughly enjoy."

","I have no doubt that the filmmakers had great expectations about their creation. They may have thought they were delivering a new ""Pulp Fiction"". And I'm not making just a random reference here, since ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a classic example of the disaster Tarantino's success has brought in cinema. Every year, dozens young filmmakers come out with a straight recipe of copying the Tarantino's filmic universe (that is, if we accept the existence of such a universe after a very short  so far- career of the man). However, in this particular film we shouldn't blame only the director, Paul McGuigan, who had after all warned us for his limited potentialities since his previous film ""Wicker Park"", where one could easily see the absence of a personal style and his tendency in stumbling in front of weak choices from the scriptwriter. Once again, a great deal of responsibility for this hollow film should be ""recognized"" to Jason Smilovic, who wrote the screenplay. When Tarantino made the choice of using everyday dialogue and scenes that until the dawn of the 90's the rest filmmakers would leave out without any second thoughts, he made it with a certainty. The certainty that was given to him, first of all from his wide ranged knowledge on cinema, and also from his contact with literature  more particularly with contemporary American novels from which he has borrowed his famous narrative techniques and devices. And this fertile dialogue of mediums, combined with Tarantino's intelligence, created a very distinctive signature, both on the grounds of subject and style. And ""Lucky Number Slevin"" lacks all these. <br/><br/>Someone could argue that McGuigan also starts a dialogue with cinema - Tarantino's cinema. But it's more than obvious that he hasn't got neither the talent nor the knowledge needed, so he just copies. The characters speak in between their troubles about their favorite films or about super heroes (sounds familiar?). And when we are presented with original lines, they aren't much superior than this: ""I'm a world class hit-man"", Bruce Willis says in one of the worst moments of his career. And that's too bad, because of the excellent cast including Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, who little can do to save this mess. As leading actor, Josh Hartnett who also starred in ""Wicker Park"" and who Hollywood systematically promotes with no obvious reason, not even after this film (waiting for ""Black Dahlia"" from master Brian DePalma). So, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is indeed a well made film, but one made by craftsmen. But cinema is art, not craft, and more than a hundred years after its birth, it shouldn't feel the need to prove it."
"serenity0323","5","6","19","10 April 2006"," Slevin not so lucky
","While Morgan Freeman (The Boss) and Bruce Willis (Goodkat) are super-entertaining, the movie itself is less than intriguing. There are too many twists and not enough delivery. In the middle of this flick I recall thinking ""oh, wow, what's going on!"" and when I discovered the plot I thought ""oh...ok..."". A lot of hook and no reel-in. Every time someone got shot (and this happens rather excessively) I threw my hands in the air and felt exasperated. The actors really deliver and play their roles very well (Lucy Liu was fantastic, might I add), but the movie is a complete let-down. The ending does give the watcher a sense of closure, but is a complete flop because it fails to give that ""one-two punch"" you might have expected half-way through. It doesn't give nearly as much emotion as it does in the beginning, and thats the problem."

","Lucky Number Slevin has a cast to die for. It has not just A-list actors, but good A-list actors who are all at the top of their game. It is therefore not unreasonable to expect great things from them. For the most part this is a very accomplished thriller, but it just lacks that extra something to go the extra mile.<br/><br/>It could actually be the cast themselves. Josh Hartnett is good in the title role of Slevin, a man from out of town who, after an episode of mistaken identities, finds himself under pressure to pay a lot of money to two rival kingpins. However, the other cast members  Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, even Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley  feel like they're operating on autopilot. They never seem to be stretching themselves to deliver something truly great.<br/><br/>Part of this also stems form the dialogue; you can tell that this wants to be a Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film with sharp dialogue and witty pop-culture references. It doesn't work as well as it should though (although I do find that even Tarantino can start to sound pretentious after a point), and a lot of the dialogue feels forced, although it's clearly meant to be smooth and sound natural.<br/><br/>It really isn't all bad though. These negative points are actually relatively small, all things considered, and don't ruin the enjoyment of the film; they are more niggles than outright irritants. The film is actually very stylish, and its retro-70s look does wonders as it gives the film a fresh feel, certainly making it stand out from the usual run-of-the-mill thrillers. Also Lucy Liu is brilliant as the only innocent character present, whose riffs with Slevin are fun and gives the film a certain lightness to it; a real bonus as it is otherwise a very cold film.<br/><br/>As with many films of this kind, we know everything will not be as it seems to be, and Lucky Number Slevin is no exception. Its inevitable plot twist feels a little contrived  it's not nearly as clever as it likes to think it is  and the payoff is not as worthy as we deserve by this point, but it is the journey that matters most and it is, for the most part, very enjoyable. However, one cannot help but feel that, with the presence of such a great cast that could have been made of this  it seems to be trying too hard to impress, rather than being a lot more natural and trust in the quality of the actors it's got.<br/><br/>Rated: 7/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Although I only had caught TV spots and screen-shots from Lucky Number Slevin, I avoided watching the trailer like the plague. It looked interesting enough, with a great cast, so I didn't want to ruin it. After managing to see it, I'm glad that I missed the trailer, but still a little disappointed with the final result.<br/><br/>After a short interlude (of which I will not spoil), we are introduced to Slevin (Josh Hartnett). He's in a bathrobe, has a broken nose and has just gotten into New York. He's there to meet with his friend Nick Fisher, whose apartment Slevin is in, but no trace of Fisher. After some knocking, Lindsey (Lucy Liu) enters the picture, a neighbour who is looking for Nick, but just decides to flirt with the stranger instead. After she leaves, he gets another knock, and its the goons of a local crime boss aptly named, The Boss (Morgan Freeman).<br/><br/>After taking the smart-ass Slevin into their car in the bathrobe, and breaking his nose some more, he meets with The Boss, and is informed of a rather large debt Fisher owes. The Boss doesn't seem to care that Slevin is not Fisher, but offers him a way out of the debt, by killing the son of another crime boss, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley as he is credited in the credits). Slevin agrees, only to return home and be picked up by The Rabbi's boys. After he meets with The Rabbi, he finds out Fisher has another large debt to pay, and The Rabbi only gives him a few hours to get it to him.<br/><br/>Still following? Need I even mention Bruce Willis' random hit-man character Mr. Goodkat who keeps popping around every corner, or Stanley Tucci's Detective Brikowski who is hot on the trail of Slevin? The film just seems to tie more and more characters to this one confusing plot line, and it seems like the addition of Liu was simply just to try and make sense of the whole thing, while proving as a mere somewhat good love interest for Hartnett.<br/><br/>The film isn't too hard to follow, but as the story keeps rolling around and around to its conclusion where anything that seems a tad bit coincidental, or just does not seem clear, is completely crystal clear to that point that it becomes a little too clever for its own good. Things are all tied together (some for little to no reason), no plot point is left unturned (even the ones that make absolutely no sense until later, even then staying ludicrous), and in the end, it just becomes a nice tight little package. You cannot argue with this unfortunately, but for a movie like this, it ties the package way too tight. The film needs to breathe, and unfortunately, the film's plot line will not allow for it.<br/><br/>If the substance is a little shifty, the style makes up for it. The cinematography is topnotch, and the colours are just fabulous. The film is totally anti-noir, but it takes the concept of film-noir, and adds colour to it. Sets are well photographed, and the costumes all match excellently. Hartnett's consistent nose injuries are also of note, as they contrast to the backgrounds wonderfully. The cast's main players are all very good, for as long or as small their roles are. The film's plot line may seem murky, but the dialogue is great. The delivery of the script's lines are all great, and all the witty smart ass quips are nailed to a tee (even though some of the conversations go around and around and around to the point of being like a conversation with David Caruso).<br/><br/>It's not that Slevin is a bad movie. It's a great movie that is just too clever for it's own good. A little bit of touch-ups here and there to the plot would make the movie so much more better. It's an exercise in the reasoning of why tying everything up by the end, just does not always work.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","Almost immediately after starting this movie I ran to the PC to see if this was written by Mamet (Heist). Same stupid cliché-ridden dialogue and melodramatic stereotypes. Disclaimer: I'm generation-X, so maybe I'm expecting some redeeming qualities to come out in the protagonists, however noir this film is supposed to be.<br/><br/>So I started wondering, was it the director or writer's fault? I looked up Ganguin and he did Gangster No. 1 which I believe I rented once. It was kind of cool for a video-quality movie. But maybe I thought so because it represented a different criminal subculture than I have been exposed to, which is 70's UK.<br/><br/>So it must be the writing, which is usually the case when the thought of the line on paper jumps out at you with the energy of wet, blurred ink.<br/><br/>Save your money. Save the shrinking feeling you'll feel for the stellar actors -- I mean Kingsley-Freeman-Willis! Good grief. This movie must have cost $30M just for the cast! I had the same sinking feeling when I sympathized with Devito-Hackman over Heist.<br/><br/>Hartnett is the only one whose character was entertaining, and that still wasn't enough to save this film. Why was it entertaining? I don't want to waste any more neurons on this film, but I think he had the least ridiculous lines and he has interesting character which seems to come through unfiltered in his parts.<br/><br/>This only got a nomination for sound editing with that cast and beautiful sets. What does that tell you? Watch the Usual Suspects or Lock, Stock... yet another time instead of watching this."
"cariart","7","2","4","30 November 2006"," Style Over Substance, But an Entertaining Ride!
","OK, so ""Lucky Number Slevin"" falls easily into the Tarantino/""Pulp Fiction"" mold, from it's graphic violence and plot twists, to the off-beat humor and quirky characterizations. And it won't take long to guess what the big 'secret' is that holds everything together (although it is intriguing to see who fits where in the scheme of things). Saying all this, however, I really enjoyed ""Slevin""! <br/><br/>A lot of the entertainment of the film comes from first-rate actors obviously enjoying themselves. Trapped in a case of mistaken identity, Josh Hartnett, sporting a broken nose and lack of wardrobe in the early part of the film, takes every mishap and disaster with such aplomb that it's easy to see why mob bosses Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley look at him in stunned bewilderment (remember the gangster in the Marx Brothers' ""Monkey Business"" hiring the totally whacked-out Groucho and Company as shipboard bodyguards? Hartnett has that same ""Are we on the same page?"" attitude). Even more fun is the relationship between Hartnett and neighbor Lucy Lui (who has never been cuter or more energetic). When she walks into his 'borrowed' apartment, sees him naked, leaves, then pops back in, hoping to catch ""the next show"", you KNOW there is chemistry! And when was the last time you saw verbal sexual foreplay consisting of obscure James Bond trivia? That scene has such a Kevin Smith 'feel' to it that I looked for his name as a screenwriter! <br/><br/>Bruce Willis is also fun, as a very smug hit man (he seems nearly 'typed' as a hit man or cop, these days). Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, and ""Forrest Gump's"" Mykelti Williamson also shine (it was nice seeing Aiello and Williamson, who I haven't seen much of, of late).<br/><br/>Certainly, the ultimate 'pay-off' lacks the 'punch' of ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Memento"", or ""Go"", but it does reveal a compassion that is surprising, considering the body count! <br/><br/>Taken as a whole, Paul McGuigan's jaunt into 'Tarantino Land' is stylishly diverting!"

","One word (OK, two) to describe this film: ""super convenient"". Everyone is way too connected and all events are way too convenient, with the twists being over the top and just not making sense even more. The twist in the ending is simply stupid, unlikeable and sugary, existing to please the audience. There's also a strong feel of everything being staged on the scene, the sense of the very script. And of course there are many usual tropes and predictable events, during the watching I was saying what will be coming next - and there it was, like I said.<br/><br/>It's still a quality Hollywood movie: great filming, great acting, and especially the great editing. It's also not dragging, despite being almost a two hour movie. By the time it was over I thought the movie was about 56 min in and there's something more. <br/><br/>However, nevermind the tired tropes and ridiculous twists, the most surprising thing about this movie is the inclusion of O Yujki Conjugate track in the soundtrack which has about five songs. OYC it's an obscure ambient British band and how their track ended up in a Hollywood movie with first class actors is truly a mystery, especially considering the low number of music tracks used."

","There should definitely be more movies like this, but unfortunately crime comedies seem to be a dying genre. The only two such movies I know of coming out soon are Steven Soderbergh's Logan Lucky and Edgar Wright's Baby Driver. It checks pretty much all of the blocks that need to be checked in a satisfying and proficient manner. The actors are all well cast and own their performances of distinct and likable characters. The plot is complex, but exposed with enough clarity that it is easy to be on the same page that the writer wants you to be on. There is an excellent twist at the end that I won't spoil, but I will say that it is a shocking twist that is very hard to predict and is shocking without insulting your intelligence with its simplicity. The twist also does not cheat by withholding information like in Guy Ritchie movies.<br/><br/>Our story follows Slevin Kelevra who is caught in the middle of a war between two crime bosses when they both mistake him for someone else. Slevin is an immediately likable protagonist in his wit, down to earth manner, and confusion that matches our own. The remainder of the cast consists of several minor characters that all get good exposition. They don't feel like real people, but they are all distinct and enjoyable to watch which is good. The Boss and the Rabbi have a good separate but equal vibe; they play the same role in the plot but are very different people that are not presented in a way that is meant to make them parallel each other too strongly. Lindsay serves as Slevin's periodic escape from the madness of the situation he is caught in, although she is able to help him at a few points. Mr. Goodkat is the mysterious wildcard stonily played by Bruce Willis. The only major character that I thought was not incorporated well was Birkowski (Stanley Tucci). Along with the aforementioned characters, there are a few other little characters that don't get much screen time but are very enjoyable when they are on screen. The characters are played by an all-star cast, but I thought every actor fit their role pretty well and weren't just selected for their talent just as much as their ability to sell tickets. <br/><br/>The world that the movie creates is very true to its identity, which I won't fully describe for spoiler reasons. But it made me feel as if everything I saw and heard could be important. Amidst the plot it was also able to fit in clever dialogue throughout. The conversations and one-liners are reminiscent of Pulp Fiction and Ocean's Eleven, though I felt that Lucky Number Slevin did better than Pulp in terms of dialogue. However, it did not feel as though it was ripping off either movie. It had an engaging and unique visual style, and I would definitely want director of photography Peter Sova based on the work he did here. There is nothing in this movie that hasn't been seen before, but it was executed especially well enough that it didn't have to do anything special to compensate.<br/><br/>Last I checked, this is still on Netflix, so I would try to catch it before it gets taken down. And who knows, maybe Netflix will come out with its own crime comedy if enough people watch this. It may not become your favorite movie, but I would be surprised if it didn't entertain you at least a little bit. If nothing else, it should hold your attention for two hours and brighten your weekend a little. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."

","Because my personality is incredibly rooted in the Type A persuasion and I like to theme my month's viewing schedule, I don't get as much time for rewatches as I would like. When the opportunity arose to include Lucky Number Slevin on one of my monthly lists, I took it. I watched Lucky Number Slevin shortly after its 2006 release and was impressed by it, I was so impressed by it that I introduced it to some friends and family members after my first viewing. It's always interesting to see when 10 years elapses if one still enjoys a film as much as they did soon after its release, all the more reason I'm disappointed I don't have more time for rewatches, alas, there are so many films to see. A star-studded cast including Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley lead an intensely gripping mystery in which every piece of filmed action is pivotal to the story. Paul McGuigan directs an engaging story told in an energetic way creating a story that necessitates watching until the final moment. <br/><br/>While waiting at an airport, a mysterious figure tells a stranger the story of a fixed horse race in the mid-70's that resulted in the deaths of a family. The story is centered around the idea of a Kansas City Shuffle in which attention is drawn to one thing while deceit is happening in the other direction. Meanwhile, present-day the sons of two feuding mob bosses are shot down, as well as two bookies. Happening simultaneously, a young man named Slevin has sought refuge in his friend's apartment after finding out that his girlfriend has cheated on him. Caught immediately in a web of mistaken identity, Slevin realizes he has borrowed the apartment of a friend who owes several powerful people large amounts of money. Acquiescing to the needs of each mob boss in hopes of keeping himself alive, Slevin puts himself into some dangerous situations. The stakes are heightened when Slevin meets and falls in love with a chatty neighbor who works as a coroner. Soon, Slevin is being watched or followed from three different angles leaving the audience to determine what link exists connecting all the pieces. <br/><br/>I was thrilled to learn that this film was every bit as exciting and engrossing as it was the first time I watched it, nearly 10 years ago. There are few things I appreciate more than a story that comes together so seamlessly with every single thing that was filmed having a place in the narrative. Lucky Number Slevin employs a stellar cast to bring together the brilliant story line. Flashbacks were used often in Lucky Number Slevin and were done in a unique and engaging way. Films like Lucky Number Slevin prove that mystery as a genre is alive and well, still maintaining a place in today's cinema."

","Reviewed June 2011<br/><br/>Someone has watched a lot of Guy Ritchie's movies but couldn't make one in the same league. My rating is purely for entertainment value where the pace is quick and is occasionally funny. But if you take this movie as a whole, well it is full of holes. <br/><br/>It is a story of mistaken identity where a guy is thought to be in debt to the two most powerful men in the city and is pushed around to make them some favors and is also closely followed by the police. <br/><br/>It tries to exude style out of every frame while killing, getting killed, scared, angry etc etc. The performances were so flat even with the talent available just for the same reason mentioned earlier as Arnold Schwarzenegger could've played every role in the movie and could've pulled it off. The story was complicated to great lengths and the non-linear screenplay adds to the trouble of making it even more. It also has that revelatory end that unfolds in a way the Scooby Doo writers will be very proud of. The story is left for extreme coincidence and perfect execution of a plan that was hatched long long ago. <br/><br/>Finally, it is just another case of style over content. Glossy to look at but never stays with you after the credits roll."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","25 December 2013"," The most Tarantino film that isn't the real deal
","I actually wouldn't have been surprised to find out that this film was at least partially created by Quentin Tarantino. It's not as gory as his usual fare, but it has a lot of his usual elements in it. Outlandish situation, great and memorable characters, lots of quirky dialogues and it even has one of his trademark actor, in this case Bruce Willis, in an important side role.<br/><br/>And this isn't a bad thing at all and I'm not saying that Paul McGuigan is ripping off Tarantino. Quite the opposite. It's great that there's another director out there that can produce a film of this quality and style. Because make no mistake, this is a great film. Easily one of the best I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>What captures me the most are the dialogues and the characters. The whole situation about two mobster at war with one another is nothing new, but it's taken to such extremes that it becomes something new altogether. It's something straight out of a pulp story or a comic book, but in a good way. It's outlandish enough that you can sit back and enjoy, because you don't have to treat it like it's supposed to be 100 percent accurate, but it's real enough that you remain invested in the fates of its players. The same with dialogues. Weird and odd enough to capture your attention, but also fun and quirky enough to keep that attention.<br/><br/>The plot is also surprising, unravels at the right pace and keeps you hooked till the very end. There are a few inconsistencies in the whole setup of two mobster silently glaring at each other across the street while their minions wage war beneath their feet, but it's nothing that would ruin the movie for you.<br/><br/>What we have here is pure, undiluted fun. It's a movie of great characters, undeniable charisma and memorable scenes that all come together to form a cohesive whole. See it if you haven't already."

Josh Hartnet's coy act along with Lucy Liu's adorable ""girl-next-door-slash- Columbo"" routine, allows us to have a sympathetic rooting interest while the gangster portion of the plot is both comic and bold as we're introduced to the serious history of the main players.

","Paul McGuigan directs ""Lucky Number Slevin"", a film which plays like ""Yojimbo"" making love to Guy Ritchie while ""Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" force feed each other LSD bananas. The film's a good decade out of date, emulating the many ""hip"", ""cool"", ""irreverent"" crime and con thrillers of the late late 1990s, all of which tried desperately to parrot Tarantino. See Mamet for this stuff done better.<br/><br/>Our star is Josh Hartnett, a noir loser who's pushed through a postmodern amusement park. Usually with these films you'd have the hero, the ""wrong guy"", buffeted by a ridiculously convoluted noir plot. But here things are even more meta, climaxing with a revelation in which our hero ""may or may not"" be the wrong guy and ""may or may not"" be the one actually pulling the strings. <br/><br/>These days, casting Ben Kingsley in a film guarantees an absolutely ridiculous, absurdly ""ethnic"", racially dubious performance. The guy's jumped from Indian to Jew to Iranian to Arab to Cockney to Asian to puppet, but now he's a Yarmulke wearing Rabbi gangster. I'm waiting for the black-face Kingsley. Then I can complete my ""Kingsley's Racist Caricature"" collection and sell it on ebay.

","I very much enjoyed this fun film. The characters are good and the actors playing them did well.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and I think he is great as the boss, but I was even more impressed with Ben Kingsley's performance as the Rabbi. Josh Harnett's character ""Slevin"" really amused me with his ability to say the wrong thing and rub people up the wrong way. His sarcastic manner really helped me to build up a fondness for a character that you don't get much back story with until later on in the film. Bruce Willis also does a good job and the character really suits him.<br/><br/>Slanley Tucci plays the role of the cop Brikowski well, and I think he is always good in roles where you're not supposed to like him.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed ""Sloe and Elvis"", a very funny double act. It bugged me for a while because I knew I had seen the actor who played Sloe somewhere but couldn't work it out. He was Bubba in Forrest Gump (thanks IMDb) and plays someone just as clever in this film.<br/><br/>I know some people that have said this film is predictable. I did not find this and wish I was clever enough to have found it so. I don't think the writer or director were trying to push any boundaries or trying to make an ultra cool Tarantino type film. I think they were just making a good watchable movie, and that's what it is. There are lots of people that will love this film and I can understand why it has such a high rating (7.8 while I'm writing this) and why lots of people would have given it 10/10.<br/><br/>This is a funny, easy to enjoy film. Just let it happen and don't try to work it out in the first five minutes. Not an amazing or incredible film, but well worth watching."
"Arsenic Drone","6","0","0","29 May 2010"," The Usual Suspects minus balls, plus Guy Ritchie, equals...
","Well, it equals a bit of a letdown. I like The Usual Suspects. It had style, it didn't hold back, and I didn't see the ending coming. By the end of this movie, the majority of the plot twist has been telegraphed halfway through, and what remains is a husk of The Usual Suspects. Its main flaw is that it breaks the old storytelling rule about showing rather than telling.<br/><br/>Not only that, it tries to do too many things. It has a love story. It has self-consciously clever dialogue. It throws in Guy Ritchie-style cinematography, which works, and some random Guy Ritchie over-the-topness, which doesn't. This all has the effect of neutering the movie and forcing it to pull its punches, because it can't do all of these things and still be a powerful mind-twister.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin is not horrible, though. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, and Ben Kingsley do good work with their odd characters. Lucy Liu unfortunately has a lot of that clever dialogue, but her character is nearly surreal enough to be interesting. Josh Hartnett alternates between convincingly natural and unpolished fake. The soundtrack by J Ralph improves the feel of the whole thing, and the visual style fits with the flow.<br/><br/>I'd recommend that if you watch this, you use your favorite method of turning your brain off, or at least down a bit, beforehand. Then it has a fighting chance to blow you away like it wants to."

","...which is strange seeing it was directed by a Brit. Lucky Number Slevin is much like a Guy Ritchie, having both his strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett) is an unlucky man; he ends up staying in his friend's apartment when his identity is mistaken. He is plunged into the world of gangsterism, with two rival gangsters believing he has debts to pay. One, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) is willing to clear the debt, if Slevin can kill the Fairy (Christopher Maxwell Kramer), the son of his rival. The other gangster, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley) orders that Slevin pay back a debt of $33,000. Slevin also has to battle the threat of an ruthless assassin, Smith/Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis): the assassin who does the job that no else wants. Slevin's only ally in his mission is his friend's neighbour Lindsey (the lovely Lucy Liu). She helps him investigate, but doesn't want him to loose his moral compass.<br/><br/>Paul McGuigan offers a very stylist form of direction, with a lot of directorial tricks, and impressive visuals. McGuigan shows that he can direct an action sequence, and keeps the film going at a fast pace, not allowing the audience too much time to thing. McGuigan also has a good cast of experienced actors, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis all offer good performances, particularly Freeman. Stanley Tucci also offers a decent performance in his small role, and McGuigan gets out better performance from Josh Hartnett, who is often just a bland pretty boy, and Lucy Liu, who offers a quirky, youngish performance.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is the script by Jason Smilovic. He is clearly a man who thinks he is more clever then he really is. He gives the audience an overly complex plot which he didn't need to and philosophy conversations that were not wanted or needed. By making the film with a more convoluted plot and storyline Smilovic ends up leaving his script full of holes. His story has some similarities to Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, where a man has to pay a large debt and have to pay back some vicious gangsters in a short space of time. He also shares Guy Ritchie problem of putting too much in a film, when less is more. That's what happened in most of Ritchie's mockery gangster film. The tone and style of the film was also similar to Smokin' Aces, a not a good film at all. But luckily this was a witty film, not taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Overall, a 3 out of 5."

They might be 12-year olds that enjoy violence or 40-year olds who love the idea of their own ideas. IMDb is the best place to go for insight into movies, the ten-scale rating gives you a hint to what a movie will be, the worst are the 6ers, but the 9ers are never good, due to the fanatics. The best can also be the 3s, but a 7.9 is almost always great.<br/><br/>That brings us to Lucky Number Slevin. I watched after reading about it, a first for me. It was actually on my birthday.

It's, for lack of a better word, ""eeeaah"" *palms moved in a clockwise and counterclockwise motion outwards at the time it is uttered*. The movie is clever, the actors are as big as they come. This could have been oceans eleven. It wasn't. The script is probably good enough and so is the directing. The problem is simply one thing.<br/><br/>It is not long enough for me to care. If the movie added 30 minutes to explain why I should care if this boss or that boss is a boss and why the other one is. Why do main bad guys have 5 minute screen time? It actually made me tune out in the end. I knew that a twist would inevitably come, and I don't care if it's predictable, it's always a nice little surprise with a twist. Always nice if they can truly surprise you, but you have to care first.

Slevin is under constant surveillance by relentless Detective Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) as well as the infamous assassin Goodkat (Bruce Willis) and finds himself having to hatch his own ingenious plot to get them before they get him.<br/><br/>Wow! This is quite the clever movie. One of the things that attracted me was the dialogue. It is quirky, brainy and quick-witted. Josh Hartnett, who I enjoyed in the widely ignored Hollywood Homicide, delightfully displays this verbal black belt in karate that sadly does not extend to his physical fighting skills. He gets the crap beaten out of him quite frequently. He keeps the movie going with charm and our sympathy for his being in such a crappy situation. Anymore about him would be spoilers, but suffice to say it's very entertaining. Lucy Liu plays his love interest. Her scenes with him are about 10 times as entertaining as the entirety of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Though that doesn't say much at all, I grew to care about their relationship.<br/><br/>Another thing I was quite grateful for was the presence of Morgan Freeman. His sultry voice is, for once, not acting as narrator or warm support to the lead. He plays one of the villains, and does so with silky menace. I was also glad to see Ben Kingsley in something of quality for a change. After Thunderbirds, Species and (ugh) BloodRayne, I thought he'd finally given up on doing anything worthy of his skills. He didn't have anything too too challenging to do, but I enjoyed his little monologue near the end. Bruce Willis is. Bruce Willis. If you like the persona he brings in his films (I enjoyed his young cop a little more than his old cop) this is it with a heavy mystique added. To be fair, he was a wild card and was completely unpredictable.<br/><br/>Of course, completely unpredictable could be the name of this movie. Without revealing anything I can tell you that almost everything said and done comes out of left field. The story is so good and the exposition is skillfully prepared, (by director Paul McGuigan) so the lags are minimal and any confusion felt is momentary. If you like your suspense..suspenseful, than this is for you. My only real critique is that I can't imagine anyone would want to see the movie more than once. Also, if you're looking for any depth or greater meaning, aside form its layers, there is none. But it's an entertaining and what's more, intelligent movie.

I'm sorry, but no one is that clever, or at least, not everyone you come into contact with is that clever. The trick was that you knew you were watching a trick, a con, but how will it play out? If you have a small idea about cinema, you'll have the entire movie figured out by the second act. Willis was great, but not enough of his character to keep you satisfied. I was very disappointed and I blame the director in the end. He could have done better if he would have taken the time. Don't bother renting. Wait for cable."

","The law of retaliation. It's the primary law that New York crime bosses live by, at least according to Lucky Number Slevin. Unfortunately for Josh ""Squinty-Eyed"" Hartnett, a case of mistaken identity drags him right into the middle of this law in motion.<br/><br/>""Lucky Number Slevin? Come on, Johnny! That's the stupidest title ever! And Josh 'Wooden Boy' Hartnett?"" I know, I know. I thought the exact same thing when I originally heard the title. ""What kind of lame attempt at being clever through the use of a silly pun is this?"" I thought to myself. But the title actually makes sense within the context of the film. To say anymore would reveal too much of a major plot element, but it's a moment where you'll say, ""Ah, I get it now. OK, that's not so bad."" And seriously, I want you to use that exact quote so I don't look silly.<br/><br/>""Too late!"" Gee, thanks. As for Hartnett, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a charter member of his fan club. I typically hold him as the standard bearer when I need a reference point for listless, unemotional acting. But the guy gives it his sarcastic best here and delivers the most likable character I've seen him portray.<br/><br/>It doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by a strong cast of actors playing a variety of entertaining, eccentric characters. Lucy Liu is cute and inquisitive. Bruce Willis is a hit-man who you truly believe is a stone cold killer. Morgan Freeman dares the audience to still like him considering the fact that he's a crime boss. And Ben Kingsley, after a huge slump of horrific movies (A Sound of Thunder, BloodRayne) finally gets quality material to work with.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed the quirky characters, what really won me over is the movie's slightly complex and somewhat unpredictable plot. Following the nonlinear storytelling of Lock Stock-era Ritchie, Slevin sets up the basic premise and then the audience watches as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. You may be able to figure out where everything is headed by the halfway point, but it's still fun to watch how it gets there.<br/><br/>You may also be able to find a plot hole or two if you look hard enough, but I enjoyed the film too much to worry about such silly nitpicking. If you're one of those spoilsports who brings your industrial-sized nitpicker to every movie with you just so you can find things to complain about then just stay home and let everybody else watch it in peace.<br/><br/>I can understand the argument that some of the dialogue feels a little contrived in an effort to appear clever, but it didn't bother me. I can recognize the humor in lines such as, ""Tell it to the one-legged man so he can bump it down the road,"" and character reactions to quotes like this reveal that it isn't written to be pretentious, just knowingly different.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a recent comparison then I'd say Slevin has a similar feel to 2005's highly entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Though Slevin isn't as consistently funny, it employs a similar dark comedy style and I think it has the better story and more satisfying ending of the two.<br/><br/>If you're not easily offended then you might want to check out Lucky Number Slevin. Be warned: there are a couple of quick, gratuitous sex scenes at the beginning of the movie that feel thrown in just for the sake of pleasing the ""perverted male"" demographic, but as far as style goes we need more movies like this that put forth a little extra effort to be cooler, more clever, and smarter than their peers.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>If you like movies with quirky characters and a complicated plot that requires you to willingly keep everything straight in your head as you follow along then Lucky Number Slevin certainly will entertain."

","Don't get me wrong, this film is not the worst I've ever seen. It is fast paced and nicely shot, but they are about the only real positives I can draw. The current rating of 7.8 out of 10 is as ridiculous as the storyline.<br/><br/>The plot, in my opinion, is too far-fetched and does not really build suspense or keep you guessing. I think a lot of people have voted highly for this film because the story is all unravelled at the very end, and because it surprises you a bit, you think 'ooh, that was clever', but it really isn't. A good film will give you a few clues along the way to keep you thinking, but this didn't provide a single snippet.<br/><br/>Another major flaw, in my opinion, is that none of the characters are convincing (or intimidating) gangsters, and 2 rival gangs in opposing buildings. No. Great gangster films are based on characters that you can imagine existing and running a racket. Once you have got the characters in place, you can run away a bit with the story - a bit like 'Snatch', 'Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels' or even 'Pulp Fiction'."

"evanston_dad","8","2","5","27 November 2006"," Where Did This Terrific Little Film Come From?
","This stylish and fiendishly entertaining puzzle movie stars Josh Hartnett, usually an actor I find it easy to dislike, giving a surprisingly good performance as Slevin, a laid-back drifter type who shows up at his friend's apartment to hang out for a few weeks and finds himself the target of two rival crime lords when he's mistaken for his friend. The plot twists and turns -- it's one of those movies where the whole point is the trick ending, but in this case (unlike so many movies of a similar ilk) the rest of the script is so well written that the ending, when it comes, actually feels like a payoff rather than a cheat.<br/><br/>Director Paul McGuigan gives the whole film a tone to match the character of Slevin. Everything is loose and cool -- even the violent scenes (and there are some pretty graphic ones) come and go without ruffling too many feathers. Hartnett gets solid support from Bruce Willis, that king of dead-pan crime films, and Lucy Liu, who seems somewhat less comfortable in her role as a chatty his girl Friday, and who gets disappointingly little to do. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play the crime lords. It's refreshing to see Freeman break away from his wizened sage roles, and Kingsley is strong as always, even if his accent is unidentifiable.<br/><br/>But the ultimate star of this film is the production design. Just keep your eye on the sets and decor, that add a fun house sense of disorientation to this diamond-in-the-rough of a movie.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Do you know those kinds of movies where you laugh but you want to do more than laugh, you're excited but you want to jump up and scream about it, you're surprised but you want to just tell everyone in the theater about how surprised you are, and it's so clever that you want to remember every single line so that you can hastily tell all of your friends the best scenes? This is the epitome of that movie. Its script is possibly one of the wittiest ever written. Its story is so tightly knit and full of perfect twists and surprises that the director so gracefully and steadily adjusts extremes in moods for, and the dialogue is so inspired and hilarious, so witty that David Mamet has finally run up against his true competition. The dialogue is so funny because of how literal and nitpicky the characters are with each other, so no matter what situation they may be in, they can suddenly happen into some silly semantics argument. The dialogue is full of clever non sequiturs and human notices and details that it blows most of the silly, pseudo-clever dialogue from other crime films in this vein. It's that type of script that, instead of making you think of who has influenced the work, makes you think that the writer has gone beyond a simple influence and created a style all his own.<br/><br/>The direction of the film, while most people will surely say it's inspired by Tarantino, is very inventive and elegant, a bit reminiscent of De Palma if anybody, and the work of someone who is very much a master of mood swings, as the tone of the film swoops and shifts but never throws the movie out of balance for one second. Another thing that's very original and quirky about Lucky Number Slevin is that it is a field day for all minorities: There are black gangsters at war with Jewish gangsters, the boss of which has a gay son, there's an Asian heroine, and something for every other one. It goes out of its way to go against the grain but appeal greatly to gangster fans with expectations.<br/><br/>The cast delivers some of the most absorbing and distinguished performances of their careers, especially Lucy Liu, who plays a character the filmmakers must've pathologically cast a completely contrary actress for, playing an eccentric, chipper kook, almost a cartoon, rather than the cold and intimidating dominatrix that's been the staple of her career. Male fanatics of the crime genre, of which there are many, won't be able to resist the idea of Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley both playing crime bosses in the same movie, and Bruce Willis playing assassin may be a bit deja vu-inducing but it cannot get tiring. I've never seen Josh Hartnett so entertaining, enjoying every second he has on screen.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin is a must-see for any fan of movies. It's a melting pot of pleasure."

","Let us continue under no misconception, this is a good movie. If your the kind of moviegoer that eats up stuff like Boondock Saints or Pulp Fiction then this is a movie for you, stylish, violent, well written, there is very little else one could hope to garner from it. The story is not all that and a bag of cheese, there are holes, and though I very much like the story and all it's little twists, I saw almost each and every one of them coming. This movie almost seems made to be predictable, it is however thoroughly enjoyable. The story is at times tragic and most of the time funny. It's told in a bass ackwards kinda way. The acting is top notch, Lucy Liu is okay, beautiful as always though hers is a very simplistic part. Morgan is as always hypnotizing, even as a bad guy you can't help but be drawn to him. Kingsley is wonderful as the Rabbi. And though both of them turn in somewhat deadpan subdued performances Hartnet and Willis are both amazing, especially Willis who wears conviction in his eyes in every scene. The film is oddly directed, it has a very cool feel to it, my only gripe is that it has a very sullen feel to it, it should mind you people are dying and the film acts accordingly, but it just seems that as all is revealed things should move faster, not just crawl along. Overall it's great movie to get a bunch of friends together and go see, very enjoyable, it's not Sin City, but it's a worthy follow up for both Hartnet and Willis, both of whom won't be in #2"

","I got the impression the film was a homage to Alfred Hitchock's work, when I saw the trailer to ""Lucky Number Slevin"". When I saw the film, I was right, but it also had some dashes of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie and Luc Besson, making it a fun, crackerjack crime drama.<br/><br/>A series of violent killings starts the ball rolling, then calms down to a tale, told by a ""quiet before the storm"" hit-man, Mr. Goodkat (a dapper Bruce Willis) to a non-assuming fellow in an airport terminal. The tale involves the execution of a middle-lower class family (wife, husband, son) after the father makes a bad bet on a racing horse.<br/><br/>Fast forward to Slevin (handsome Josh Hartnett, who rescues himself from the future acting troupe of the CW network), a jobless, robbery victim slacker who's visiting his friend in New York City. The friend's missing, but Slevin rests his laurels in his bud's apartment. Problem: Slevin's mistaken for the friend by two warring crime lords, the Boss (Oscar holder Morgan Freeman, who plays against type) and the Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley, another Oscar holder, who acts a wiser version of his Don Logan role from ""Sexy Beast""). Thinking he's ""Nick Fisher"", both men want cash from Slevin or else, but things here aren't straight-forward, let alone the truth.<br/><br/>Director Paul McGuigan (he worked with Hartnett on ""Wicker Park"") has fun with the script by Jason Smilovic (the TV shows ""Karen Sisco"" and ""Kidnapped""), noting that events of a mystery are better solved when not looking at them too closely, taking some steps back. Some have said the film's too clever for its' own good, trying to be another ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""The Usual Suspects"", but with expendable fare like ""Step Up"" and ""John Tucker Must Die"" infesting movie houses, ""Slevin"" has to be clever to separate itself from the muck.<br/><br/>The cast is game, especially the spunky Lucy Liu as a good-hearted medical examiner who befriends Slevin. It's so nice to see her in a non-Kung Fu role (yet ""Kill Bill vol. 1"" was fun), she's a goddess in black, high-heeled boots and a sweater and she shows potential to be in a Kevin Smith comedy. <br/><br/>Other cast members include Stanley Tucci (The Devil Wears Prada, Big Night) as a hard-boiled cop; Mykelti T. Williamson (Forrest Gump, ATL) as one of the Boss's goons; Danny Aiello (Do The Right Thing, 29th Street) as a bookie and Robert Forster (Jackie Brown, Alligator) as another cop who solves the mystery from afar. I can't tell you about the conclusion. It's too good for words.<br/><br/>In a medium filled with computer-animated bubblegum jars and shallow adolescent mirrors that amaze the moronity of moviegoers, ""Slevin"" is nicely and unashamedly smart and adult, hearkening back to the films from the 1930s to the 1970s. Make this film your lucky number."

"drystyx","2","4","14","10 June 2007"," Stupid, trite, and waste of time
","Make no mistake, this is a formula movie, and probably the most predictable movie you will ever see. I won't spoil it, but will say that ""yes, what happens in every film in this ignorant genre, will happen again"". This movie does set a milestone. It is the first movie ever to have the poorest in writing-every single word is out of place, forced, and contrived; in acting-good actors can make something out of the worst scripts, but these actors are miserable in line delivery; and directing-since these actors have done better, it must be the direction that leaves them looking pitiful, plus the scenes don't make any logic, and yet somehow the entire movie is predictable. You soon realize they are just doing the ""formula"". What makes this movie worse than terrible is that the hero is supposed to be the everyman (such as in Hitchcock classics), but instead, you know he's some kind of super thug like the others-not only by his manner and attitude, but by the sheer logic of events. You never buy any of the characters. It is impossible to find credibility in the flirting with the two leads, the logic of accepting the huge bet, the bookie willing to take the bet to people he knows will kill him for it; I mean, there is exactly zero credibility in each situation! An audience wants adventure, but something has to be credible (usually the characters being credible make it worthwhile), but this really looks like someone wanted to enter the ""Worst Film Festival"" in every category, since even the acting was horrible. And yes, this may be the worst acted film you'll ever see. There is no plot, except for revenge. And the only thing that possibly veils the story is a change in hair color for the vengeful person. We have super tough thugs who are so stereotyped, you'll have to laugh. Speaking of hair color, the director makes sure he falls into the neo-Nazi tradition of these ignorant movies by killing off at least one dark haired woman (refereing to the other neo Nazi filmmakers of USUAL SUSPECTS, GODFATHER, etc.). I'm sure most audience members get tired of the preaching and pounding these neo Nazis put into their effort. It got old decades ago. The characters are stereotypes, too, and even look more trite when the director and writer try to make them look different. It is a complete failure. No one cares about these characters, and the dialogue is so ridiculous, hack, and contrived, you wonder whether it was written by a bunch of two year olds. But everything, and I mean absolutely everything, in this movie is Hollywood formula, and will leave you feeling like you wasted a lot of time watching this trite crap."

","I was disappointed by ""Lucky Number Slevin"". I liked the premise of the movie but the execution left a whole lot to be desired. I did not like Josh Hartnett's attitude in the movie. He was not believable as someone who was forced to meet gang bosses because of a case of mistaken identity. He was far too flippant and cocky for the situation and I did not find him in the least appealing. One of the movie's premises was that you had to believe he was an unwitting dupe. He did not advance that belief at all. In fact you suspected him from the beginning and the subsequent events lost their shock value. I had guessed at the underlying story way too early and I just watched it unfold. Nor was the character in the least appealing. Was I supposed to care about this character? Feel some empathy? I felt nothing but disgust for the cold blooded violence he used. The movie was very violent. His affair with Lucy Liu was equally unbelievable. She was lousy in her role. I kept expecting her to be some kind of undercover cop or an assassin since she was so awkward portraying her character. She seemed cold and disingenuous, perfect for someone to turn out to be a baddie but poor as a straight role. Was I to believe that they would be happy ever after at the end? I don't think so and I don't care. Neither actor were appealing to me at all. Bruce Willis played his role with his typical smirking attitude. He was OK. Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci were good given what they had to work with. The script was not that good. It was violent and there were too many coincidences to be believable. Miss it."
"Chris Knipp","8","4","14","10 April 2006"," Something old, something new: thoroughly entertaining
","""So here's an audience's dilemma,"" a Hollywood Reporter piece on this movie goes. ""You know you've been had, but do you like it -- or not?"" 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Usual Suspects' obviously influenced the young Jason Smilovic. In his late teens when they appeared, he wrote the screenplay for 'Lucky Number Slevin' at twenty-three. He no doubt did know he'd been 'had' when he saw those and knew he 'liked it' -- well enough to want to do something in the same vein -- with a strong dash of gangster noir -- and stir his influences into a spicy stew that anticipates the bizarrely baroque plotting and heavy body counts of Park Chan-wook's Korean revenge fests.<br/><br/>Maybe neither Jason Smilovic, nor Guy Richie acolyte Paul McGuigan, who directed, is quite as clever or as richly inventive as Tarantino or Park, but this movie brings together a cast that was as well entertained as we are. Does being conned really matter? Is it really ever any other way with crime stories that take the trouble to keep us guessing to the end? Is 'Pulp Fiction' anything but a complicated (and bizarrely silly) puzzle with amusing dialogue? Isn't 'The Usual Suspects' one of the biggest movie con jobs of recent memory? And don't a lot of the most classic noirs explain everything in frenzied talky dialogue at the end, just like this movie? In 'Lucky Number Slevin,' we're definitely misled from the earliest scenes in which we think we know what's going on. And before it's over, we're going to have to re-view some flashbacks and learn that they didn't play out the way we'd been led to believe the first time.<br/><br/>Slevin is a story of mistaken identity (Slevin, Josh Hartnett, who people take for a shifty pal of his whose flat he's borrowing) and two warring crime lords The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley) holed up in facing towers. Slevin comes to stay at the big city flat of his pal; first, though, you've got this guy in a wheelchair, Bruce Willis with hair and porkpie hat, talking to a young man in an empty airport waiting area. He's talking about something called the ""Kansas City switch."" This movie is nothing but guys telling tricky tales like this, half joke, half explanation of stuff we haven't felt the need to have explained -- yet. McGuigan used Josh pretty well before in Wicker Park, but that didn't quite come off; it was an adaptation from a French movie that lost in translation. This time Josh is great, bumbling, bold, and charming, and adding a new edge to his smooth if limited repertoire of styles. This movie lets the ""victim"" (if he is that; who knows?) and the ""sleuth,"" Lindsey (Lucy Liu), Josh's friend's neighbor and a ditsy but lovable coroner, have a real romance going on and takes the time to develop that romance both in and out of bed, a nice change from recent movies that are so intense about their nasty business that their sweetness gets short shrift.<br/><br/>So Slevin, Josh, gets mugged on the way from the airport to his friend's flat. Next he's in a towel, slung very low on his hips to show off his long torso, nursing a smashed-in nose and entertaining Lucy Liu, who's come over for a cup of sugar and stays on for sleuthing and romance -- because he gets his nose broken again by some of The Boss's goons, and Lucy Liu tries to figure out what's going on. What we learn is that The Rabbi has had The Boss's son killed by a professional assassin called Mr. Goodcat (Willis) and now The Boss wants to kill The Fairy (Yitzchok, Michael Rubenfeld), The Rabbi's son, and make Josh do it, because he thinks Josh is his shifty pal, who owes both gang lords a lot of money.<br/><br/>Josh, that is Slevin, handles himself with such aplomb when dragged around in nothing but the towel, that you wonder. He says he has a condition that makes him never worry about anything. He's witty, and completely unafraid. His character is one of Smilovic's greatest achievements and a feather in the cap for Hartnett, whose light comedic skills seen in things like 'The Virgin Suicides' and 'Blow Dry' needed this extra dash of ultra-violence to give them punch. Lucy Liu is quite equal to his panache and adds a bright improvisatory flutter to her character.<br/><br/>Freeman and Kingsley give intense, hammy performances that only actors of their caliber could carry off. Willis is adept though his part hasn't the range of his Butch in Pulp Fiction. Stanley Tucci comes into play as Brikowski, member of a cop team watching the gangsters who intervenes to try to find out who Slevin is. Who is this guy? They have no record of him. He doesn't exist for them.<br/><br/>It's impossible to describe the story from there on, because that's when the surprises really begin. Like all shaggy dog-con job crime stories, this one goes way back in time, and the guy in the wheelchair in the airport waiting room in Scene One alluded to something twenty years ago.<br/><br/>Contributing significantly to 'Lucky Number Slevin's' smooth style are the flashy camera moves of cinematographer Peter Sova and psychedelic interiors by François Seguin that underline the hall-of-mirrors nature of the plot.<br/><br/>There may not be enough depth of conception or structure to make this the kind of cult movie you watch over and over to dissect; you'll watch it again, if you like it, for the zingy dialogue. Despite its unabashedly derivative nature, it has fresh twists, most notably its peculiar combination of revenge and romance. Hot or cold, revenge is always sweet but usually comes at a severe price. Not this time."

","I had some free time on my hands today, so I decided to hit the theater. I was in the mood to laugh at something, and was split between watching The Benchwarmers or Lucky Number Slevin. According to their trailers, they're both comedies. Being that Lucky Number Slevin had gun-play in its trailer and The Bench Warmers had Rob Schneider, I chose Lucky Number Slevin. Lucky for me.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin was one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It had action, comedy, drama, suspense, and lots and lots of thrills. At first, I thought I was watching a dark comedy but soon realized it was much more. The story focuses on this guy named Slevin who happens to be REALLY funny, but unfortunately has the worst luck ever. After losing his job and his girlfriend, Slevin (Josh Hartnett) decides to visit his friend Nick Fisher in New York. Upon arriving, he's mistaken for Nick, who happens to owe a lot of money to 2 rival crime mob bosses, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>After being roughed up by both The Boss's and The Rabbi's goons and forced to do favors for both bosses in order to pay off Nick's debts, Slevin finds himself under constant surveillance by a relentless Detective named Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) and unknowingly manipulated by a world class assassin simply known as Goodkat (Bruce Willis). Caught in the middle of a mob war and hounded by the police and a deadly assassin, Slevin soon comes to the realization that he'll have to do some pretty horrible things if he wishes to stay alive and out of a jail cell, especially if he ever wants to see Nick's neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu) again, who he meets amongst the chaos and falls deeply in love with.<br/><br/>From a dark comedy, to a suspenseful thriller, the transition goes quite smoothly, especially if you pay attention to the beginning of the film. The story has many twists and turns and can be predictable at times, but it's actually for the better. If it had turned out any differently, the ending wouldn't be as powerfully moving. Besides the story, the acting and the camera work are excellent. The entire cast is incredible, as well as the writer and director. My only complaint with the film was a blooper involving a gunshot which at first was loud and then, when shown the second time later on, was silenced due to a silencer on the gun. Other than that, every thing else involving the production was perfect. To sum it up, the film was very gory, very realistic, and basically, very well executed all around.<br/><br/>As for the story, it's really great and to sum it up, it's a well written dark comedy that quickly turns into a suspenseful thriller. For fear of completely ruining the film's awesome story for you guys, I can't say much more, except that the film goes from a suspenseful thriller to something else, something much darker. The ending will have you in tears, with a big smile on your face and desperately hoping for a sequel. For fans of gangster films, spy flicks, and crime stories this film is for you. It has it all, interesting characters that will make you laugh as well as cry and action and suspense that'll have you on the edge of your seat. However, even if you're not a huge action, suspense, thriller fan, you'll find Lucky Number Slevin's story heartfelt and quite heartwarming, not to mention very funny at times. The bottom line, for fans of good film and for anyone else who wants to be entertained for 2 hours, Lucky Number Slevin is your lucky number.<br/><br/>GO AND SEE THIS FILM, NOW!"

","I am not normally a prude nor have a weak stomach. But, this movie was advertised as a ""thriller comedy"". I was expecting something like the delightful ""Inside Man"". Instead, from the moment the credits opened brains and blood were spattering close range and continued throughout the movie. The two sex scenes were close up and graphic. The language throughout was filled with unnecessary obscenities.<br/><br/>I will concede that the story line was excellent. The idea of mistaken identity was carried through with sufficient suspense to keep you guessing. I loved the way it all tied together at the conclusion but the presentation was just too gross for my tastes. Sorry folks."
"siderite","7","3","10","11 June 2006"," Last Man Standing meets The Jackal and The Usual Suspects
","I might have said too much already in the title. The thing is that the plot of this movie can't be told without spoiling it. What I can tell you is that the recipe for the movie is bring good actors and use a non conventional twisting plot to make them shine. It worked for The Usual Suspects and it works for this one.<br/><br/>If it weren't for the mellowed down ending, I would have given this film an 8. It is a good police thriller, with a tendency for over verbalization, but not too annoying, and thus worth watching. Bruce Willis doesn't save the day, that's also a plus, while Josh Hartnett plays his role well. There are a lot of known actors in the movie, with ""Oh, I know this guy/chick"" moments all the time, but that doesn't mean they all have significant roles. My biggest disappointment was that both Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman had unimportant, clichéd playing.<br/><br/>Conclusion: it's worth seeing, yet be warned that it uses fast talking and a lot of US cultural references in order to make the actors look better than their roles. If your English and love for movies are not very good, watch it with a good translation, none of that ""I'm 10 and I think I can translate movies by using an automated translator program"" crap."

","The pickings were slim when we (2 ""50ish"" women) tried to choose a movie to see this evening, and LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN won by process of elimination. While I can't claim to hate the movie, I found the plot to be convoluted and the guts and gore a bit overdone. Our fellow movie watchers were laughing at many scenes in which the humor somehow escaped me. Dare I say that this movie really wasn't much of a ""chic flick""? (Fellow feminists, Mea culpa!) I think my husband will definitely love this one when it comes to cable, which I imagine will happen soon...I read one comment that compared this movie to PULP FICTION, an opinion I definitely don't share.

","(There are Spoilers) Clever elaborate but a bit complicated crime drama/thriller that covers a span of over two decades which is the time it took for everyone involved in a bloody massacre after a fixed race, at the Aqueduct Race Track in Queens NY, to come full circle. Back in the fall of 1979 Max a degenerate gambler desperate for money gets the word from a race-track tipster and close friend of his Uncle Sol,a big-time New York horse player that the number seven horse in the tenth race at Aqueduct that afternoon has been fixed, or secretly drugged, to win the race. Max then goes to his local bookie, Roth, to bet $20,000.00 on #7 on the nose. Leading all trough the stretch the number seven horse suddenly collapses and dies just before he hit's the finish line! With Max now broke and Roth in hot water with the mob for taking his bet both their lives on the line if they doesn't pay up.<br/><br/>This is a story that a Mr. Goodkat tells a total stranger at the almost deserted airport lounge before he, in what looks like to make a point, murders him. This sets up a chain of events that has the murdered mans, a petty gambler named Fisher, friend Slevin come to visit him after he's been forced out of his place by the city marshal. Slevin is mistaken for Fisher when he goes to his apartment and is roughed up by two hoods sent there by The Boss to pick up a $96,000.00 gambling debt that the deceased Fisher owes him.<br/><br/>Slevin not being able to convince The Boss that he isn't Fisher and at the same time not having the money to pay the head gangster back is forced to make a deal with him. Slevin agrees to knock off the gay son, Yitzchok, of The Boss' chief rival for control of the crime syndicate in the city The Rabbi. Slevin is later apprehended by two of The Rabbi's hoods and brought to his mid-town Manhattan penthouse. there he's told that not only is he in debt to The Boss for $96,000.00 but also to him for another $33,000.00! This has the unlucky Selvin now stuck between a rock and a hard place with his life not being worth a plug nickel!<br/><br/>We keep seeing Goodkat, who turns out to be a top-notch hit-man for hire, pop up all throughout the movie not really knowing just what his connection is with The Boss and The Rabbi as well as the confused and bewildered Slevin. Everyone involved in this strange arraignment have one thing in common that in the end ties all the looses ends in the movie together; the what's now mythical fixed tenth race at Aqueduct some twenty five years ago!<br/><br/>A lot like ""The Usual Suspects"" the movie ""Lucky Number Slevin"" has a storyline that has a number of different characters from the police mobsters bookies and local horse players woven into it that takes a while to unravel itself. Slevin at first comes across as an innocent and unlucky dupe, and victim of circumstances, who's caught up with things that he has no control off. But as the movie reveals more and more of it's secrets you somehow begin to realize that he's not the person that you at first thought that he was.<br/><br/>The connection between Slevin and the two hoodlums, The Boss & The Rabbi, is also not as accidental as it seems. You start to notice that he's setting up the two for something but why and for what? Slevin also has a connection with the mysterious hit-man Goodkat who's beginning to look more like the one that's possibly behind this entire grand and murderous plan.<br/><br/>The film stretches the creditability of it's story a lot by everything going off almost without a hitch with the exception of Slevin's live-in girlfriend Lindsey which in the end turned out to be very lucky for her. Unlike in the 1995 block-buster and highly popular ""The Usual Subjects"" the surprise ending, that took over 15 minutes, didn't leave it's audience up in the air thinking that they were watching and listening to a sloppy and made story, by the person telling it, just in order to be shocked or confused by it. The surprise ending in ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was a lot more believable and and at the same time shocking then you would have expected it to be and has you going back to see the movie again to spot all the missed clues that you at first overlooked."

","A movie with a title as stupid as Lucky Number Slevin needs to have a lot working in its favor. Thankfully, what might seem like another Snatch meets Pulp Fiction rip off actually proves to be a worthy addition to the silver screen.<br/><br/>Following our main character Slevin (Josh Hartnett), we find a simple case of mistaken identity. Slevin has come to stay at the apartment of his friend Nick, but Nick never shows up.<br/><br/>Soon he is visited by the girl next door (played by Lucy Liu), and finds himself in the middle of a gang war between the boss (Morgan Freeman) and the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, credited as Sir Ben Kingsley because the actor must have an inferiority complex.) What will happen next? Will Slevin live? Why is his identity mistaken? Thankfully there are answers, and they aren't disappointing ones, either.<br/><br/>The acting, script and direction are all top notch. Director Paul McGuigan handles the large cast well. Every actor plays the part right, including Josh Hartnett who is quite a bit better here than he was in Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis play roles similar to some stuff they've done before (no, Morgan Freeman is not God again), but they do a fine job at it.<br/><br/>Much of the on screen time takes place in New York, and there is an interesting artistic style that has flair without being overtly flashy. There is even a visual effect shot that efficiently sets up the conflict between the warring mob bosses.<br/><br/>One thing, however, that may be surprising is the amount of violence.<br/><br/>Although the film is never gratuitous with its bullet holes, there are moments of visual bloodshed and intrinsic nastiness. A somewhat fun, light-hearted mood permeates most of the time, yet at heart Lucky Number Slevin is a drama.<br/><br/>There are also some pretty nifty action scenes, as McGuigan demonstrates a unique directorial style. There is more than just action, though, and the dialogue itself is usually sharp.<br/><br/>At times it heavily resembles the blissful operatic ramblings of Quentin Tarantino, but the real joy here is the story and the way it is told.<br/><br/>I love when movies have lots of little details that are wrapped up in the end.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the best attribute of Lucky Number Slevin, as all the little pieces of the puzzle come together.<br/><br/>Sometimes too many plot elements are crammed into one little monologue to explain an entire movie, but here every little twist and surprise is revealed at the right time and in an appealing way.<br/><br/>The script is smart, and for the most part it properly balances light-hearted humor with serious dramatic moments. It seems actual thought and care went into the narrative structure.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Lucky Number Slevin ends on a high note.<br/><br/>A successful mix of a crime caper, a drama, a situation comedy and a mystery, the film knows when to borrow and when to pave a path of its own. There is enough originality to make it worth the time, and it successfully tells an interesting story distinctly.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: Dramatic, funny and smart, Lucky Number Slevin is a successful collage of genres. Don't let the title fool you, there is more here than first meets the eye."

To clear the slate, he is asked by TB to assassinate the son of Schlomo in an on-going mob feud.

What the movie can boast above all else is an intelligent, well conceived plot full of twists and turns that require your full attention to the end, when it all gets revealed as just another big revenge storyline of the type that's been coming out of Hollywood a lot lately (a few years after 9/11.) <br/><br/>Some rather big flaws, then, but still a very rewarding action thriller with a clever plot. ****"
"sexydavie","8","3","11","25 February 2006"," loved this film, fantastic display offering extremes of both emotions, made me laugh and cry- fantastic
","I really enjoyed this film. Indeed, I thought it was a brilliant mix of several recent (and not so recent) films which didn't quite cut it, as they did not contain or offer the scope that this film manages to achieve.<br/><br/>The film begins with a fantastic contrast, the juxtaposition of some wonderfully graphic and deliberately hard-hitting violent scenes, which are very well filmed and definitely succeed in starting the film with a shock; contrasted with a fantastic cocky humour on the part of Slevin (Josh Hartnett), which sets the tone for this character throughout the film. I found myself recalling the almost poetic and semi-philosophical attitude and tone prevalent in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which I loved; in the character of Slevin (unfortunately kkbb lacks the substance that Lucky Number Slevin has in abundance). The graphic murders are carried out wonderfully, and can almost provoke tears, and definitely leave a lump in the throat of the hardiest movie-goer, making Munich look positively tame. However, a few moments later your spirits are uplifted by literally laugh-out-loud humour. This film is also exceptionally stylish, sticking loyally to one 'look' throughout, in a fashion that reminded me of The Aviator. Far from that film's early Technicolour glory, Lucky Number Slevin is a fantastic display of seventies retro- at one point I was unsure if it was indeed set in the seventies, it could be, however this is simply the style of the film, one of the chicest displays of cinematic fireworks I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Throughout the plot, there are some elements which one may have to consider artistic licence. At several points I began to think that maybe one or two details in the storyline would not come to play quite as they did in 'cinemaland', however provided one is willing to allow a degree of artistic licence to this film, often simply to the extent of offering it the benefit of the doubt, it becomes a masterpiece. Well developed and thought out characters, especially Josh Hartnett's, manage to pull off the sometimes spurious plot line with ease.<br/><br/>Throughout, especially at the beginning, there are various scenes which do not particularly link to the action taking place, which leave the viewer feeling dazed and unsure of their relevance- however, this all becomes clear, when the storyline is explained towards the end, clearly illustrating what has happened and how the scenes the viewer saw all link together in a truly ingenious fashion. Revelations towards the end totally change the way we look at several of the main characters: good guys become bad guys, the innocent bystander becomes the premeditated assassin, the premeditated assassin becomes the charitable old man, and our perceptions of love and hate within this film are turned on their head, all executed ingeniously within a very stylish, emotive and humorous backdrop. Loved it. A high eight."
"tastethevapour","8","3","11","25 February 2006"," Pretty enjoyable I thought
","OK, so this isn't a downright classic movie, but I felt it was pretty enjoyable. I was a little hesitant in seeing this flick and the main reason for that was Josh Harnett being the leading man, but he surprised me in being quite strong in that role.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsly are obviously great in the supporting roles as the feuding gangsters while Bruce Willis is the usual stone face monotone voice guy he is in most of his movies now.<br/><br/>I think that this movie will attract a lot of criticism due to the obvious fact that it thinks that it thinks it is a lot more clever than it actually is. A lot of comparisons have already been made to Revolver and this is probably a weaker film as it is not as clever.<br/><br/>Overall though, I enjoyed this and would recommend."

","Imitation Tarantino movie!<br/><br/>Within a few minutes of watching this flick, it's clear that the cast and crew are impersonating a certain type of Tarantino film.<br/><br/>The forced 'chemistry' between Hartnett and Liu is embarrassing to watch. The smart-Alec dialog comes off as high-school kids muttering ""I know you are but what am I?"" repeatedly and not much of it is funny, clever or even pertinent to what's going on in the movie.<br/><br/>The convoluted story tries so hard to trip up the viewer it stumbles over itself in the process. The stupid names are enough to tell you that this is gonna be a stinker... The Rabbi? FFS! You can get away with these cartoon villains in a Batman movie, maybe but here they just look and sound ridiculous.<br/><br/>Here's an example of the dialog...<br/><br/>Does he owe you 94,000 dollars? I don't know. Does he owe me 94,000 dollars? Do I owe him 94,000 dollars? Yes, you owe him 94,000 dollars? Do I owe you 94,000 dollars? You owe him 94,000 dollars, so you owe me 94,000 dollars. So, I owe you 94,000 dollars? Yes, you owe me 94,000 dollars.<br/><br/>This goes on for a while, so you can get up and make a sandwich or something when it starts.

Besides all the mystery, excitement, bloodshed and action, there is also time for romance and subtle humor.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is superb. A mysterious Josh Hartnett and a playful and sexy Lucy Liu both demonstrate truly powerful acting performances which pull you into the movie and never let you go. Take those two for the leading roles, and complete the cast with celebrated actors like Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci and Ben Kingsley, and you have all the acting talent needed to make a truly great movie.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin is an amazingly intelligent movie that really keeps you guessing until it reaches its final parts. I have to say that it became a little confusing at some point, but when the movie evolves further, everything becomes perfectly clear. What a plot twist this movie has.

","We decided to see this movie mainly based on the fairly good reviews it got. First, we saw a trailer which wasn't very promising. But at the end the trailer was pretty much ""what you see is what you get"". They (the movie makers) were trying too hard, definitely. Characters aren't very layered and it seems to me that some of the cast (e.g. Freeman and Willis) did their part in a routine manner. The beginning is a little bit confusing but as you watch the movie, the pieces fall into place, but in a way that the viewer is able to guess how the movie is going to develop, and especially how it is going to end. It's a formula that has already been in some movies before (revenge of the child for the loss of his parents, etc). Also, I can't really have compassion for the main character in his pursuit to get revenge, because a lot of innocent people get killed on his way. The warmest part of the movie is a connection between Harnett an Lucy Liu, and I'm glad that she survived at the end. Overall, a very overdone, over-trying-to-be-cool movie with mainly predictable twists."
"Sandcooler","8","2","6","7 December 2008"," Smooth
","Yet another one of those hypercool crime movies, this one's variation is that it actually has a good plot, apart from something happens somewhere and then all the story lines intertwine. They still decided to keep the whole talking in one-liners thing though, and it's not working out here. Neither does the obligatory pseudo-philosophy. I can't say it's all that poorly written, but it just seems really out of place for some reason. Perhaps I'm just sick of directors trying to be Tarantino and having people talk in a way nobody talks. Then again, it could be the unconvincing delivery, Josh Hartnett is no well, he's not much of anyone. When Morgan Freeman gets his podium for a pointless monologue, it just sucks less. No need to be negative though, this movie is still quite good. The pace is pretty smooth, for once I even enjoyed the camera going everywhere because it fit the atmosphere. And as I said, the plot is really good and not that easy to figure out, which surprised me. It's one of the better attempts."

But not only his brilliant performance makes the movie one of the best ever. The mysterious plot, the suspense from the first minute to the end, the surprising end and a excellent cast (brillant: Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley as rivaling Mobsters.

Cute: Lucy Liu as a hobby detective who falls in love with Hartnett) won't disappoint fans of flicks like The usual suspicious, Pulp Fiction and Go.

","One of the most important things in a film is its characters. However, it is often the case that these characters are all boring, or generally dislike-able, which makes it difficult at least for me to get into it. This problem can be ignored if there is a strong story, or at least poignant and interesting dialogue thrown in to give a level of respect to the character. The paramount example of this would be Pulp Fiction. This film has NOTHING of the sort I just mentioned.<br/><br/>Another redeeming factor in a crime/caper flick can be exciting action sequences... again this film doesn't have any. Furthermore, the star power this movie had going into it is painfully unused. Freeman and Kingsley are a waste, and Willis does nothing to help. Hartnett is as annoying as ever, but I will say Lucy Liu was cool in it - maybe because she had the only likable character.<br/><br/>My guess would be this film was misdirected, because it does have a good story... it's just not paced and revealed correctly. There is a good plot twist, but it's timing is in a flashback and at a point in watching it where there there is just nothing to care about; If the film stopped trying to be a Tarantino and just told the events in chronological order, like movies used to be, it would have been good."

"brodie_kashmir","4","2","6","10 July 2006"," Pretentiously awful, Hartnett deserves better
","""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a fast paced comedy thriller about a case of mistaken identity. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) takes a shower at his friend Nick Fisher's apartment just as two rival New York mafia bosses (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsly) send their thugs to collect on Fisher's gambling debt. Downside for Slevin is that both bosses are being controlled by assassin extraordinaire Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis). And from there, wackiness ensues.<br/><br/>""Slevin"" provides good laughs and an intricate plot with a surprise ending. Though to the film's detriment, director Paul McGuigan and writer Jason Smilovic tell us the ""surprise ending"" in the first 10 minutes, so you spend the rest of the film thinking about how they're going to reveal the ending, rather than concentrating on the movie (maybe that's a good thing). One would think they would have learned from the mistakes of M. Night Shyamalan.<br/><br/>McGuigan lets the ""mistaken identity"" theme creep out into real life. Though, McGuigan is trying to be mistaken for someone else. Actually, two other people: Quentin Tarantino and Bryan Singer. McGuigan grew up idolizing Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and Singer's ""The Usual Suspects,"" so he tries out his best impersonations of both and puts out what comes across as a sloppy fusion of the two.<br/><br/>But the cast keeps the audience's attention well enough to distract us from the cliché ridden plot. Hartnett is trying to grow up beyond the ""boy toy"" image he was known for in his earlier years, by taking a darker role. I found him to be entertaining and he should keep taking these quirky roles.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu plays the love interest of Slevin, and however noir-ish this film tries to be, she is no Femme Fatale, and is there more for comedy than anything else. Though in keeping with the theme of the movie, mistaken identity, this is a Lucy Liu we haven't seen before. While she still doesn't bring anything to the proverbial acting table, she does come off as a lot less annoying then she does in say everything else she's been in.<br/><br/>Freeman finally took a role which isn't God, or a wise old man or something like that. And he doesn't have to narrate, like he did in his past 7000 films. But he does seem uninterested in the role and this film. Willis plays the puppeteer assassin with a heart of gold, though like Freeman, he seems a bit removed from the film.<br/><br/>Again, here comes that recurring theme of mistaken identity. It's rough to see these two actors, both of whom I am a fan, take a walk on this. They seemed distracted, like the film was a waste of their time. It's not what I expect from these two. Fortunately they both have projects looming on the horizon that would return them to their more lively selves.<br/><br/>With so much talent and an interesting story, I really wanted to like this movie. I did, honestly. But the laziness of everybody involved (with the exception of Hartnett, who did his best with what he was given) dragged it down."

","How this film boasts a 7.7 rating with almost 300,000 weighing in is beyond me. That's too many for shilling, so one must assume this is the world's honest consensus opinion.<br/><br/>The positive reviews are technically correct on some points: yes, ok, this is a thriller about revenge, it's violent and gritty, and its fairly elaborate plot coils tightly around itself. It boasts an impressive roster of A-list actors, and the director/writer are definitely aiming for the upper echelons of Tarantinery.<br/><br/>The sad part: I am not even sure that McGuigan and Smilovic missed. Maybe the trauma of witnessing our civilization slowly flush itself down the apocalypse bowl for the last decade has so completely severed me from the mid-2000s cultural zeitgeist that I just can't fathom how anyone could have found something this vapid and contrived to be funny, cool, or entertaining. Maybe the majority of people on this planet are dull, easily amused, and proud of it. Maybe I am just crotchety and jaded at my advanced age of thirty-five.<br/><br/>Then again, I would like to think that McDonagh went on to pen Seven Psychopaths - a desperately needed and wholly deserved skewering of Tarantinery - after walking out of this particular film. (He really didn't, but it's a nice fantasy that definitely belongs to SP's meta-realm.) The fact that SP has a rating a half a point lower than LNS is just another sign of our civilization's impending collapse, as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>In any case, dissecting why Slevin is a nauseatingly unhip mess that goatse-stretches the viewer's credulity to its incontinence point is not just an objective waste of time, but pretty much impossible without spoilers. Basically, imagine expecting nonsensical plot elements and improbable coincidences to make some semblance of sense after an hour and a half - only to have to choke down an explanation that is even more improbable and nonsensical than what you started with. And don't even get me started on the awful dialogue, the lame names/handles, the mere presence of un-ironic hitmen...<br/><br/>Instead, I'll just point you to Seven Psychopaths, which aims at the same upper echelons - with a satire-caliber cannon, loaded with heart and wit. Smashes a gaping hole clean through, revealing the bloody, soulless vacuum beyond. I am even willing to compromise here: if that sounds a bit too 'meta' or 'preachy' for you, and if you'd rather watch something with a bit more style over just about everything else - go for Guy Ritchie's latest, The Gentlemen. Totally vapid, silly, contrived, improbable - but like...still entertaining and fun. (Oh, and Ritchie draws enough water to fill his own britches, so any comparisons to Tarantino are superfluous and unnecessary.)"
"davidjanuzbrown","10","1","2","17 April 2016"," A Classic Gangster Movie
","For anyone who is into gangster movies (and I am ) Lucky Number Slevin should be a must see). I see comparisons made to The Usual Suspects, and Pulp Fiction (both movies had Bruce Willis (in Pulp Fiction it was Butch Coolidge and here, it is Mr. Goodkat)). I would add Reservoir Dogs to the list where you had characters named after Colors: Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, and Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino). Here you had ""Rabbi"" (Ben Kingsley), ""Boss"" (Morgan Freeman), Goodkat, Elvis, and of course, Slevin (named after a horse), and Kelevra (Hebrew for ""Bad Dog""). I am not going to spoil the movie because of the mystery element to it: Except to say that there is no one who is a hero, anti-hero, and even Victim (except perhaps Slevin's (Josh Hartnett) mom). There are a lot of bad people in this movie: How bad you may ask? Goodkat, who is a sociopath hit man, does one decent thing in the movie, and is not close to the worst character in the movie. There are four worse then he is. If there is a moral character in the movie it is Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who is the love interest of Slevin (real name Henry), but even she is far from perfect. I will say this much: If you get through the violence, mystery, betrayal, revenge, and everything that Henry goes through, you will be rewarded. Major Spoiler: By the way, Henry does end up with Lindsey (so he gets a happy ending), but how he gets there? Watch and find out. 10/10 stars"

","It's hard to judge this movie because, in a fundamental way, it's really two movies -- one a casual look at mistaken identity out of ""North By Northwest"" -- the other a complicated story of murder and revenge, out of ""The Usual Suspects."" The performances are excellent with a few exceptions. One of the exceptions is Josh Hartnett, on whom the momentum of the story depends. He's inoffensive as the ordinary young guy mistaken for somebody who owes high-echelon gangsters a load of money, but he's something of an embarrassment as the bitter and sadistic killer of the climax.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are opposite numbers at the top of the racketeering business, and both are superb. Both are highly respected actors and here they get to show why. Freeman's two black goons are convincing as well, but Kingsley's are not. Kingsley is a rabbi. His goons are orthodox Jews and orthodox Jews are simply not menacing, even when they punch you out. Kingsley is hilarious in the penultimate scene. He's strapped into a chair and his killer is explaining why he must die. Kingsley is desperate to talk his way out of this inconvenient situation. He haggles in whispers. He tries gallantly to gesture with his arms and hands but he can't because they're taped to the arms of his chair.<br/><br/>It sounds a bit like a joke so far, and for the most part it is, despite the broken nose and the punches in the stomach.<br/><br/>The direction owes something to the Coen brothers, and if you have to owe something, the Coens are much better than Freeman or Rabbi Shlomo. Art direction should also take a bow. Lots of imagination has been expended on the set dressing. The screenplay is fine, the dialog has some nice exchanges and wisecracks, until the end, when it changes from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" to something more like ""Reservoir Dogs."" That ending, and Josh Hartnett's light weight performance, keep it from being the thoroughly enjoyable parody of high-end crime that it might have been."

","And, when I say 'like an American Guy Richie film' I mean one of his good ones, not Swept Away. Lucky Number Slevin follows the tale of a young man, oddly enough who goes by the name 'Slevin.' Upon arriving in New York he's mistaken for someone else and ends up getting caught in a life or death feud between two rival mob bosses (both wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). Throw into the mix a hit-man (Bruce Willis) who you don't know which side he's on and Lucy Lui as the love interest and you have the recipe for a half decent film.<br/><br/>Like made famous more in British gangster films, there are plenty of shady characters along the way (you know most will end up on the wrong end of a gun sooner or later), plus even more twists and turns so you don't know who's double-crossing who. However, luckily there aren't so many plot twists here that the conclusion will leave you scratching your head and having to look the end up on the internet (as I found myself doing with Guy Ritchie's 'Revolver').<br/><br/>All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is a good, solid entry into the gangster genres. It may never quite attain the dizzy heights of Goodfellas etc, but it's definitely worth a watch it you're a fan of the genre."

","I found Lucky Number Slevin more fun watching when I WAS DONE watching. Do you understand? Well, I have a hard time understanding too. <br/><br/>During the movie, it is hard finding out what the motives are of Slevin and what his purpose is in the whole film. During that quest, you get rewarded by the outstanding performances of Willis, Freeman and Kingsley. They are absolutely superb and really enjoyable to watch. Their henchmen look a bit like the crooks from the famous Snatch movies, although with less character and not the same amount of humor. <br/><br/>I didn't expect actress Lucy Liu to be so good in this type of movie. Perhaps I still imagine her as an 'Angel', but she really contributed to this movie. <br/><br/>When I was watching the movie, I'd rate it a seven.

When I was done watching, I immediately knew the movies was worth a big fat eight."

","Lucky Number Slevin takes a familiar take upon past better films such as Pulp Fiction. Involving an intricate, multilayered story structure constructed around a case of mistaken identity, ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" boosted as it is by a former A-list ensemble cast and a heavy dose of intrigue, crosses the unfortunate line between clever and pretentious, rendering itself tiresome long before its heavily built-up denouement. Screenwriter Jason Smilovic's dialogue, which fills characters' mouths with fast-paced exchanges and protracted analogies, has been described in production notes as the film's ""heightened language."" And while purposefully stylized and unnatural, the affected speech that becomes the pic's hallmark serves to distract from, rather than enhance, the genuinely gripping labyrinth of twists and turns.<br/><br/>At the center of ""Lucky Number Slevin's"" maelstrom is the eponymous Slevin (Josh Hartnett), whose run of bad luck hits an all-time high the moment he arrives in New York City to stay with his friend Nick (Sam Jaegar). Finding his old buddy's apartment empty, Slevin decides to settle in while awaiting Nick's eventual return. Slevin subsequently is abducted by a set of bodyguards and taken to the penthouse of The Boss (Morgan Freeman), who thinks that Slevin is Nick. It seems that Nick owes The Boss, and The Boss plans to cash in by having Nick -- who is really, of course, poor Slevin -- off the son of a rival. If Nick/Slevin doesn't agree to the deed, he will be the one killed. Returned to the apartment, Slevin is nabbed by a second set of thugs.<br/><br/>Delivered to the penthouse suite of The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), located directly across the street from The Boss' abode, Slevin is once again thought to be Nick, who is also deep in debt to The Rabbi. Sworn enemies with The Boss, The Rabbi also gives Nick/Slevin the choice to destroy his nemesis or else die himself. Complicating matters is the fact that Slevin is being tracked by a mysterious assassin named Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who is somehow manipulating the not-so coincidental circumstances, as well as an NYC detective (Stanley Tucci) investigating the two crime bosses. Slevin's sole confidant in this muddle is Nick's perky and adventurous neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu), whose involvement with her newfound friend takes an intimate turn.<br/><br/>=== As a rewatch 07/13/18' Lucky Number Slevin is quite an interesting watch with a lot of things happening. The film is quite a good mystery type dark comedy thriller and did enjoy it on another watch. Though can still see the flaws within the film that could have made it better. <br/><br/>As we watch the ending unfold and see how everything truly was, a lot of it was predictable in a way though still entertaining. A main reason was due to Josh Hartnett's performance. For a character that was put in many ""coincidences"" within the film, he didn't play it as someone who was worried or in too deep of situations. He played it cool throughout as if he knew he was never fully in danger. Somewhat confusing in the end with many plot twists though also engaging. Rating changed from 5 to 7."

In my opinion that is the absolute best way to watch this movie because i cannot figure out how to describe this movie without ruining the experience. Instead, I'll try to describe the type of people who might like this movie and if that's you, then stop reading and just watch it.<br/><br/>You might like this movie if any of this fits you. if you like crime and or mystery genre. if you can't stand missing the first 5 minutes of a movie. if you like movies that keep you guessing and trying to figure out whats going on. if you like movies/shows like Snatch, Oceans 11, Leverage. if you like one liners and entertaining dialog. if you rewind movies you watch at home because you are worried you might miss plot developments.<br/><br/>if your into that stuff go watch the movie.<br/><br/>if your still reading this then maybe its not for you. I'll try to get further in depth without revealing anything about my rating and likes/dislikes here. I know dialog is both a con for some reviewers and a pro for others. it is true that at some times its a little too witty in the sense that nobody really talks like that 24/7. I, however, am on the side of pro. i love the one liners. a specific one told by Hartnett i find particularly memorable because no matter how many times i think about it, i would arrive at the same answer every time. I also feel it keeps those scenes interesting enough to hold the viewers attention without being too interesting/funny as to completely derail the tone of the scenes. Pacing to me is another thing i like. For me it was perfect, it never shifts scenes too early that i haven't picked up what i was meant to understand, but also fast enough that i don't have time to process it and start devising my own conclusions. Its that small gap between acknowledging the situation and comprehending the situation. For me this movie hits it perfectly, again and again the whole movie and it makes for a great ending. and last is the plot twist/big conclusion style. I am a big fan of these types of movies. Most movies, however. in order to pull off a big finish. they need to throw in a lot of beginning chaos. the bigger the finish, the more chaotic the beginning. That leaves the average person confused and some times irritated. I know many who do not like this style of movie because of this. Lucky Number Slevin, however, manages to keep a big finish without making the viewers feel lost. viewers just feel like their riding shot gun to this extremely unfortunate persons life and to me that makes this movie great. that fact that you don't have to feel confused to get that wow factor."

","Lucky Number Slevin is a fantastic mystery thriller starring Josh Hartnett who plays the unfortunate Slevin Kelevra, an enigmatic smug yet lovable protagonist, who gets mixed into a colossal misunderstanding of identity placing him in debt with to rival gang lords for a combined $129,000 or an alternative of 1 gang land murder and $33,000. This leads Slevin on a brutal journey laced with dark wit from one plot twist to the next. Cinematographer Peter Sova really captured the essence of the 1950's mystery noir with the use of granulated filters during flashback sequences as an almost homage to past films. To add to this effect Screenwriter Jason Smilovic peppers in some clever back and forth between characters that keep the audience intrigued as they unveil plot twist after another which is actually addressed to as a ""Kansas city shuffle."" The film has a powerhouse cast (Josh Hartnett, Lucy Lu, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley and even Stanley Tucci) that really bring this project together. Also pay attention for Director's Paul McGuigan use of juxtapositions throughout the film. This was truly a triumph for all those involved!"

","The title of this film had put me off seeing it, also the fact that Josh Hartnett is the lead didn't do it much favours. I don't have much against the guy but he seems to make every character he plays turn into Josh Hartnett and that is why it seems that he brings out a movie every few years or so. Saying that, once this film got going he had drawn me into his character rather well and I actually believed I was watching a guy with the weirdest name, Slevin and not Josh Hartnett.<br/><br/>The film is based around mistake identity. Slevin has come into town after losing his job, flat and girlfriend all in one day. He has come to New York to stay with his friend Nick Fisher, such a good friend that when he arrives he isn't there and still hasn't returned the following morning, leaving Slevin to make himself at home. Slevin then meets Nick's neighbour Lindsey (Liu), who instantly falls for Slevin's charm, and I'm sure manhood considering she gets a complete eyeful with him only wearing a bath towel. Moments after she leaves another knock at the door produces two heavies, both of whom work for the Boss (Freeman) and have orders to bring in Nick Fisher. Despite not being Fisher, Slevin has no way of proving otherwise and is dragged in front of the Boss who is demanding the ninety-six thousand that he/Fisher owes him, or kill his arch nemesis, the Rabi (Kingsley)'s son to wipe off his debt. Slevin leaves to ponder and almost instantly is dragged in front of the Rabi, who also believes he is Nick Fisher. Nick Fisher happens to owe the Rabi thirty three thousand and Slevin has forty eight hours to pay up. What to do next?<br/><br/>The narrative is very jumpy and the story twists and turns throughout and you find yourself guessing and then second guessing what is going to happen to this poor guy, who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He must somehow come up with a plan to worm his way out as he is no killer and has no money to his name. I won't let you in on anymore as you won't know which way this film is going and it will have you confused until the very end, where every little seed of detail falls into place, and I have to say it works bloody well.<br/><br/>The cast is full of A-List stars and not one of them disappoints. As well as the leads we are treated to a bit of Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, both of whom are very good in their roles. It isn't only the plot that takes surprising turns, it is also each character, all of which seem to have a trick up their sleeve at some point and all the actors present their tricks with surprise and intrigue. It is a thinker and if you are not really watching you will become confused. <br/><br/>It isn't a crime thriller, more of a dark comedy. The first half is very quirky and the dialogue is sharp and snappy and some of the best pieces of dialogue I've heard in a while, all delivered with great punch from each actor, including Hartnett. It was a film that had me thinking but also had me laughing. What more can you ask for?<br/><br/>One minor fault I have with it however is the lack of direction shown in a few very poor shots. There are also a few jump cuts which make very little sense and there wasn't much point of them. At times they make you notice several continuity problems and to be fair they needn't have done it. So for me the choice of shots and some of the editing does let it down but the acting, story and dialogue do make up for that. The first half is quirky, showing some poor filmmaking and the second half becomes dark, a complete change of tone, and shows some great filmmaking, especially in the editing. It is like two different films and both were very good.<br/><br/>Let it all sink in and laugh along and I tell you, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>4 / 5 <br/><br/>Tolli<br/><br/>Check out my blog: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

Now I believe that when you make a bet such as $20,000 you will be required to lay that amount of money down on the bet. There was also ""juice"" called for but whether or not one would have to put that down too escapes me.

I was that impressed when I first watched it.<br/><br/>Fast-forward four years andwell, not so much. Yeah, I still liked it (hence the 8/10 stars; I think my original opinion was 5/5.) It was still clever, had good acting, but it didn't have that sting that caused my original double-watching. I don't know what did it for me this timemaybe it was trying too hard to be smarter than it was, or that Ben Kingsley has lost a lot of respect from me over the years – A Sound of Thunder, anyone? And even though I hadn't seen Thunderbirds – I really can't bring myself to do so.<br/><br/>Sure, Benny, sorry, SIR Benny, has been in a handful of excellent to good movies – Schindler's List, Shutter Island, to name a pair – but here, he just plain sucked. Lucy Lui – I always like her (""Hubba, Hubba, Hubba"" – Payback) but here, she seemed to just play the part. Willis and Tucci – ditto.<br/><br/>The only duo that stood out was Freeman and (oddly) Hartnett. I say oddly, because, after his premier in the way above average Halloween: H20, he's been as reliable as Keanu Reeves in film; you always know he is going to be terrible.<br/><br/>The real winner here was the script. It's witty, fast paced, fun, original and a lot of the times, you will, in fact, do what I did: rewind and play again to see what you might have missed. I didn't see this in theatres, but I did for Fight Club, and I might have done just that for that movie.<br/><br/>Aside from the movie's intro that jumps all over the place – though it's a great scene with Mr. Goodkat (Willis) in a wheelchair – we begin with Slevin (Hartnett, and incidentally I LOVE that name: Slevin) who's sporting a broken nose, a missing friend who he was supposed to stay with while visiting in NYC and a nosey neighbor, Lindsey (Liu) who does see more than he wanted her too.<br/><br/>Not too long after Slevin's arrival, he's kidnapped via being mistaken for the friend he was supposed to meet. In nothing but a towel, he's taken downtown to meet a crime-lord, ""The Boss"" (Freeman,) who explains he owes him money, but a hit on his nemesis, ""The Rabbi""'s (Kingsley) son will do just fine.<br/><br/>No matter how much Slevin tries to talk his way out, truthfully explaining he is not his friend – mistaken identity, etc – he gets further thrust into the battle between the two mobsters and the police all the while judging Lindsey and her ""investigation"" of trying to help this complete stranger to her.<br/><br/>It's a very well made movie with great dialogue, twists/turns and successfully takes itself from the realm of dark-comedy and quick wits to a more serious movie of revenge and retaliation. Despite my opening remarks, I highly recommend this little seen movie – especially if you like superhuman characters (Slevin) as much as I do. In fact, I think his only Kryptonite, though it was integral to the story, was the wildcard Lindsey. SEE IT!"

"Lucabrasisleeps","6","1","2","16 December 2008"," Slightly disappointed
","For some reason, this movie didn't click with me. The movie is one of the most inventive thrillers of recent years. And yet...<br/><br/>The reason could be Josh hartnett. I don't think I have been so underwhelmed with a performance of a leading man in a good thriller. Maybe he lacked the potential to be a proper leading man. His cool,composed style is maybe out of place in this movie. He doesn't have the screen presence to perform this role which is somewhat intense. He has a bored look on his face all the time.<br/><br/>The basic plot line is as follows : Slevin Kelevra(Josh Hartnett) is a man who is mistaken for his friend Nick fisher and gets caught between two mob bosses, The Boss(Morgan freeman) and The Rabbi(Ben Kingsley) who are intent on wiping out each other. In a complicated storyline, a hit-man simply named as Good cat(Bruce willis) is also involved in this mess. There is also a girl Lindsay(Lucy Liu) who helps Slevin make some sense of the whole thing. Unfortunately Lucy liu's role is quite short and I feel she was underutilised in this movie.<br/><br/>One thing I loved about this movie is the way the director finally closes all the loose ends at the end. The movie flows smoothly with a dark style of humor and an energetic screenplay. That is one of the strengths of the movie and might be the reason for the high rating this movie has. Bruce willis' performance is another one which is a strong point. He plays the regular tough guy role that he is famous for and he does that to perfection. Morgan Freeman is somewhat wasted in this role and his abilities could have been put to better use. Still, he does well enough to give the right edge to the bad guy character. Ben Kingsley, again, is much more capable. Still, I hope both these actors would do better in choosing their roles.<br/><br/>Does it have replay value? Maybe not because there aren't many memorable scenes and the humor is somewhat forced in many scenes(especially the scenes with the two black hit men at the beginning). Or maybe Josh Hartnett does not have the ability to deliver the lines right for this kind of humor. Whatever it is, the humor doesn't seem natural and the natural British style humour isn't anywhere to be seen(which I expected because the director is British).<br/><br/>Overall a good thriller but somewhat disappointed because my expectations were sky high for this one. The twist was very good and for that I applaud the director because it doesn't seem like a cop out. Instead it seems like an intelligent end and doesn't have many plot holes in it. It is a thriller for an intelligent audience. But Josh hartnett's performance is a downer and the revenge theme has been done in many movies. But this gives a new twist to it and a fresh approach to the thriller genre. But don't expect a classic or anything.<br/><br/>Overall rating 6/10"

Anyone with a brain can enjoy the fast script and hidden quirks. Not to mention excellent performances by everyone in the cast, each character is fresh and different and they all have their quirks.

'The Wrong Man' stars Josh Hartnett as Slevin Kelevra, a hapless young guy with the worst luck in the world. After walking in on his disloyal girlfriend, and being mugged in the street, Slevin goes to the empty apartment of his good friend, Nick Fisher (Sam Jaeger), only to be mistaken for Fisher by two gangs of rival mobsters  ruled by The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), respectively  and asked for the money that he supposedly owes them. This is a quick plot summary that is partly correct, and partly a complete lie, but that's exactly the point. This is a film that relies almost entirely on its twisting story, and without it the film would be basically worthless.<br/><br/>The characters, despite an exciting ensemble cast of talented actors (with key roles also played by Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci and Lucy Liu), are basically cardboard-cutouts; nothing more than glossy caricatures. This, I think, is what drags the film a solid step downwards from the likes of 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' both films with well-developed characters and ripper dialogue. 'The Wrong Man' is basically played for straight entertainment purposes, never really trying to be anything more profound, though you get the feeling that  with all these twists and turns  writer Jason Smilovic thought he was being a genius. In his defence, I will at least admit that I never saw the big twist coming. In fact, I was impressed at how the actual twist was handled. Usually, it is reserved for the final act of a movie, ending on a high note but almost always leaving unanswered questions and gaping plot holes. 'The Wrong Man' times its big reveal with about half an hour remaining, before investing a lot of time into explaining the little intricacies of the first half. Of course, there are still a few unsatisfying explanations (how did anybody work out that Det. Brikowski has been the assassin twenty years earlier?), but at least the filmmakers made an effort.<br/><br/>It seems a bit redundant to discuss the acting, since the characters were all so one-dimensional, and probably deliberately so. However, I will say that Bruce Willis was probably the most impressive as Mr. Goodkat, the enigmatic and highly-skilled personal assassin. Josh Harnett spends the first half of the film as the sympathetic, smart-mouthed innocent, but, by the end of the film, has somehow transformed into a dark, calculating shadow bent on bloody revenge. The transition is sudden and jarring, and it doesn't really allow the ending to carry any great feeling of resolution. The fact remains that we liked the original (innocent) Slevin infinitely more, and so we're left feeling somewhat betrayed by the path that the narrative has chosen. The mid-way switch from good-natured black comedy to bloody, violent revenge flick was also a bit mismatched. However, I did enjoy Lucy Liu's very natural performance as Lindsey, the chirpy and excitable young woman from the apartment across the hall."

","I, as a real fan of almost all genres of movies (except for horrors, and stupid teen comedies), I am sick of hearing why you people give your negative, pessimistic reviews of movies you most likely knew in advance, that you would not like anyway. You start watching the movie with a darn pessimistic screwed up attitude, thinking that Tarantino is the damn greatest director, and if he is not making the movie, it will definitely suck!!! You don't have to tell me that I am darn close on this. I have close friends that are that way, and they, as well as you all, have your right to your opinion. But some of you, really like to shove your opinions down the throats of others, for you believe your words are gospel. In this movie, you have not 1, not 2, but 3 of the greatest actors in this world. Morgan Freeman by far, is one of the most respected actors of Hollywood. That man can sit in front of 200,000 general people, and read a local phone book, and he will have every one of their undivided attention. Sir Bill Kingsley, to me is very underrated. You need to see, ""Searching for Bobby Fisher"" if that is you can watch it, there is no nudity, nor stupid comedy, such as someone running into a bus on a bicycle, or a bunch of wet T-shirt bimbos running around. Then, of course there is Bruce Willis. I need not to say much about the man, that darn near all red blooded Americans know already. Then there is the very up, and coming Josh Hartnett. I imagine all hormonal females loved the towel thing. The part I admired the most -- had to be the part played by Lucy Liu. I was not a big fan of Lucy Liu, until I seen her play this part. Why? I don't care for the roles she had played previously; which were almost all Miss Betsy Badass........so damn passé of today.....yawn. In Lucky # Slevin, she plays a human female, with real emotions. She was cute, warm, funny, and entertaining. Next, was Stanley Tucci. Great act from him, as always. Now the part I am really burned up on, is the person(s) who stated the movie was predictable... First off, let me guess you are fan of Tarantino, right? Next, let me see............ You work in the carnivals guessing the weight of people, and you are damn good at.........let me see, the government has contacted you on numerous occasions to help them, because you can predict anything, right? Stupid, right? Just like you saying this movie was predictable. I have not found anyone personally yet, who has not given this movie anything lower than a 6/10. I as a real fan of movies, not of just one genre, not of just one, or two directors/producers/writers/actors, not of just nudity, not of just action, not of just violence, not of just car chases, etc., etc., etc.. I am a FAN, a BUFF. I will see a movie for what it is worth, not because I want to sound cool, by being pessimistic. Maybe you really feel that way, then again... maybe you don't. But, to me, and everyone I personally know, this was a great movie.... mind you, not perfect, not even close, but damn good. That is why I am giving this movie, with a terrific cast, good script, and set. A movie that kept you guessing--- an 8 out of 10."
"ferris_scotland2006","4","1","2","11 August 2007"," hope your still awake to see the action!
","This was another one of those films with all the right actors, starring in terribly boring film...<br/><br/>The start was quite interesting and the relationship between Slevin and Lucy Lu was compelling but the film never really gets going and you don't feel any empathy for the leading characters I really din't care what happened ..as such I could have easily stopped watching at any point in the first 1hr 30mins.. then in the last 10 minutes all the action happens as the film tries to tell you that the last 90 minutes were really interesting not..! Even after the twist everything was predictable... I prefer films that leave you to work out what is happening not have it thrown down your throat... How this film classified as a thriller is the only thing that confused me..?<br/><br/>Please don't waste your time watching this movie.."
"edwardrevans","9","1","2","1 July 2007"," Nicely tied together
","Although this type of movie has been done before, Lucky Number Slevin, actually takes the time at the end to quickly tie and summarise all the loose ends, just in case you didn't yourself.<br/><br/>All the characters expect Slevin have minor parts in this movie but when they do appear on screen their time is used well and doesn't reveal the twist at the end. OK so its another Bruce Willis Movie with a twist so what, the surprise is well worth it.<br/><br/>A little confusing at the start with what seems to random strangers meeting in an airport departure lounge quickly leads on to a cleverly crafted story. The movie has also in parts so very amusing comedic moments with notable performances from the ""Boss's"" and the ""Rabbi's"" henchmen."
"kmillervir","8","1","2","29 June 2007"," Genuinely entertaining movie
","I saw about 3 previews for this movie on TV before it came out and i debated whether to go see it because it looked like one of those movies that could be pretty good but just as easily been really bad. So it just ended up slipping my mind until i saw it to rent in blockbuster a few months later and i immediately grabbed it.<br/><br/>Im glad that i did. It turned out to be a very good movie. The story lines were very well done, the acting was pretty good and it was just a good story. I also like movies with a particular style, like when you know that someone made it their own, like tarantinos movies, and jim jarmusch's movies. And i felt a great amount of special style in this movie. I really hope this director continues to make his movies his way.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin was just an all around enjoyable movie to watch, and you'll definitely find yourself watching it more than once. Go rent it and you'll probably end up wanting to buy it. go get this movie. 8 stars from me"
"cuddly_belly","8","1","2","25 June 2007"," Lucky Number Slevin - A Review
","A fantastic fast paced movie which has more twists and turns than the usual thriller. Newcomers to Josh Hartnett will not be disappointed as he comes across as a truly multi faceted actor of some note. Bruce Willis puts in the usual moody brooding role he is so good at,but in this instance adds a little more with his hit-man with a heart character. And Lucy Liu puts in a great performance as the wacky but very sexy neighbour with a Columbo type brain who's always got a theory. The plot is fast and furious but unravels at just the right time to keep you more than interested.This is not the film for you if you watch movies in two or more sittings, but its well worth sticking with. Guy Richie fans will love this. Its everything revolver wasn't."
"Galagonya","7","1","2","9 May 2007"," Well done.
","Very well crafted movie, where everything works starting from the music on, the story, the characters, the cuts, really nice and entertaining.<br/><br/>It was fun to see Bruce Willis performing not as a good guy in the first place, but a controversial figure (although he does not do much talking this time either). Josh Hartnett has been quite a surprise to me- he did much better than I expected. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley were their usual good selves (nothing extraordinary, though).<br/><br/>There are some real good dialogs, and some nice when not laughs but big smiles.<br/><br/>All together, an involving, good storyline, decent performances = 109 minutes of good quality entertainment.<br/><br/><ul><li>- - HERE BE SPOILERS - - - </li></ul><br/><br/>Something I did not get is why Slevin would tell Lindsey about himself anything at all in the first place, let alone about his past and the job that is on. <br/><br/>The other thing - you can trust a man with your life, he has raised you, he has taught you everything of his craft, he does everything he can to assist you in killing off the murderers of your parents (with what he had nothing to do directly), but you can not tell him, hey, you know, I kinda like this girl, let's keep her around for a while, shall we? And why? Beacuase he would SURELY not understand. <br/><br/>Why would Goodkat shoot Lindsey in the chest, then again? Everybody is always being shot in the head in this film (the bookie is banged in the head with a ball, the Rabbi's men both get head shots, the son of the Rabbi is shot in the head), why the chest for Lindsey - okay, it is apparent, so as to have this plot twist. Well, it has not been worth it.<br/><br/>Also, being a pro, why would you prefer an unknown girl to the guy who spared your life, your tutor and only living ""relation"", so to say? Why do this love threads always get so week in otherwise good films? <br/><br/>There were some moments of very good humor here. Josh Hartnett is being dragged around for a considerable part of the movie like a package, but for quite a long part, without the usual wrap. He takes it quite casually, in the end. The part where he ""mistakes"" the Bosses guy for him leads to some nice dialog. The same is true with the Rabbi complaining about hard it is to get decent people to work for you. In his business, sure. The Rabbi's men in the car also made me smile (does he never talk? no, why? you would have to ask him. would he answer? no) <br/><br/>My only concern is- where in earth does that horrible apartment house with those alarming wallpapers exist? It is my sincere - but doubtlessly unfounded - hope that it was only built as a set and demolished afterwards. The same is true for the hair cut of Josh Hartnett- life is easier for me if I suppose it was a wig."
"redmiss99","6","1","2","8 November 2006"," not bad, but don't compare it to the usual suspects
","I saw this movie a few weeks ago & its not bad, but not great either. What surprised me is IMDb's recommendation 'if-you-liked-this-movie you-will-also-like' The Usual Suspects. huh? This movie *does not compare* to The Usual Suspects. TUS was a standing ovation, chills-down-the-spine, watch-it-several-times movie, and incredibly impressive. I had Slevin figured out 30 minutes into it, and I am no Sherlock Holmes. Its like comparing Star Wars to Tron: same genre, different league. Entirely. I also expected better from Kingsley, Freeman & Willis. Maybe it was the direction/tor. I don't have high expectations for Lucy Lui or Josh Hartnet, so not real surprised there."

","I saw this movie without any expectations and I was more then surprised. It was a great movie whit a very smart dialog. I've seen some of the other comments and I cannot understand who you can say that this movie isn't smart or well done. You maybe need a little patience to understand the movie in the beginning, but that don't matters when the dialog is smart and funny. Some people just see an Hollywood Action/Comedy and assume that it's just another crappy Hollywood production but this film really isn't.

","It's really one of those movies that grabs you and pulls you in. Though, this isn't a movie you want to go take a break and get a drink or popcorn in. You have to pay full attention or really, the movie is lost. I like this about it, I can see how a lot of people wouldn't however.Josh Hartnett does a very fantastic job in his role and really makes you feel bad that he got stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time. Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis both do a fantastic job as well. Overall the acting is grand and I think it's a movie everyone should try and see. I think this is going to be one the best movies of 2006 without a doubt."
"UweBollFan1","6","3","12","21 April 2006"," Sort of Lucky
","Let me first say that I liked this film overall, it just left me feeling empty. It may have been because I guessed the ending about half of the way through or it could have been the poor man's Tarantino style of editing and dialogue (which isn't all bad). I liked all of the actors in the film (even Sir Ben, although I can't look him straight in the eye anymore after Bloodrayne)and I thought everyone gave solid performances. But for some reason, I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of the movie. If you enjoy ""gangster"" or Tarantino inspired movies, this one is worth seeing in a theater, otherwise you may want to wait until the DVD comes out."
"jackg123","10","3","12","9 April 2006"," Thrilling detective movie
","Lucky Number Slevin is a thrilling detective movie is unlike any other I've seen. It will keep you guessing (as all detective movies do) but with such finesse and suspense which will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end. The writing, directing and acting are excellent all around. As the main characters, Lucy Liu, Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis turn in super performances. Although their roles are smaller, but important, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman turn in the excellent performances expected of them. Likewise, the supporting character actors turn in very good performances. Except for a few minor flaws in the writing (deliberate, perhaps?), the plot, the pace, the drama, the relief are excellent. The photography of lower east side Manhattan as well as the towering, breathtaking, high rise, penthouse views of the super rich will be especially appreciated by New Yorkers and expatriates. Although it is early in the year, I expect this movie to walk away with the 2006 Academy Awards for movie, directing and acting. I am a frequent movie goer and this is one of, if not THE best movie I have seen in the last ten years."

"Cristi_Ciopron","3","2","7","22 May 2009"," Intended as a fancy roller—coaster; Willis in a honorific role
","I do not know if it will be of much use to point that Slevin is a new try on the character patented successively by Hammett in writing and by Kurosawa and Leone on footage—the mysterious stranger who . Some scenes in SLEVIN are amusing—the lustful Asian babe is nice—but the movie is generally unexciting and uninteresting. Except from some funny notes, SLEVIN is uninspired and slummy. Who cares about the Rabbi and his queer son and Freeman's regularly dignified diction? The Willis extravaganza named SLEVIN is a fancy thriller with some high class cast, trying also to look classy and witty and cultured—they even quote Hitchcock. Willis has a supporting part; the plot involves two mobsters fighting each other. The movie has many things that are nice; or, better—quite a few things that are nice. It only lacks the essential. It constitutes moderately amusing fluff, intrinsically shallow extravaganza, with not much to offer, it lacks the essential fanciness and witty merriment and exciting pace of such tales, it does not seem fast—paced, as it should, but hurried—as it should not; Willis is not required much.<br/><br/>And what SLEVIN seems to strive to imitate is rather the new OCEAN'S ELEVEN, except that it does not achieve at all that level of merriment. The boy who plays the titular character is indeed very good—looking, and an execrable actor.<br/><br/>Somewhere the characters quote a Hitchcock thriller; then they talk a little about Mrs. Saint. For me, she's a more interesting topic than SLEVIN.<br/><br/>I agree that Eve Marie Saint was hot; more than 13 yrs. ago I have found out that in the Actors Studio epoch Eve Marie and Lee were the true feminine stars, the most impressive upcoming actresses."
"tain-5","2","2","7","9 July 2007"," Unfortunately, not funny.
","This movie makes Hong Kong action flicks look like cinematic masterpieces. The acting's not that great but acceptable, 5/10. The script is another story however. It's like a ""retarded 3rd grader wrote this"".<br/><br/>The dialogs are so primitive and artificial that I might be tempted to enjoy it as a B movie, unfortunately as bad as it is, it's still not quite bad enough to be funny. -3/-10.<br/><br/>If you are one of the ""I've never seen a Jewish mob boss before, this must be brilliant"" people then the movie is for you.

","Wow, what a dumb movie. Literally everything about it is exactly wrong. The acting, the cinematography, the sound, the writing, it's all bad. Why oh why oh why was Harnett in a towel for 40 minutes and why oh why oh why was it so irritating to see him eating a sandwich with bread that white. Ugh, I'm shivering.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this thing, are you kidding. This movie feels like a cross between Tarantino and that young guy who was in Die Hard 4 and who's in those techie computers. The result: Annoying! How could I possibly care for Slevin in this movie. The sensibility where the 'good guy' won't take any lip from the bad guy and is instead a 'conundrum' does nothing to make me ally with him, to care about what happens to him. And I don't blame just the actor - this is also the directing.<br/><br/>The way they use sound in this movie can be insulting, too, along with the editing. Well, what isn't most concerning here is how bad this movie is, but it's the high reviews its getting, for the most part. Oh, man, I give up ..."

For comparison,American Psycho has 7.6,Glengarry Glen Ross is just +0.1 away from Slevin,The Rock is 7.4,Face off is 7.3... Its just ridiculous...<br/><br/>It seems that the cheesier they make them,the better they are liked,this movie tries to be funny,smart,mysterious,but it fails in everything. Its just a pointless revenge story which is supposed to blow us away with ""unexpected"" ending. Not at any time of the movie did I feel any sympathy for any of the characters,from the protagonists father,to the corrupt cop getting shot at the end,this movie evoked zero emotions. Dialogs are just flat,unimaginative,trying to be funny and witty,but actually cliché,fueling God awful plot. Sure, a mob boss would let you interfere within his chess game. People who let you do that cannot make criminal empire, its that simple, I cant stand the movies that don't do their homework on psychological profiling and as a result make their characters into oxymoron's.<br/><br/>Rating for this one should be say 3.5,but I just have to abolish these unrealistically high ratings with 1/10."
"classicsoncall","9","2","8","17 April 2006"," ""Besides, you can't have a Kansas City shuffle without a body.""
","Maybe fun is not entirely the correct word to describe my viewing experience for this film, but I have to say that watching it was a blast. With only the odd trailer or two and some IMDb viewer comments to go by prior to seeing the movie, I was prepared for a more typical kind of 'mistaken identity' film. That gimmick usually works against the protagonist, but this time around it's the title character Slevin that's creating the smoke and mirrors. Come to think of it, maybe even the promotional clips were intentionally in on the ruse; all seemed to suggest Bruce Willis as the lead character.<br/><br/>So successful was the movie in laying the groundwork for the first major plot twist, that when it happened, I literally sat up and said to myself - ""Slevin really killed Yitzchok - What's that all about!"" From that point on it was a different movie, with Slevin's complete change of character and a juggling act to figure out if Goodkat would complete his contract with the Rabbi.<br/><br/>All of the films's principal characters turned in not only credible, but outstanding performances. The surprise characterization might have been that of Lucy Liu as next door neighbor/coroner Lindsey. By the time we get that far in the film, I was already hedging my bets against her 'hit' by Goodkat, so the surprise was going to be how Slevin would square it with his partner. Pretty much all he had to do was ask, but the way it played out allowed Willis' character to provide his own job reference - ""I'm a world class assassin f......d. How do you think I found out?""<br/><br/>Along with ""Inside Man"", 2006 has already provided a strong early dose of exceptional caper films, so if that's your pleasure, I would recommend both highly. A word of advice though, they're probably best viewed without trying to solve them with the action still rolling. The fun isn't so much in the destination, but the ride that gets you there."
"phillipstephenso","10","2","9","26 May 2006"," World Class Acting
","Josh Hartnett and Bruce Willis are probably the most under rated actors today. In this film, Bruce is a ""world class assassin,"" who becomes involved with Josh originally as a ""specialist"" hired to kill Josh 20 years ago, when Josh was about 7 years old. Josh is the son of a man murdered by a new gang in New York City, which exacts revenge from a ""sure bet"" that his father makes that he cannot repay. So, Josh's father is killed along with Josh's mother and even the losing horse, ""Lucky Number Slevin."" Bruce, or ""Goodcat"" could not bring himself to commit the murder, though. So, he adopts Josh and gives him the name ""Slevin Klevera,"" alias ""Baddog."" Evidently, Josh is trained in assassination by his adopted father. Meanwhile, the gang splits between two leaders, the ""Boss"" living in one high rise building opposite another high rise building, in which the other gang leader named ""Rabbi"" exists behind security cameras and bulletproof windows. Bruce and Josh, suddenly appear 20 years later to exact revenge. It seems that also gangsters sow what they reap. Bruce is believable as a cold-hearted hit man. And, Josh is charming and sexy, as he spends the first 30 minutes of the film with only a towel covering his fine, slim body. There is explicit violence, including several gruesome murders, of course. And, the corrupting brutality of the gangster oligarchy in New York City is vividly laid bare as a continuing challenge to law enforcement and justice in that vast and complicated urban center."

But it's good that it eventually makes sense and it all comes together and you're like ""Oh I finally get it!"" lol So it has many twists and turns in the plot, which is good so it doesn't get stale fast.

So my overall review summary - lots of twists and turns, storyline keeps ya guessing, but only con is that the whole film runs a little slow to get through.

Okay.(Though if you want to read to the end but not know anything skip the next paragraph) <br/><br/>As good as the movie is there is a large flaw in it, its not a fatal flaw but its the type of thing that keeps it from being a great film. The flaw is that the film thinks its much more clever than it is. Constructed as a twisty turny little thriller where nothing is as it seems this film is trying desperately to pull the wool over our eyes. The problem is that from the start we're told and shown we're going to be misdirected so we never completely settle into accepting the movie on its own terms, which is what great films trick us into doing. As I said its not fatal, but it keeps this film from being the great film it aspire to be and that it thinks it is. To be honest I had a good chunk of the movie figured out early on, and while it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie, it did stop me from loving it. I suspect that on later viewings when knowing whats going on will be a foregone conclusion this may play better.<br/><br/>Flaw and all this is a good fun movie. I don't know if you'll love it but my guess is that you will like it.

","Brilliant. I saw this late last night with my Dad. I was expecting the usual shoot 'em up thriller but I was pleasantly surprised with the intricate plot; it was something completely different. The best writing since Italian Job and Ocean's Eleven. The plot focuses on details and it is incredibly well thought out. The audience is led in one direction and the outcome is the complete opposite; expect the unexpected. Each member of the cast fits his or her role perfectly. Josh Hartnett masters the role of Sleven. The whole thing is a guessing game. The beginning of the film leaves random loose ends but the smallest of details seem to fall into place by the end of the film. Don't think too hard and don't try to figure it all out in the beginning; it will ruin the enjoyment of the entire film. If you don't catch this movie now, you'll be kicking yourself when you stumble over it in a movie store and have to watch it on your small TV screen. I beg you to pay the $10.50 to see in on the big screen for the full effect. You won't regret it. I assure you."

And another Career Maker for Josh Hartnet and Lucy Lui. If you haven't seen this movie yet, PLEASE GO! It has just enough humor and romance for a great date movie, just enough action adventure for a guys night, enough fun and Josh Hartnet for a ladies night out.

","Lucky number Slevin was a refreshing gangster movie with a great cast. Whenever you put Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, and Lucy Lui in the same movie your in for a treat. The performances are very good and the plot only adds to the excitement. Hartnett plays his obnoxious care-free character very well and Bruce Willis is cast well in his assassin role and once again comes through with a great performance. Lucy Lui provides a refreshing personality in the movie and as always Morgan Freeman play ""the boss"" beautifully. Ben Kingsley may not be the most convincing rabbi, but he too plays his part well. The plot makes many twists and turns, some expected, but many surprising, and it's only in the last ten minutes when you finally realize what is going on. These last ten minutes of the movie allow you to leave the theater satisfied and happy. This movie is not a waste of time and if you're in the mood for a good time i strongly recommend it."
"lothlorienmindscape4-1","9","2","9","19 April 2006"," A surprisingly good film...
","I have to admit that when I went to see this movie, I thought it was going to be funny and witty, since that's what all the TV spots said about it. But truth be told, this movie is flat-out amazing despite the minor amounts of humor. Josh Hartnett's character is very convincing as a man mistaken for someone else. The dialogue in the movie can range anywhere from witty to heartbreaking, but at all times it's pretty much fast-paced and keeps the story moving along well. The best aspect of this movie is probably that the characters are by no means flat; even the cruelest ones seem to have a bit of a soft spot. The plot line of the movie isn't laid out within the first five minutes by one character's dramatic monologue (as in some other less substantial films); you figure it out as you go, and even in the last few minutes of the movie you're still guessing. That's what keeps everyone entertained."
"Tbird23","8","2","9","17 April 2006"," great flick
","Wow. What a great flick. I had read some reviews of this and was intrigued by the cast.<br/><br/>Started out a bit slow, but Hartnett did a great job and frankly any movie with Morgan Freeman in it can't be all bad.<br/><br/>To me this was a cross between Pulp Fiction, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs. Bruce Willis was superb as usual, playing a very subdued character. Reminded me a lot of his character in The Sixth Sense. In fact, I think they used the same wardrobe and hairdresser.<br/><br/>Very cool noir sorta flick. Confusing to be sure, but rest assured it all ties together nicely with multiple twists and turns. Sure, some of them are expected, but some catch you going ""oooohhhhh"".<br/><br/>Mykelti Williamson has a nice little role.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Hartnett was superb and I almost forgive him for Pearl Harbor."
"Ultra-violence","7","2","9","15 April 2006"," Pay attention...
","After a montage of killings committed by men whose faces aren't revealed, the film begins its story of a who, what, where, when and why mystery that we all know and love. Slevin(Josh Hartnett, Wicker Park)is staying at his friends apartment when the New York black mafia thugs mistakenly drag him to 'The Boss'(Morgan Freeman, Million Dollar Baby) so that he can wage war with his arch rival, 'The Rabbi'(Ben Kingsley, Sexy Beast) Why do they call him a rabbi? Because he's a rabbi, as said in the film it's self. Meanwhile, the nosy neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu, Kill Bill. Vol. 1) is playing Sherlock Holmes and trying to find the whereabouts of her neighbor, while getting close to Slevin at the same time. Not much can be said without ruining the ending, but don't think that that's all the film has to offer. Directed by Paul McGuigan the film relies a lot on dialogue and if you drift away for a second, you can definitely miss something. In every scene the dialogue flows in a rapid motion that quick and witty at the same time. For instance, Slevin's character suffers from the ability to worry, in which only naturally makes him a complete smartass. He questions everything that is said and answers everything with a smart remark that could be done without. The dialogue maybe quick but so is the editing, in which makes it easier to withstand all the jibber-jabber. One particular scene that I enjoyed was when Slevin was refusing to ride with 'The Bosses' thugs and after threatening to break his nose, the big mouth thug pulls his arm back and a shot of Slevin freezes and then cuts to him sitting quietly in the backseat of the car with an obvious broken nose. It lets the audience use their imagination on what the impact looked liked. There are several scenes that fade to white, fade to black and even shows a shade a red during a point-of-view death scene, But for the rest of the film, it is as if McGuigan has told the whole story straight through, but took out certain frames of the film and put them at the end. It defiantly makes the film a lot more confusing and rises questioning, but isn't that what mysteries are all about? Questioning everything? For the most part the camera motion was very mobile and was used for tracking a person at times as well. Back to the point-of-view scene that I referred to earlier, someone is shot and the camera is shown through the eyes of the victim who falls down to the side. Now it's not like the camera falls backwards but it actually looks like they physically dropped the camera on it's side, in which gives it that realism of what it would be like to be shot and killed. Kind of creepy, but effective none the less. The most stylistic trait that I found was that in every scene, the wall paper was very absurd and had interlocking patterns similar to M.C. Escher's symmetry paintings of the 1930's. But every room's wallpaper was different. In the friends apartment that Slevin was staying in, it seemed very outdated, similar to the whereabouts of his friend and in the apartment of Lindsey, interlocking flowers covered her walls suggesting that she is nothing but a flower herself. All through out the film, it seemed to flow very richly and everything was timed perfectly, whether it was when someone enters the room or when the music followed up the reaction of someone's expression gave it a predetermine flow to the film. Lucky Number Slevin has its own style with somewhat believable characters. I think that Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis are battling to see who can be cast in the most films in their career. Josh Hartnett does make a believable smartass that you want to know but hate to acknowledge. Lucy Liu has always been able to prove that she can play with the boys and I am always glad that she does, especially when she is the only lead female role. But nothing comes close to Ben Kingsley's performance as a Jewish mobster, something I could never believe, but now I can. He does a great job acting as does everyone else in this film, being that the dialogue is quick to follow let alone say. A good thriller mystery that seems to follow in the footsteps of other films like The Usual Suspects wouldn't be so bad, but to call it a Tarantino film shows the laziness of a movie-goers attempt to categorize this film."

Brice Willis of course never fails to deliver a great performance and he masterfully does here. Easily one of his best movies in a long time.

"JimD73","8","2","9","12 April 2006"," Lucky Number Slevin near-perfect 90s style flashback
","You ever had a really bad day? You know, the kind of day where nothing seems to be going right and just about anything that could go wrong does? No matter how bad your day may have been, I'm going to assume that the crap Slevin has to go through in this movie can top that. Even if it is about someone having a really bad day, Lucky Number Slevin is one hell of a good movie.<br/><br/>Slevin (Hartnett), as stated above, is having on hell of a day. It starts out with him getting fired from his job. He goes home to find out he is being evicted. Without a home, he plans on staying with his girlfriend for a while, only to wind up walking in on her with a strange man. He instead calls his old friend Nick and goes to New York to stay with him. En route to the apartment, he is mugged. When he gets to the apartment, Nick is nowhere to be found. And, to top it all off, two gangsters show up at his front door to collect on a $96,000 debt that Nick owes The Boss (Freeman).<br/><br/>Instead of demanding the money, The Boss offers Slevin (whom he assumes is Nick) a second option, which is absolve all debts by killing the gay son of rival gangster The Rabbi (Kingsley), who recently murdered The Boss's son. At the same time, The Rabbi picks up Nick/Slevin because Nick owes him around $30,000. Also, nosy detective Brikowski (Tucci) is investigating Slevin's appearances with both bosses. To top it all off, a mysterious assassin named Goodkat (Willis) shows up, apparently playing both sides of the fence. Slevin, with the help of curious neighbour Lindsey (Liu) is now caught in the middle.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning, where Goodkat tells a story about a mob killing to a man in an airport, the movie tells you it is a con with a reference to a 'Kansas City Shuffle', where everyone looks to left and you go to the right. If you are good at solving this kind of movie, odds are you'll get the main twist sure enough. It's the little twists that are almost completely unpredictable, and they make the ending one of the best in recent years. The first two-thirds are a total setup to the incredible final act.<br/><br/>The movie's style seems to be a mix of Pulp Fiction, The Usual Suspects and Get Shorty, which is a very good thing. It has a comedic flow with a great edge to it. In fact, there is almost nothing in the movie to suggest that it wasn't Tarantino directing another Elmore Leonard adaptation. Yes, that is right, I just compared this to Tarantino, and it deserves the comparison.<br/><br/>The problem with the style is that the movie is often self-contradictory, or throws some very confusing scenes at us early on, which I will now dub WTF moments, due to the fact that they made me wonder exactly what the hell was going on. Some, such as myself, love this type of movie, but others may not like being stringed along as they will be constantly in this movie. Throw in some time-jumps, and this movie adheres to basically every Tarantino rule, which not everyone will like.<br/><br/>One aspect I really liked was the paranoia from The Boss and The Rabbi, both of whom live in buildings facing each other, too afraid to leave their bulletproof glass shield for fear of high-powered rifles. The minor thugs they have all seem to fit into some kind of caricature, which helps keep the movie's style flowing in a Leonard-like fashion. Sure, stereotypes they may be, but they work well for the movie.<br/><br/>One part I was worried about was the star, Josh Hartnett, who seemed quite out of place when compared to the rest of the cast when looking at the roster. Surprisingly, he steals the show with a character seemingly written just for him. Slevin is a smart-ass, sly and semi-pathetic character, and Hartnett completely convinced me, easily proving to be the best role I have seen him in to date. Not saying that this is some performance that will seriously garner any awards attention, but he stands tall, perhaps even rising above, the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is comprised of some true greats from Hollywood, including two Oscar winners and Bruce freakin' Willis. Morgan Freeman definitely fits in with the Leonard style, with an edge much akin to Delroy Lindo in Get Shorty. Ben Kingsley creates a quite interesting character out of The Rabbi, which contrasts well to Freeman's cool, yet one-dimensional, Boss. Stanley Tucci seems largely ignored, but does exactly what anyone could have hoped for in his screen time. Lucy Liu did exactly what was needed for a female lead, which was to look attractive and bounce off Hartnett well. The two of them have definite chemistry, which is a major plus. Finally, Bruce Willis does what he does best as the mysterious assassin Goodkat. Even if the man says nothing, he still emanates kickass, and just by being in this movie the movie automatically rocks (well, not really, but you get the point).<br/><br/>For anyone who loved the 90s, this movie is for you. It has all the style of the greats from that era, as well as a twisty, somewhat convoluted plot line that any fan of the genre will love. With a solid plot, excellent cast and plenty of style, Lucky Number Slevin is exactly the type of movie that we almost don't see enough of anymore. So, bring on more of the same, because even a copycat of this would be worthwhile.<br/><br/>Overall Rating  94%"
"lymond01","8","2","9","10 April 2006"," Entertaining
","With a lot of Bruce Willis's films, you can rely on his entertainment value. This movie is, happily, one of those times. The plot is a little predictable, but the tale is in the telling here. Good acting, good direction and great editing put what might have been a mediocre film into a category of ""definitely worth watching"".<br/><br/>Lucy Liu is terrific as the hyper coroner, Josh Hartnett does an above average job as the visiting kid caught in the mob war, and Willis, well, he does his calm, cool, collected routine, but he does it well.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie entertains on a high level.

The performances in this film were all really good, especially Ben Kingsley in a role as a Rabbi mobster and Stanley Tucci as the corrupt FBI man. The problem with the film is that it is unfolded in a confusing way where you don't know exactly what is happening until it is explained at the end of the film. It might annoy you, which it did to me, but I enjoyed just watching these guys perform. The plot (or what you are lead to believe is the plot) is that hit-man Mr. Goodkat (Willis) kills a man named Nick, and Slevin (Hartnett) happened to be staying at Nick's place and is called in by two mobsters both that hate each other (Freeman and Kingsley) that believe he is Nick and they want him to pay him money that Nick owes them and kill each other's loved ones. Meanwhile Slevin meets Nick's neighbor Lindsey (Lui) and is being watched by FBI agent Brikowski (Tucci). The plot unfolds about 50 zillion secrets and twists and turns along the way which I won't reveal, so go see it. I recommend it! My rating-3/4 stars. 105 mins.

"LaffingNow","9","2","9","7 April 2006"," Dual choreography of mistrust
","I saw this movie today on its screen debut in southern CA and enjoyed it quite a bit! It had just about everything in a film that I enjoy. Mystery and suspense, serious intent, well-written plot, contemporary thematic backdrop, the action handled with finesse and portrayed with meaningful direction, all intelligently support this brilliant and well-paced thriller. Most of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the finely crafted juxtaposition of how the weak can lead the strong through the exposure and effacement of pride that ultimately leads to downfall.<br/><br/>The film contains two sets of adversaries in a dual choreography of mistrust. That is between the two once friendly but now wealthy strong men and the uneasy truce established between the nemeses hired guns. The two strong men have erected individual decades-old barricades to protect themselves from each other in an upscale New York City setting. However well constructed, their defensive fortifications remain proverbial gilded cages. In the case of the two adversarial protagonist strong men (Morgan Freeman vs. Ben Kingsley), the simple catering to the respective egos and weaknesses of these two mortal enemies by the antagonist sheep (Hartnett & Willis) proves to be their undoing. The protagonist's rush to judgment over each other's calculating chess maneuverings (nice theatrically visual centerpiece as well) was symbolic of misplaced pride that prevented them from seeing the real truth. This eventually leads to mutual demise. Oddly tragically Elizabethan as it is reminiscent of how pride and misplaced trust proved to be the complete undoing of Othello.<br/><br/>The gradual unfolding of multifaceted objectives ran a nice undercurrent throughout the character development and sustained the central plot with retro-activity well. I see experimentation in circularity of plot implemented in other films these days and consider this a nice twist to the common (yet still good) linear plot approach.<br/><br/>Although throughout the film emphasis is placed on mistrust, of which there are two flavors; namely overt and evident as between the primary adversaries (Freeman & Kingsley), and covert and unspoken as between the secondary (Hartnett & Willis), there does appear to be an attempt to convey a moral to the story. So what I got out of this film in this area was: there is a lesson to be learned regarding revenge and mistrust; that is that no matter how sweet revenge, retaliation, vengeance, or retribution may be, its only result can be bitterness. Attendant mistrust (established or uneasy) can lead only to a cul-de-sac of cascading and spiraling mistrust, never to full satisfy. Therefore, one needs an honest and open relationship, and in this case it presents itself in the promising relationship with the love interest character (a Coroner portrayed by Lucy Liu). This apparent relationship with innocence is necessary in order to break away from the dark side.<br/><br/>Thus, the inescapable and magnetic love-at-first sight attraction between the younger assassin (Hartnett) and Lucy Liu. Although a youthful Willis character early on exhibited the ability to refrain from murdering a child displaying how he wasn't completely jaded, he has been in the assassination business for so long, he knows nothing else and is too far-gone. But there is hope for the younger assassin. This is reminiscent of the dilemma of the jaded assassin in the comedy ""Matador"" between the Pierce Brosnan assassin character and Greg Kinnear. If one waits too long, they become jaded in the only thing they trust: revenge; served up nice, cold and basically not shareable. However, Willis' and Hartnett's characters are ultimately killers themselves in a film that exhibits no clear good or bad guys in a world filled with only gray matters which ruins, I believe, the potential for serving up poetic justice.<br/><br/>Since I'm a romantic, I especially liked the allegory of how the strength of love was portrayed as having the ability to be a more powerful force than the satisfaction derived from the expectation and execution of patient revenge for unjustified murder and the subsequent halting trust established between two hit men with an uncomfortable and eventually untenable, lifelong agreement."
"mccarthyk8","10","2","9","7 April 2006"," Slevin (Hartnett) is catapulted into an awful case of mistaken identity going between two rival mobsters of New York (Freeman and Kingsley).
","This movie was amazing. It was witty all around and Hartnett, Willis, and Freeman, being some of my favorite actors, were perfect fits for their roles. Everything came together in the end and it all made sense. It really was a thinker so if you aren't in the mood to think, this isn't really the movie for you. But if you love action, suspense, humor, action violence, and everything that goes along with it, you're in luck. You will like this movie if you liked ""Fight Club"" and ""V for Vendetta"". Sure it was a little predictable, but hey, it makes you feel good about yourself that you could put two and two together. Lots of twists and turns. A top notch movie."
"craigsomerville","Null","2","9","23 March 2006"," Well worth a watch!
","The first 30 minutes of this movie I must admit I didn't care for that much. The problem was the script is a little too quirky, it was just trying to be far too clever. The characters come across as a little smarmy and I found myself starting to dislike most of them, if not all.<br/><br/>The second act turns the movie around for me, it becomes a much better film, good character development helps you begin to care about the lead in the movie played well by Josh Hartnett. Lucy Lui also turns in a very strong performance even tho a little under used. The mighty Morgan Freeman and equally strong Ben Kingsley are also not used to their full potential but both bring in a credible effort.<br/><br/>The final acts the most enjoyable part of the movie in my opinion, You find most of these types of movies usually struggle to tie all the lose ends together at the end in a satisfying way. This film certainly does not, the way every thing is rounded off is very pleasing to watch even if its slightly predictable.<br/><br/>Overall a very enjoyable film. Terrible title which I think will put a lot of people off going to see it, but well worth a viewing if your looking for something a wee bit different and you want to give the brain a bit of a workout."

I've been one of those people that think Bruce Willis seems to do his best work with a gun (Moonlighting & Blind Date being exceptions), but he turns in a pretty understated, wry performance. Morgan Freeman & Sir Ben Kingsley always keep your attention---WHEW! Lucy Liu is very quirky and mischievous as a neighbor that drops in on Josh Hartnett. I don't understand why he gets a bad rap from people (HATERS IN THE HOUSE!), I'm an African-American male and I've always found his work pretty solid (O, Hollywood Homicide, Wicker Park, etc.). The director, Paul McGuigan even spoke after the screening and found his body of work comparable to Willem Dafoe---high compliments & Mr. McGuigan's aura is not typical of usual Hollywood b.s.

Lucy Liu also fitted in perfectly, very cute and perfect for the role of Lyndsey. <br/><br/>Only flaw I could see would be the relationship between Goodcat and Henry/Slevin.

Complex, yet totally understandable plot? Check! A few twist along the way? Check! Funny moments all along? Check! An astonishing art direction? Check! That awesome felling that you are missing something no matter how much attention you are paying to the movie? Dobule check!!<br/><br/>The movie is catching since the first 10 minutes, when Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) gets introduced. From then on, there is no idle moment on the film. You get quickly introduced to Josh Hartnet's character, a Mr. Nobody that is mistaken for someone else and ends up owing favors for two big and confronted Mafia bosses (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley). In the next minutes, we found out that this seems to be Mr. Goodkat's plan from the beginning. And now I'll stop!<br/><br/>If you are a fan of action/adventure films BUT you NEED a good plot, this movie is for you! And also, it's very funny!<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Slevin(Hartnett, in the one good performance of his career so far) has just moved into his friend Nick's apartment when he is mistaken for him, by two rival gangs, both of whom want to collect ""his"" debt to them. One of them, The Rabbi(Kingsley, who ""tought he taw a puttytat"") wants the cash within 48 hours, the other, The Boss(Freeman, who speaks in an incredibly repetitive manner) wants him to knock off(why not hire a complete stranger to kill someone protected by ex-Mossad agents, and who you want to make sure die?) the gay son of the other one, in revenge for his own offspring's recent murder. Unbeknownst to him, Mr. Goodkat(Willis, cool as ever... and yes, the names in this were thought up in about five minutes), the world-class assassin, is in town, and when he's around, people end up dead. So, with the aid of his new neighbour(Liu) he tries to figure out how to deal with all of this. Confused? You don't know the half of it. The tale is actually rather straightforward(and not particularly memorable), once you're told what's going on. It would be fantastic if that occurred more than ten minutes before the end of the excruciating 1 hour, 45 minute running time. Do we need to be able to tell what's going on(and I mean at all, there's nearly nothing in this where you know what is happening, who someone is, why which whatever, and we're given no reason to care) other than retroactively? Perhaps not. In fact, that idea could open up exciting new avenues in storytelling. Obviously, however, we will need something else to justify spending 90 minutes on something that is then explained in a sixth of that time. The lead? Nope, can't be it. We know literally nothing about him, and only find out anything, yeah, you guessed it.Ah, it must be dialog? No, it's a strain on anyone's patience, with lines that try extremely hard at being clever and fall flat on their face. Not only that, there is so much straight meaningless babble in this that you'll miss several of the few actually relevant lines. The slang makes parts difficult to understand, and it's too goofy to take seriously, or for it to establish an environment. Humor? It's terrible, there's maybe one joke(the puns and plays on words are cringe-inducing) that isn't overdone. Frankly, this is quirky(characters, situations, etc.) and contains one twist after another just for the sake of it. Do those qualities pass for interesting traits, and something well-plotted, respectively? Have we forgotten that fiction, mystery and otherwise, is other things than surprising the audience(as this does in every scene, where we literally typically do not know what's going on)? Keeping you guessing is easy(especially when plausibility is not on your list of priorities, as is the case here; there are holes in this, if one even wants to bother exploring it), getting you involved is not, and this puts all of its effort in the former, forgetting the latter even exists. Not only did I not want to learn more about anyone in this, I downright wanted them to be shot, just so they would *shut up*. The stylized cinematography and editing earns this one star above average, on account of there being next to nothing entertaining, enjoyable or engaging in this. There is a bit of bloody, violent, disturbing content, sexuality, nudity(and it puts a lot of energy towards offending several ethnicities, orientations and faiths), and strong language in this. The DVD comes with two commentary tracks(#1: director Paul McGuigan(informational and technical, some will find it dull). #2: Lucy, Josh, and the screenwriter(amusing enough, and it gives background)), a decent making of(13 minutes), 2 unforgivably awful deleted scenes(11 minutes total, if it will feel like ten times that), trailers(this, The Squid and the Whale, 16 Blocks, She's the Man, Arthur and the Minimoys, Stormbreaker, Crazy in Love) and an alternate ending(1 minute). I recommend this to people who need nothing other than to not be aware of what's going on to like something. 6/10"

I love that the plot starts very confusing in the beginning then reveals itself at the end. You could not ask for a better 'all star' cast. Some of the best actors of all time in one movie? You could not ask for more. Anyone that does not understand this movie need to stick to cartoons or reality shows. There was a reason Bruce Willis spoke about 'The Kansas City Shuffel'.

","A victim of mistaken identity, a man finds himself in the position of committing a murder or being killed by underworld figures.

The first half of the film is quite good, with break-neck pacing and witty dialog propelling the story forward, although it is not clear what is going on. Then the plot turns dark as the loose ends are tied and the big pictures starts to become clear; the film also starts to become less fun at this point.

","I love it dearly. Witty, hilarious and incredibly compelling with top-notch performances from the entire cast. I had never been a fan of Josh Hartnett before seeing this film, but he perfectly creates this character and has my eyes glued to him the entire film. The twist is a jaw-dropper and really had me stunned. The entire story has this breezy, slick feel to it that's unlike anything I've ever seen in a film and is something I adore watching over and over. Easily one of the best films of 2006 and certainly one of the most underrated of the past decade. An intelligent,hilarious screenplay combined with the fantastic direction of McGuigan and an incredible cast creates a truly amazing film."
"cchase","8","1","3","1 February 2008"," Darkly Entertaining In Spite Of Itself...
","Thanks in no small part to the juggernaut that was THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the crime film genre developed a whole new subset of 'wisenheimer', noirish capers dripping with as much irony and faux-witty sarcasm as blood and brains, (as in on the wall, not as in the smart kind.) Many of these movies nearly break their own arms patting themselves on the back for their smug cleverness. Common attributes are: low-life gangsters with funny names, people on the wrong side of the tracks who talk sometimes as if they've read too much Sartre or Shakespeare, and double-jointed plot twists that always have that ""Keyser Soze""-style 'GOTCHA!' at the end.<br/><br/>Into the fray, along with films like CRANK, SHOOT 'EM UP and the more superior LAYER CAKE, comes LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Only I'm not going to trash it, number one - because in spite of all the tough-guys-with-a-twist trappings, it's still an admirable little film, and number two - I have a bias I must admit to here. The author of the screenplay, Jason Smilovic, was one of the creative forces behind KAREN SISCO, one of the best detective shows never to be given the chance that it truly deserved, and he gets instant brownie points from me for that reason alone. <br/><br/>SLEVIN, in case you were in a coma and missed the oft-shown trailers when this hit theaters, is one of those 'mistaken identity' scenarios. Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is a poor shlub who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Breezing into town to help a buddy out with a business deal that's not going so well, he finds out how bad things REALLY are when, mistaken for his friend Nick, Slevin becomes embroiled in a deadly game of ""an eye for an eye"" going on between two major underworld players: The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and his former compadre turned bitter enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley). Interested parties include Nick's neighbor and intermittent girlfriend, Lindsey (Lucy Liu in a role that's a far cry from her usual stuff, and a DECENT role at that!), a not-so-honorable cop (Stanley Tucci) and the mysterious ""Mr. Goodkat"" (Bruce Willis), a pro hit-man so badass that nobody even knows what he looks like. <br/><br/>Of course, in the same vein as THE USUAL SUSPECTS, nothing is at all what it seems - not the characters or even the plot itself, yet if you've seen enough of these things, you will know where this is going before it even reaches the halfway mark. At least director Paul McGuigan is savvy enough to just let his cast do their thing, which they do very well, (Freeman plays far too few villains, so this is a treat, and Kingsley will never rival his work in SEXY BEAST, but he keeps it low-key here. And Willis shows why he's becoming such an in-demand specialist in quick but memorable cameos.)<br/><br/>Hartnett does a pretty good job shouldering the lead role, though he sometimes seems so glib and clueless, you get a secret sense of satisfaction as various thugs and members of law enforcement smack him around at the moments that you'd actually like to. (There's a reason for his ""WTF"" attitude, but it's a spoiler, so you'll have to watch the movie to find out where it comes from.)<br/><br/>All-in-all, I've spent more time watching much worse movies. LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN is hardly the next ""USUAL SUSPECTS"" or ""FARGO"", but it'll do on a TV-sluggish Saturday night.<br/><br/>And just for any KAREN SISCO fans out there - keep your eyes peeled for a VIP cameo at the end by one of that show's most endearing players."
"Tim851","6","1","3","30 October 2007"," Pretentious
","Now here is a movie that thinks it is so much smarter than it really is.<br/><br/>It is awfully splintered, the entire first half hour is more a collage of events than it is a film. Very confusing to figure out what all is about. And the last 40 Minutes are spend in flashbacks telling us the ingenious scheme of the movie and how clever it is, but it's not, seen it all before. Highly predictable and therefore very unsatisfying. I really disliked this disruptive storytelling throughout the film.<br/><br/>There is some comedy, although it eventually is a rather dark movie about vengeance. Josh Hartnett delivers a good performance, Freeman and Kingsley are more routine than inspired and Bruce Willis has a very thankless role that could (should) have been filled by someone else. Lucy Liu is very charming as usual."

Its hard to imagine at times that this was brilliantly played by Josh Hartnett and Lucy Lui, interestingly changing her character to a lovable-bubbly type of girl than most of the cold-bitched up type characters she usually does.<br/><br/>This film is intriguing in its own world filled with a breathtaking script that leaves you wonder how this ain't one of the greatest films ever made. <br/><br/>I am not gonna give anything away, because I strongly recommend you to watch this, if not own it on DVD (what the hell are you waiting for!!!)<br/><br/>A MUST SEE"

(I don't think I've ever noticed wallpaper in a movie until seeing this one. I find that interesting.) The two penthouse office/apartment sets were amazing. Beyond the sets, this was a finely done movie, in general. The story, although a bit predictable, was one of the better suspense stories I've seen. The music and camera work added a great deal to the overall style, as well.

","For a chick who hates blood, cussing and extreme violence this movie was probably the last type of movie I would choose to go see if I had been aware of the genre. My husband bought home the DVD and stuck it on and I before I even had time to look over the cover I was deeply immersed in the plot and Josh of course. What a great movie and proving once again it's often the ones that sneak onto the screen that make no fuss that are the most interesting and special (ie. 28 Days later). The cast were all perfect in their roles but I especially enjoyed Josh H. who looked absolutely irresistible with his broken nose, Bruce Willis who never fails to disappoint and Lucy Lui who was very natural in this role. The way the film was shot was also interesting and not your usual slick, Hollywood palate pleaser stuff. An interesting approach, a clever plot and an absolutely fantastic cast. Go and see it if you like to think outside the box a little!!!"
"Turriff","8","1","3","6 November 2006"," New York Movie with an L. A. Feel...
","That seems to be the best way to describe this particular film. I've thought about it for days, and that really seems to be the best.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin comes out of the gates strong and never really lets up.<br/><br/>Slevin's New York-ness comes from its location (no-brainer, guys), which while self evident is important. Movies that are set in New York always have a certain urban panache that is unrivaled. While its true that I couldn't find (or remember) and proof that the city in Slevin is in fact New York (shot in Montreal), it still looks and feels like New York. Subject also plays a role, as the gangster motif can't help but invoke feelings of the New York mob scene.<br/><br/>Art direction take the film across the continental us, and leaves it firmly in L.A. Visually, the movie feels more like the Elmore Leonard movies than anything else. Pacing, interior decoration and the humour all seem to have the west coast feel, standing in contrast to the east coast elements.<br/><br/>This in no way detracts form the movie, which is by far one of the better films I can remember watching recently. Some people don't like the surprise plots, where the clues add up and the twist is revealed. Some people figure it out to early, some people never figure it out at all. I think if you don't try to hard, though, this film does the twist well. Sit back, and enjoy the show. Follow along, but try not to jump the gun. I think it'll be more fun that way.<br/><br/>Technically, this film plays out well. Some of the camera work is superb, a bit noir by times, but not always static and close. The interior sets are sumptuous and stylized, but not to the point of absurdity. Bold prints and vibrant colors dominate, making the film a really beauty visually.<br/><br/>Cast, lead by Hartnett, is fantastic. His performance is spot on. Cool, calm and collected, with just the hind of stupid innocence that makes the whole character work. Kingsley and Freeman bring years of experience to their character. Watching such seasoned actors is alway a joy. Liu is good in her role as romantic interest, and Willis is picture perfect as a contract killer.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that I just can't not like. This film is excellent on several levels. Dialogue is good, production value is high, set design, cast, camera...<br/><br/>I haven't quite got my new, reformed rating system off the ground yet, but it will involve a series criteria for a film that will influence the final mark depending on how well the film meets them. I think that this one would do well by any set, although I heard form some that it was two violent. I don't agree, but hey...<br/><br/>My girlfriend loved it, talked about it for days.<br/><br/>Must see for fans of the genre, Great movie all around."
"nobbytatoes","6","1","3","5 November 2006"," a great mystery, yet not a wholly effective film
","In the wrong place, wrong time, Slevin has had bad luck constantly struck him. Moving to stay with his friend Nick Fisher, Slevin becomes entangled in a debt held by Fisher. Selvin is mistaken to be Fisher, who owes debts to two crime bosses; The Boss and The Rabbi. Fisher owes money too both, yet caught in the problem, Slevin is forced to kill The Rabbi's son, revenge for The Boss. Circling around in the shadows of both bosses is assassin Goodkat, who seems to be setting Slevin up. Helping to solve Slevin's problem is Lindsey; the girl next door.<br/><br/>The Wrong Man (Australian release title), runs under a false misapprehension. A look at the trailer would have you believe this is a quirky, jazzy, gangster flick; great laughs to be held. Instead The Wrong Man is a much darker tale of coincidence, mistaken identity and retribution. That's not too say there isn't comedy, there are touches of humour spread through this story; just don't expect full out hilarity.<br/><br/>The Wrong Man has a smash up of influences; pulpy Tarantino dialog with touches of Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Payback. The most distinctive part of The Wrong Man is it's dialog. Writer Jason Smilovic has cleverly tried to created fast paced, pulpy dialog, yet never reaches the effectiveness of Tarantino or its ambitions. It lacks a lot of subtlety and the intellectual stability to keep it captivating. Conversations run around in circles, never going anywhere; where's the focus and cohesiveness. Smilovic wants to bite you with forked tongued wit, but lacks the teeth.<br/><br/>Patience is a virtue. A virtue needed for The Wrong Man takes time to focus itself, from a very muddled beginning. The mystery surrounding all the characters and their part in the overall scheme takes awhile for pieces to start clicking; similar to the dialog, it is abit of a run around for some time. Misdirection is used exceedingly well by director Paul McGuigan; as Goodkat said, when everyone is looking to the right, you should be looking to the left. McGuigan really gets into the guts of the story post mid-point, but pushes the line to far with too many twists in quick succession. When the darker elements are finally injected, you start to feel its grip dragging you in; but too little to late.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is cool and collected as Goodkat, walking in the shadows and behind his mystery plan. Josh Hartnett is at his best as Slevin, constantly holding his down trodden character in good esteem. Lucy Liu is beautiful as innocent Lindsey, jumping in head first to help Slevin's problem. Morgan Freeman not near his best, yet still strong. Ben Kingsley takes lead from his character Don Logan from Sexy Beast, toning Don's sheer vulgarity for a head strong Rabbi.<br/><br/>While The Wrong Man does run around in circles for some time, when it finally heads in a clear direction, a great, dark mystery can be found to unravel."
"MrVibrating","7","1","3","31 October 2006"," Solid movie with clever script...not terribly entertaining though
","Smilovic's script is undoubtedly the strongest part of ""Lucky Number Slevin""(in case you're wondering ""why the retarded name?"" the explanation is in the movie). It's wholly based on twists and turns, with the more and more tiresome(but still working) ""look-at-all-the-clues-you'll-only-notice-in-the-second-viewing"" revelation at the end. The problem with such a script, of course, is that the movie has to be pretty damn good for you to want to watch it again. Lucky Number Slevin isn't that good.<br/><br/>The actors are all big names, but none of them are giving it what they really got. It was nice seeing Lucy Lui in a role not totally stereotype, as usually happens to her. Morgan Freeman was a gangster, but still his usual jovial self, nothing new under the sky here, except a momentary emotional outburst at the end of the movie. Harnett was pretty forgettable, along with the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Directing is professional, camera-work too, with nothing to complain about. The sets and location are well-chosen, which is something you don't usually notice. Music is pretty bland, there's strings when you should be sad, and some more strings.<br/><br/>This is worth seeing in the cinema or renting, but nothing you'll want to watch more than once or twice."
"oneill_nx","9","1","3","16 October 2006"," Incredible
","Yes, incredible is right because this movie was individual, smart, funny and downright...incredible. OK, so Josh Hartnet, one for the ladies maybe, but he doesn't fail to impress as the supposedly arrogant and lippy Unlucky Slevin, who, by an unfortunate twist in fate, ends up in the middle of war being plotted by two violent gang lords; The Boss and The Rabbi - the excellent Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu is also at her best as 'the girl next door', whose zany hyperactive behaviour offers amusement and, my new word, lovability. Slevin, despite his dark secret, unwittingly falls for her innocent charm, which seems to erase any thoughts of his dangerous predicament.<br/><br/>And there is, as promised, Bruce Willis; who captures the essence of a hardened 'world-class assassin' called Mr. Goodkat. The character is expertly presented by the often stereotyped Willis, who leaves behind his macho, hard-talking, gun-blasting vigilante-like Die Hard - whom this character could very well have imitated - and creates the subtle, quiet-spoken hit-man who's cooler that the North Pole.<br/><br/>The plot is also a highlight, with so many amazing twists that the story becomes more enjoyable as it continues. Couple this with the amazing cinematography - flashback scenes mingled with present time situation, and a healthy use of vibrant colour and patterns - and you have one heck of a film which delights in it's own intelligence, and is unjustly criticised because of it.<br/><br/>In an age where films are beginning to dumb down for the supposedly stupid audience, i think everyone should stand up and applaud a very versatile, funny and often moving story of mistaken identity in which the viewer is never left feeling like they got the simplest version of events."
"zetes","7","1","3","2 October 2006"," Fun, if a tad predictable
","This suffers somewhat in comparison to Brick, which I watched for the second time right before I saw Slevin. Like Brick, it's a noir / crime flick that attempts stylized dialogue. The dialogue in Slevin succeeds at being clever and entertaining. Unfortunately, the film itself never feels as weighty as Brick. It shoots only for coolness, where Brick has more of a soul. Still, that doesn't mean that Slevin is worthless. Far from it. It's actually very entertaining. Josh Hartnett makes up for his terrible 2006 performance in The Black Dahlia. He's very good here; people who don't believe he has talent should see this. Lucy Liu is gorgeous, and she delivers her dialogue with appropriate slickness. A lot of the pleasure comes from her and Hartnett simply interacting. Bruce Willis, Stanely Tucci, Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are all good, too. The twisty story is fairly predictable. It's still fun, though."
"dfranzen70","7","1","3","28 September 2006"," More or less hits the mark; Hartnett a surprise
","Poor Slevin Kelevra (Josh Hartnett). He's just lost his girlfriend and his job, and when he jets to New York to stay with a friend for a while, he finds himself mistaken for his now-missing friend by the heads of two crime syndicates, each of whom wants to use Slevin for their own nefarious purposes.<br/><br/>On the one hand, there's The Boss (Morgan Freeman). Seems Nick, Slevin's missing bud, owes The Boss a lot of money. The Boss knows Slevin's not Nick, but what can he do? Slevin's just in the wrong place (Nick's apartment) at the wrong time (the present). The Boss also knows Slevin has no money, so he offers to forgive Nick's debt to Slevin (i.e., not kill Slevin, which is important) if Slevin does a little favor for him. That favor, of course, is killing the son of The Boss's biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>The Rabbi, meanwhile, tells Slevin that Nick owes him money, too, and he gives Slevin a short time to come up with the cash. So now Slevin has to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars and kill someone. Good thing he's not alone; Nick's neighbor, the vivacious Lindsey (Lucy Liu), concerned about Nick's absence, helps Slevin investigate and contemplate. Also thrown into the mix is a double-dealing hit man named Goodkat (Bruce Willis); no filme noirish movie would be complete without one.<br/><br/>The movie feels a little perplexing for the first three-quarters, but then all of a sudden Things Make Sense. And not in a contrived, force-fed sense, either; it all falls into place. That's one of the debits of the movie, though; there aren't loose ends, there aren't endless possibilities, there aren't nebulous motives, and so forth. It's all too blunt, too black-and-white without even a hint of gray sneaking in from the side.<br/><br/>Hartnett's not bad at all, though, which surprised me a great deal. I've always thought of him as a squinty-eyed dim bulb, frankly. He just seemed like a Big Dumb Guy, kind of like Ben Affleck. But Hartnett turns in a pretty amiable performance in the lead role, although the role was written as a little too glib for my tastes. (Slevin's nonchalant, unserious attitude seems more off-putting and distracting than colorful, even if it's partially explained later on.) Praise should go to an able supporting cast, especially the adorable Liu and the trenchant Freeman. Stanley Tucci, who plays a detective trying to sort out the mess, is also superb as always, as is Kingsley. Even Willis, who by now can do these roles in his sleep, manages to inject some life into his rather low-key scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie - despite its cumbersome title - is a bit better than I expected. The plot is fairly solid and believable, and the movie is well cast, even in the key role of the titular Slevin."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","1","3","24 September 2006"," Intricate, involving, thought provoking, and interesting - one of the best of 2006
","Lucky Number Slevin is one of the best mystery thrillers to come out in a long time. I highly enjoyed it because of the originality behind it, the wonderful writing (Jason Smilovic), and because Josh Hartnett finally delivered in a performance. Paul McGuigan directs this crime/thriller/mystery to near perfection. With a brilliant cast, it's definitely one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Slevin (Hartnett) is not really having the best of days. After arriving in New York, he finds himself accidentally tangled in a web of problems involving him with the two biggest crime lords in NYC, The Boss (Oscar Winner Morgan Freeman) and The Rabbi (Oscar Winner Sir Ben Kingsley). Add in a mysterious and ruthless assassin (Golden Globe Winner Bruce Willis), a nosy detective (Stanley Tucci), and a cute neighbor (Lucy Lui), Slevin has a very full plate for the next few days.<br/><br/>Let me start with the lead actor, Josh Hartnett. For so long, we've been waiting for this 'next big star' to break out, and he finally delivers in L#S. He makes Slevin cool, likable, and just straight up bad-ass...all those factors make Slevin one of the coolest characters of the year. Freeman and Kingsley give another pair of great performances, not surprisingly, as does Willis. With L#S, it's 3 great films in a row for Willis, with Sin City and 16 Blocks being the others. Lucy Lui is likable as Slevin's neighbor, and she and Hartnett seem to have nice chemistry as they work well together. I didn't really like Stanley Tucci's character, but that doesn't mean he was bad. He did his job in making his character one that you don't really care for that much.<br/><br/>I simply loved Jason Smilovic's writing. It's simply brilliant, providing all kinds of twists and turns, making it all come together in the end, much like you've just untangled a quadruple knotted shoelace. Only veteran moviegoers will be able to predict Smilovic's excellent writing. This is the strongest point of the film. Paul McGuigan's direction is good, but nowhere near Smilovic's writing. McGuigan does the thing that most directors had problems with: getting the best out of Josh Hartnett. McGuigan's scenes are nicely cut, but I wish he would have made The Boss's room a little more modern. I think it was supposed to be like it was for the character, but I think most will agree that the boss's room looks odd in 2006. Except that chess set.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a true winner, one of the best crime thrillers in years, with an unthinkable twist at the end that rivals those of 'Saw' and 'Memento'. I highly enjoyed it, and I know I'll see it several more times. I recommend you see it too. Due to the sometimes graphic sexual content and some language, this film shouldn't be seen by anyone under 16.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"
"thomasmorrisiv","8","1","3","24 September 2006"," ""Slevin"" delivers in all the right places
","I've had to watch this film three times to be prepared to write this review, because the nuances are far too numerous to catch in one viewing. There are any number of praises I could give ""Lucky Number Slevin"" right from the beginning.<br/><br/>Director Paul McGuigan seems to have come out of nowhere, having only a handful of unimpressive and unnoticed films under his belt before ""Slevin."" The film's pacing is deliberate and unapologetic, but at no point does it feel rushed. McGuigan takes time and does a beautiful job letting the plot's secrets unfold, at no expense to the stylishness of the characters or the freshness of the dialogue. He gives the audience's intelligence credit, always only giving just enough information without being vague.<br/><br/>Cynics have labeled green screen-writer Jason Smilovic's script for the movie as ""Tarantino-esque"" but in fact the product is quite different. While Tarantino's dialogue shifts smoothly between being almost excessively cool and shockingly graphic, Smilovic remains down-to-earth and realistic. At the same time, he writes rich, fascinating characters, most of whom seem to have been cast perfectly from some higher power.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu is completely adorable in a role which only faintly gives off the aroma of Natalie Portman's in ""Garden State."" Stanley Tucci is solid as usual as the dirty cop, and Bruce Willis continues to impress me with the interesting film choices he makes, turning in an excellent performance as the mysterious assassin. Josh Hartnett is everything you could want in a leading man; don't be fooled by the boyish good looks, the man can act, and he is perfectly suited for this role.<br/><br/>The real show-stealers, however are Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley as the rival gang lords. Initially I was skeptical about Freeman as a villain, because ever since ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" he has been type-cast as a kindly grandfather-like figure. I was pleasantly surprised though. He retains his genial quality but at the same time you can sense a menacing streak within his character. Kingsley is a joy to behold as well, and when the two veteran actors finally share the screen, it's as if you're watching a stage-play.<br/><br/>It's hard to find anything wrong with this film. Its genre is so ambiguous that you truly find yourself having no idea what comes next, and it is a breath of fresh air. The score by composer J. Ralph sets the tone beautifully and Peter Sova's cinematography is on par with if not beyond that of Conrad Hall (""American Beauty,"" ""Road to Perdition""). Frankly, there is something in this movie for everyone, and unless strong violence makes you squeamish, I strongly recommend it to any film-lover."

","Something was wrong with this movie. I really expected it to be excellent, but I was disappointed. I expected it to have a lot more style, but it didn't have it. I expected it to be funnier, but it wasn't. The plot was very good. It was smart. The twist was good. But the biggest problem was what happened after the reveal. It spoon-fed everything to you. It showed you every scene that you'd want to look at twice over again. So, instead of how Usual Suspects so excellently just showed you a quick montage of all of the things that you'd like to review, this movie actually spends half an hour on that ""montage"". You see everything so clearly that there's nothing left for you to guess about, or imagine, or think about. And it gives you no reason to want to watch it again. And showing how the girl really doesn't get killed? That just cuts against the intelligence and the bond of Mr. Goodkat and Slevin... With a re-cut, much tighter ending, this maybe could have been the suspense movie it was trying to be."

The big untouchable bosses have just two henchmen each, which unless I missed some big, poignant statement, that's just silly. Still, it was like an amusement park ride you knew was going to take a turn, you could see the turn up ahead, but what you cannot see is the drop, loops, and rises that come after that turn.

Fast, Witty and funny dialogue really make the 2 hours fly in. The plot, granted, was confusing in the middle, but everything came together perfectly towards the end. Perfect casting throughout, Liu and Freeman and Kingsley all give some fine performances, Hartnett suits being the protagonist with all odds against him and Bruce Willis breaks from the mould of playing the same character in every damn film he's in, so he gets points for that.

","If you take two great established actors as opposing heads of gangster families, add in another handful of successful established movie actor with an intriguing script and unorthodox direction, you are likely to get an intriguing and interesting movie. Yet adding all those elements up don't seem to work for this film.<br/><br/>The film centres around a man who is charged by two sets of gangsters as owing them money for gambling debts, even though he is the wrong man, and the only way out of it is to pay off the debts by doing a hit job! Add in another layer of a mystery (sic!) hit-man stealthily chasing after him also, plus a nosey lovable female neighbour and you have an increasingly complicated outline to the movie. But its not complicated, and the direction of the movie follows in a diluted form of what ""The Usual Suspects"" was like even when you take in the inevitable twists into account.<br/><br/>The story is nonsense, and the acting is generally not above par, not that it really requires it. Ben Kingsley is wonderful as ever, but Morgan Freeman doesn't look like he wants to be there. Lucy Liu is also only there as a silly love interest, not convincing either, plus else there would have been no female role in the movie without her (excusing the unnecessary sex scenes of the other women earlier in the movie)! Its not all a bad movie, just the clever writing is not clever enough to want a second viewing. Maybe some further work with more editing and input could have tightened up the movie and maybe it harder hitting, but then again maybe a lighter movie was what was happened. Another missed opportunity of a movie, but not by any stretch a terrible movie. Enjoyable, but no more than that."

Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are the two bad guys and play their respective roles with relish, Morgan Freeman as a bad guy? Horrors! Stanley Tucci has the sexiest role he's ever played and predictably goes out with a bang. Lucy Liu excels as a sweet female lead, with none of the kick-ass attitude she usually has.

"Robert_Hearth","5","1","4","6 November 2006"," ""My Name's Goodkat. You Can Call Me Mr. Goodkat."" --- Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis)
","""Lucky Number Slevin"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Paul McGuigan <br/><br/>Starring: Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, & Stanley Tucci <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for strong violence, sexuality and language) <br/><br/>I must admit that this is the trickiest review I have had to write thus far. On one hand, ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a well-made film, well-acted with just the right amount of gleam and polish. On the other, I just didn't enjoy it. I could only care for one character, Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and she seemed to be a tad underused. The plot uses a few too many cheap twists to keep the audience going and the dialog is overly-intellectual in all the wrong places. I felt as if the entire movie was just an artificial, two-dimensional exercise in style over substance. It was convoluted and deeply pretentious. It was as though the entire movie was made to give the filmmakers an outlet for them to point and laugh at the audience with cheers of, ""Ha! We're smarter than you"". And, clearly, they are, as I was watching the movie and as I am writing this review right now. Still, I cannot dismiss this movie completely and I will tell you why.<br/><br/>A case of mistaken identity leads Slevin (Hartnett) directly into the middle of a bitter battle between two of the world's most powerful crime bosses: The Rabbi (Kinglsey) and The Boss (Freeman). Detective Brikowski (Tucci) is on the case, constantly trying to decipher just who Slevin is and why he seems to be hanging around with the Boss so much. On top of this, a specialist assassin named Mister Goodkat (Willis) has also been brought in by both crime bosses. Throw in a talkative, but cute-as-a-button coroner named Lindsey (Liu) to act as a love interest for Slevin, a fixed horserace, and a tangled web of suspicion, lies, and deceit, and you have ""Lucky Number Slevin"". The plot seems as though it could be a fun ride and, to some extent, it is. The problem is that, because the characters, for the most part, are either dull or evil, there really is no one main character to relate to. Who is the bad guy? Well, everybody, except for the aforementioned Lindsey, is. We are meant to be rooting for Slevin, I suppose, but, as his character reveals a huge twist about himself near the end, it is very hard to get on solid ground with him. Everyone else is a crime lord, an assassin, or a mindless goon.<br/><br/>The entire time I was watching this movie, I kept thinking about ""Brick""--a movie to which I awarded seven out of ten stars and a letter grade of a B+. If you have not yet read my review, then I suggest that you do, as these films both suffered from the some of the same problems. In both, I felt strangely detached from the characters. Who can care for people that are just hollow shelves of other characters? In ""Brick"", the other characters were from an old-fashioned noir mystery (much like ""The Maltese Falcon"", etc.). Here, the characters seem to have fashioned out of those made famous by Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" (a movie that, not surprisingly, is mentioned within the context of the movie). I still maintain my statement (that I made in my review of ""Brick"") that I respect this technique. Unfortunately, neither of the films did it flawlessly. Both lacked the emotion and the heart of the characters. The end result was a dull, couldn't-care-less kind of feelingand I hate that feeling.<br/><br/>When ""Lucky Number Slevin"" was over, I was glad--not because it was a bad movie, but because I just didn't particularly care what happened. I had never developed any emotional connections with the characters, aside from Lindsey (I guess I should just say now that, when discussing the characters in a negative manner, I am always excluding her unless mentioned otherwise). All of the characters (please include that implied line here) could have been blown to smithereens by a rocket that could have been fired from Martians and, not only would I not have cared, I would have probably believed that this was highly-plausible--not because it is, but because this movie is good at what it is: a con. It cons you into thinking that this could all be true with its allusions to the film that obviously inspired it (i.e. ""North by Northwest"") and its self-knowing attitude. It seems to acknowledge the fact that it is completely ridiculous and that seems to make it okay, much like ""Scream"" did (except without the bitter satire, sarcasm, and the engaging characters). I have no idea what rating to give this movie and yet I know that I must to maintain the format that has been working so beautifully up until this point. If I went on my personal opinion, it would get a solid four. If I went on how effective the movie is, then I would give it a five. Because, it is effective enoughI just resented the effect that it did have. But, as this wasn't a bad movie, I will put aside my personal feelings and award it with an average five.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is an okay watch, even though it lacks engaging characters and has a self-indulgent attitude about itself.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)"

","I went into this movie not knowing anything about it, not even the broadest details of the plot. It didn't take long to figure out the entire plot, including the ""twists"". I really didn't like the constant ""why is he called the Rabbi/why is he called the Boss"", ""Because he's a rabbi/ because he's the boss"" schtick. This is what passes for 'hip' dialogue these days. I did not like this movie at all, it offered no surprises, and even good acting couldn't save this movie from being predictable. I didn't come to that conclusion until the end though, as I kept giving the movie the benefit of the doubt, thinking ""oh that's too obvious, there has to be more to it than that"". Well, there wasn't, the movie ended exactly as I had predicted it would 10 minutes into watching it. If you're good at guessing games, pass this one by. If you're terrible at figuring out puzzles, maybe your experience will be closer to the multitudes who've posted how 'wonderful' this movie supposedly is."

","Note, this review contains plot elements and spoilers, so don't read it if you want to remain in the dark.<br/><br/>First to set the record straight, I LOVED the first half to two-thirds of this movie, the mistaken identity plot line, Morgan and Ben's characters and the light humour and scooby-doo style investigation by Lucy Liu's character. But whilst the writer did have some strong ideas they seem to have run out and he just slapped on a twist ending, before going back to the start of the script to add in Bruce Willis' first scene to tie it all together (indeed what is the POINT of BW in this film? aside from standing around in a trench coat and just repeating bits of Last Man Standing?).<br/><br/>One plot hole that reveals this is the Kansas City Shuffle itself. Nick Baker may have needed to be unavailable for the long con to work, but they didn't need his body for the hit on the Fairy. Swapping watches and burning the body to make out that it was Slevin's was made pointless as he instantly reappeared the very next scene and even ""connected"" with the Policeman who'd been on his back. The job looked like a job so no body was needed to make it not look like a job.<br/><br/>This is not one of those films that you watch three or four times and see clues and revelations each time, sure they're probably there (most are shown at the end anyway) but like i said, most of it is actually good fun and lucy liu is the cutest girl you could possibly ever want to live across the hall from, i'd go as far as to say this is her sexiest role to date because of that.<br/><br/>Conclusion: OK for a Saturday night in, but make it the first film you watch that night"

","Reviewing films encourages following the opinions of fellow reviewers whose thoughts nail movies dead center: often reading reviews by certain reviewers encourages or discourages this reviewer regarding a controversial film. Reading some thoughts about how particularly disappointing this film almost precludes watching it: happily a coincidence encouraged viewing such a film that for this viewer was fascinating and satisfying.<br/><br/>The production crew of this thriller worked overtime to make a style: the film is filled with metaphorical circles in the wallpaper, the decor, the steps, the room designs - each pointing a sturdy finger to the story's meaning from the very beginning. But along the way the writing and pacing of this high-octane film zoom past the eye with twists, turns, interlocked relationships, and character development that waits for the end for the payoff. To say more would probably alter the good chase fun the movie provides in its ending.<br/><br/>The film is one of the bloodiest and goriest of the season, but it all serves the purpose of exposing crime at its pinnacle. The good guys are difficult to separate from the bad guys in this case of mistaken identity that spurs mayhem. But the cast is at all times stylishly active: Josh Harnett, Lucy Liu, Danny Aiello, Morgan Freeman, Sir Ben Kingsley, Stanley Tucci, Kevin Chamberlin, Dorian Missick, Mykelti Williamson, and of course Bruce Willis. There are some holes in the plot but the action is so well paced that they are inconsequential, and for this viewer the end justifies the means.

The film starts out in 1979 with a hit on an inconsequential gambler and his family. Later you find out what that's all about, but its not too hard to guess. Excellent cast and acting.

The crime lords are The Boss(Morgan Freeman)and The Rabbi(Ben Kingsley): Slevin is in a position of being forced to doing ""a job"" for each against the other.

","Kudos to Paul McGuigan for directing one of the finest slight-of-hand movies of the year. A second viewing of this flick made me realize how painstakingly obvious the major plot elements were, but my initial viewing had me constantly scratching my head.<br/><br/>McGuigan includes a couple of scenes early in the movie that would ordinarily not be missed if they were omitted. However, their inclusion leaves the viewer wondering what importance they have. After a viewing of the movie, one realizes that these scenes' only importance was to make one wonder what their importance was.<br/><br/>Add to this outstanding slight of hand the terrific acting by an ensemble of truly outstanding performers. Morgan Freeman gives a riveting performance, as does Josh Hartnett. Bruce Willis, a man who I thought was a great actor mired in a myriad of terrible films, finally finds a film that gives his acting prowess justice. Lucy Liu and Ben Kingsley round out a cast that leaves little to be desired.<br/><br/>The movies one weakness is simply the fact that when we add up all of the elements, it is simply a theme that has been done over and over again. So, with a poor score given to originality, the rest of the aspects of this film really round it out. Not a must see, but any devout movie goer will not be disappointed."

","I had the unnerving experience of watching this and ""The Salton Sea"" on the same day - I don't recommend it, not a good combination!!Both are far too off the wall. However that bit of bad programming to one side, this film is an interesting piece of black whimsy. I enjoyed it (despite Sir Ben's somewhat OTT acting)though I had figured out the crux of the film during the initial flashback sequence to the horse race and the subsequent killing of the unlucky gambler, his wife and young son. If you like lots of shootings and dead bodies in your thrillers then this film is for you. The story hinges around a bad case of mistaken identity, or does it? As I say I'd sussed it out in the first ten minutes! As a piece of film-making this is an interesting effort but not a great effort. However Josh Hartnet was a revelation, I had no idea he was as good as that; Lucy Liu is also very good. And she and Hartnet bounce well off one another. The film is worth seeing if only for all the vomitary and migraneous wallpaper: straight out of the sixties. Loved also both the direct and indirect references to that great Cary Grant film ""North by Northwest"". The last ten minutes of the film are spent explaining how it all worked. Again I really didn't require any explanation but it was done so entertainingly I didn't mind being patronised. Bruce Willis did what Bruce Willis does best, i.e. being quietly menacing. Slevin may be no George Kaplan or Nick Fisher for that matter but he is an oddly engaging character. This is not the best film you ever likely to see, but it is fun and a great way to spend a miserable February afternoon. P.S. Don't ask a stranger what a Kansas City Shuffle is, that'd be definitely a bad move."

The movie's ""universe"" is well constructed, the story is stringently told in a way that keeps you enjoying what you are watching, and the overall atmosphere and coolness is entertaining, not embarrassing.<br/><br/>Also, the guys have done a good job in casting the characters. Bruce Willis is playing pretty much the same guy as in The Whole Nine Yards and The Jackal - which is a good thing in my view, because he is pretty good in these roles. Josh Hartnett is a (surprisingly) credible lead, Lucy Liu is lovely as always if you go for Asian girls, and I just like to see Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley being the cool bad guys (they have played this numerous times before, too). Even the supporting characters are fun to watch.<br/><br/>In short, not the most original movie of all times, but a pretty save bet for a good time seeing guys at work who know what they do (again...)"

","Sure Quentin is the king of this fast paced style of wham-bam movies, but can't anyone come up with a new take on his style that doesn't look like it's stolen? This movie, along with Stay, Smokin Aces, Boondock Saints, etc. all try to rip off Quentin's style but don't add any substance. Sure, lots of violence and a twisted plot look great on paper, but the delivery falls flat as hell. There are so many plot holes and unbelievable twists that 20 minutes into the movie my wife looked at me and said ""bleh, drivel"", and I had to agree with her. She fell asleep while I waited for it to make the smallest bit of sense, but it continued to be totally unbelievable right up to the end. I give the director props for trying, but if you rate this movie higher than a 5, you really need to watch more movies."

","Thought that this was okay...it goes through highs and lows of being really really engrossing and then into a bit of a lull. I may be slightly biased towards the duller side however I think that Josh Hartnet is an appalling actor and he spoilers every movie that he's in. I'm also not keen on Lucy Lu so this probably isn't the best movie choice for me anyhow.<br/><br/>In saying that Bruce Willis manages to get both the crap actors through this movie and it keeps you watching even if it is a tad predictable...I'm not someone who saw the Sixth Sense twist coming but believe me I saw this one in the making after the first 25 mins. Don't get me wrong though this is a decent enough movie and is definitely worth watching at least once."

","Kay well Slevin is having a very very bad day. He goes down on his luck and eventually is pulled into a gang war that he isn't even supposed to be remotely involved in. To top that a very high profile assassin is involved. What will happen to our hero? Will his bad luck last forever? I like thing simple at times but then again there are times when a movie's complexity impresses me. This is a movie that has a very complex plot and nothing is as it seems. The acting is very nice and it is always nice to see some of the big names like Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis strut their stuff in this film. If you are really into the action I apologize as it is mostly talk and speculation but still it is a very good movie and there are still plenty of bodies that pile up.

"wolfmano23","10","1","6","13 September 2006"," Kansas City Shuffle
","The film opens in an anonymous bus station where Goodkat, talking to a seemingly random individual, begins to tell the story of a Kansas city shuffle. He tells of a series of events back in 1979 when rumors of a fixed horse race prompt several people, including a working class family man, to make a large bet on the horse in the hopes of changing their lives. However, the drugged horse, instead of effortlessly outstripping the others, has a heart attack right in the middle of the race. With no money to pay off the debt he owed to the mob, and since the mob had found out about the fix, the working man, his bookie, his wife, and his son are ordered to be put to death to send a message to others in the gambling society.<br/><br/>The film flashes back to the present day, when a young man named Slevin (Josh Hartnett), brought to town by care of his friend, is mugged while walking to his friend Nick's apartment. When he arrives he finds that the door is open and his friend is missing. While settling into the apartment (wearing only a towel) he meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and together they concoct the notion that his missing friend has in fact not gone out, but has been kidnapped, and that it is up to them to play amateur sleuths.<br/><br/>Just after she leaves to go to work, Slevin is forcibly taken (still wearing only a towel) to the office of powerful mob boss known as The Boss (Morgan Freeman), who has mistaken Slevin for his missing friend and is looking to collect on a large debt. As the only man in his organization who knew what Slevin's friend looked like was recently killed, the Boss has no reason not to think Slevin is, in fact, his friend Nick.<br/><br/>The Boss is willing to forgive the debt if Slevin agrees to murder the son of the rival mob boss known as The Rabbi (Kingsley), (so called, ""because he's a rabbi""). The son is known as the Fairy - everyone knows about his homosexuality except his father. The Boss wants to have ""the Fairy"" killed in order to seek revenge upon the Rabbi for the recent murder of his own son. The Boss gives Slevin 24 hours to consider his options. Later in the film it is revealed that the Boss hired professional killer Goodkat to kill the Fairy, but the Boss agreed with Goodkat's proposal to have the killing done by Slevin, after which Goodkat would kill Slevin, in such a way that it would look like a suicide pact of two gay lovers, forcing the Rabbi to forgo the criminal war that would inevitably happen if he felt that the Boss was behind the death of the Fairy.<br/><br/>Soon after Slevin returns to his apartment he is taken by some goons to meet the Rabbi (who resides in a penthouse building right across the street from The Boss; the rivals are former friends and ""business"" associates). The Rabbi also mistakes Slevin for Nick; he wants Slevin to kill the Boss and come up with a large sum of money to pay off a debt. Slevin returns to his apartment, and confides about his situation to Lindsay. Lindsay has gotten a cell phone photo of the mysterious hit-man named 'Mr. Goodkat' (Willis), who is also seen in the shadows of both mob bosses. As Slevin reluctantly plans to murder the Fairy, he is accosted and watched by the police, and also thugs from both crime families, who have mistaken him for either a moron or a new professional hit-man. Meanwhile the sleuthing with Lindsay brings them closer together as passionate lovers.<br/><br/>The end of the film reveals that the whole story is about avenging the 1979 horse racing incident. At the time, when Slevin (called Henry) was a small boy, his parents were murdered by gangsters - among them both ""The Boss,"" ""The Rabbi,"" and the police detective. Goodkat was hired to kill Slevin, because no one else would take the job. Instead of killing the young boy, he took him in and raised him.<br/><br/>Grown-up Slevin and Goodkat make an elaborate plan to get close to both the Rabbi and the Boss. For this purpose, Slevin takes the identity of Nick Fisher, who owes a debt to both bosses' bookies. Fisher is murdered by Goodkat, as shown in the beginning of the film, and Slevin kills the son of the Boss, so that the Boss will hire Goodkat for revenge. Slevin fakes his own mugging so he cannot be properly identified, and has both bookies killed, stealing their books in the process. According to the plan discussed with the Boss, Slevin has a date with the Fairy, and kills him. This is a turning point in the film, since until then Slevin seemed friendly and naive, and not at all inclined to kill someone. Goodkat, instead of killing Slevin, kills the two bodyguards who storm in. Nick Fisher's body, which Goodkat has taken with him after murdering Fisher, is used in place of Slevin's - after Slevin and Goodkat detonate a bomb, Nick's body is burned beyond recognition. The Boss is not very satisfied, because ""the job was not supposed to look like a job"". Slevin and Goodkat kill a number of bodyguards, tie up the Boss and the Rabbi together, and finally Slevin takes the ultimate revenge, killing the two in the same way his father was killed, by suffocation in a plastic bag. In the end the whole story about the Boss and the Rabbi killing is told to the Police officer by another officer. It is then we realise that the cop was also involved in murdering Henry's mother. Slevin is hidden in the car during the conversation and he kills the cop."

","This really was an amazing movie. I've read a few other comments and I don't exactly agree with them. Yea, Hartnett didn't fit the character of what the viewer is Supposed to believe about him at first. He was putting on an act inside his acting career if you get what I'm saying. Once you understand his true identity, his previous goofy, ignorant character ties into the plot...therefore, making the whole plot ingenious. If anyone loves the classic films of the 30s through 50's of true film noir, then you will absolutely love this movie. Twists like film noir x 10...along with witty dialog. It was actually a pretty funny movie too. Hartnett plays such a smart-ass, so there's bound to be some funny stuff i guess. read some of the quotes on here if you want a preview i guess."

","Yes, this was a good movie. Of course, what movie isn't good that has Sir Ben Kingsly in it!? Then the easy reader himself was also in this movie. Yes, Morgan Freeman. This movie was good. There were many twists. The diatribe between Josh Harnett and Lucy Liu was a little bit annoying. After you accept that Josh's accent and nose are not going away, you can enjoy this movie. This is another one of those revenge driven movies. Mr. Goodcat stole the show. The best scene was when he did the Kentucky Shuffle or something like that. Just amazing! I loved the ruthlessness that Bruce Willis put into his character. The best scene was the part where the Rabbi pulls out a shotgun and said that he would not go to hell if he killed Josh Harnette."

","Thoroughly enchanting but for one plot hole. If Slevin is trying to be Nick Fischer why is he telling the Rabbi and the Boss that it's mistaken identity? Okay. That's for us, the audience. If he does then we know he's in on the scam. You know, it's the kind of thing that we'll put up with for a great story because we don't think of it until hours later. The only other critique I would venture is that there seem to be far too many flashbacks to explain the setup. If we had known that Slevin was the kid and Goodkat the the ""specialist"" assassin. That would have been enough. All told this movie has that edginess that puts it in the league with Pulp Fiction."

This is movie that plays on the viewer wits and dares them to keep up. In the end for those who are too slow the plot is finally revealed. I wished the last would have been left up to us to decipher, but in the end the movie is great. I personally would put it into my top 25 list. It is a mixture of Hitchkock's North By Northwest, Terentino's Pulp Fiction, and Singer's The Usual Suspects. But don't get me wrong, it does not exceed any of these films.

","So, going into this movie I expected nothing but spectacular cinema given the cast and genre of the movie. I was not at all disappointed for the first 1 hr and 45 minutes. However, when we find out that Slevin warned Lindsey about Goodkat coming to kill her....my attention turned south. I can understand the reasoning behind the writer allowing for some compassion to come from Slevin (basically following the footsteps of Goodkat when he didn't kill Slevin as a child), but it totally turned a 'badass' movie into a 'so-so mob-gambling' movie. It was basically like 'Casino' went on a date with 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lucky Number Slevin' was their love child. I did enjoy 95% of this movie, but it would have left a much better taste in my mouth if Slevin and Goodkat had boarded a plane at the end of the movie, not thinking twice about Lindsey. The dialog and plot were too smart to have such a stereotypical happy ending."

","I decided to go to this film after reading a couple of very interesting reviews in the local newspapers. They were hinting at something different and intriguing, but the reviewers appeared reluctant to admit they were bowled over by the film. I tend to be distrustful of reviewers who ""love"" a film since it usually reflects the movie might be a little too different and might just be trying to hard to do something new. ""Slevin"" doesn't try to reinvent the genre (whatever it might be in this case), but it does certainly present sharper portrayals of prototypes we have encountered before, and there is also much more care given to a storyline that could easily baffle audiences. Instead, here is a film that delivers, with a very satisfying payoff!! 2006 has definitely given us outstanding work by Bruce Willis, an actor that manages to prove he is very reliable, versatile, and quite talented in some very unorthodox vehicles (""Pulp Fiction"", ""16 Blocks""). He now embodies the epitome of cool, with a performance that shows he can be white hot and put enough energy to keep this very unpredictable tale going.<br/><br/>The movie is an ensemble piece, and Bruce stands out as one of the mysterious pieces in the movie. There is great work by both Freeman and Kingsley who are two of the most versatile and best actors of their generation. When they are in their separate scenes they dominate the screen, when they are both together, the results are explosive. Lucy Liu is sweet and quite effective as the romantic performer. Josh Harnett makes a bid again for stardom in a performance that shows the right script can do wonders for talent like his.<br/><br/>Going through the elaborate screenplay requires multiple viewings, but watching it for the first time can be a very enjoyable ride. It is only fair to say that any of the classic Greek tragedies certainly provided inspiration for the multiple twists and clever plot lines that hold the story together. The screenplay is the work of writer who understands background and depth are necessary to create interesting characters.<br/><br/>Be prepared to see the multiple sides of the underbelly of society, and how deceptive looks and appearances can be. Also some stereotypes will be shattered as the writer allows its audience to have fun along the way. ""The Usual Suspects"" was only the introduction to the wildest ride of the year. Hope this is remembered later in the year because this is outstanding film-making, and whoever said that being bad doesn't pay, might not be rethnking that appreciation."

Stylistically, Lucky Number Slevin is a joy...still, it would constitute no loss to the potential viewer if he were to forgo a trip to the large screen for this...wait for DVD.

The film's conclusion, however, proves that very few things are what they seem. The creative writing of Jason Smilovic and Tarantino-esquire directing of Paul McGuigan turn this 'drama' into a refreshingly witty and intense thriller.<br/><br/>Along with its energetic soundtrack (including 1964 Stax Classic, After Laughter Comes Tears by Wendy Rene) and eye-catching production design, moviegoers will love Lucky Number Slevin's enigmatic essence and quirky humor.<br/><br/>It is dreadfully bloody, incredibly sexy, very funny, and EXTREMELY clever."

This movie has just about everything in it - the cliché sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll probably describes it best - without being too over the top, or hard to follow. As the story was moving along, you were able to put together the little pieces that eventually led you to the end and you had that 'aha' moment when you are able to figure something out that was staring you in the face all along. I especially like the witty dialog, I think Lucy Liu played her character really great, and while the movie was a bit explicit in some of the violence it made the movie what it was. Also the way the story moved along reminded me of my other favorites Josh Hartness movie ""wicker park"" because it keeps you guessing as to what is gonna happen at the end.

","""Lucky Number Slevin""<br/><br/>The cast was excellent, with Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui, Morgan Freeman and the great Sir Ben Kingsley. It's not everyday you watch a film with names this huge sharing the same screen. After watching the trailer, the movie looked like some kind of action spoof and that put me off big time. But then my sister told me it was good so I gave it go. Little did I know I would later call this the second best film of the year 2006. (After V for Vendetta) This film totally shocked me. It started off a little silly and confusing, with Hartnett coming across as a hapless unlucky joker but it all started to make sense. And it got interesting real quick then I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. The narrative was illustrated beautifully, set in 70's well I think anyway, that's what the flower covered wallpaper was telling me. Also Set in New York City, a case of mistaken identity lands Slevin (Josh Hartnett) in the middle of a war being plotted by two of the city's most rival crime bosses. At first I thought the film was going to waste my time but I stuck with it because I always watch an entire movie before I murder it in a review. Anyway the acting was brilliant. Bruce Willis who is not one of my favourites was haunting as a stalking assassin. The best I've seen him perform. Lucy Lui was good as was Freeman and Kingsley. The old guys delivered like always. But Josh Hartnett who I have never really been a fan of was great as Slevin. He was bloody convincing as an unlucky sucker and equally convincing as a vengeful son looking for payback. Not to mention he has seriously improved in the looks department. (My other sister noticed that first!) The movie was quick, slick, The twist in the end was wicked. I was loving it! The whole structure of this movie, the narrative, the camera shots, and the fragmented visuals all worked like magic. It was realistic, it was clever and it was different. The acting was great, the storyline was unique. One of the first scenes in the movie where Willis breaks some guy's neck was awesome; it was really clever how it made sense in the end. The only flaws I could see in this classic is that the film was less spoof -ish and they could have set a more serious tone, they could have developed the gangster's character more; they never seemed dangerous to me; instead comical. Also the start was a little slow and dull. But Hey! A film like this can afford a few flaws it was that GREAT!<br/><br/>Witty, stylish, thrilling, full of action. ""Lucky number Slevin"" has it all and more. I recommend you see this film. Watch it or miss out!<br/><br/>10 out of 10 <br/><br/>I love it when I get surprised."

","The first part of this film runs so quickly and so loosely without good direction that it is a relief when things start to fall into place midway through the meandering plot. Part of the problem is that there are a hand full of people who directed this film. I had the impression that the people who directed and produced this film spent a lot of time over coffee with computer software testing over and over again the logistics of their story line. The gratuitous violence and sex in Lucky Number Slevin is the crazy glue that keeps the flashback scenes from seeming completely without relevant content. The merits of the film are artistic expression; the acting and other technical aspects of film are very good. I was entertained most of the two hours I watched the film; if you can hack brains being splattered everywhere several times throughout the movie, and like a suspense/thriller this is the movie for you."

Her chemistry with Josh was incredible. My only disagreement with this film is its style...they tried doing too many ways of delivering scenes...slow motion, jumpcuts, grainy, etc. They should've kept it consistent, one style for the present tense, one for the story build-up and one for the flashbacks and extended scenes. And the tone...the first half was light and funny while the second half was moody and dark (i liked the second half more)...it almost felt like the shift in 'snatch' when brad pitt's trailer park was burned.

","SLEVIN is a gimmicky crime drama about gambling and payback that depends much too heavily on a twist ending. It also has all the earmarks of an independent production, yet it stars some pretty damned big names in relatively small roles, including Bruce Willis as a hit man and Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman as rival crime bosses. Your tolerance for the film may depend on your tolerance for Josh Hartnett in the lead role as a loser mistaken for someone else. He wasn't bad, although it is hard to watch the kid without thinking of lookalike Ashton Kutcher and PUNK'D. If you can hang in to the end, you may be pleasantly surprised by the turn of events. Willis doesn't look particularly well, by the way. Don't know if this was intentional."

","I loved the look of this film. The entire film was given a 70's look even in present day scenes. Josh Hartnett plays the laid back, sarcastic, go with the flow Slevin very well. As always Bruce Willis plays the hard ass great. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu and academy award winning actors Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley also gives great performances. This film is sleek and witty, and a welcoming/refreshing change from the crap that's been churned out of Hollywood the past few months. I'm not saying there haven't been any other good movies; just that they are few and far between. The only real gripe I have with the movie is that the movie is a mystery movie, but in the end the audience is given every single piece of information so that no thinking was actually necessary. Audience members could have been catatonic throughout the first half of the movie and still came out with the same knowledge as those who avidly paid attention the entire time. Even though the film had a twist (which was predictable) I felt the makers of this film should have given a little credit to the audience and left a little to the imagination. That's my long but not so significant gripe about this movie. Other than that it's a great movie and its better to watch than Scary Movie 4."
"noralee","8","1","8","13 April 2006"," Hartnett in a Towel and a Smile Trumps Alarming Body Count for Noir Entertainment
","""Lucky Number Slevin"" at first seems like a humorous noir tribute a la ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" of mistaken identity before it harshly turns into ""V for Vendetta"". <br/><br/>Telegraphed by a long prologue with the incredibly adorable kid from ""E. R."" with the crinkly eyes Oliver Davis, the first half of the film is dominated by the simply wonderful chemistry between a dryly laconic Josh Hartnett (with the crinkly eyes), quite attractively draped in a very low rise towel for at least a third of the film, and Lucy Liu in her best role since TV's ""Ally McBeal"". I'm not just biased that Liu grew up just down Queens Boulevard and went to the same high school as my son to admire that she plays an unusually smart cookie for a genre film, who is always thinking while she's volubly flirting, even while distracted by what's under that towel. I would certainly look forward to the two co-starring as a talky team again, even as he towers over her by over a foot. When the screen goes black as they hit the sack, with not even an old Movie Code fireplace or wind-blowing curtains in sight, director Paul McGuigan uses how much we want to see them together to cleverly distract us in the story when they have a cute morning-after.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is ever wily, especially in arch monologues, but Sir Ben Kingsley grinds the film to a halt as ""The Rabbi"". Though he was so scary in ""Sexy Beast"", he was similarly miscast in HBO's ""Mrs. Harris"" as a Jewish heavy, his ""Rabbi"" here is not just ludicrous in accent, plot and Talmudic rationalizations (it's usually British mysteries that enjoy the visual comedy of Hassidic criminals), but just seems like a desperate stretch to avoid the usual Italian or Russian mobster clichés.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci doesn't get to play cop often and he sure seems to be enjoying gritty here. Mykelti Williams is almost unrecognizable, playing closer to his ""Forrest Gump"" character than his usual more recent wise acre cops. Robert Forster is a marvelous raconteur in a cameo monologue.<br/><br/>While bread crumbs are left throughout the film, especially through nagging little disrupters that at first seem like debut feature writer Jason Smilovic's script or continuity errors but turn out to be clues, the tone of the film changed quite abruptly as the bodies piled up, particularly those of characters we'd gotten to know. The audience fell into an uneasy silence, partly because you could literally hear people concentrating to follow the sudden plot twists. The ending, however, is surprisingly less cynical than usual for the genre. But then Hartnett's smile could melt any cynic.<br/><br/>While the cool opening credits recall classic Saul Bass, it doesn't live up to other film references, including Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" and various Bond movies. The discussion of L'il Abner's ""Schmoo"" seems too ""Pulp Fiction"" pop-culture referential, but I certainly will remember this film's definition of a Kansas City Shuffle if it's referred to in a future film.<br/><br/>The production design of each character's apartment and entrance hallways is amusingly garish, looking like Britain in the mod-'60's. Some of the exterior shots do seem too obviously set in the fictional NYC of the other Bruce Willis with guns movie this year ""16 Blocks"" that is really in Canada (odd that in promotional interviews the cast said they shot the film in Montreal whereas all the credits acknowledge Toronto and other places in Ontario).<br/><br/>The original trailer kept the mystery twists, but unfortunately the more recent ad campaign is giving too much away."

"nickarsenev","3","0","5","14 December 2019"," A big mess.
","Lucky Number Slevin reminded me of how much worse are serious bad films than ironic bad films. It started off kinda ok, the dialogues are funny and awkward (in a good way, tho I'm not sure they are even intentionally awkward). But the second half of this film is truly one of the worst cinematographic experiences in my life, I swear to god. They made a huge (or so it seems at first) plot and all they do for like 30 minutes is explain the plot with the mouths of their characters. Not even kidding, and with that - the plot is also pretty predictable. This is like a new genre - kids detective movies. Stupid, corny, utterly boring.
I don't know why they had to get Bruce Willis for this. Bruce Willis (Mr. Goodkat or whatever) has the same scene over again in this film. The scene goes like this - something is happening and then he walks in very silently as some dramatic music starts to play. I swear to god that's almost all he does in this film. Like Bruce Willis is a genuinely good actor, he CAN ACT. It's beyond me why would they even have a character like Mr. GoOdKaT, who must be the most boring assassin in the history of cinematography.
Also the joke about black people and jews must be one of the worst things about this film. I'm not a social activist or a postcolonialist, but this film is very lazy with the stereotypes, it was genuine cringe during the scenes with Saul, Abe, Elvis and Sloe. Lucy Liu... I don't understand why this film needed a love storyline. How can you mess up a film so much?
I don't even want to know the background of this, I don't want to know who wrote this and who filmed this. This is like if David Fincher went insane and started filming with his toes.
Seriously, if you want something that's kinda like this but good - you should watch Se7en.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Not that Hollywood is always bad but this is super glossy, has big star power, has an overly engineered story and just feels trite. This movie has several twists, twists that cheat the audience as it doesn't really leave you any clues that you can trace back to earlier scenes; aside from the overarching plot arc which is abandoned for the majority of the movie. The granular twists come out of nowhere and you just have to go along with it, thus they weren't smartly interwoven into the script. And for a film with so many A-List actors, Hartnett is the main actor.Hartnett! and half the time he is wearing a towel and acting overly snarky. I'll give credit to the production crew and the cinematographer as the scenes looked bold and were visually striking however the pacing felt awkward. Overall, this tried to and succeeded in coming off cocky enough to think it outsmarted such classics as The Usual Suspects or SE7EN, for example, without giving you enough charm to care for any of the characters. In the end, I just cleared out some stale movie queue fodder which was only in their because the movie title was unique enough to stick with me from '06."

There are hit men involved as well as some humor sprinkled here and there (primarily in the beginning) but it's much more of a gangster/crime movie. The kind of story that keeps you guessing (although, for anyone paying attention, the twist is pretty evident early on).<br/><br/>What's disappointing is how seriously it plays the subject matter.

This is my favorite movie of all time, are there better ones out there as far as cinematic value and legendary statuses? Sure, but I can't explain why this had me at the edge of my seat. How the guy who annoys everyone by guessing the big twist at the end of any movie, and being right all the time, can't figure this one out. They didn't make it obvious but they didn't hide it all too well.

I don't need an explosion every 5 minutes to keep my attention and I hate it when everything ends in gunfire and crappy one liners.

It has its drama which will require more empathy if you can provide such immersion when watching movies.<br/><br/>But what it does best is its twist ending.

Ohhhh he's an amazing director for that movie and deserves more respect, no thanks not from me.

In other words, he gets the victim to look one way while he is coming from another direction. The thing about this maneuver is that it can happen to anybody. That said, this movie will take you in all kinds of directions and just when you think you understand what is going on something else transpires that changes everything. And while there were several big name actors involved in this movie, I thought Josh Hartnett (""Sleven Kelevra""), Morgan Freeman (""The Boss"") and to a lesser extent Lucy Liu (""Lindsey"") really stood out the most.

The film opens with Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) telling a stranger in the airport about a fixed horse race in 1979 resulting in the death of two bookies and a Mob boss son dying, before Goodkat kills the stranger. Then it skips to Slevin (Josh Hartnett) hanging out in the apartment of his missing friend Nick Fisher, he had previously been mugged, and he is visited by coroner neighbour Lindsey (Lucy Liu) wants to try to help him. After she's gone, two thugs show up taking Slevin away, believing him to be the man who lives in the apartment, taking him to The Boss (Morgan Freeman). Believing he is Nick Fisher, The Boss tells Slevin about the Mob rival between him and the other boss, Schlomo 'The Rabbi' (Sir Ben Kingsley). The Boss wants Slevin, or ""Nick"", to kill the son of The Rabbi, known as The Fairy (because he is gay) in revenge for the death of his son, within five days. Meanwhile Mr. Goodkat is helping both mob bosses, and it is a question of why and is there a big connection to the whole thing, and the answer, yes, it's Slevin in quite an interesting twist. Also starring Stanley Tucci as Brikowski and Kevin Chamberlin as Marty. The casting is very well done, Hartnett has some good one-liners, he has a good small love thing with a sexy Lui, Freeman is great as the talkative and cool mob boss, and even though Kingsley is a little less used he is good. There are some well scripted moments to keep you guessing and hooked, the twisted plot could have had a little work done to give it more impact, but it is quite a fun black comedy thriller.

The whole story line left me feeling kind of empty. There was nothing to connect to in the movie on a human level- its main disadvantage to me was that it was simply not real and the story seemed to have no moral. On the positive side, it is not completely boring; there is some action (though too much senseless blood), there is some ""witty"" dialogue, some intrigue.

Once he has finished the story he kills the man he told it to. The action then moves to Josh Hartnett who is playing the strangely named Slevin Kelevra. He isn't having a good time; he has lost his job, his house has been condemned, he has caught his girl friend with another man and when he goes to stay with his friend Nick Fisher he loses his wallet in a mugging. Nick isn't in when he gets there and before he has had chance to get dressed after a shower he is accosted by two thugs who think he is Nick, they take him to see The Boss (Morgan Freeman) who says he has three days to pay him back $96,000 or kill the son of his rival: The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley). No sooner is he back at Nick's flat than another two thugs arrive and drag him off to see The Rabbi who tells him he owes him $30,000.<br/><br/>Even though I ticked the spoiler box I won't say more about what happens as the various twists and turns need to be watched to fully appreciate the film, knowing them in advance would take the edge off it. The actors all do a good job, although there are a lot of big name actors in the secondary roles they just get on with playing their parts rather than trying to upstage each other.

He was good. wont give any thing away about the story.. just watch it and let the Film do the talking, Fans of the Gangster genre will love it!!."

","This movie had a brilliant story. The way the whole thing came together was very nice. Josh Hartnett plays his role well- let me digress for a second. This is only the third movie I've seen Hartnett in and my question is: Does he have sex in every movie he's in? Hollywood Homicide, 40 days, and now Lucky Number Slevin. Is it in his contract or something? - OK back to the point. The movie kept me guessing the entire time as to what was the objective of it all. It all wrapped up well, plus you had Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis. Freeman and Willis rarely do anything that's a flop so I can't imagine them both being in a movie and it not being good."

","They seem like somewhat of an unlikely pair. Obviously, he looked slightly younger than her when they met. But despite that, both acted good in the movie. But I can't say the exact same for the plot.<br/><br/>I enjoyed some of the twists, although the last two or three I kind of expected as I slowly pieced together the beginning scenes and made sense of it for the rest of the movie. It took a little bit of time for it to sink in for what was going on. Many films, when they try this sort of thing, usually don't tie everything together. But this one did.<br/><br/>However, the camera-work was kind of weak. The somewhat constant skipping ahead slightly during the scene was slightly bothersome at some times. Plus, I kind of wished the characters were developed more.<br/><br/>I was glad with the deaths that were inflicted and all the killings seemed thought-out. The music throughout the movie was not on far with what was happening sometimes and that got to me a little.<br/><br/>Overall, its not a bad film. If you don't mind piecing together a movie with deaths like this, then its your cup of tea. The music, direction, and camera-work were not as great as they could be. As a result, it doesn't get the grade it could have got with a better director. The director was just bad. ""B-"""

","Lucky Number Slevin (2006), directed by Paul McGuigan, is a crime movie where nothing is what it seems to be. Josh Hartnett plays Slevin Kelevra, who gets off a bus, gets mugged, ends up at a friend's apartment, meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and gets kidnapped. That all happens in the first ten minutes of the film, so none of this constitutes a spoiler. As the movie progresses, we're introduced to Morgan Freeman as The Boss, Sir Ben Kingsley as the Rabbi, and Bruce Willis as the professional assassin, Mr. Goodkat. <br/><br/>Most of the movie involves people thinking that Slevin is someone else, demanding money from Slevin, threatening his life, and punching him in the stomach to emphasize the seriousness of their demands. Slevin responds with James Bond-like quips. Lucy Liu's character is--I believe--described as a ""coroner."" I think they mean that she's a pathologist, although I don't think she'd be living in her modest apartment if she were an M.D. Anyway, she's as cute and witty as can be, so no one notices or cares.<br/><br/>The film didn't deliver much, considering the star power invested in it. Still, it wasn't boring, the acting was professional, and it worked well on the small screen. It's OK if you like that sort of thing."

","""Lucky Number Slevin"" comes out firing, but instead of bullets, you get a barrage of witty lines. While the movie is not dismissible, it certainly doesn't measure up with its other smooth-talking crime movie counterparts and would be better served up with some more action and less conversation as Elvis would put it.<br/><br/>""Slevin"" rolls deep with a killer cast. If Hartnett, Willis and Liu weren't enough to bring in viewers and impress them, Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley help add more intrigue where the plot often meanders. Only Kinglsey could make a rabbi-turned-mob boss character seem interesting and not simply laughable. After all, if you're going to make a film that's more about the exchange of words than punches, you'd best have the right people delivering them.<br/><br/>""Slevin"" isn't devoid of appropriate gun-wielding fare, it simply opts for only showing characters pulling guns, people dropping and then cutting to the next scene. There isn't even enough time to think about suspense. There seems to be a ""say something witty or die"" attitude in the script. McGuigan's fast-paced directing style accommodates this motto nicely. There are a lot of interesting shots and the constant use with varying length flashbacks seem more effective than redundant.<br/><br/>Basically, the film takes too much time trying to outsmart you plot-wise or smooth-talk you to death, either that or it simply pulls the trigger so it can smooth-talk again. enough so that it can't really become anything special or more than entertaining."

"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","1","10 October 2007"," Slick and enjoyable, but a little too clever for its own good
","This very slick, fast-moving crime thriller from Paul McGuigan actually has a very simple revenge story at its core, but writer Jason Smilovic seems to have worked hard at making it as convoluted as possible. Like a pair of seasoned hustlers, though, McGuigan distracts us with flashy visuals a la Guy Ritchie while Smilovic keeps us wrong-footed with his dense, fast-talking dialogue that appears to owe more than a little to Tarantino at times.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett is engaging enough as Slevin, an amiable young man who finds himself mistaken by a couple of gangsters (Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, both good) for his friend Nick Fisher, who just happens to be into Freeman for $96,000. Freeman is willing to settle the debt, however, if Fisher/Slevin is willing to bump off Kingsley. From this simple strand things take off in increasingly convoluted circles as Slevin finds unexpected  and incredibly fortunate, when you think about it  assistance from police coroner Lucy Liu who lives in the flat opposite Fisher. And while all this is going on a melancholic Bruce Willis lurks in the background in one of his sillier wigs.<br/><br/>This is one of those roller-coaster rides that barely slows long enough for you to draw breath, so determined is it to keep you guessing throughout its running time. For the most part, it's good  if over-derivative  fun, as long as you don't take it too seriously. But by its last reel it was straining to maintain its credibility as it pulled off its umpteenth twist. In fact, this is one of those films that's so deliberately convoluted that you can't prevent yourself from picking over it afterwards to find out where the inevitable plot holes are. And there are so many of these twists to be straightened out that it takes Smilovic a good fifteen minutes to unravel them all and that has got to be too long because, for my money, the truly clever films are those that, while they may be as convoluted as this, can be explained with a single devastating revelation."

","In the end the story is pretty basic, there isn't so much originality. Even the way the story is told is not something that has never-been- before-seen. What is amazing is the confidence and deftness with which we are steered through this tale.<br/><br/>This confirms that it's not just the story but how you tell it- suspense, puzzles, loopholes that later become closed, mysteries that become solved...a masterful telling of a forgettable story and after seeing Wicker Park, i can say Paul McGuigan is a talent that can only get better.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis- I can see why Shyamalan respects him so much...he embodies a character and makes it his own. Every other performance will always pale in comparison to his though Hartnett gets top marks for trying. Sir Ben is always like a ghost-actor in that he blends so well with his character that you don't see him only his character (he made such a believable Rabbi!) and Freeman's laid back style is ever so strong. Lucy Liu has come of age as an actress- top marks for interpreting such a surreal role.<br/><br/>The cinematography is the most wonderful thing about this film, one scene literally took my breath away! and the camera angles are worked with such scientific precision. Some of the decor has to be commented upon as it blended so well with the story and I can truly say 10 out of 10 for lighting which was always enough and never too much.<br/><br/>The story was courageous, audacious and brash and this is partly why this film could be pulled off not to mention the first rate cast! Altogether, a great Directing effort and a film worthy of Slevin out of ten."

","This was an excellent respectable movie, that kept you guessing for most of the movie. In terms of box office, I think the biggest problem to seeing this is the name. While kind of clever, it tries too hard and is annoying, while some think that also describes the movie, I don't. The story, plot, and acting are all excellent, except that the ending is a bit too happy. To make it a truly great movie, there needs to be less rose and more thorns. The cast is phenomenal and more could have been made of character development. It did feel somewhat manipulative in the time line jumping, which always makes me feel like the maker's do not feel like they have a good story to tell. On this note, all perspective film makers, please see Italian Job. Overall an excellent movie and I would suggest it to just about everyone."

","Paul McGuigan is an enormously talented man. His film before ""Lucky Number Slevin"", ""Wicker Park"" was jumping around in style and intensity; and in everything: performances, camera use, intelligent writing. These three things in special repeat themselves in ""Lucky Number Slevin"", where McGuigan got some really professional actors that couldn't do much (Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci) and others that had a blast (Morgan Freeman and Bruce Willis). But it's difficult to sit down and appreciate performances in this film; it goes faster than ""Wicker Park"".<br/><br/>Again, the director brought Josh Hartnett for the main role, and again he puts the young actor in the wrong place at the wrong time. To say that ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is a story about a guy in that situation above mentioned would be fair enough; because telling the rest is spoiling it for the viewer. At times, you can't take your eyes off of the screen, but there were moments where I honestly felt a little tired.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to blame Jason Smilovic's script for this, but he throws a lot of things in and the movie is just above one hundred minutes. And I've been thinking if the movie would have been better with more detail and pauses so we could really understand and study the characters, but I say noBecause this is how McGuigan works, and here Peter Sova's cinematography and Andrew Hulme's edition are better than ever; with challenging close ups, imaginative shots, beautiful quick cuts and a solid use of flashbacks.<br/><br/>The movie requires flashbacks because it's a mess, but it's a nice mess. An intelligent mess with avoidance (and also mocking) of the clichés all the way through, with intelligent movie references and an unexpected resolution you only see coming when you have to. Is it too intelligent for its own good? I really don't know, because it doesn't just put a lot of words and some action so we get distracted; it focuses completely on the words and conversations of the characters. Yes, we don't remember some characters and they're not really developed, but the script asks questions about things we've seen some minutes agoIt goes back on the story; it wants to know if we're really paying attention.<br/><br/>I never stopped paying attention because of what I said before, because McGuigan's way of capturing a city's feeling, because of J. Ralph's exhilarating score and also because the actors' faces. Morgan Freeman's face demands attention and, believe it, also does Josh Hartnett's. Both of them take the film to high levels, while Bruce Willis makes a great narrator but a not so great player in person. In other words, it's his voice and not his face that demands attention.<br/><br/>The good thing is that you want to see the movie again when it's over, because you feel like you've missed a lot; just like it happened to me with ""Wicker Park"", which was a remakeThis is an original. The good thing is that you'll never forget about something called ""The Kansas City Shuffle"". The bad thing is that Paul McGuigan can make a great movie, but ""Lucky Number Slevin"" is not it."

","An article with director Paul McGuigan on the casting of the movie told me the stars were won over by the script. That's hard to see.<br/><br/>It's a game of two halves; the set-up and the execution of a complex plan, with each half bringing it's own problems.<br/><br/>The opening hour concerns Slevins mistaken identity and his subsequent meetings with the two rival crime bosses. Slevin's ""witty"" nonchalence during these meetings lends an air of predictability to the film's 2nd half. The final 40 minutes of which become an agonisingly patronising walk through of events.<br/><br/>Yet for it's faults, the movie has it's charm. The script ties up well, and Lucy Lui gives a surprisingly great performance as the love interest. She is a shining light above some awfully mediocre turns from the other stars (I can never buy Morgan Freeman as a bad guy).<br/><br/>In the end though i think it is Paul McGuigan's direction, which at times shows real class, that raises lucky number slevin over other movies in this genre."
"RJBurke1942","6","0","1","19 May 2007"," Where righting a wrong could mean doing wrong, even when you're right
","Is this a thrilling comedy or a comedic thriller?<br/><br/>There's a good cast here, with Freeman, Kingsley, Tucci and Willis doing their thing and in their usually competent manner. And, there's Josh Hartnett (whom I'd seen before in Black Hawk Down and Sin City) who takes on the role of Slevin  the wrong man in this narrative.<br/><br/>Which is -- when all I said and done  a pure spoof of the gangster/crime genre and can be reviewed sensibly only from that perspective. But, it's not as bad or as good (depending upon your own point of view) as those spoofs that Leslie Nielsen (The Naked Gun etc) does in his sleep, practically.<br/><br/>Quite simply, the story is stupendously stupid but, along the way, there are some very witty lines, some delicious ironic twists, and the usual run of bloody murders. So, it's all a lot of ""good"" fun, despite the rising body count and the almost total amorality of the characters  the exception being Lindsey (Lucy Liu) who tags along with Slevin and his problems. However, take away the comedy, change the narrative slightly, and you'd have a viable comparison to other recent gangster movies -- e.g. The Departed (2006), for one -- and a film noir contender. What a pity it wasn't done that way; it would have been a more gripping and more believable story  instead of a black comedy that was trying to be serious.<br/><br/>Hence, as presented, the story is simply a framework upon which to hang different traps, pitfalls, and surprises for the delight (or frustration) of most viewers. Frankly, I nearly fell asleep in the first forty minutes (well, it was very late at night too, when I watched this one) and only perked up when the first surprise popped up. Sorry  can't say what it is, because that would spoil it for you, and the rest of the story. Bummer, huh?<br/><br/>The production is slick  but I think it was done on the cheap (no crashed cars, trains, planes, etc and a minimum of sets)  the filming is competent, but the editing is a bit jerky. I loved the dialog, the verbal jousting, the innuendo and the lies that keep you guessing  or just totally confused. Whatever...<br/><br/>Is it worth watching? Yes, simply to see how a lot of good actors make a bundle of money having a lot of fun. And, you might have a bit of fun along the way also."

So now the family of this poor jerk they kill (for the Kansas City Shuffle) is entitled to exact their revenge on Willis & Hartnett?

","This movie has style - snappy editing.. cheesy interiors.. The dialog gets on shaky ground at times; the back-and-forth quips don't quite have the cocky self assurance that you get in a Tarantino movie. It's a minor gripe though. Josh Hartnett's acting isn't out of this world, but he doesn't need to because even if he's not exactly pushing boundaries he delivers the lines with aplomb and charm. At times the talky parts dragged on a bit but the action sequences were quite well done. Bruce Willis phones in a boring-too-cool-for-school hit-man performance and Lucy Liu tries too hard to be quirky/cute/weird but doesn't exactly get it right. I personally found her annoying. And we've got Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman Acting Cool in a Movie. <br/><br/>Towards the end where things fall neatly into place, things pick up. I found that the flashbacks to Slevin's past were the most interesting bits of the movie, as well as the race. Visually, the film is pretty if repetitive at times. Watch this movie if you like Josh Hartnett and want to see him look good in a bath towel and a slightly f-d up nose, and don't expect anything profound."

It's either a part of the background, or a big driving force. In this film, what was it?

"jose-leonor","7","0","1","12 February 2007"," The Kansas City Shuffle
","--Spoiler-Heavy: Please read only once you've seen the movie--<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin is ostensibly merely a cleverly crafted story with somewhat forced ""cool"" Gut Ritchie-esquire dialogue. Beneath the surface, the movie is ultimately about a greater thing than just an eclectic cast composed of well-known actors offering great performances and what Bruce Willis' stranger in a wheelchair labels ""The Kansas City Shuffle"". The movie, when it is all said and done, is about fathers and sons and how prepared that soil is for miscommunication and the resulting misunderstandings.<br/><br/>The Boss and Schlomo the Rabbi play major parts in the demise of a little boy's family. They murder his parents separately and assign Mr. Goodkat the wholesome duty of taking the innocent boy's life. Having had no prior rapport with the kid, Mr. Goodkat demonstrates a gentler side and takes him under his wing. The movie's plot revolves around the result of years of planning the boy's revenge.<br/><br/>The Boss's son is murdered and, considering their long-standing rivalry since their collaboration in the murder of the boy's family, he immediately blames The Rabbi's people. In exchange, the Boss wants to murder Yitzchok The Fairy, The Rabbi's son who is homosexual unbeknownst to his father. These men are dearly attached to their sons despite their caustic, reclusive existences. Once Mr. Goodkat and Slevin succeed in bringing The Rabbi and The Boss together, the latter brags to The Rabbi about his success in killing his son, The Fairy. The Rabbi, realizing the certitude with which The Boss confesses, becomes choked up in what is the only truly emotional scene in the movie. It is at this point a film rather than a movie. Ben Kingsley clinches here as the best performer in the film as his heartbreak is as genuine and warranted as it was for him in House of Sand and Fog.<br/><br/>In the end, Slevin achieves his self-righteous retribution and fails to learn his lesson from the situation. He fails to trust his only father figure with the truth and incorrectly assumes Mr. Goodkat is incapable of a sympathy he had previously shown in saving the kid's, Slevin's, life.<br/><br/>It is, at its core, movie about disconnected men and the vengefulness with which men respond to affronts on their families. Despite the fact that Slevin will never have his biological father back, the film comes full circle with the scum having been wiped out and Slevin capable of moving on with his life. The son lives on and finds a mate to protect and who can care for him the way his parents seemingly cared for one another. (Note that the only two female characters play integral roles only before revenge is ""called for"" and once it is accomplished. That's a review for someone else to write.) Enjoy it either way you want. It is both a neat, cool, and clever movie that at times tries too hard to emulate its colorful cinematic predecessors (Snatch, The Usual Suspects, etc...) and a highly entertaining commentary film dealing loosely with the bonds between men. Or maybe I've been duped by the Kansas City Shuffle.<br/><br/>7/10"

When he arrives at Nicks apartment he finds that no-one is in, but Nick is expecting him so he naturally lets himself in and makes himself at home. When two thugs knock at the door asking for Nick, Slevin has no choice but to be dragged into a gang building to see the gang leader, 'the boss' (Morgan Freeman). The boss then goes onto explain how Nick owes him 90,000 dollars, and Slevin (having been mugged as soon as he got to New York City) has no ID and seems to be living in Nicks apartment. The boss then explains how a rival gang leader, the rabbi (Ben Kingsley), recently broke the bond of trust between them by murdering the bosses son, and then he goes onto give Slevin two chances, either pay the 90,000 dollars or kill the rabbis son to make it even between the gangs. Slevin has no choice, his mission, to assassinate the rabbis son. But the pressure is really on Slevin when the detectives start harassing him and following him everywhere, when he learns that hes being followed by the world class infamous assassin, Goodkat (Bruce Willis), and when the rabbi and the boss start pressuring him more. Although when a nose neighbour, Lindsay (Lucy Lui) stumbles across Slevin's situation she is eager to help him out and soon enough they start to fall in love. Will slevin really kill the rabbis son? Will slevin find out who this infamous Goodkat is and why he keeps following him? Or will slevin simply go to the police?<br/><br/>This film manages to maintain a marvellous story line with twists and surprises around every corner whilst at the same time being hilariously funny with its scattered black comedy. It also manages to pull of quite a body count whilst staying sleek and suave. This films for the person who likes to think through a film whilst seeing a funny, and sometimes gory film. The acting is superb, my personal favourite character is Slevin himself because of his innocence and lovable cockiness. Although their is also Bruce Willis's character Goodkat, a smooth clean assassin who gives no mercy. The script and dialogue are also superb. I consider this film to be one of the very few films that can pull off being very funny and yet really gripping at other points as well. <br/><br/>All in all it is a very enjoyable watch, and anyone with a passion for films or movies will love it. It keeps you guessing right till the end.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I would like to detest the statement made by ""niuqniuq"" that the homosexual in the film was made to be gay to make the audience not feel bad over his death. He was killed for the sins of himself and his father had done towards his family and if you would recall he was not innocent in the least. He was ""getting fat"" as they put it off the deaths of innocent people. The reason he was homosexual was they needed a way for slevin to get into the building in the first place without having a cheesy endless fight scene put in for the effect of action. They made it hold more intrigue in this way. Although this gives far from a moral picture movies would be like children's books giving the moral of the story in its entirety."

","Without a doubt, Lucky Number Slevin is one of the most complex movies ever. This is both good and bad. On the plus side, it absorbs and enthrals you. With so many twists, it is very hard to get your mind around what is actually happening. On the other hand, this is a film that is far too complicated to be a classic - it tries too hard to confuse the audience, and you come out at the end in a daze as to what the conclusion was. If you are someone who likes to watch movies where you don't have to think about what's happening, steer clear of this one. On a more positive note, the film is packed with stars giving five star performances. Josh Hartnett is very well appointed as Slevin, Lucy Liu is in inspired form as his sidekick, while Bruce Willis is in uber-cool mode as the Goodkat. He is the best character in the movie, and the scene in which he shoots two guards coming through a fake wall is sensational. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley did well in their roles also. Overall, a good film with some great scenes - but not a classic."

"itamarscomix","6","0","2","28 November 2006"," High octane action, sleek script, but not quite Tarantino
","There's really nothing much to complain about when it comes to this film. It's absolutely, unfailingly entertaining and rewarding by the minute. With great action scenes, high tension, an intricate and clever plot, great dialogue and a superb all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Stanley Tucci, Lucky Number Slevin is a true pleasure, and for fans of directors Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, it's practically too good to miss.<br/><br/>Therein lies the film's problem  it tries a bit too hard to imitate Tarantino and to a lesser extent Ritchie as well, and in the process it loses something of its own voice. It seems that McGuigan actively tried to create a cult film, and to a certain extent he gets the job done; Lucky Number Slevin has some very memorable characters and some highly quotable lines of dialogue. In the end, though, it's just not quite memorable enough to carry that weight. It's a very impressive directorial debut, no doubt, but it has neither the soul of Reservoir Dogs nor the energy of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels. In trying too hard to be cool and sleek McGuigan forgot that he has a voice of his own, and the film lacks a bit in soul and feel.<br/><br/>Still, it's lots of fun, and certainly stands on par with a lesser Tarantino work  True Romance (Tarantino's script) immediately comes to mind. Lucky Number Slevin doesn't have the spark, the inventiveness and the cultural awareness that make Tarantino great and unique, but it never gets dull, and never loses its perfect pace. The storyline may be far-fetched but it works, and the twist ending is both surprising and satisfying; and killer performances from three key figures  Willis, Freeman and Kingsley  make the fast, tongue-in-cheek, witty dialogue an extreme pleasure. Lucky Number Slevin is not to be taken all too seriously  it's basically a crime thriller, to be taken more or less at face value, and despite the constant Tarantino comparisons it has nothing of the cultural and artistic statement of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill. For fans of the genre though, and for anyone looking for an evening of pure entertainment, you can't miss with this one."

","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Embedded in hip, street-thug canon, there is Scorcese's *Goodfellas*, there is Tarantino's *Pulp Fiction*, there is Ritchie's *Snatch*  all periodically panned for their film stylings, yet garnering indirect accolades through their wealth of imitators  but if there is such a thing as ""too hip,"" Paul McGuigan's *Lucky Number Slevin* would be choking on its own faux street cred.<br/><br/>Sidling past the grandmasters of urban cool, *Slevin* embraces its influences and tilts unashamedly at the zenith of Thug Hip.<br/><br/>Sometimes it works, as when danger men like Bruce Willis (as hired gun, Mr. Goodkat) or Sir Ben Kingsley (as crime kingpin, The Rabbi) orate Urban, but sometimes it flails for credibility, as when Morgan Freeman (as opposing kingpin, The Boss) tries to convince he's Bad, or when Boy Hartnett (as title character, Slevin) tries to convince he's Hard.<br/><br/>The impeccable Stanley Tucci, as the testy New York cop, edges into hip with his seedy, malign temperament. Lucy Liu is the Girl Next Door (why doesn't the Girl Next Door ever look like Janeane Garofalo?), as titillating yet irritating as a GND usually is, her contribution to hip being a slavish adherence to Gap-generation mismatched clothes; her presence an obvious element required for gratuitous intercourse and Implausible Happy Ending Protocol.<br/><br/>There's a sarcasm at work in the title, for at first glance, Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is anything but lucky, being mistaken for the guy whose apartment he is crashing in and whisked off with a twice-broken nose (with nary but a bath towel betwixt him and primal exposure) to visit two of the crime bosses of New York City, and told that he owes them both large. The Boss makes a deal with Slevin to cancel his debt in return for a favor: assassinating The Rabbi's son. But Slevin is not the low-rent thug they think he is And hit-man Goodkat is skulking around, seemingly hired by both The Boss and The Rabbi, for reasons unknown There is something afoot and we can't quite focus our thug-dar for all the misdirection thrown at us by the serpentine style of the film-making and the bass-ackwards nature of the film.<br/><br/>A million plot twists later, we discover that *Slevin* is a tale of revenge. The long way 'round. Events go nowhere and twists add up to nothing, but when the layer cake is baked, the Moebius strip winds up making sense - until it tries to make sense of itself. In the last explanatory dialog (delivered by Robert Forster) all non sequiturs are accounted for, with one glaring exception, a mistake on the film-makers' part  the motivation of a major player is lacking, to the detriment of the film's overall enjoyment. <br/><br/>SPOILERS...<br/><br/>During the movie, we are led to believe that lethal Mr. Goodkat (Willis) is playing both bosses for his own ends (a role much like Willis' character in *Last Man Standing*, 1996, one of the many inferior remakes of *Yojimbo*) and that he has ""plans"" for Slevin, who is in turn being played by the two bosses. In the denouement, it is revealed that twenty years ago, Goodkat was sent to execute Slevin as a boy, but stayed his hand, unbeknownst to his employers. In the present, Goodkat is in fact aiding Slevin's revenge on the two bosses.<br/><br/>The question is: Why? What possible reason did Goodkat have to renege on his kiddie execution? If it was to groom Slevin as an accomplice, we'd have motivation, but Slevin is NOT his accomplice  on the contrary, Goodkat seems to be aiding Slevin for no recompense. We can speculate all we want about Goodkat doing something moral to palliate his nihilism, or that for the past twenty years, Slevin was in fact in Goodkat's debt until the revenge job released him from Goodkat's services. But  as Sloe (Mykelti Washington) tells Slevin - ""Tell it to the one-legged man, so he can bump it on down the road."" Speculation schmeculation.<br/><br/>In all the smash-cuts and filtered film, all the mind-numbing wallpaper and misdirection (making pretty-boy Hartnett not so pretty with a broken nose or prison goatee), in all the flashing forward and backward, all the split-screens and strobed scenes, in all the compositing of dialog from different flashbacks and spine-snapping the chronology for more impactive ""reveals,"" director McGuigan and writer Jason Smilovic strangely  but understandably - neglected to give Goodkat plausible motivation.<br/><br/>The movie might have been harder, heavier and hipper were it not for the discrepancy in Willis' character and the silly girl-boy happy ending. Yet it retains its high rating for the obvious effort to create a film more interesting than your average bear - visually, conceptually, linguistically.<br/><br/>Best line is Goodkat's reply to Slevin: ""I'm a world-class assassin, fuckhead!"" because it seems so altogether true - about BRUCE WILLIS. In one scene, Goodkat, in long, tough-guy overcoat, raises two guns straight forward, arms outstretched, furious intent on his face - an image of Bruce Willis as engraved in our minds as Christ on the Cross.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis bigger than Jesus? Now that's hip."
"buggeroff-15","5","0","1","17 November 2006"," An amusing black comedy, but lacking in depth
","An amusing black comedy which more-or-less works as a lightly entertaining caper film, but fails as the grifter/sting film it promised to be. Fair performances -- slightly overacted for comedy -- were turned in by a cast of exceptional talent, while the (sometimes far-fetched) dialog is often amusing.<br/><br/>One weakness is that the principle antagonists are painted more as comic villains, making some of the violence difficult to emotionally justify, and thus seeming heavy handed (although the film is not very bloodthirsty by today's standards.)<br/><br/>However as a convoluted sting caper, it fails to deliver. There is the appearance of multiple wheels in motion, cunning legerdemain, the seeming of a clever puzzle unfolding. From the opening scenes in a transit lounge and Nick's apartment, alert viewers will be rewarded for the effort of trying to piece the clues together. But if you try to digest it like a le Carré spy game or a Lawrence Block grift, it falls to pieces.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>With thinking cap on, you may quickly realise that Slevin is lying about nearly everything, then soon realise he is in cahoots with Goodkat, and soon their object becomes evident. I confess that I missed the clue on motive (Slevin asks the Boss ""how many times can you kill me?"") and had to wait until the director spelled it out. But that was because quite a bit of the plot didn't really fit. e.g.:<br/><br/>1. Introducing Slevin to the Rabbi as Nick was supposed to lower his guard. But the request was so odd his spider sense should be twitching like electroshock therapy. He even realises Slevin is an impostor. Then inexplicably, he just starts trusting Slevin.<br/><br/>2. Getting the Boss to coerce Slevin is supposedly so that Slevin can come and go. But he never needs to until after Goodkat captured the Boss by force.<br/><br/>3. There is a complicated plan to do with convincing the Boss that Slevin has been killed by Goodkat. Much of this plan is totally confusing until one realises that Slevin and Goodkat have been forced to modify their plan because of Lindsey. Even so, large chunks of it remain seriously illogical and unnecessary to their aim, so I conclude that they killed two innocent people for no reason.<br/><br/>I have a dozen more, but this is already too long...<br/><br/>Oh, one final thing. Recall that in Nick's apartment at the start, Slevin told Lindsey that he wasn't worried because he had ataraxia  ""a condition characterized by freedom from worry or any other preoccupation"". In fact ataraxia is not a medical condition, it is a term from Greek philosophy which is often translated as ""the consolation of philosophy""; he is saying that he is calm because he is now fully resolved and prepared to undertake his plan, come what may. It is one of a host of clues he gives in the apartment."

","The DVD case reads that by taking the best parts of Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects, you end up with Lucky Number Slevin. Rather, LNS wishes that it had the natural assurance of either of these films, but instead ends up feeling slightly forced. The twist wasn't particularly surprising nor very clever or well crafted and its explanation drove on. It was fun to see Morgan Freeman playing a character on the darker side, but the only performance that really stood out for me was Lucy Liu's effortless turn (perhaps because I had just recently watched her completely stoic in Kill Bill vol 1) as the girl next door. There are comparisons made constantly to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which is a far superior film, and I would urge you to check that film out if you enjoyed this one. Both films possess a sort of sheen and a je ne sais quoi sense of ""coolness"", but Kiss' script is far wittier and its performances overall much stronger. In short, this is worth a rent perhaps, but don't expect too much."

","Director Paul McGuigan, who previously set the plague upon the world that was the Josh Harnett vehicle ""Wicker Park"", returns with an entirely new bag of tricks with ""Lucky Number Slevin"". The oddly named film fulfills the basic requirements of a crime thriller, providing equal amounts twists as turns, and leaves the audience grappling at straws up until the very end. On the surface this is all very familiar territory, which has been going especially strong since Quentin Tarantino burst on the scene in the early '90s, reviving the genre.<br/><br/>Most of what came after Tarantino's arrival (specifically ""Pulp Fiction"") was below par, hackneyed, and at times little more than hero worship pointed at that director himself. McGuigan takes ""Lucky Number Slevin"" in more of a ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" direction, as it allows intrigue and crime to occur in a world familiar with the same film catalog as those staring at the screen. It's this sort of self-conscious film-making that makes this one really work, even if the whole mess comes off as a filmic casserole.<br/><br/>It tells the continually unraveling story of Slevin, a man who finds himself caught in an extreme case of mistaken identity that leads him deep into the crime world of New York City which is headed by two warring isolationistic crime bosses. There's a lot of strong acting talent involved here, including a surprisingly effective performance by Lucy Liu, who tends to be an awkward fit in many of her roles.<br/><br/>The story is predictably complex, and at times indiscernible, as it continues to unravel in interesting, entertaining, and surprisingly tidy ways. There's a palpable energy to the whole thing that makes it an exciting, if quickly forgotten experience."

It was a superb offering, humorous, yet with a death toll that I'm sure rivals Scarface...and a twisting, turning storyline that is (IMO) very difficult to predict, but not to difficult to rationalize or follow as it unfolds. Pay close attention to the small flashback details as it allows a quicker clarity...BUT don't be upset if you miss some as they will all converge and focus at the climax of this very well written story...it's got one heck of a cast that lives up to or surpass usual expectations...I never cared much for Lucy Lui until watching this flick...What can you say about Morgan or Ben (That's SIR Ben...LOL) they are perfect for their respective roles. Josh plays his part to unbelievable excellence and Bruce, well he's Bruce, but justly so as Goodkat...gotta love him! Tucci is very convincing as a not so goody two shoes NYC cop and a very funny crew of henchmen with odd quirks that make them adorable in a macabre sense. This is the best movie I have seen in quite some time, especially considering the notoriety (or lack of)...I give it 2 thumbs up (your nose so your soda doesn't spray out your nostrils as the dark humor emits from the screen)"

Then, a short time after being returned to his friend's apartment two different goons take him to their boss, 'the Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), who happens to live right across the street from 'the Boss' and they, bitter rivals, often stare at each other across the abyss.<br/><br/>This movie has lots of unsavory language and violence, but it is done in a style that begs the viewer not to take it too seriously. The critic Ebert gave it a very mediocre review, but what he disliked are some of the things I like about it. One being the unusual and witty dialog, almost like a parody of a David Mamet script.<br/><br/>Other main characters are Bruce Willis as Goodkat, a professional assassin, and Lucy Liu as Lindsey, who lives in the same building as Slevin's friend, and who works for the coroner's office. As the movie unfolds we learn that little is what it seems to be at first.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. The story, not revealed chronologically, is rather simple. The first scene takes place 25 years earlier, and a young boy sees his father killed for gambling losses, the last one on a horse called 'Lucky Number Slevin', and that's where the title of the movie is taken. Goodkat looks at the boy in the eyes and spares him. The boy grows up to be the Josh Hartnett character and he with Goodkat plan the revenge killing of 'the Boss', 'the Rabbi', and several others who had been involved in his parents' deaths.

","What made this a pretty dynamic movie was the quality of acting delivered by Freeman, Hartner, Kingsley, Willis, and Liu; along with a good supporting cast, the actors played their parts well and with the right amount of realism without overdoing things. As far as the story itself is concerned, I was quite impressed by the central plot as it was allowed the chance to blossom into an elaborate network involving murder, manipulation, obsession, and redemption. Without giving away much of the story, this is a movie mainly about revenge, although you don't see that right away until the end.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that my favorite character in the movie was Lindsay (Liu). Amongst all of the violence and seedy corruption, Lindsay was a character that gave different insights into the story itself. To a small but significant extent, Lindsay plays a special role in Slevin's salvation and redemption despite the fact that he's quite possibly an individual with psychopathic tendencies.<br/><br/>Willis does a great job portraying Mr. Goodcat and we see that in addition to being very intelligent and manipulative he has a few redeeming qualities that play significantly within the story.<br/><br/>Although this movie is mainly about good old fashioned revenge, it does a great job exploring the boundaries of its characters and how each character plays significantly in the lives of the other people involved. Clearly this is a character driven movie with great and humorous dialog. I was definitely impressed."

Paul McGuigan does a very good job although he used different techniques and a mix of CGI and film that worked most of the times. I would like it to be a bit darker since it is a mob story and the super modern sets of the gangsters' lairs where a bit to unrealistic. After all the scenario is Hollywood reality and a bit unbelievable by itself. <br/><br/>I would first like to mention the brilliant job Sir Ben Kingsley does. Honest you are up for a surprise. This actor is so multi-sided and he doesn't stop bringing a variety of characters on the screen, thats why he remains one of my top ten males. His cooperation with Morgan Freeman is truly professional.<br/><br/>Expect to see a Jackal and SinCity mix of Bruce Willis whose character although in the background is the common denominator. After all the above three actors where the reason I saw the movie, me not being a huge fan of Hollywood.<br/><br/>The only other time I had seen Josh Hartnett was in SinCity where I cant remember if he even has more than a line and in this one he does not make any impression to me and found him rather planate.

They don't believe him when he tells them his name is Slevin and drag him out of the apartment clothed only in a bath towel. They take him to ""The Boss"" (Morgan Freeman) where he's told that Nick (i.e., him) owes a lot of money but can work it off by killing one man: the son of his biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>Soon after agreeing to do this, Slevin is then picked up by The Rabbi's thugs and told by him that he owes The Rabbi money, too, but can work it off by killing The Boss. Caught between the disbelief of two mob bosses about who Slevin really is, he's forced to make a decision. Or is he? At the beginning of the film we're introduced to a poor family man with a gambling problem. He bets a lot of money on a losing horse and soon he and his family are ""rubbed out"". And who killed the family? Yep. The Boss and The Rabbi before they became enemies. Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, a heartless assassin who eliminates the young boy of the losing gambler with a single bullet to the head. Or did he? Convoluted stories are often so complex that they lose cohesion and I was afraid that this might happen with LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Thankfully it didn't. The complexity is there and subtle, but handled with expert care by Aussie director Paul McGuigan. The flashbacks are impeccably pulled off as are the many action sequences. The fact that it all came together so nicely in the end made the entire movie watching experience effortless. Although I did try and figure out what was happening, there were so many well executed twists and turns that I was continually surprised and delighted.<br/><br/>We always here the words ""ensemble cast"" when certain films come out with a few favorite actors sprinkled here and there, but this time the title is well deserved. Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, Kevin Chamberlin and a smattering of other notables round out this pristine cast.<br/><br/>Comparisons between Tarantino's directorial style and Mr. McGuigan's have been made, but Paul McGuigan's methods, I think, are more subtle in tone but direct in execution (I hope that makes sense!).<br/><br/>The other notable point in the film was location. The filming of the sets held a consistent circular theme to them, including wallpaper, stairways, and cups. This theme is well deserved, as a circle has no beginning and no end."

","Enteraining caper tries to pull a Usual Suspects, but comes across being a little suspect itself. While the movie flies along with assured direction, highlighted by the great cast and peppered with insightful dialog, Slevin definitely is the forerunner for this year's hip crime flick for the uninitiated. For all of it's witty reinvention , Slevin at times comes across as silly, shallow, and quite naive. Although one should suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride with a movie of this nature, too many ""revelatory"" moments in the film's final act sort of bog down the flow, trying a little too hard to shove that shock factor down our throats. Cast is fine, although they rarely achieve anything past the fundamentally cartoonish nature of these larger the life characters, an all too often used move in the world of threateningly entertaining capers catering to the young and hip. Make no mistake, Slevin is a good time to be had, especially if one is in the mood for a watered down Tarantino kind of night, but all of the hype surrounding the plot twists, while at it's best wickedly entertaining, does not really get past the self-importance, and slightly forced hip factor this fun movie sets out to capture."

","Lucky Number Slevin starts off a bit slow, jumping from one scene to another in a seemingly incoherent fashion. It soon picks up the pace as Hartnett keeps scenes lively and fun, while the story is being unfolded layer by layer. Very quickly from then on, the movie keeps you wondering and guessing as to what's really going on, constantly progressing without giving too much away Â— until the very end of course, when it resolves in ways even the most keen observers wouldn't have predicted.<br/><br/>Slevin is a well-balanced cocktail of humor, plot, twists and intriguing storytelling, and any fan of mystery-style movies would do well to check it out."

","*spoiler alert*!!! Wow, this IS an amazing movie to say the least. Under-rated in my opinion. I won't go on and on about the plot, since there are plenty of other people doing that. But, I will say this, this movie plot was flawless, except for Lucy Liu's part. I know it's just a movie, but give me a break, the guy sleeps with her once, not 48 hours passes and he lets her in on the whole plan. Trust doesn't come with sex, as is commonly believed. And for someone to plan throughout their entire life a vengeance on everyone and more involved in their parent's killing, and then divulge everything because of a little roll in the sack seems a complete lack of focus. It makes the lead character seem not as bright and as driven as the rest of the film would have us believe. And, actually, Lucy's role could have been done away with all together and not have it affect the film one bit. Don't get me wrong, she is a good actress and a very sexy woman. But her character just took away from the film's bite. Especially at the end. I might have believed it, if Bruce Willis had acted more of a empathetic father-like figure, but the fact that he didn't, makes Lucy's part seem all the more confusing to me at least."

"The_Void","7","0","3","27 August 2006"," Decent lightweight thriller
","I've got to admit that I always enjoy a well put together little thriller, and while Lucky Number Slevin is far from brilliant; it's a constantly entertaining and quirky little thriller that managers to keep you guessing while delivering a lot to have a good laugh at. The quirky comedy styling is what really makes the film what it is, as Jason Smilovic's screenplay revels in its one-liners, which receive good feedback from the casual nature of the screenplay, which manages to stay relaxed in spite of the high number of plot twists. The film sets itself up very well through a barrage of seemingly unconnected events that prove to have a greater significance later on. Towards the start, we see Bruce Willis' cold assassin break the neck of a stranger in a waiting area, a number of people killed and, most importantly, a man named Slevin that arrives at his friend's flat after a barrage of bad luck. He soon hooks up with the girl next door, before being dragged off in his towel to see the local mob boss, who having mistaken him for his friend; requests a favour for the money owed to him.<br/><br/>The film takes obvious influence from the many 'cool' crime flicks, headlined by the films of Quentin Tarantino. That being said, Paul McGuigan's film appears to realise that it is, in fact, lightweight fluff and this is an asset for the movie as it never tries to be too deep and allows it audience just to have fun with the audacious plot. The film does well in lulling its audience into a false sense of security, as every time we think we know what is going on; the rug is pulled from under, and there's another twist to enjoy. Sometimes this can be annoying, but since Lucky Number Slevin is so irrelevant in its plot and execution, it's more fun to simply believe everything that is thrown at you and enjoy the ride. The film benefits from a good cast of well known stars. Josh Hartnett is good in the 'good looking guy' role, while Lucy Liu is cute enough as the girl next door. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley sleepwalk through their respective roles, and the central cast is rounded off a cool turn from Bruce Willis as a sinister hit-man. Overall, I'm pretty sure I won't remember Slevin for long; but it's good while you're watching it, and provides decent entertainment."

","Lucky Number Slevin is a crime thriller with well-known actors and hilarious names of characters. Jason Smilovic has provided screenplay with enigmatic, precisely planned plot. The storyline is quite convoluted, but not to such an extent that an average viewer could not understand it. The dialogue is witty and quotable. In addition, to my astonishment Paul McGuigan (director of dull The Wicker Park) directs efficiently and keeps a fast pace throughout the film, which is to my mind crucial in this kind of flicks. The well-casted actors did a great job. In particular, Sir Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are amazing as leaders of gangs fighting each other. Josh Hartnett also plays surprisingly well and convincingly. Among the minor vices of the film one can rate: an unnecessary love thread and a bit unoriginal (but surprising) plot. All in all, Lucky Number Slevin is an ingenious crime pic with numerous surprising twists."

","In this world of false promises it is not common for a film to live up to the promises made by its theatrical trailer. Much less for the film to actually surpass them.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin managed to do that with quite some style. And then more. The story is solid, interesting and never boring or overstretched. It nicely builds up the tension in different parts of your brain until it explodes in the dramatic twist in the tale which must surely be one of the best in current Cinema. Not to mention the clever use of shots which we would have already seen before, leading one to wonder: ""How the hell did I manage to miss that!"" And with a running time of slightly more than one and a half hours it is the perfect length to build up the story without over indulging on it. You'll sit up from that sofa with the feeling you get when you've just enjoyed something good, very good.<br/><br/>Verdict: Go rent the DVD now. Better still, buy it."

","After his recent flops, Wicker Park and The Reckoning, Brit director Paul Mcguigan returns to Gangster No.1 territory with this clever gangster flick, and boy is it clever...<br/><br/>Starting off as a story of mistaken identity, the film takes a perhaps obvious twist three quarters of the way through and becomes something entirely different, but you'll have to watch it to find out what, no spoilers here! Josh Hartnett plays Slevin, an innocent man in the wrong place at the wrong time who gets caught up in a bitter gang feud between The Boss (Freeman) and Schlomo (Kingsley). He is told that he owes each gang leader a large sum of money and must do each side a favor to cancel the debt.<br/><br/>The film plays out like a pulp fiction novel with a British flair and comparisons with Guy Ritchie's Revolver can be easily made, though this film is far superior in every department. While Revolver had some clever dialogue, a lot of what was spoken seemed forced and trying too hard to be clever. Lucky Number Slevin never comes across like that, the dialogue is sharp and witty and has some of the best lines found at the cinema this year.<br/><br/>The acting is also top notch, while the jury is still out on Hartnett, he puts in a solid performance here that matches his excellent but brief role in Sin City. Freeman plays against type and plays the villain, but imbues him with his natural charm to create the impression of a mob boss that becomes far more dangerous the more you warm to him. Kingsley is also good and Bruce Willis has a fantastic screen presence as a mostly silent assassin.<br/><br/>This is the film Revolver tried and failed to be. A sharply written, superbly directed American gangster flick with a British influence, Lucky Number Slevin is a film that shows that talented director Paul McGuigan is back to his very best, highly recommended.<br/><br/>http://www.filmcritic.zoomshare.com"

","It may start out pretty slow, but if you keep looking for 15 to 20 minutes it picks up the pace. This gangster movie was very well directed and full with details. The best way to describe it is to see it as a mixture of Payback (1999) and Pulp Fiction (1994). The faint of heart shouldn't watch this movie as the violence is quite direct. Oh, but the story is great! Slevin ( Josh Hartnett - The Faculty, Black Hawk Down) is not so lucky. He gets mistaken for his good buddy Nick Fisher and now gets in trouble with the two biggest kingpins in town aka The Boss (Morgan Freeman - Se7en, Amistad) and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley - Sneakers, Schindler's List).

"darkmarshall","8","0","4","10 July 2006"," Plot Twists... plot twists... and yes, more plot twists.
","I have checked many of the other reviews before deciding to write this one and, like any other movie out there, some hated it and some loved it. I am going to do my best to give everyone a better understanding of the film without actually giving away all the fun of the film.<br/><br/>First off, anyone who says the characters were boring obviously wasn't watching the film all that much. Perhaps they were boring because you were making out with your girlfriend or perhaps they were boring because you just don't like a particular actor, who can say really. I must agree that much of the dialog was ""Gilmore Girls""-esquire while still being of it's own style. It was rapid, witty, and occasionally unrealistic, but that never took away from the movie. Even from the early parts of the movie, the director made sure that the character was just naturally fast talking. I am sure some of you have friends who can babble their way into oblivion and never really even notice the difference.<br/><br/>The film is a bloody mess of murder and mayhem with every genius and idiot in the audience scratching their noggins on what the hell is actually going on. I was that way when I first saw it. Dead guy, dead guy, dead guy, and more dead guys. What is the point of all this murder? And, at first, there was no answer to that question, but an answer does come later in the film. That's why it's there, to keep in the back of your mind until the climax where it all makes sense.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the whole film is a wild and crazy mistaken identity crisis that proves that some people really need to pay more attention to who they are bringing into their house. Especially people who are paranoid about getting killed at any point. That was one little plot hole that confused me, but for the sake of trust toward a little assassin played by Bruce Willis, I suppose it was plausible.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett (Sp?) plays the 'victim' in this caper. He's a self-proclaimed unlucky fellow who finds himself chilling in his old friends apartment when everything goes haywire. While he is there, dressed in a mere bath towel, the sexy Lucy Liu who plays his ol' buddies' neighbor Lindsay, comes walking over for some sugar. Both characters create excellent chemistry while trying to figure what the hell happened to Nick (Lucy's neighbor/Josh's friend) and dealing with their obvious attraction toward each other. My first opinion of Josh Hartnett when he came to the big screen was something to the effect of ""oh great, another teen idol that girls are going to wet their panties over"" and for awhile I was right. Even so, he had raw talent that was more than obvious and it seems that he is getting better and better with each movie he does. This movie was no different. His performance was something of an eye opener for the young actor. <br/><br/>On to the gangsters: Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. Now, I first saw that name, Kingsley, and though: ""Holy sh!t! Gandhi is back!"" except for the fact that Gandhi now turned gangster. Kingsley brought an interesting perspective of a gangster who was getting too old to be very effective, yet still with balls that won't be broken easily. His performance all the way til the end of the movie made me constantly think ""this is an old school bad a$$"" and I am sure if he was able to show those colors, he would have. Morgan Freeman, mind you, I am a little biased towards him since I have been a fan my entire life, was incredible as usual. He has always brought new life to certain characters that may never have been if played by someone else. He was a true to heart a$$hole with very little care for anything save for himself (and in this case, his son).<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, well, he did his Willis thing as the other reviewer aptly said. He was the assassin with, at least from my perspective, a heart of gold. People were confused on why he let the kid live, but I wasn't so confused. Say you are a cold-hearted killer hired to kill a child who had no part and no knowledge of any thing that would cause someone to kill you. Even cold hearted killers aren't mindless idiots who just pull the trigger when ordered to. I guessed this because of his name: Mr. Goodcat. If anyone knows how cats act, they will understand that orders are something that cats know nothing about. They go off basic instinct and a quiet sense of affection when it suits them best. Throughout the movie you gain an assumption that perhaps these two gangsters did something to Goodcat that made him a little less interested in working for them. I was guessing it was some back story that was never told, but should have been to give a bit more credibility to his motives.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie had great style with many scenes that give you a headache because of the crazy wallpaper. If I were to live in any of these places these characters lived in, I would have killed myself. There were a few plot holes, but what movie doesn't have those, and certainly they weren't large enough to throw a fit over. The performances were great, the dialog was witty and entertaining, and the climax leaves you breathless (no pun intended). I recommend it to anyone who likes a lot of blood, a lot of violence, witty dialog, and twists that keep you guessing. If you are a Freeman fan, you will love this movie on that principle alone."

","I was initially wary of this movie because of the awful trailer that made it look like an unoriginal clone of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". Why are American trailers so damn formulaic? They rarely capture the tone, feel or sensibility of what they're selling. The ""Inside Man"" trailer missed the boat also. It did not capture the feel of the movie. It's like everything is being jammed into a template that some idiot once thought had value.<br/><br/>""Lucky Number Slevin"", at least tonally, has more in common with Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" than a Guy Ritchie film. It has a deceivingly languid pace as it sets up its protagonist (Josh Hartnett) and introduces the enigmatic Goodkat (Bruce Willis), surely one of the silver screen's most memorable denizens of late. The plot, which I won't detail here (nothing more boring than a long plot synopsis!), involves an ongoing feud between Ben Kingsley's ""The Rabbi"" and Morgan Freeman's ""The Boss"". Hartnett is sucked into their feud and is forced to use his wits to extract himself. Lucy Liu, looking mighty sexy and playing a coroner, offers him assistance and a warm vagina.<br/><br/>Naturally, nothing ends up being what it first appears, so that's the beauty of the exercise. Director Paul McGuigan, who helmed ""Gangster Number One"", brings a wry style and pitch to the drama, and, working with a really fine score by Joshua Ralph, creates a cinematic jigsaw that feels finely nurtured. The action scenes are swift and gloriously bloody, the performers all have fun (Kingsley is a standout), and the relentless plot revelations, though predictable in a genre context, never feel lazy.<br/><br/>The film did not perform any great feats at the box office, and I'd like to attribute some blame for that to the studio's trailer department. Dropping yet another fast-paced, graphic-heavy, ear-splitting piece of crap on the unsuspecting public didn't do this leisurely paced, smart, off-the-wall, unexpectedly dry thriller any favors."

","It's just...so perfect...it start's a little bit funny and keeps going like that and it ends dramatic, I saw hundred of movies and I didn't expect that. I think the movie is made in such a matter that it keeps you wondering what is going to be next and makes you forget about the little things: why did he kill the dumb guy when he was a professional killer? why when the gun was pointed to the kid's head it showed the bloddy house's background? why don't things add up?it's at half...who is the real Slevin?and so on...it is so absorbing that makes you forget...and I usually anticipate a lot. I think Slevin was given a role that is really matching with Bruce Willis's roles in other movies...ironic, funny and bad...especially tricky. All in one...what a hit. And where do we put that the Kansas City Shuffle was on us this whole time! Hat's off to the producer."
"majohn-1","7","0","6","13 May 2006"," There is a thing called 'too much'.
","I had no idea what this movie was about when my boyfriend dragged me along to see it in the theater yesterday. While I enjoyed the movie, I have to make a quick comment on how the movie was explained to death during the last 20 minutes or so. The explanation was not needed (except Lucy Liu's character and the cop and who he is and how he fits in). It would be highly sufficient, and the movie would actually be better if the audience were left to figure things out for themselves. A good movie is a movie who leaves some things unsaid.<br/><br/>Other than that, go see it for good entertainment. Don't expect to be blown away in any way, because the plot is nothing new, but still worth mentioning as a decent movie."

"footfault","9","0","5","5 May 2006"," Great Movie
","This was probably the best movie I have seen in the past 3 years. Bruce Willis is always awesome, but particularly here. Amazing. Don't know who the actor who played Slevin was, but props for keeping up with an awesome cast. Of course Morgan Freeman can do no wrong, so he kicks a$$ as a mob boss. The bald guy from X-MEN (dont know his name either, sry) was hilarious. Witty dialog, nice action, great camera work. Only thing stopping this from a full out 10 is that my theater was full and a fat guy spilled his drink on me. Honestly, i cant list any improvements. People who say they didn't get it, see it again and PAY ATTENTION. It was amazingly well thought out, but people are used to not have to think in action movies. However, in no way did they spend too much time on the (awesome)plot. Tons of action. This honestly reminded me of about 6 or 7 great movies rolled into one. A must see for all boys young and old, and girls from about 12-35"

","This is the best movie I've ever seen, bar-none. There needs to be more information posted on the web about ""The Kansas City Shuffle."" The performances put on by all of the actors in this movie is superb, and the actual story line for this movie goes above and beyond what a good story line is. This was an excellent movie in every way and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will not go into depth about what the movie is about, because I refuse to ruin it for anyone who wants to go see the movie. This is definitely the kind of flick that you don't want to miss, nor do you want take a bathroom break during the show while watching it. Hopefully this sums up my approval for the movie. I rated the movie a 10 out of 10. Make sure you go and see this movie as you will not be disappointed. This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again. It is also the kind of movie that raises the bar in the movie industry."

","u guys, i don't understand what more u could ask for from a film? intense action, HILLARIOIUS scenes, and i mean hilarious, even the most serious instances will make you start cracking up laughing, a beautiful Asian, and of course there is the ever intense Bruce Willis. this movie was so well scripted, this is proved in many scenes. Bruce and Morgan Freeman are AMAZING, both of which are in this film, and prove that acting is an art not just a hobby. actors of this callibar deserve a chance at the Oscars. josh hartnett is okay, just medium, i think this role was mostly written for the likes of Brad Pitt, but we got stuck with hartnett instead. lucy lu is HOT, bruce is intense, the rabbi is amazing, the two black henchman are just something to fall in love with as soon as u watch the film, this movie is definitely worth two or three watches, there are SO many little easter eggs in it, see if u can catch em all."
"larry.launders","7","0","6","26 April 2006"," Lots of good fun that won't win any awards
","Lucky Number Slevin can leave you guessing until almost the end. I'd say that depends on just how enveloped you let yourself become while watching the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the good stuff: This movie doesn't mess around with getting the ball rolling. People die violently in the first few minutes. Things then settle down into story building, but I do find one hole in Josh Hartnett's character which, in the spirit of the movie, is easily dismissed. And fortunately there is no mysterious reason why the guys doing bad things are afraid to use the most effective tools. You don't have some guy wielding knives at a gunfight, in other words.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu and Morgan Freeman all fit their characters quite well. Ben Kingsly does too, of course, but I couldn't help but feel that the role of the Rabbi did not NEED Kingsley. It almost seemed a waste of his talent. <br/><br/>For American muscle car fans, pay particular attention to the couple of scenes that take place in the parking lot of the horse track. I know there aren't a lot of cars for that period around anymore, but it looks like these guys raided a museum. Real eye candy for a motor head.<br/><br/>The end is, well...a bit drawn out, IMHO. You find out who is who and why everyone who is a target IS a target, and the story line is benefited by not having shown their faces when the story got told early on. In other words you know the history, just not the players.<br/><br/>The movie does a good job of keeping you on your toes, guessing as to what 'really' happened in a couple of places. It's fun, definitely worth a look."
"ccycritic","8","0","6","24 April 2006"," Cross between Memento and True Romance
","I went to catch this movie this weekend, and was a little apprehensive given the generally poor reviews and box office. I just don't understand why this is, because this was about the most interesting movie I've seen in a long time. I think this had one of the most interesting plots I've seen come out of Hollywood in quite a while. It had all of the light-hearted murder and mayhem that Terantino included in True Romance, as well as the superb use of time displacement that Jonathan Nolan exhibited in Memento. The acting here was solid (no awards, but I never felt it was lacking). The pace and directing were both outstanding. All in all, well worth the $8.50 and 2-hour investment!"

","This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire length. As you watch the movie you think you know whats going on but you've got that little feeling in the back of your head thats telling you there's something else thats slipping under your radar.<br/><br/>The ending and opening of this movie are so expertly written that it feels like there's honestly no other way the movie could have closed. Me and my gal left this movie feeling as wired as drinking a pot of coffee, each.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis has a commanding presence in the film and Freeman has the mysterious dangerous air about him, but its Josh who really shines. He portrays the character so well and keeps you riveted to the screen to see what happens next, and more importantly, why.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a flick that will keep you guessing the entire way and make you love it as you sit on only the front part of the chair eyes glued to the screen, Lucky Number Slevin is it."
"danieljamesb","7","0","6","11 April 2006"," Good but not GREAT. Early Summer Movie.
","7.5 out of 10 I thought this movie was good but not great. In the beginning it kicks off a little strange. Your thrown for a loop and if you reach down for some popcorn you could miss a crucial part of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie was good, I mean typical. There weren't very many diverse, difficult, emotional roles to play. There is just your typical movie villains / mob bosses / assassins that you would see in any other movie, only that they are well know expensive ones (ie. Bruce Willis).<br/><br/>The movie does have a twist here and there and eventually all the turmoil makes sense but the twist doesn't leave you speechless like an M. Night Shamalan movie would. It is predictably unpredictable as like most new movies out there. I think I might dip back into my old VHS's again to find something great to watch. This was just good."
"clint-cole","7","0","6","11 April 2006"," Predictably Unpredictable
","This movie did many things good, but failed to do one thing right. Many people compared this movie to 'Snatch' or 'Pulp Fiction', but it fails to compare to either of them. Both of those movies have twists, like this one does, but those twists are less predictable and more entertaining. Both of those movies followed different intersecting plot lines, but the lines were so vividly different that when they did intersect they had violent and entertaining reactions. Sleven had one plot line that jumped around a bit. I was expecting more. With every twist I was mildly amused but not fully entertained.<br/><br/>This was worth the money, and worth the time. Considereing what was out in theaters at the time, it was the best choice.<br/><br/>What I would have changed: Throw in Christopher Walken as one of the bosses, and a villain that isn't a pawn. Someone like Kevin Spacey would have done nicely. Cut Ben Kingsley and you've got a movie. Nothing against Kingsley. He just wasn't right there.<br/><br/>I'm just glad it didn't have Ben Affleck or 50 Cent anywhere in it."
"Bomarsh","10","0","6","11 April 2006"," Excellent Movie!
","Anger, sadness, humor, jubilation, this movie hit 'em all for me. One of the few movies I have actually clapped after. It's definitely not a movie to ""monitor"" as some people do, pay attention! And don't be late. Like any sound construction project, you need a good foundation and in this movie it is laid in the beginning. The acting performances by all were wonderful, but I give special recognition to both Ben Kingsley and Josh Harnett. I've always enjoyed Mr. Kingsley's work, but I was never blown away by his performances until this one. Wow. I personally feel that this may be Josh Hartnett's best work to date. He shows some real acting maturity and range in this film. If you like movies where you actually have to follow the plot, you'll love this film."
"mrmikewnaylor","10","0","5","10 April 2006"," Was the greatest surprise in films I have had in years.
","This film was very well written and the acting was superb. Without question the best movie I have seen this year and is now in my top 25 movies of all time. I loved all of the acting not heavy on special effects and truly a unique and fresh script. Excellent film! One of my favorite film icons and yes I say icon because he is changing Hollywood Mr. Mark Cuban who would have had this released on PPV and the DVD for sale on the release date. If the DVD had been for sale in the lobby as I left the theater I would have bought it and watched it again over the next few days. That's how good it was. Look for this film to do really well with consumers. STUPID RULE TO HAVE TO WRITE TEN LINES TO BE POSTED! COME ON IMDb GET A LIFE. HOW ABOUT FIVE LINES?"
"blashco","9","0","5","9 April 2006"," Not The Usual Suspects good, but good
","This movie is a movie all about the ending. When I was watching it through, I was weirded out by the lame dialogue. Instead of just talking, they would dance around what they had to say and then about 50 seconds later, they would say it.<br/><br/>The acting was great, but Lucy Liu or whoever was annoying. She never shut up. <br/><br/>The directing was great, it always somewhat confused you, but wouldn't make you have to replay the scene in your head to understand it. Unless, of course, you are stupid or the president.<br/><br/>The music was OK, nothing that would top John Williams, but it fit. <br/><br/>The plot was sweet, but like i said before, the dialogue had some holes that needed to be filled in.<br/><br/>But in the end, you just are forced into liking the movie. The right amount of people die, and the entire story of the past and present fit together like clockwork.<br/><br/>So I'd say that it is probably the best movie this year so far, and to definitely see it."
"tricksixxx","6","0","9","9 April 2006"," Fun but overplayed at times....
","I REALLY wanted to like this movie. In fact I shouldn't say I didn't like Lucky Number Slevin, because I did. Instead I should say I expected better after reading the reviews and watching the trailer for it. A couple of key elements hold Lucky Number Slevin together so we will start with those. The script is amazing. The writing and dialog between characters is very well written and is on par with this year's ""V for Vendetta"" (which also had a very well-written script). Josh Hartnett and Lucy Liu played much better than expected and earn some credit in my book since I haven't seen them impress me much in the past. Also, the chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley was outstanding and the scenes they were in were masterfully written. With that said there are to many flaws present to give this movie higher than a 6. First and foremost is Bruce Willis. It seems to me he is a hit and miss kind of guy. He hit big with Sin City and missed big with Lucky Number Slevin. Though his dialog was nice, he didn't portray his role the way I think it was written and instead acted bland and boring. Realizing that assassins most likely aren't the most dramatic people on earth, I bring forth the idea that he is supposed to be some sneaky ghost of a man. He is supposed to be creepy and slide in the shadows, and Bruce Willis just didn't pull off that vibe to me. Also, the ""twist"" in the movie wasn't all that good and seemed like a generic way to end the film. Also I was surprised IMDb didn't put a main genre of this as comedy, since most of it was obviously intended to be comedic. In fact, most of it is comedic up until the last 20 minutes or so. It tries to be something sneaky like the usual suspects, but just fails to enthrall me. It takes itself like the best movie this year, when really I'd rather watch Slither. Good effort by the screenplay writer though and Josh Hartnett deserves his props for sure. 6/10"
"enlynka","6","0","7","9 April 2006"," plot had a good twist to it.
","Acting was good. Too violent overall. <br/><br/>Note: actor mykelti williamson was not shown on your list of<br/><br/>credits. His name was shown on the credits at the end of the film itself. He had a small role but the way he was made up (false teeth type overbite) reminded you too much of how he looked in Forrest Gump. This took away from the seriousness of his character.<br/><br/>The accent used by the character ""The Rabbi"" was realistic and ""catchy"". Morgan Freeman was good as usual. The story line around the character played by Stanley Tucci was a bit weak: little far-fetched.<br/><br/>Still, the plot kept you guessing."
"jdesando","Null","0","6","1 April 2006"," A saucy mock thriller
","""I'm a world-class assassin, F---head,"" exclaims Brice Willis's Mr. Goodkat to hero Josh Hartnett's Slevin, a young man the target of mobsters in a classic case of mistaken identity. Willis has a minimalist charm that makes him everybody's hit man, as cool as any hood coming out of the tongue-in-cheek school of Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty, or North by Northwest. In fact, he survives quite well working for both sides of two warring New York gangster clans. He describes the catalytic event for the story as a ""Kansas City shuffle,"" a gambling term hinting at the reversals of almost every scene in this riff on film noir wrapped in a stylish con.<br/><br/>When the crime bosses are played by Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley, it would seem futile for Hartnett to go nose to nose with those thespian icons. But he does successfully. The script calls for underplaying the violence and irony and for a light-hearted delivery contrasting the murders while playing with the girl next door, charmingly acted by Lucy Liu as Lindsey.<br/><br/>Just as playful is cinematographer Christopher Sova's color scheme, with enough variety to make the wildest Asian DP jealous. On the other hand, Joshua Ralph's original music is unenviable.<br/><br/>Lucky Number Slevin was a selection for the 2006 Sundance Film Festival but not a thunderous winner. Then again, its smug, self-reflective wit, lost in the resolution of the film but everywhere Slevin has a chance to shoot off his mouth, may have been overdone. Even starry-eyed Park-City visitors are smart enough to spy a phony.<br/><br/>But then, like The Usual Suspects, nothing is as it seems in this saucy thriller, so just sit back and enjoy the twistshardly in the Memento leaguesome of which you can see coming and others amusingly a surprise."
