"MacAindrais","10","75","78","9 April 2006"," Au Revoir, Louis Malle.
","Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****<br/><br/>What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.<br/><br/>In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. <br/><br/>Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. <br/><br/>Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. <br/><br/>We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. <br/><br/>These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. <br/><br/>Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. <br/><br/>Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.<br/><br/>4/4"
"Sloke","10","120","127","5 August 1999"," Lived-in feeling gives sad film great depth
","The movie was a project close to Louis Malle's heart (he was in tears when the film premiered at a film festival in 1987) and it shows in the multi-layered treatment he gives the central setting, this fascinating boarding school with its broad cast of characters. Because there are so many different strands and affecting moments tangential to the central plot, one is not entirely prepared for the finale even if you are expecting it. French film is characteristically digressive, often to a fault, but here it works to splendid advantage. It also lends itself to repeat viewings.<br/><br/>I don't think you need to have lived in occupied Europe to appreciate this wonderful film; it speaks to all of us who have lived through childhood's quickly-passing parade and know its lifelong regrets. That last image of the stone wall is emblazoned in many consciousnesses, as it is in mine.<br/><br/>There are many interesting choices Malle makes in this film. For example, while the central subject is the Holocaust, nearly all the Germans we actually see in the film are fairly decent if nonetheless menacing types. The real villains here are almost entirely French collaborators, which was done I think to call attention to collaboration during a period when the French were dealing with the Klaus Barbie trial. [Barbie was a Gestapo officer who was aided in his work rooting out Resistance leaders by many French collaborators.] But casting French people as the heavies also suggests the central evil of prejudice and oppression is not something exclusive to one nationality, and it broadens the scope of the movie.<br/><br/>The tender treatment Malle affords the Catholic hierarchy in the movie is unusual, too, when you see other more anti-clerical Malle efforts like ""Murmur of the Heart."" There is an unexpected sense of spirituality throughout this film, somewhat muted but there all the same.<br/><br/>This may well stand as the cinematic masterpiece of a man who, at his best (see also ""Atlantic City"" and ""My Dinner With Andre"") was to motion pictures what his countrymen Zola and Hugo were to novels: An artist who filled his canvas with the verve and breadth of human life."
"francheval","10","53","59","14 February 2006"," Best french movie, highly recommended
","""Goodbye children"" is to director Louis Malle what ""The Pianist"" has been to Roman Polanski. These are movies that dealt with intimate matters related to painful childhood experiences, both taking place in occupied Europe during WW2. In both cases, it is palpable that they were movies that these directors had planned to make for a long time, but they waited until they had achieved a considerable degree of recognition at the end of their careers, so that they would feel self assured enough to carry their project out.<br/><br/>""Goodbye children"" evolves around two essential guidelines : the first one is the historical background of France during WW2. The second one is about childhood friendship and loss.<br/><br/>There are quite a lot of movies that were set in France during WW2, but the matter of collaboration of the French with the Germans was still a sensitive subject in 1987. A decade before, Louis Malle had made a film called ""Lacombe Lucien"", portraying a young French peasant entering the Gestapo as a way of social promotion, and it caused quite a controversy. Things had quietened a bit though, when ""Goodbye children"" came out, and most of the people who had lived through the period as children seemed to be pleasantly reminded of childhood memories, as the boarding school and its characters appears to be a very good reflection of reality.<br/><br/>Ugly as it has been, collaboration was nothing else as a survival policy. In war time and or/dictatorship, people rarely afford to have moral dilemmas, and this is well shown in the movie as a thriving black market goes on among children at the boarding school. The character of Joseph, an illiterate limping cook, is the one who gets blamed when the black market scandal breaks out, and loses his job. He is also the one who is going to sell out everybody, by revenge. He betrays because he feels betrayed. When one has seen ""Lacombe Lucien"", it impossible not to make a link between the two characters.<br/><br/>""Goodbye children"" is also a very good study of the division among French people at the time. When an old Jewish man is arrested at the restaurant by the French ""milice"" (political police under the Vichy regime), there is as much applause as protest. What comes as a surprise is the positive role played by the church, impersonated here by Father Jean, who is in fact a resistant hiding Jewish children and holds provocative sermons during mass. There definitely existed such priests, and it is all the more surprising to get that portrayal from a left-wing director like Louis Malle.<br/><br/>The plot evolves around two very different young boys. One, Julien, comes from a typical French upper-class family, he is both gifted and spoiled. The other, Jean, is the typical Jewish boy, brilliant but secretive. Of course, no one among the college boys knows that Jewish kids are hiding there under false identities. Julien is at first both irritated and intrigued by this odd rival, but as they confront, they gradually become implicit allies. Their bonding is well illustrated by a few scenes, for example when they get lost together in the woods, or when they play piano during a bomb alert.<br/><br/>As it can be expected from twelve year old boys, they only scantly express an attachment which becomes all the more real. The very fact that a film about child friendship is done by a director who is past fifty is a revealer of its very importance in a whole lifetime. Julien only realizes the price of it when Jean is arrested by the Gestapo, and waves discreetly as he walks out the college door, never to be seen again. The final shot of Julien's disarrayed face, which appears chillingly mature for the first time, is a very powerful one. But well, Louis Malle was not an amateur.<br/><br/>""Goodbye children"" is also a major film about loss, and it gets all the more effective in doing so that it ends abruptly, leaving you with a feeling of irreversibility. You never quite know how long you are going to know someone, how long you still will be there, you are rarely quite aware when you see someone for the last time. It is only when people are gone forever that you can realize how meaningful they were to you.<br/><br/>If you are studying French or interested in French culture, this is really a movie which, as a Frenchman myself, I would recommend because it is both excellent, accessible and representative. Unsurprisingly, it received several Cesars, including the one of the best film of the year (Cesars are our French equivalent of Oscars)."
"msalifa","Null","47","57","22 June 2003"," touching film; probably based on an actual event
","This is a very moving film, most likely based on an actual event. The Carmelite priest,Lucien Bunel (1900-1945, ""Pere Jacques"") was founder and director of the Petit College d'Avon, near Fontainebleau. He was arrested on Jan. 15, 1994, accused of hiding 3 Jewish boys among his students, and was deported to the infamous Mauthausen concentration camp. He died in Linz, Austria on June 2, 1945. Malle's film depicts the intense trauma of Jewish children who were separated from their families and forced to take on a new identity in hiding, always afraid of being found out. They also faced the dilemma of how to maintain their Jewishness in the setting of a Catholic school. So, not just another war movie, this film depicts some of the real struggles facing hidden children, many of whom were saved by courageous Christians in Europe."
"bouncingoffwall","10","47","58","6 September 2003"," Stunning Work of Art
","In this spellbinding film, Louis Malle is able to evoke the fear and sadness some children suffer while away from home at a boarding school, the loneliness. Yet he doesn't dwell on sentimentality but only skims it, instead peppering the scenes with the bravura and faux assertiveness of adolescents. Malle and the actors adroitly juggle circumstances and emotions. Ultimately, they capture a terrifying time in history through the eyes and uncertainty of boys who aren't as grown-up as they'd like to think.<br/><br/>The two main characters, Julien Quentin and Jean Bonnet, are beautifully portrayed by two very capable and talented young actors. The supporting cast is equally impressive. The film is directed with a touch of genius, and holds its own when compared to another motion picture masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird."
"dbdumonteil","Null","31","38","23 February 2003"," and hello again Louis Malle!
","Possible SPOILERS. After having led a roaming and chaotic life during more than ten years abroad, Louis Malle came back in France and made the movie he was always to make. This one was rewarded in Venise where it won the golden Lion in 1987. ""au revoir les enfants"" tells the story of a friendship between the son of a wealthy family, Julien and a Jew boy, Jean Bonnet hidden under a false identity. However, at first sight, nothing lets see the start of a friendship between Julien and Jean. Julien feels admiration and curiosity towards this new student but we don't really know why and Jean pretends not to see him. A few events will bring them closer, especially a treasure hunt in the woods... It's a touching, moving and finally tragic story because the intervention of the Gestapo will lead this friendship to an end between the two boys. It's not the first time that a Louis Malle's movie takes place during the second world war. In 1974, ""Lacombe Lucien"" told the story of a young peasant who found his place in the Gestapo. If this movie had divided the French public, ""au revoir les enfants"" will provoke the unanimity. Both movies are successful and strong but ""Lacombe Lucien"" is a rough fiction whereas the other one is partly autobiographical. With this movie, Malle eagered to recall a memory that upset him when he was at school: the arrest of a few Jew children who were hidden under a false identity. This is this memory that he filmed in the last sequence. This last one is carefully prepared and filmed in the minute details as if Malle wanted to recall exactly what he saw it and then don't think about it definitely. This is one of Malle's most beautiful movies and his last great one."

","On seeing this movie several years ago my accompanying colleagues said of the film: what a load of self-indulgent, confusing, French stylized rubbish. They bemoaned the slow pace of the film, of the 2 dimensional directing and lack of any action or violent death scenes!<br/><br/>Those words still linger with me now and has made me realise that perhaps a lot of the movie-going public these days feed on the latest sfx pyrotechnics, more ingenious ways of abstract killings, lots of needless sex and not letting a good intelligent story get in the way.<br/><br/>Films like Les Enfants are going to be even more difficult to track down if Hollywood and some of the European studios opt for the fast Buck route to riches.<br/><br/>Les Enfant is a truly wonderful & yet harrowing account of life in a Catholic boys boarding school during the dying embers of the Nazi occupation of France in WW2. One of the new boys happens to be Jewish but the headmaster chooses to keep such identities covert while still offering him sanctuary and an education in spite of all the risks he takes.<br/><br/>To be fair I know little of Louis Malle previous to this film, but I think he must have poured his life's soul into writing & directing Les Enfant.<br/><br/>No detail, harrowing or otherwise, is spared; we see so much beauty amongst the horrors of occupation & collaboration; but also the blossoming relationship between the two lead boys and how initial envy & hatred of the Jew is somewhat diluted by the realities that this is no infantile school game but that life and death for the Jewish boy hangs by a thread if anyone at the school should reveal his true identity.<br/><br/>The final moments are perhaps one of the most sad & dramatic scenes I have ever seen. These days a lot of people would be waiting for some great heroic entrance from a big movie star to sort out all the misery and leave us with a reassurance that ""it really wasn't all that bad back then was it"".<br/><br/>But there are no heroes at the end of this movie, at least not the kind of heroes Hollywood serves up. The boys in this film are the true heroes right to the very end, primarily for their spirit of humanity in the face of impossible odds.<br/><br/>This is the hard reality of war amongst children growing up not only in the face of their own adolescence (and all the problems that serves), but also with the dark fingered claw of Nazism hanging menacingly like the the Scythe of the Grim Reaper.<br/><br/>This film will move you in so many directions and will hopefully bring you back down to earth from the current Hollywood shallow circus of pap & style-over-content.<br/><br/>Its a difficult film to track down, and the reason for this can be attributed to the first paragraph of this review.<br/><br/>*****/*****"
"DeeNine-2","10","47","62","17 March 2000"," A work of genius
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of cinema, a work of genius by one of the greatest directors, Louis Malle. He does everything with the barest touch, just the slightest emphasis, without rancor or any loading of the deck. He understates and plays fair always. He has complete control of his story and of the audience. He knows what they believe and what they expect. He respects that, but he doesn't cater, and he is very gentle about leading us to the conclusion. He makes it beautiful although it is horrible.<br/><br/>Gaspard Manesse as Julien and Raphael Fejto as Jean are unforgettable and a reminder that in film it's important to have a good cast. Yet, I suspect Malle could have made geniuses of any number of talented young boys in their parts. This is your Catholic boys school coming of age film without lecherous priests or the brutality of children; that is, no more than is necessary, just what is real and seen in perspective, the context being the Nazi occupation of France in 1944. It is amazing how Malle manages to show the bestiality and brain dead stupidity of the Nazis by presenting them at their most gentle. If one can damn by faint praise, one can destroy by contrast. Compared to what is human and natural we see the Nazis, as their pretentious Reich is falling apart, chasing after children, obsessed with psychotic racist delusions. Through the objective eyes of the children we see the evil. Malle need only let the facts speak for themselves.<br/><br/>I think artists working in any medium would benefit from study of this film.<br/><br/>What it says to us is be honest, be fair, keep it simple, but not too simple. Use not a brush stroke more than necessary, and pay attention to every detail, especially the small ones. But while we can learn from and appreciate, it takes genius to pull it off. It can't be done by connecting the dots.<br/><br/>I am struck by a little irony on the jacket of the video. It has an early Siskel and Ebert quote: 'One of the year's best films.' That's a little embarrassing unless the year is a hundred years long.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the sublime, beautiful and wondrously talented Irène Jacob made her debut here in a small part as a piano teacher."
"sjlinnyc","10","39","52","23 June 2002"," Why isn't this available on video/DVD?
","Louie Malle's film is a deeply personal examination of the Holocaust, childhood friendship and accidental betrayal. Its young protagonists are affable without being overly sweet or cloying, and despite the semi-autobiographical nature of the story, Malle never gives over to cheap sentimentality the way Steven Spielberg might. While this is one of the films that got lost in the quagmire of Orion Classics, other titles from this period have been rescued and released on DVD through MGM. Long since out of print on VHS, it's shameful this film isn't readily available to those who might wish to examine the Holocaust from a different cinematic perspective, or to those seeking a powerful story that never falls prey to pathos."
"sharky_55","8","6","6","5 March 2016"," Au revoir les enfants
","Upon the first viewing of Au revoir les enfants, we are as engrossed into the mystery of Jean Bonnet as the young Julien Quentin is. And on a second viewing, the little clues become a great deal clearer, and we are able to piece together the puzzle a little quicker than the inquisitive young boy. But of course the modern older viewer has the frame of context and knowledge that Julien does not have - he knows the telltale signs of a Jew, but cannot figure out why they are hunted and persecuted so diligently, when all he sees is one of his close friends. And so the entire film is tinged in regret; even as Jean reminds him that he would have been caught anyway, we feel the chain of events that lead to that monumental morning being so painful to remember, and that one fatal glance that led to a death on his hand. <br/><br/>Louis Malle works with his memories and experiences, and here he has crafted a group of young schoolboys so reminiscent and convincing. He has captured that remarkable knack and ability of young boys to be able to hastily create relationships out of nothing, sever them, and hastily mend them all over. They pipe up at any opportunity to make a joke on someone else's behalf, and take playful violence to the limit, and are all friendly the next day. And any child would remember cheering whenever they got a break from school-work - here it is within the grim context of air raids, but they cheer anyway, and when the teacher starts a prayer, they all instinctively join in. <br/><br/>Why this succeeds is that Malle does not overdo the World War 2 setting; these boys certainly do not take the war so seriously, so he takes on that viewpoint. They playact as knights on stilts and knock each other over as real soldiers fight, but it might as well be another day for them. They trade books with dirty stories in them, and cackle at a rare viewing of Chaplin. When a German soldier stands up to a French collaborator in the restaurant and the whole establishment rallies around an elderly Jewish customer, there is an sinister undercurrent about it, but this is viewed through the innocent lens of Julien, who seems to know that what is happening is bad, and instinctively covers for his Jewish friend, but does not understand why being Jewish is bad thing. <br/><br/>He is at the centre of the narrative, at the tender age where he is still a mummy's boy, but like many blossoming teenagers puts on a braver, cooler front: indeed his first lines to Jean are a thinly veiled threat to not mess with him. He has little moments of cheekiness and intelligence, bartering his mother's jam and pretending to drown in the bathtub to avoid the wrath of taking too long. And there is a subplot of his uncertainty around his future aspirations that links towards the courageous actions of the priest Père Jean; mentors whisper that he does not quite have the calling of priesthood, and his mother coddles and suggests taking on the same occupation as his father in engineering, and in the same vein his piano playing is not quite up to scratch, so he is recommended taking up violin. But he does have those same qualities as Père Jean anyway. A bitter Joseph mocks him for being so pious and generous when it is war and it is every man for himself - ""They're just Jews,"" he spits outs. But it is the rejection of this statement by Julien that rings so true and brave - it is in those small acts of defiance, and those brief friendships that shine brightly in the darkness of the Holocaust, that our humanity remains."

","This movies is one of those movies that you can love, but hate.  It makes you hate what happens in the movie.  You get so attached to the characters, and when things happen to them, you hate it.  But the movie is powerful, wonderfully written and directed by Louis Malle and defiantly should be seen anytime one is studying WWII or the Holocost, or if you have free time, and are looking for a good heart-wrencher.  I watched it in French, with subtitles, and that makes it all the better."

","Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987)<br/><br/>A wrenching, sensitive, all-too-true drama set in a gorgeous French wooded outpost during World War II. The main actors are boys, and they play their parts with unusual conviction, unexaggerated but with intensity. And the anti-Semitism that arises, though inevitable in Nazi territory, comes subtly and really stings. The movie isn't complete without this horror, but the horror is made complete by the really vivid recreation of this kind of private boys school--a period movie at its best.<br/><br/>Director Louis Malle has not only a message, but a sensitive feel for the medium--for making fluid the flow and background of the plots of his films. It's also a fairly complex mix of types, and you can somehow keep them all straight as it goes--as straight as you are meant to as the facts unfold. In the end, it confirms a familiar story of Nazi terror, but one that can't be told too often."

"Polaris_DiB","9","8","10","7 August 2006"," Malle's masterpiece
","I've seen this movie twice, and in the context of the situations I've seen them provides two good ways to approach this film, so I'll do both.<br/><br/>The first context was when I saw it in French class in high school. Beyond just being the typical ""movie during class!"" experience, I thought it was pretty amazing anyway: the two children actors who play Julien and Bonnet are extremely talented and perfectly encapsulate two children of the period, the story is heart-felt and visceral at the same time, and the ending has a tendency to stick in ones conscience.<br/><br/>At the very least you have that. But in the context of the 3 Films of Louis Malle box set released through Criterion, it has its own aspect of interest. The first is how it combines the two themes of the previous two films, coming-of-age and the German occupation of France, into what Malle seems to be wanting to talk about all along. The most important thing is that this time it's true. You don't even need to research that, you can feel it as you watch.<br/><br/>Not that it isn't without it's stylizations of cinema, but that's what makes it great. Especially amazing is the fear that runs throughout it, even in smaller scenes. The two key moments involving this fear, though, are especially great: the woods and the end. The woods are mostly childish fear, illusive and imagined, yet it gets the spectator's heart pounding. The end is real, and thus much more disturbing and helpless. The change in maturity of the character moves from an abstract (""I think about death all the time"") to a concrete (""I'll remember every second of that day for the rest of my life""), and yet the feeling of fear through an artist's mind is still a drive to create something as strong and engaging as this work.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"River4Rain","10","6","7","10 June 2003"," a very touching movie with fine acting
","You could say this is a war-movie, but it's told from a very original POV. You see how the children in the school cope with the war and the occupation by the Germans. The tensed atmosphere in the local boarding school is very well set when a couple of new boys arrive. Rather by accident Julien finds out they're Jewish and that the priests are hiding them. Sadly the boys are discovered and taken away by the Germans in a very touching, though not melodramatic end.<br/><br/>If you want to see a war-movie which shows another side of the occupation, and you like to see a bit of fine acting, this is the one to see!"
"lee_eisenberg","10","3","3","20 October 2016"," child's memory of occupation
","After a few years making movies in the United States, Louis Malle returned to his native France and made ""Au revoir les enfants"", based on his memories of growing up in Nazi-occupied France. The movie focuses on the friendship between two boys in a Carmelite boarding school, one of whom is keeping his real identity secret.<br/><br/>A particularly effective scene is in the restaurant. There are some Wehrmacht officers at a table, but they keep to themselves. Then the Milice enters and orders a Jewish patron out of the restaurant. The Wehrmacht officers then order the Milice to leave. This emphasizes not only the role of the Vichy government, but also the role of the collaborators in every country that Germany occupied.<br/><br/>I haven't seen all of Malle's movies, but this is probably the best of his movies that I've seen. The final scene has to be one of the most chilling in cinema history. I recommend the movie."

","Another fine film by Louis Malle. An understated drama about two pubescent boys, one of whom is a Jew hiding from the Germans. The pacing is slow, but the various dramatic are scenes telling. The ominous ending creeps up like a thief in the night and the finale comes down like a sledgehammer. Even if it is as subtle as can be.<br/><br/>Gaspard Manesse, on whose character the film focuses mostly in the first part, plays wonderfully natural, but I have no complaints on any of the cast. And the setting of rural France is beautiful to boot.<br/><br/>This may not be the sort of film I watch a lot, but from to time, I can really appreciate it. A good 8 out of 10."
"Doylenf","7","5","6","24 October 2007"," Friendships, coming of age and loss of innocence during World War II...
","Emotionally engrossing coming of age story for boys at a French Catholic boarding school during World War II, where subtle changes in friendship evolve during a time when Jews were being persecuted by the Nazis and sent to extermination camps. Told from the boyhood viewpoint of children, it captures the fearful nature of children under enormous pressure from outside sources they cannot comprehend.<br/><br/>The semi-biographical account by Louis Malle of a time he spent at such a boarding school is driven by the focus on two boys: Julien (GASPARD MANESSE) and Jean (RAPHAEL FEJTO), a French boy and a Jewish lad, respectively. They carry the main burden of the story and are both excellent in a cast that is uniformly good.<br/><br/>The rambunctious behavior of a bunch of Catholic school boys is something I can relate to personally, having sung in a choir as a boy where I was surprised at the ruffians who, behind the scenes, were like street youths full of boyish pranks and rough-housing, until summoned to walk out to the altar of the church, hands clasped in front of them like little cherubs. This aspect of the French boys in the film rang true to me, their behavior being very true to life.<br/><br/>The story is compelling, dealing as it does with the Nazis determined to find every Jewish lad they could, aided sometimes by collaborators who for one reason or another turned in Jews to the German officers. The ending is particularly poignant and well acted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended and stands as a reminder of the cruelties of childhood and war."
"WriterDave","10","7","10","8 June 2006"," A Masterpiece
","There once was a small class of master filmmakers well studied in the now seemingly lost art of cinematic subtlety. Louis Malle was their king. Lovingly and desperately inspired by his own childhood attending a French Catholic boarding school where a handful of Jewish children were being hidden, ""Au Revoir, Les Efants"" is a film of small moments leading to one of the most heartbreaking finales you will ever see. What makes it so tragic and resonant is the subtle build-up. Malle's on-screen alter ego Julien is a spoiled kid who reluctantly befriends one of the new kids who he later discovers is Jewish. The progression of their friendship and the day-to-day activities at the school are done without one bit of pretense and so laize-faire, that when the accidental betrayal occurs with a simple glance in the classroom witnessed by the Gestapo, it happens so casually and naturally that neither we, nor Julien, can even begin to process it until long after the film has ended. That's subtle film-making at its best.<br/><br/>Louise Malle crafted a masterpiece showing both the innocent child's view of WWII and the almost insane passivity adopted not only by the French (who didn't seem to mind being occupied as long as they could drink their wine and smoke their cigarettes) but by a greater portion of the world that was asleep at the wheel and allowed the Holocaust to happen. With nary a scene of violence or warfare to be found on the screen, ""Au Revoir, Les Efants"" is probably the most low-key film you will ever find on the topic, and long after it's over, its universal themes and quiet tragedies will haunt you."

The acting is INCREDIBLE, any American movie with as many child characters would fail miserably.<br/><br/>Anyone watching this movie should NOT be discouraged by the first few minutes.

","An elegantly crafted tale of friendship, compassion & boyhood, Au Revoir Les Enfants is a heartbreaking, poignant & tragic cinema that's actually based on the events which took place during the childhood of this film's director and is an endearing portrait of life at school, student rivalry & beauty of friendship.<br/><br/>Set in France during the final years of the Second World War, the events of Au Revoir Les Enfants takes place in a Catholic boarding school and is narrated through the eyes of Julien Quentin; one of the students at the school. The plot covers his relationship with a newly arrived enigmatic student with whom he's at odds at first but the two learn to get along & share a big secret.<br/><br/>Directed by Louis Malle, the film is nicely crafted with many details beautifully captured by its calmly moving camera. The screenplay tries to get an authentic vibe of education in Catholic schools, the conversations between its characters carry the childlike innocence & the performances by its cast, especially the child actors, becomes more captivating as the story progresses.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Au Revoir Les Enfants (also known as Goodbye Children) isn't in anyway a hard-hitting or emotionally scarring cinema but the gentle manner in which it depicts its premise really makes you care for its characters, makes you wish they get away, makes you wish for a miracle & although its subject matter has been dealt in a better manner, the film is worthy of a watch for its two main characters alone."
"Winduct","8","2","2","28 October 2013"," Powerful and moving
","''Au Revoir Les Enfants'' is a very touching film about two children in a French boarding school who form a bond and share a dangerous secret. The film reflects the director's childhood life, Louis Malle, who as a kid witnessed three Jewish children and a priest being deported to Auschwitz during his stay in a boarding school. Deeply moving and realistic, ''Au Revoir Les Enfants'' is a film about friendship which challenges the viewer's emotions.<br/><br/>Malle directs the film with great care and makes sure that his characters go through their emotional journey without revealing themselves instantly. This gives great realism to the film as well as to its actors' performances. At 104 minutes, the film takes its time but by the end, we have witnessed an entire voyage of two children who despite their initial conflicts, come together and unveil their sensitive sides as children. Malle's direction does all that and the result is a film that doesn't force the audience to shed a tear like a melodrama rather than just tell us a powerful true story of bondage with realism.<br/><br/>Being a film where most of the characters are children, it would be very difficult to drain amazing performances from the leads. However, Louis Malle's meticulous direction allows the film to have a great emotional impact on the audience while guiding his young actors through the story. The two young protagonists (Gaspard Manesse, Raphaël Fejtö) give very natural performances which contribute very nicely to the film. They do not try to show off but they gradually expose themselves to the emotions and situations they find themselves in. What makes the children's performances so effective is that they portray authenticity . Their performances are raw and honest (At the end of the film, Manesse's performance leaves a very strong mark as he watches his best friend leaving with the Gestapo and waves at him while tearing silently, knowing that he will never see him again).<br/><br/>The film features no musical score (other than the children playing the piano in some parts of the film) but it proves not to be a weakness to the film's powerful story. Louis Malle's script is carefully written, clever and poignant.<br/><br/>If you are into films with a good, simple and moving story along with great performances, this is a recommend French classic that even after 26 years since its initial release, evokes strong emotions to its audience."

","A French boarding school run by priests seems to be a haven from World War II until a new student arrives. He becomes the roommate of top student in his class. Rivals at first, the roommates form a bond and share a secret.<br/><br/>The film is based on events in the childhood of the director, Louis Malle, who at age 11 was attending a Roman Catholic boarding school near Fontainebleau. One day, he witnessed a Gestapo raid in which three Jewish students and a Jewish teacher were rounded up and deported to Auschwitz. The school's headmaster, Père Jacques, was arrested for harboring them and sent to the concentration camp at Mauthausen. He died shortly after the camp was liberated by the U.S. Army, having refused to leave until the last French prisoner was repatriated.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, I much prefer the earlier work of Malle. ""Zazie"" and ""Elevator to the Gallows"" are both great. People tend to like his later work, including this film and ""My Dinner With Andre"". I will give this film credit for one thing: it is uncompromising, and nice to see Malle opted for the French. By this point, he was married to Candice Bergen and living in Beverly Hills, and could have easily made this a Hollywood picture. He chose not to."

","Netflix offers this movie on DVD, so it is at least available through them, if not elsewhere. Well worth owning.<br/><br/>I like the earlier review comments about this being a non-sentimental, non Hollywood treatment of real people and a very real issue.<br/><br/>Vivre la France. Hollywood & the US have a lot to learn in my opinion about what it takes to communicate an authentically human experience in film. Louis Malle did not aim at a mass market, and clearly was not interested primarily in commercial success. There is nothing wrong with commerce, but it isn't art. I think what distinguishes a film like this (and so many french films, highbrow or lowbrow)is an ability to capture and communicate authentic experiences, immediately recognizable human experiences. To my mind this film is worth any price simply because of its depiction of two boys faces, watching a Charlie Chaplin news reel remake of the famous ship filled with Jewish refugees turned back as it tried to enter the US. The news reel pans the Statue of Liberty in NY's harbor, then the quick, jerky movements of refugees being roped off and contained. Then the two boys faces. The French boy's face is oddly blank and not quite entertained. The Jewish boy's face recognizes what he sees. Yet there is no movement, the boys are the same age, friends, in the same school. It is a haunting, irreversible moment. <br/><br/>Why do so few of these moments exist in made-for-the-market movies?<br/><br/>Get this one if you want to be reminded what it is not to be made for the market."
"MartinHafer","9","4","6","20 August 2005"," excellent
","There's not a whole lot negative to say about the film. This is yet another excellent film about the holocaust. What I especially like about it is that it offers a view that is not typical of other films (i.e., the perspective of children in a boarding school). This unusual perspective lifts it about other holocaust films--nearly to the same level as the wonderful Shop On Main Street (from Czechoslovakia). It, too, had an unusual perspective.<br/><br/>The one thing, though that surprised me was that there were some sympathetic German soldiers in the film--such as the one who told the self-important French collaborator to leave the restaurant and leave the Jewish man alone as well as the apparently decent soldiers that brought the two lost boys home. Though surprising, it did add to the picture in that both good and bad Germans as well as good and bad Frenchmen are presented.<br/><br/>This film would be acceptable to watch by most anyone. Despite Malle having made many non-family friendly films, this one has very little objectionable material. For younger viewers, I would recommend watching the film with them, as it is sure to bring up a lot of confusion and emotional issues for younger viewers."
"writers_reign","10","4","6","14 June 2005"," Goodbye To All That
","The fact that this film is highly autobiographical - Louis Malle did in fact witness the central events, was himself a boarder at a Catholic school run by priests during the Second World War - should not be a contributory factor either way to its impact on the viewer. The only relevant question should be,Is it any good? Answer: an overwhelming Yes. Malle waited years before he attempted to recapture the key incidents of his youth if not, indeed, his life and the result is a superb film, arguably far better than a younger Malle, much closer in time to the events would have produced. I write as someone born and bred in England, a country very much a part of the War in question but one never actually invaded so I am not really qualified to expound on the rights and wrongs of portraying the occupying Germans in a somewhat sympathetic light and the French activists as the heavies as Malle has opted to do here presumably because that is how he remembers it. The film stands or falls on the two schoolboy protagonists, one representing the young Louis Malle, the other the Jewish boy whom he befriended at school and watched being led off by the Gestapo in the final reel and both are magnificent. It is, significantly, Malle's own voice we hear at the very end affirming how strongly his life was affected by that major incident. This film takes its place amongst the cream of French films set in the Second World War than which there is no higher praise."

","I've saved this for some time.<br/><br/>Louis Malle in two of his later films changed me. ""Dinner"" and ""Vanya"" were remarkable for being extremely layered, very much aware of itself as film drama. I delayed seeing this because some of his other films were significantly less impressive, even ordinary. <br/><br/>This is his most straight-ahead film I believe — straight ahead in the sense that you are intended to simply fall into the reality of the thing with the camera and any dramatic convention as irrelevant. So careful is he to be without artifice that he sacrifices all the devices he could have used to engage us. The thing is quite simply narratively incoherent.<br/><br/>The coherence and power is supposed to come from outside the film. We are told that these events really happened as we see them, that he is the boy who is the narrator, and that the entire film exists only for the final scene. There is no need for structure or storytelling when you have those two qualities. <br/><br/>I have to admit that the last scene does have power, both because of the way it unrolls and the fact that we know it happened — that cruelty comes home. But you have to pay for that by sitting through what amounts to a boring setup; old man memories. Just because something captured the storyteller when it happened, doesn't mean it should be part of the story.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

"alrodbel","10","3","5","20 February 2008"," My Kipplesteins
","The holocaust was perhaps unique, in the scope,efficiency and very banality of its evil. True art, at least my definition, brings the observer to the edge of experience, to that point of being of the moment depicted, but safely viewing it from the distance of the observer. <br/><br/>I will never know what those who lived in fear of the dehumanization that was a prelude to mass racial slaughter experienced. Yet, in a strange way I do. This is a true story,not true in Hollywood terms, where a nucleus of actual actual events is shaped into a salable product. This was true in that it depicted Louis Malle's life in a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation. And while all around him was in turmoil, while the slaughter of world war was reflected in the sound of distant bombs, something inexorable and universal was also occurring. Friendship, the enjoyment of one person of another. <br/><br/>Two boys, bright enough to be competitors in being the best student in their class, connected. Their friendship was shown in the brief scene of their playing a simple ditty on an old piano, the pure joy of the timing, the sound and the laughter of music. For the young Malle, the school was an extension of the wealthy protected life of a child of a wealthy respected French family. The new student was more reserved, except when he had the answer to a math question that only he could explain to the class. Something didn't fit about his life story, however , until buried deep in his book case his real name was discovered, not Barnett, but Kippelstein. <br/><br/>The slaughter of European Jews took place as I was only slowly becoming aware of a world outside of our little apartment in Washington D.C. Antisemitism for me was a fistfight, and my coming home with a bloody nose to my mother's arms. And then there were the letters from Europe after the war, written in Yiddish script, an arcane medium that only my Uncle Irving could read, as my entire family was transfixed around the table to hear whether some of our cousins, perhaps one or two, had survived. Kipplestein, millions of Kipplesteins, most died but a few lived. <br/><br/>Representive Lantos was a Kipplestein, who survived to come to America, get his doctorate in Economics, and play a part in Congress. And he had two daughters, each one having large families to please their father who had lost everyone as a child. <br/><br/>My friend Arnie, who would hang out at the Cafeteria with me after finishing his messenger job was a Kipplestein. I remember his words:<br/><br/>---- ""When we got off the train the kids were separated into two lines, by age. I knew what was happening, so I bolted from the little one's lines and yelled, ""I'm strong I can work, I belong with the big kids."" And so he was in a work detail throughout the war. I remember his saying, in his calm accepting voice, how he looked at the German kids his age, and marveled that they were walking free, while he had forgotten what it was like not to be marched, in unison."" ---- <br/><br/>Did Louis Malle's friend Kipplestein survive? Did he live a rich, full and happy life. Did he use his intellect to contribute to society? I said this is a true story, but the answer is really unimportant. The vast reality transcends the destiny of any one individual. The tragedy is those who did not live, whose lives were ended, who were exterminated by those who saw them as the vermin that the Nazi propagandists depicted. How easy it was for the SS members to do their jobs, to simply obey orders, not to risk being a trouble maker. <br/><br/>I have the gnawing sensation whenever I back away from a challenge. Whenever I say, ""why bother,"" in the face of what I see as a mindset, a passive acceptance of injustice, that I am not being a Kipplestein, but following in the tradition of those SS who murdered them. <br/><br/>I do miss my cousins whom I never knew. Those who were sent to the wrong line at the train station. I bet we would have been real friends."

","The sad days of France during WWII take a new meaning, as a Jewish mother, in order to spare her young son of the horrors of the times, decides to send him to a catholic boarding school, where the local Carmelite priests welcomed, and protected, some of these unfortunate children. It was not an easy for Jean Bonnet, the newly arrived boy to settle into a world that was totally foreign to him.<br/><br/>One thing becomes clear immediately, Jean was a smart kid, way ahead of his classmates. He was an easy object of ridicule because of his introspective nature. At the same time, Jean attracted the attention of Julien Quentin, who went on to become Jean's best friend, and whose life was touched by the incident he lived at the school. <br/><br/>Life in the boarding school was not a happy one for many of the children. Being away from family took a heavy toll on most of them, while for others was a great time to be away in a somewhat safe environment. Justin, who spies on Jean as he prays during the night, is the first to discover his real identity, which was a well kept secret. <br/><br/>In fact, Justin is quite concerned as the boys are brought to a bath house knowing Jews were not welcome. The same goes when during mass, Jean makes an attempt to receive communion from one of the priests, who clearly knew he was not catholic and passes him by without giving him the sacrament. <br/><br/>The film is Louis Malle's tribute to a similar incident he lived during his boyhood. It is the most autobiographical of his work, dedicated to his children. ""Au revoir les enfants"" is a timeless account about an era in which the horrors of the war was seen through the eyes of innocent children, totally at sea in the madness going on around them. The gloomy winter atmosphere was photographed by Renato Berta, a frequent collaborator of Mr. Malle.<br/><br/>The two principals do an excellent work. Gaspard Manesse who played Justine Quentin and Raphael Fejto, showed great promise, but did not go into great screen careers as one would have hoped."

","First viewing of this wonderful film brought about many emotions, of which all are ones that I'm sure the director had hoped for with this semi-autobiographical piece. A tale of burgeoning friendship under trying circumstances, of children having to grow up faster than can reasonably be expected, the film delivers a sort of adult perspective seen thru children's eyes . Set at a boarding school during the German occupation of France in January 1944 we are privy to these young children's lives, there is no slick look at innocence here, this is a stark look at children coping with upheaval because they have to.<br/><br/>It's dreamy in quality and not without dashes of humour, but Malle is really only setting us up for a finale that is very moving and puts the whole film into perspective. I was a bit annoyed to find that this is seen as the end part of a trilogy with Soufflé au coeur, Le (1971) & Lacombe Lucien (1974) the previous instalments, but as a standalone this film is beautiful, and I have finally found a child performance that ranks alongside that of Aleksei Kravchenko in Idi i smotri (1985), because here Gaspard Manesse is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Cracking film, 9/10."
"bandw","9","2","3","16 June 2007"," A different coming of age story
","Most coming of age stories usually revolve around resolving a personal conflict like an unrequited first love or something as inconsequential as not making a sports team. Being an adolescent in France in 1944 presented an entirely different scenario. No matter how protected you might have been, coming of age then meant getting exposure to serious issues at a young age.<br/><br/>The story is that of two early-adolescent boys who have been sent to a private Catholic boarding school at some remove from heavily targeted areas. One boy, Julien, is the son of wealthy Parisians and the other, Jean, is a Jewish boy who has been taken in by Père Jean, the school's director. The good priest has taken a great risk in hiding Jean at the school, since the Nazi occupiers and French collaborators are never far off.<br/><br/>The film develops slowly and lulls you into thinking that not much is happening but, before you know it, you are emotionally committed.<br/><br/>The whole cast is excellent; the two child actors are exceptional and perfect for their roles. The film skillfully captures the awkwardness young boys have in expressing their friendship, often to the point of self-denial. But Julien and Jean do ultimately become friends.<br/><br/>The boys are at an age where they are feeling their way to an understanding of the world and being in the middle of WWII compounds the difficulties that all adolescents face in this. Julien hears comments about Laval, and Pètain and one kid comments that Jews and Russians are worse than the Nazis. It is difficult to resolve such conflicting opinions, even as an adult. How ill-fated it is that Julien's sudden revelation about his friend and the Nazis and the Jews resulted in unintended tragedy. Even though some of the Nazis are given a human face, by the end of the film Julien has no doubt who the bad guys are as evidenced by his physical withdrawal in the face of a young collaborator.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see priests presented in a favorable light. Père Jean takes his faith seriously and, Christ-like, dies for his acts of compassion.<br/><br/>Malle reports that this film is somewhat autobiographical and his making the movie gives testament to how innocent acts of youth that result in unfortunate consequences can haunt you for a lifetime."

"TheLittleSongbird","10","1","1","10 June 2019"," A powerful goodbye
","Absolutely love foreign language films, whether French, German, Spanish, Italian or Russian etc and of all decades and genres. And what, admittedly not enough but enough to judge him a very talented director with some great films in his filmography, has been seen so far of Louis Malle has not been less than good or interesting, which is a much better standard for most directors in lesser efforts. Some films when directors were at their worst were real misfires.<br/><br/>1987's 'Au Revoir Les Enfants', translated into English as ""goodbye children"", is semi-autobiographical and is Malle's most personal film, being very much a memoir. It also is a contender for his most emotionally powerful film and is among his very best. What's more, 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' is a fantastic film on its own, one of the best and most emotional films seen in a long time. Its two Oscar nominations, for foreign language film and original screenplay, as well as many other awards (wins and nominations), were more than richly deserved.<br/><br/>Malle is a big reason as to why 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' makes as much impact in the way it does. There is so much passion and sensitivity in his directing, and he does it without sentimentalising or being gratuitously graphic in its depiction of friendships and cruelty. The film manages to be uncompromising and remarkably does not take sides, which was unexpected for a subject as difficult as this one (as difficult as one can get).<br/><br/>It's beautifully filmed, without being over-glamorous and with the right amount of grit. On top of not being one-sided in its depiction of a brave subject, 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' is also one of the honest and poignant portrayals of friendship and youth, again because of the realism and not sentimentalising even though there are parts that are appropriately gentle. In a way that's easy to relate to. There is some nice use of Schubert and Saint Saens too.<br/><br/>The script provokes a lot of thought. The ending is chills personified and really brought tears to my eyes. The portrayal of war and its impact on the characters is harrowing, although the pace is slow it never felt dull due to being so emotionally invested. The characters are very much rootable and well acted across the board, have not seen such beyond the years performances from younger cast members in a while.<br/><br/>Overall, fantastic. 10/10"

","""More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.""<br/><br/>Part of what makes this autobiographical film from Louis Malle so powerful is that a big portion of its coming of age material is universal. In a Catholic boarding school we see hazing and random bullying while ineffectual headmasters look the other way, bedwetting, reading after hours, playground battles, curiosity about girls, and the kind of childhood events that get remembered for life, like getting lost in the woods. In other words, it's just boys trying to get through the difficulties of growing up, and really could be any group of boys, at any time.<br/><br/>But of course this isn't just any period, it's occupied France during WWII, and while the school full of affluent kids seems mostly insulated from that, danger lurks. Three new boys who have been admitted and given new names are secretly Jews, a fact which gradually becomes known by Julien, one of the smarter students (Gaspard Manesse, playing the young Malle). He has a rivalry and a friendship with one of the new boys (played soulfully by Raphaël Fejtö), and the nuances of their relationship not only felt authentic, but it made it hard to know how the film would play out.<br/><br/>I love the dimensions of the film, including the differing Catholic responses to the Jewish issue in Vichy France - some good, some bad. There is also an axis of rich/poor, and I loved the sermon where the priest shocks the visiting parents by criticizing the behavior of the wealthy. Lastly, the use of the Chaplin film 'The Immigrant' (1917) within the film is pitch perfect, and a masterful touch."
"antagonist117","9","1","1","24 January 2015"," Malle draws on unvarnished childhood memories to tell a WWII story from a fresh angle
","This French WWII film confines Nazis and freedom fighters to the background in deference to a segment of the population that is typically relegated to one-dimensional supporting roles: children. It is a fresh point of view, and one with many potential pitfalls, but Louis Malle's careful execution and commitment to truth carry it through. Basing the story on his own experiences at a Catholic boarding school in Nazi-occupied France, he draws on detailed memories of the cruelty and naivety of children. The students in ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" are not precocious, like so many movie youths, but they do have individual talents and interests, and they enjoy pretending to be sophisticates. They try to talk dirty, they exaggerate their experiences, and they pretend not to miss their parents when all they think about privately is how they long to be with them. They all have problems and insecurities, as well, that expose them to the insensitive taunts of their peers. One boy has night terrors, one is anemic and faints during mass, and the protagonist is a bed-wetter.<br/><br/>But these are nothing compared to the dangerous secret that some boys are hiding. The lead boy, Julien, whom a teacher describes as intelligent and a bit pretentious, reluctantly befriends a new student, Jean. They share a love of reading, but Julien resents the fact that Jean is a smarter than he and more of a teacher's favorite. Jean is sensitive, and therefore an easy target, so Julien quickly discovers his weak point. But he withholds the valuable information, recognizing its importance without fully understanding its meaning: Jean is Jewish, taking refuge in the school under a false name.<br/><br/>It is hard to find your way to this movie without knowing that key plot point, so even before it comes to the forefront Malle begins exploring it through artful verbal and visual cues. Early on, two students in the schoolyard pretend to be knights engaged in combat. One of them, secretly Jewish, chooses to play the part of a Saracen knight. The other students call him an infidel, and only Jean cheers for him. But such moments of agency in which Jean can express his identity without outing himself are few. More often, he is at risk of appearing different because of things he cannot do: he cannot recite the Hail Mary and other prayers with the rest of the students, cannot eat pork when it is offered, and cannot receive communion.<br/><br/>The communion scene is particularly interesting because it shows the limitations of the school headmaster's charity. After delivering a ringing sermon to wealthy parents about the need to give generously to those in need, Jean comes to the front to receive communion. The headmaster passes him over since he knows Jean is not a Catholic. The moment might have been too-on-the-nose but for the interesting questions it raises. Does Jean intend only to strengthen his disguise by joining in this ritual? Does he do it to better fit in with his peers, and to get closer to his friend Julien? Or, as I tend to think, does he do it because the headmaster's sermon has deeply moved him? In any case, this is one of several moments that make us wonder whether the headmaster could have done more to keep his Jewish charges safe.<br/><br/>Another is the decision that brings about the end of the ruse. The students and teachers gather to watch Charlie Chaplin's ""The Immigrant"" (a 27 year-old film, but there is a war on and it is a religious school). Images of The Tramp and a woman sliding around a rolling ship give way to Malle's shots of a brawl on icy pavement between the school's cook and crippled kitchen boy. The boy, perhaps 18 years old, has been running a black market in preservatives, so the headmaster fires him. In retaliation, the boy notifies the local Gestapo that the school is harboring Jews. The headmaster is a hero who shelters Jews at the risk of his own safety, yet his incomplete committal to his espoused principles creates an opportunity for his work to be undone. Still, he falls gracefully. He courageously delivers the titular farewell when he is marched off to share the Jewish students' inevitable fate—a fate Malle has foreshadowed in a tense but beautiful forest sequence midway through the film.<br/><br/>The movie's Nazis are one-note, but this is not a problem so long as they are kept in the background. When they show up in force at the end, they indulge in a bit too much leering and mustache-twirling for a film that is primarily interested in the hypocrisy and indifference of the French rather than the blatant barbarism of the Germans. But nothing diminishes the impact of the film's final lines, which are delivered almost without emotion in a voice-over by an adult Julien. The window on the atrocities of WWII that he had as a child was a narrow and privileged one, and his understanding of them was imperfect, but the sudden and permanent loss of a friend became a searing and defining memory for him. By looking at the period and place through a child's eyes, Malle demonstrates that no amount of insularity or innocence could keep one blind as to what was happening to Europe's Jewish population."

","I was so intrigued and touched by the Au Revoir Les Enfants movie that I researched the facts behind it. While browsing the internet, I found the NYT article dated 2/7/88 and titled ""Malle Confronts Haunting Memory"" which was written by Richard Bernstein. This NYT article examined the interesting facts surrounding director Louis Malle's school experiences at Petit College d'Avon. It also revealed the historical facts and names behind the real life characters who are depicted as Jean Bonnet, Negus, Jacques Dupre, and Pere Jean in the Au Revoir Les Enfants movie. <br/><br/>About 43 or 44 years later,director Louis Malle found the courage to write and share his gamut of profound emotions on the silver screen about his experiences with his beloved former Petit College d'Avon colleagues and French school headmaster who still tugged indefinitely at his heart strings despite the passage of time."
"thinker1691","8","1","1","28 June 2010"," "" There is only one real fear and that's the fear only a few have courage to challenge evil ""
","In the country of France, there were many atrocities inflicted against the nation as a whole. Divide the country by the number of children the Germans destroyed during World War II and you'll discover too many to account for. Of course, out of every massacre, one or two survivors arose after the war to point an accusing finger at those responsible. One of those eye witnesses was Louis Malle. It was his memory who wrote and then later Directed this incredible story called "" Au Revoir Les Enfants. "" The name translates to "" Good-by little Children. "" It is the sad story of two French school boys, Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse and Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) who attended a Catholic School under Nazi Supervision. The Germans do not immediately know there are Jewish people hiding in the school. However, as the Occupation drags into the third year of the war, the secret information reaches the SS and the Gastapo. It is then the courage of those who protected the Jews, really shines as they risk their own lives to keep them hidden. The stark Black and White film is a monumental tribute to the French people and their Priests who offered up their lives for their beliefs. The cast and the Director have without much effort created a living Classic to stand for all time. A remarkable film which is easily recommended to any with the patience to watch it through. ****"
"Quinoa1984","10","1","1","30 November 2009"," about friendship first, the horror of the German occupation (very close) second
","Louis Malle's Au Revoir Les Enfants goes head to head with Truffaut's the 400 Blows to creating *the* French film about what's real, and sometimes dark and terrifying, about childhood. Both films have conflicted young protagonists who are just starting to become teenagers, and faced with a question: how to live, or just react, in the world around them? In the case of Malle's film, however, there's a lot more going on in the personal side of things than just an outsider/petty criminal. It's about a boy who finds a friend, without really going out of his way, and then that friendship ending because of something that neither boy can control since one happens to be a Jew. The film doesn't start as some haunting elegy to youth, but by the end it becomes just that, and about the very crucial act of remembering.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the many strengths of Malle's masterpiece (his best film perhaps alongside Murmur of the Heart, also about a boy) is that it's so carefully remembered from forty years past and brought to life, as if it were happening today, at least emotionally. It's set in a Catholic all-boy's school in 1944 where Julien Quentin is off to learn and be away from his mom and dad, the latter he barely ever sees. There's a new boy, Jean Bonnet, who is attending the school, and immediately (perhaps predictably) he's picked on and bullied, though nothing too terrible that he can't bounce back. He somehow connects with Jean over the coming months, as they become stranded in the woods during a treasure hunt, one teaches the other piano, and Julien sees something rather startling: Jean praying at night with candles out and in a language he doesn't understand. Something else he discovers is his real name- Jean Kippelstein- and that he's a Jew. He has to asks someone first what a Jew is, the response from one of his school-mates simply ""A Jew doesn't eat pork."" <br/><br/>Malle observes the ways of children without interfering with them, but at the same time creating an atmosphere that is so real that the hangups with melodrama never get in the way. The little dramas of an everyday school-boy life, or just the side-issues at the school (trading objects black-market style, sneaking around a copy of Arabian Nights, keeping up with playing be it on stilts in the playground), or, as it turns out, Julien's own little problems. What Malle does is subtle but extraordinary; by letting the story unfold in this gradual style, with little events building upon one another, a whole picture emerges of the story of these two friends set against this backdrop of Catholic highs and lows, French occupation by the Nazis, and the hint that there may be more than one Jew at the school - one where anti-semitism is noticed but not well experienced. We don't get a full dose of this reality until the scene at a restaurant, where Julien, Jean and Julien's family see it first-hand.<br/><br/>There is a message Malle wants to convey of course, about the ultimate horror of the Nazi regime on good people, some innocent and some trying to do the right thing by hiding others, and we see this particularly in the climax of the story when the Germans come to the school to sniff out any/all Jewish refugees. But this isn't precisely paramount for Malle, or rather it's not the full reason one senses why he made the film and why it's so personal. It's because he knew these people, and that it's about friends and being cared for and being in a bond like the one Julien and Jean have. I wondered going in to the film if it would be more conventional, that it would be about Julien having to hide this secret from the other kids and something building to a point of Jean being found out.<br/><br/>It doesn't work like that, really, except that Malle throws in a hint of existential turmoil: when asked in the class who is Jean Kippelstein Julien, who is the only one who knows, turns his head ever so briefly to Jean, but it's enough to signal the German as to who he is. What's so clever, and just devastating, about this is that it's not Julien's fault, ultimately, if Jean were to be caught, since as it turns out the school is turned upside down for anyone, and eventually three are brought out of the school and sent to Auschwitz. But, by the look on Julien's face, caught in a grip of tragedy, he feels in this moment as an adolescent as if it is his fault. Au revoir les enfants is never forced dramatically and all of its acting and scenes until the last ten minutes are so unforced that its ending is all the more crushing to the soul. It's a heart-rending, powerfully directed portrait of youth, in its ups and downs, and a year that must never be forgotten - not a moment."
"kenjha","4","8","22","7 August 2011"," Underwhelming
","Like most people, Malle had an uneventful childhood as he attended a boarding school in France. Unlike most people, Malle felt a need to make a movie about this rather dull period of his life. There is nothing very interesting about watching boys going through their daily routines at school. There is no plot, just random episodes that fail to sustain a narrative flow. There's an extended scene where the two main characters are separated from their troop while playing a game in the woods. It seems like it's building up to something dramatic, but it just fizzles out. The final scene is powerful, but does not warrant having to sit through the rest of this underwhelming drama."

","I've just seen the movie (available on VHS actually for the reviewer who complained) and have read the universally admiring comments made below - and I'm afraid I didn't have the same reaction.<br/><br/>First, it's not a BAD movie at all - it's obviously made with care, and has a very realistic feel throughout - it seems almost as if a camera were simply rolling at a school and the film was then edited. The details of dress, of horseplay, of conversation all sound quite realistic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, that didn't mean they were interesting. The movie seems almost formless - until the uninteresting climax we expected throughout. If I had found either the central character or his brother appealing, I might have a different reaction - but I don't. They are very realistically presented - and quite unlikeable. <br/><br/>The whole movie feels very episodic - with one episode having little to do with the subsequent episode. I suppose much of life is this way - yet in a drama, I want to see something that's more shaped into a story.<br/><br/>I kept wanting to fast forward the movie to see how much longer it would go on. Nor is the story very original -- from The Two of Us (which may have been the first French movie I ever saw) to The Angry Harvest to A Love in Germany (though that time a Polish POW instead of a Jewish civilian), we are used to The Pianist to Enemies to the Diary of Anne Frank, the hiding of Jews during W.W.II is very well-trodden ground. No subject is ever entirely plowed - and if there were some particular insight this time, I might have been more intrigued. Alas...<br/><br/>I actually regret the reaction I had - because this movie apparently means so much to so many - but although the review stating that it felt ""lived in"" is completely true, that didn't make it interesting. One may have a remarkably accurate memory of something - and more remarkably be able to recreate it on screen, but this meandering story simply didn't hold my interest."

Joseph works at the school and trades with the boys on the black market.<br/><br/>Filmmaker Louis Malle base this on his youth in a Roman Catholic school. This is compelling personal history of the larger story. However there is a lack of tension. It's never in doubt that Bonnet was a Jewish boy in hiding. It may help if he was a blonde hair, blue eyed boy. There are a couple of incidences where Bonnet is in the vicinity of being discovered but the tension never build. There is a lot of boys being boys like a 'Lord of the flies' lite. It's a bit annoying and directionless. I do like some scenes that don't go straight like the restaurant where the German troops kick out the french police trying to take a Jew. The movie probably needs to give Joseph more time and set him up for the big turning point. The movie should probably concentrate mostly on Julien, Bonnet and Joseph and lose half of the rest."

","Malle tells a story which is in part autobiographical: the story of two school boys, set in a French boarding school during the Second World War. Simply told, beautifully composed and paced, it never once draws attention to the great story-telling and cinematic skills its director. The horror of the Holocaust, which has been told many times now in film, has never been depicted as quietly as this. The Germans who carry out the jobs, the French who collaborated with them, the honorable priests who are truly Christians are all seen through the eyes of a naïve and innocent but observant adolescent boy. At the end of the film we are left as speechless as the boy who is the witness to this piece of history. A masterpiece."
"nycritic","8","2","4","7 June 2007"," Friendship in Harsh Times
","Coming into Louis Malle's AU REVOIR LES ENFANTS, it seemed to me as though this was a film that was made for very personal reasons; it was present in every scene from the opening shot to that last haunting picture which displays the voice-over which tells of the fates of the characters which were developed with so much care throughout, and held the inimitable stamp of something closer to a confessional and a denouncement. Much like Vittorio de Sica's THE HOUSE OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS, this one also transpires behind the relative safety of walls, walls which belong to a boarding school where Jewish boys are enrolled under assumed names and protected by their teachers. Two boys in particular become fast friends, and the main character, Julien (Gaspard Manesse) eventually becomes the innocent bystander who witnesses and tells of these horrible events which we never see -- in an ode to the preservation of innocence, they're kept off stage even though we know they are, like a noose, tightening around the school. If the Holocaust, as a matter of fact, wouldn't be located strictly in the most remote background, this might be just another coming of age film about two boys growing up, but that gets a deeper resonance here and has a vague tone of dreamy languidness, like a prelude. A very delicately told story, it takes its time to reach its devastation, and by the end, it has left a lasting impact of silent horror."

","""Au revoir les enfants"" is Louis Malle's spare, sensitive exploration of two youths -- one Jewish, the other not -- and their tentative friendship at a religious boys' school during the days of WWII. This is not a movie about big emotional scenes. Malle takes an almost journalistic approach, not ever using music or directorial flourishes to tell us how we should be feeling, but rather letting the fine performances and powerful subject matter speak for themselves. The boys never become necessarily close friends, but they do form a bond forged by loneliness and a mutual respect, which evolves into genuine concern as the one gradually awakens to the very real danger the other faces for being Jewish.<br/><br/>I believe this film is largely autobiographical, and you can tell it is even if you didn't know that going in. It just has that personal touch that autobiographical films have, something you can't necessarily define but which you recognize when you see it. It put me in mind a little bit of Fellini's ""Amarcord,"" though that film mixed in much more humor with its tragedy.<br/><br/>""Au revoir les enfants"" received two Academy Award nominations in 1987, one for Best Foreign Language Film and one for Best Original Screenplay.

","Louis Malle is an interesting director. He never gained a huge following, and his best known movie is probably My Dinner with Andre (which I actually have never seen), but everything he made is eminently watchable. The most recent movie of his that I was exposed to was Vanya on 42nd Street, a performance of Chekov's Uncle Vanya presented as a rehearsal in a dilapidated theater. That film did more to enhance my opinion about the importance of actors than any other movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Childhood<br/><br/>Au Revoir Les Enfants is deceptively simple. It's the story of two boys in a Catholic boarding school outside of Paris during World War II. The main character, Julien, like the rest of the boys at the school, is the son of wealthy parents. Like most eleven year old boys, he has little understanding of the world outside his childish concerns. At one point he asks his older brother, who also goes to the same school, what a Yid is.<br/><br/>François Quentin: A jew.
Julien Quentin: I know, but what exactly is a Jew?
François Quentin: Someone who doesn't eat pork.
Julien Quentin: Are you kidding me?
François Quentin: Not at all.
Julien Quentin: What have people got against them?
François Quentin: The fact they're smarter than us, and they crucified Jesus.
Julien Quentin: That's not true. It was the Romans. Is that why they have to wear yellow stars?<br/><br/>This lack of understanding of the greater world around him mostly seems to confuse little Julien. As far as he knows, he's never met a Jew, but he does see them from time to time. There's an old man in a restaurant who gets threatened by Vichy French militia. There's a younger Jew who walks out of the public bath (which Jews are barred from entering in the first place).<br/><br/>This inability to grasp the implications of anti-Semitism is made all the more potent with the addition of a new boy to the school: Jean Bonnett. He's obviously not like the other kids. He doesn't pray the Hail Mary with everyone else. He doesn't take communion. He doesn't even take Greek (because of his knowledge of Latin). Jean doesn't really notice Julien, he's just another one of the boys that picks on him for his last name (""Easter Bonnet"" they call him), but the two begin a relationship that steadily grows as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Slice of Life<br/><br/>The relationship that develops between Julien and Jean feels shockingly real to me. It doesn't have a linear path. Instead, it ebbs and flows between moments and events that they both enjoy and small fights that erupt between them. With each moment they share, the two grow closer in the way that boys who fight often do.<br/><br/>Whenever I hear actors talk about finding truth in their performances, I tend to roll my eyes. I find it pretentious talk, but I'm going to engage in some of that very same stuff now.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie feels so very true, starting with the two boys themselves. Acting very understatedly and believably by two young performers (Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto) who almost never acted again, everything the two do and say feels genuine. The reading at night, the insults they hurl at each other, the way they avoid hiding away during an air raid just to play on a piano without any real rhyme or reason. All of it feels completely natural and believable. That believability about every little thing in the actors' performances really sells the reality of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>That believability doesn't end with just the performances. The movie was made in a small boarding school called the Institution Sainte-Croix outside of Paris. It was filmed entirely in winter so that when the boys complain of cold, it very well could be because they were actually really cold.<br/><br/>The Real World<br/><br/>I talked before about Julien's inability to understand the world around him. That attitude is very much not reflected in Jean, for Jean's secret is that he's a Jew on the run.<br/><br/>The priests and teachers of the school have taken in three Jewish boys in an effort to hide them from the authorities. Julien has trouble connecting with people easily partially because he's so terrified that an errant word on his part, or on the part of another boy, could give away not only himself but the two others.<br/><br/>There's a great moment in the latter half of the movie that highlights the difference in how Julien and Jean approach the world. All of the boys in the school have been sent out as two separate team to find a treasure. Julien gets separated from his team but finds the treasure on his own. Alone with night approaching, he looks around and finds Jean nearby.<br/><br/>Julien Quentin: I found the treasure. All by myself.
Jean Bonnett: Are there wolves in these woods?<br/><br/>Julien's mind is on play. Jean's is on the danger that surrounds him at all times.<br/><br/>How does Julien combine his innocence of the world with Jean's fear that never goes away (""You scared?"" Julien asks, ""All the time,"" Jean replies)? He can't quite do it. He's no mature enough to understand. Through circumstance, Julien discovers that Jean's real last name is not Bonnett but Kippelstein, and in a fit of momentary rage threatens to tell everyone Jean's real last name. He has no idea of the implications of what that would entail.<br/><br/>One Winter Morning<br/><br/>There's a subplot in the film about a cook's assistant who trades with the boys for their foods that their parents send them from home. Julien's mother gives him jam, so Julien trades with the cook's assistant for little things here and there in exchange.<br/><br/>When the head of the school finds out that the cook's assistant not only was trading with the boys, but was helping to supply the black market from the school's kitchens, he's furious and fires the assistant. The assistant (Joseph) finds the act unjust, especially since the cook herself, according to him, did it just as much as he did, if not more. With nowhere to turn, Joseph turns informant based on the obvious suspicions around the three new boys (who never ate pork).<br/><br/>The Gestapo shows up, knowing the real names of the three boys and saying that they had been looking for them for some time. As the chief officer is busy angrily tearing small USSR and USA flags out of a map, Julien quickly looks back to Jean. The Gestapo officer noticed the action out of the corner of his eye and simply walks over the Jean until Jean packs up his things and follows the Gestapo officer out.<br/><br/>Other things play out for some time involving the teachers and the other two boys until the final moments of the film:<br/><br/>With some attention and familiarity with French, you can hear the title of the movie spoken by the priest as he leaves. But the key is the final voiceover spoken by the film's director, Louis Malle.<br/><br/>Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at Auschwitz; Father Jean at Mauthausen. The school reopened its doors in October. More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.<br/><br/>The impressive emotional impact of the film itself combined with the fact that it's autobiographical to the film's director.<br/><br/>This film is so small in scope but affects me so intently that I treasure the fact that I saw it right around the period that I was originally developing my top ten years back."

","Do not buy this movie from NDTV Lumiere, as they have censored it. Imagine.. they censor even films like these!!! The government does not allow any sex, nudity, or even kissing! yet these new 'global savvy Indian companies release world cinema titles which they know will get scissored by the censors. Shame on India, Shame on its repulsive government censorship, and its stupid naive film industry! This a beautiful, wonderful film and I recommend it to everyone. A stunning as well as heart-rending portrayal of Malle's own tormented childhood and his own sense of guilt and loss. As usual the director is unflinching and the makes the film a memorable piece of art. A veritable classic, such a film could never be made in the USA, where artificial and inhumane superficiality, escapism and a sense of paranoia and age-segregation when dealing with the experiences of children, would make this (and thousands of other) film socially unacceptable."

There is something incredible about the images I retained from the movie -- the sunswept fields amidst the horror of WWII, the little boy's innocence amidst the evil of the Nazis and their collaborators.

"schmidtmike555-1","3","10","38","17 May 2008"," It seemed a bit pointless to me. I didn't get it.
","I remember watching this movie in my French class a while ago. The whole time I was watching it, I was waiting for a main conflict to arise and bring about a plot line, but this event didn't arrive until the very end of the movie. I thought something important might happen when the Nazis first capture the boys- I was expecting one of them to be sent to a concentration camp, but the Nazis simply drive them back to the school. It seemed a bit anti-climatic. I know it's not an action movie that needs a climax like that, but the entire movie seemed a bit boring and uneventful. It seemed more like a documentary filming the life of a student in France in the 1940s rather than a feature film about a boy's life during WWII.<br/><br/>This made the movie extremely realistic, which is a definite plus, but it seemed too realistic for its own good. Very little of the movie focused on the war itself compared to the main character's life at school. And when you have a movie set during WWII in Europe, with the actual climax of the film involving the Germans, you expect the movie to actually be about the war.<br/><br/>Other than the plot, I don't have many other complaints about this movie. The writing, acting, directing, etc. were fine. For a movie with a rating of 8.1, it should get some people to talk about it, but when my class finished the movie, we all felt sort of indifferent after watching it. No one talked about whether they liked it or not. So the reason I give this movie a rating of 3/10 is not necessarily that I hated the movie, but that I feel the movie is very overrated."

"Cosmoeticadotcom","7","3","8","7 September 2008"," Au Revoir Les Enfants is good, not great
","In 1987, Louis Malle, after a run of American produced films that worked (My Dinner With Andre, Atlantic City) and failed (Pretty Baby, Crackers), decided to return to his roots and write and produce a small budget French film, Au Revoir Les Enfants (Goodbye, Children) about a supposedly true experience he had as a child, in Vichy France, toward the end of World War Two, at a privileged French boarding school. Although Malle has always claimed the incident to be true, despite changing details of it in retellings, and dramatically for the screen, while others have claimed he was simply telling a good story, neither claim's veracity nor lack has a thing to do with whether or not the story and film work as stand alone works of art. They do, but not nearly as well as the film's greatest champions insist.<br/><br/>The tale is rather simple- in the winter of 1943-44 (December and January) the Malle stand in character, a twelve year old boy, befriends one of four Jewish boys that a Roman Catholic headmaster allows to stay at the private school, to save their lives. Their friendship is slow but realistic in budding, but then the Gestapo comes to the school, rounds up the Jewish boys- save one who escapes, and the headmaster, Father Jean (Philippe Morier-Genoud), and the final shot is of the Malle stand-in watching his friend, and the others, being carted off to the death camps, as the school is closed, and Malle, in voice-over, reveals their fates. Overall, while Au Revoir Les Enfants is a good film, indeed, arguably a very good film, it is too straightforward, one dimensional, and not that daring, to come close to true greatness. Yet, mere excellence in a film that could be more is often more frustrating than watching a piece of garbage, because there are moments when one can say, 'If the director only did this,' 'If the screenwriter only did that,' etc. Yes, the film, like almost all Holocaust films, did well at awards time, getting two Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign Language film and Best original screenplay, it won the Golden Lion award at the 1987 Venice Film Festival, and swept up seven awards at the César Awards- France's Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film and Best Writing, among other honors, but honors do not make up for the 'could'a, should'a, would'a' feeling one is left with after a film like this. And, unlike Chinese food, such leftover pangs do not demand a second helping. Thus, Malle's film is what it is, a good- but not great, meal, served at a restaurant (Holocaust art) that one should only eat at sparingly, so whatever pungency it packs stays on the tongue longer, after its real flavor has faded, and the remembered taste seems all the more delicious."

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>This film takes place in 1944. The viewer is placed in a Catholic school in France where a mother has abruptly sent her Jewish son to go to school to avoid getting captured in Paris by the Nazi's. The film focuses very little on that heavy topic but primarily on the Jewish boy and the friendships he makes with a Christian boy who keeps his true identity a secret. There are endless scenes of boys being boys in school and doing their things, which is fine for character development which eventually builds up to a heavy emotional scene at the end. It was a good drama, nice little scenes but lacked intrigue. One of these films I heard tossed around a lot in discussions so I had to check it out."

"ferd_berfel_9","9","1","2","9 July 2012"," A historical question
","I loved the movie but there seemed to be one scene that didn't ring true. It is regarding the treatment of Jews during the Nazi occupation of France, so I would appreciate any input from French or Jewish readers or World War II buffs especially cognizant of that era. After 4 years of Nazi occupation and the pro-Nazi Vichy government under Petain, who gave free reign to the Gestapo to do whatever they pleased, wasn't it pretty obvious to the remaining Jews that they had to hide to survive? Why would that elderly Jewish man be sitting there in broad daylight in a public restaurant frequented by Nazis? And why wouldn't the priest have warned the Jewish child not to go into the town much less go to a public restaurant? <br/><br/>In another film about that period, Francois Truffant's ""The Last Metro"", Catherine Deneueve's character Marion Steiner hides her Jewish husband Lucas Steiner in the cellar below her Paris theater to prevent him from being arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp and certain death. That movie was set in 1942, two years before ""Au Revoir Les Infants"". Which is accurate?"

"mjneu59","9","1","2","5 November 2010"," a haunting a personal recollection
","It took Louis Malle over forty years to write and direct this autobiographic coming-of-age story, in which he recalls an extraordinary moment from his childhood in Nazi occupied France when he betrayed, with an involuntary glance, a Jewish classmate attending his Catholic boarding school under an assumed name. The setting is a cloistered adolescent world of petty cruelties, minor triumphs, and a few not-so-childish secrets, with hardly a false note throughout. Even after four decades the details are crystal clear, showing none of the distortions or exaggerations of memory; every virtue of the film is so well balanced that each one is virtually invisible. The story is disarmingly simple and straightforward, and yet in its own restrained, undemonstrative way the final impact is heartbreaking. There is no gunfire, no bloodshed, no violence, but Malle reminds us that sometimes, on an all too personal level, the consequences of warfare are no less lethal for being so quiet."
"Hitchcoc","10","1","2","13 October 2010"," So Sad What We Do to Each Other
","Set in a French boarding school during the occupation of France by the Nazis, the silences of this film are thundering. We get to know intimately a group of boys, two in particular, one a French boy and the other a Jewish boy whose identity is being covered up. As the boys go through the all the day to day turmoil involved in their close quarters, the threat hangs heavily on the outside. The German soldiers aren't initially portrayed as villainous, but we know what will happen if the news gets out. This is a film about a time when one word can destroy a life. Unfortunately, children often act before they think. This film is subtle. It's about a friendship. Louis Malle, a king among directors, never beats us up with the events. Watching this with hindsight, it made me very sad. I also see that even in our own country, certain groups are now being minimalized. We need to learn from history."
"ARTSinAlabama","8","1","2","20 September 2010"," Better than most French movies
","French movies are almost always too slow and boring for American audience tastes. While cinematography is important, French movies are often criticized for their overindulgence in angles without dialog. Finish a French movie and ask yourself, ""What did I just watch?"" Often times, the only redeeming part of French movies are the actors and actresses who are more than willing to remove their clothes for the audiences.<br/><br/>So how can a 20-year-old Au Revoir Les Enfants keep contemporary American attention? With an amazing script, realistic portrayals of childhood, different perspectives on world history and viewer created tension waiting for heartache as it looms on the horizon.<br/><br/>The story follows Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) leaving Paris after Christmas Break to return to his Catholic boarding school. A new student, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) joins his class and quickly demonstrates modest intellectual superiority over arrogant Quentin. Refusing to adopt a formulaic childhood movie friendship (animosity, followed by one person helping the other and then a flowering and transcendental relationship), Quentin and Bonnet seesaw between appreciation and apprehension. True to life, there is no single event that cements their friendship and instead several experiences grow the two closer together.<br/><br/>The setting takes place in occupied France during World War II, which is a situation ideal for exploring the sheer range of human experience: trust and betrayal, love and hate, fear and courage, hope and hopelessness. However, the film doesn't try to do overextend itself and simply concentrates on the children. In fact, most of the situations that occur are not understood by Quentin. While he's sitting in class and the camera shows a German soldier asking to confess outside the window, he doesn't even look up from his school work. Then when his math class continues underground after an air raid siren, he nonchalantly ignores the teacher's lesson and reads a different book. When the lights flicker, the children act excited; when the teacher starts praying, the children follow out of habit instead of fear. Even though the audience has evidence the story occurs sometime during the occupation, the only way we can identify the precise year is near the end when the math instructor mentions the start of a Soviet offensive. And since that signals somewhere around six months before Paris is liberated, the hope for a happy ending looms somewhere in the future.<br/><br/>The film proceeds somewhat direction less for a long time. This allows tension to flow from the audiences expectations that something should happen soon, although we're not sure what or how. We mostly watch boys enjoying a sheltered life, oblivious to the dire state of world affairs. The voice over at the end is especially memorable because the free-flowing story has no buildup to a climax and we only recognize that we witnessed the climax when the voice over starts. As the German officer continues calling names, we are led to believe the movie has led us to the names called. But it doesn't – the events are mostly over.<br/><br/>While it can be tedious watching a French movie tiptoe from one isolated incident to another, Au Revoir Les Enfants is absolutely amazing. Seeing children in movies that behave like children (naturally we're not surprised when students relentlessly harass the new kid) authenticates the experience of the characters far beyond the less believable golden heart child befriends new kid and receives rewards for their kindness. Witnessing world history from different eyes will hopefully serve enough interest to consider watching this movie yourself. - Erik Hagen"

The camera work of the movie is outstanding for example,the tracking shot of Julien running in forest,it is short in length but it is one of the best tracking shot i have ever seen in my life.The movie based on brilliant plot with dramatic depth get perfect treatment from it's editing and camera work.<br/><br/>I think this movie is the most suitable WW2 movie to show to children because this movie gives a view of holocaust era from the eye of a small boy without being much dark and violent.<br/><br/>I just watched this movie twice in last 24 hours and i am giving this movie 9.5 of 10,and this movie goes at 59th position in my favorite 100 movies."

","I first saw this movie long ago in high school french class when we did a sampling of classic and recent French films. I remembered bits and pieces, but re-watching it recently as an adult, I found this movie to be a real classic.<br/><br/>It's an incredibly unpretentious film, telling without any cinematic fireworks the story of Jean Bonnet (Kippelstein), a young Jew who has been hidden at a boarding school for wealthy Catholic boys, and befriends Julien Quentin. The friendship is portrayed very naturalistically and is charming in its realism, there's nothing profound about it, they just go from being strangers to pretty good friends in a very casual, haphazard way that strikes me as how most people made friends at that age. Much of the movie is episodic, which helps build the characters in a realistic way, and I think a lot of the film's strength is how much time it devotes to building the friendship through interesting little moments. To succeed, any character-driven movie needs to make you care about the characters, and through realism and honesty, ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" does just that.<br/><br/>The movie is set against a backdrop of World War 2 and occupied France, and I wonder how French people feel about this movie, it must represent a sad chapter of their history. The movie seems imbued with the gloomy, defeated attitudes that must have been prevalent in the country then, and yet there is a spark of defiance - the core characters do small things to antagonize their occupiers, and in the beautiful conclusion we of course are left with the message that although the events of the times were horrible, the human spirit had the ability to prevail.<br/><br/>""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" is a beautiful and tragic work of art. It is one of those great movies that is uplifting (despite telling a sad story) and has something profound and optimistic to say about about the human condition. This one's a winner, pure and simple."
"nandoferrer","10","1","2","8 December 2009"," En état de grâce!
","I've loved Louis Malle's work for many years now,having seen several of his movies and some of his master-pieces.Paramount among them I believe to be 'Au revoir les enfants' a movie made in 'état de grâce' (state of grace) by the director.This wonderful,magic,nostalgic and brilliant piece of film work is unforgettable and everlasting.I've seen it several times, and each time it becomes more gracious and important in my own life experience.It not onlys brings us back to the sufferings and contradictions of Nazi-occupied France,but it tells a heart-felt story of friendship between two boys from different backgrounds,religions and outlooks on life: a catholic bourgeois and a refugee Jew.The direction is secure,translucent and enveloping,and the actors more than competent, suave and delivering all the gamut of emotions conveyed by the characters and needed to muster sympathy towards the film's themes.It is also an opportunity to watch Francine Racette's last movie role, before devoting herself to her family, after her wedding to Donald Sutherland back in 1972. Cinematically Malle was never considered truly part of the nouvelle vague directors because of his classical traits, but not exactly a truly 'old vague' director, thus establishing a sort of balance between both fields. The actors, the music, the direction, the story, all will stay forever in our hearts. For those who wish to learn more about his work, please watch 'L'Ascenseur pour l'Échaffaud', 'Les Amants' or 'Le feu follet' among others. As for 'Au revoir les enfants', it is truly a masterpiece in movie history."

","I have seen a lot of movies covering the WWII era, but none from the perspective of children. This makes this movie especially poignant and moving.<br/><br/>It centers around boys that attend an all boys Convent school in France. It is a French foreign language film and there are subtitles in English. I'm not a big fan of subtitles, but somehow they didn't bother me here. The storytelling was engrossing enough that the subtitles seemed almost non-exist. I was able to follow along quite naturally - which for me is unusual for a foreign film.<br/><br/>The child actors are all quite good, especially the main ones. I did find that there were quite a few crude exchanges between the boys, that I think would have been better left out. I know they were trying to portray the gutter talk that boys will resort to when left to their own devices. I think some of the boys were a little young to be participating in this. Again, perhaps this is a product of being at an all boys school with younger and older boys mixed in together in tight living quarters.<br/><br/>I think this film is a great portrayal of friendship. I also believe it succeeds in showing us the worst in humanity, and balances it by showing us some of the best. I think the risk the priest took (and the ultimate sacrifice he paid because of it) shows us how in the worst of times, ordinary people rise to the occasion."

","The thing that struck me first about this was the uniformly great acting. Obstensibly about a group of boys who are sent away from Paris during World War 2 due to the occupation of the Nazis, you get a feel for all the things that mattered to them. You feel the bitterness and anger they feel about being shepherded off away from their families. The main story is about Jean & Julien, two different kids whose paths cross. It is found out during the film that Jean is Jewish, and you can imagine, given that time in history, all the things that went through the boys' minds. Louis Malle has crafted a film that not only tells a good story, but is shot in intriguing colors. The story has a lot of heart and is highly recommended."

","ARLE is another masterpiece by French director Louis Malle (his other great movies are Lacombe Lucien and Elevator to the Gallows); it's about the troubled friendship of two boys -Jean and Julien- who live in a boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France (c. 1940-44). Julien (as most of the boys in the school) is a Catholic, and Jean is Jewish, as Julien and the rest of the kids later find out. Julien is Jean's only friend at school, and their friendship is based in an (almost) silent complicity and mutual interests (they read the same books, enjoy playing the piano, etc). In the middle of the film, they get lost in a forest during a trip; this scene is wonderful because almost no words are used, their emotions are shown through their eyes and facial expressions. In the last scene, Louis Malle reminds us that sometimes, when we are very young, we make mistakes that we later regret the rest of our lives. But Julien wasn't a traitor, he simply made a foolish error or acted unconsciously, without willing to harm Jean or risk his life. And Jean was right: ""Sooner or later, they would have caught me"", he told Julien, who would be haunted by the memories of that day until his death."

Gaspard Manesse, being at the center and telling the story with angel-like grace and sublime sincerity, experiences the harsh time of the German occupation as he suffers from malnutrition, cold and desolation caused by bleak accommodations and continuous air raids.<br/><br/>Then he encounters Raphael Fejtö's character, Jean Bonnet, an outcast who joins Julien (Gaspard) and the other boys in their daily struggle for viability. The evolving affection and eventual friendship that subtly accrues from their mutual bias for literature is not presented in a stereotyped and corny mode, but transformed as a growing sympathy based on events and incidents that awakened Julien's awareness of Jean's apparent strangeness in terms of religion and eating habits. He slowly discovers Jean's secret, which makes him curious and strengthens the bond of affection that was already growing between them. The tragedy at the end is thoroughly brutal in its transition on screen, thrashing in its subtlety and heart-rending in its sincerity.<br/><br/>I was personally moved by the quality of each illustration, of the message of every detail and the power of the camera work. Gaspard Manesse tells the story masterly, conveying horror and spirituality alike with naive simplicity and touching authenticity.<br/><br/>The movie ranges among the best ever accomplishments of French cinema. It made me think about life and values, about the truths of our existence and the brittleness of life. The story is historically true and thus a strong and pervasive witness of one boy's real experience of the horrors of war and the inequities of our daily struggles to find and defend happiness and vitality against all odds.<br/><br/>Louis Malle died in 1995. At the end of the movie he says that despite the 40 plus years that have passed since 1944, he would never forget that moment on that cold and chilly January morning, when his friend was taken away by the Nazis. Maybe he had Jean's face in front of him when he died in California, so far away from his native soil. Maybe he reached out for the face of a boy who died in 1944, a face that accompanied him for the rest of his life and did not let go of him, defining his character and his values. It's memories that make us who we are and what we were. The movie's last line symbolises this eternal message of life in an unprecedented and subtle manner for all times."

","""Au Revoir les Enfants"" (French, 1987): Some say this is Louis Malle's masterpiece. Fair enough. Although set in the last years of WWII, at a Catholic boys school in France, this is not a ""last gasp fight to the death against the Germans"" action film with gun toting youngsters. It is a story about BOYS, and it simply happens to be 1944. They're children of rich parents  boys who've been shuffled out of Paris (etc.) to the safer countryside. They're silly, awkward, conniving, antsy, and typical. Yes, they can sometimes hear fighting in the distance (but they're too busy with their own tiny squabbles), they are required to respond to air raids (but consider it a game), and they do see Nazis on occasionbut mainly, they're just typical, dopey boys. Slowly - very slowly - one of the brighter boys suspects that not is all what it seems, there at his school, and, with time on his hands, begins searching for secrets and answers. What he finds will change his life and lives of many others. Few films have looked at real war through the eyes of children, and this is possibly the best."

Previous to Bonnet's arrival, Quentin was the class leader, both academically and influentially outside of class; now the new upstart Bonnet appears to be Quentin's academic and artistic superior.

It keeps the same line as reality. There are very funny parts of course and that's what makes it interesting. You never get bored in this movie like in movies like ""The english patient"" I got very bored in that movie. This is very interesting. I must say that Julien Quentin a very smart boy was for his time. He was getting mature (he talks about wet dreams) and he doesn't even know what it means. He probably was the most mature or the first boy who had this (for him it was) ""problem"". These aspects show that the life goes on and that it was not all about the war.

","Louis Malle's 'Au Revoir Les Efants' is a semi-autobiographical picture. The world of this school in which the story takes place is the crossroads between the innocent, sheltered world of childhood, and the brutal reality of adult life. The tragic conclusion is also a cross between these worlds. The instinctive glance of a child and the betrayals and hatreds of adults.

"classicsoncall","7","1","3","12 May 2018"," ""Are there any other Jews among you?""
","Apart from the film's being somewhat autobiographical in nature for director Louis Malle, I didn't find the story to be that compelling. It lacks dramatic tension, as events that seem to be building into a confrontation with the Nazis all seem to dissipate for one reason or another. One example would be when Julien (Gaspard Manesse) and Jean (Raphael Fejtö) accidentally encounter the German soldiers seeking their way back from the outdoor competition. They're brought back to St. John's without much fanfare. A better example might be the scene that took place in the restaurant when French Vichy authorities attempted to rid an elderly Jewish customer and a Nazi officer came to his defense! Perhaps these events actually occurred and were witnessed by a young Malle during his childhood, but they didn't seem to translate dramatically on screen. Even the classroom removal of Jean Bonnet/Kippelstein didn't engender any real fear or paranoia as I expected it would; it simply proceeded along rather matter of factly. Of course the horrific message is brought home in the closing moments when Julien recounts the eventual demise of his classmates and school principal, but because it's dealt with as an off screen event AND as a forty year old memory, the impact is not what it could have been.<br/><br/>I don't think the film had to entice us with scenes of brutality or the horrible scourge of the Nazis to make it's point, but I couldn't help feeling that there was something significant lacking in the picture. By contrast, I would point the reader in the direction of what might be the most disturbing movie I've seen regarding the fate of young Jewish children, indeed, it might be the most disturbing movie I've seen given any subject. That would be 2008's ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", with a decidedly emotional ending that conveys an unusual twist. On a somewhat different level, there's also 2004's ""Before the Fall"", which examines German students in a schoolroom setting as this movie does for the French, and how those chosen to become members of the Nazi elite dealt with their unconventional status."

","Despite being made in the late 1980s, this film watches very well today and is set to be a timeless classic.<br/><br/>The production values are fair and the scripting becomes a little plain at times, though the unfolding of a friendship in a boarding school environment is sublime, highly character driven and commands your undivided attention.<br/><br/>But more than that - this film captures an era where ordinary life was turned on its head in the shadow of German occupation. Being neither a war or holocaust film, it delves into the plight of young Jews and those of a different faith that put themselves at risk to try and save them from the Nazis.<br/><br/>The closing 20-30 minutes of the film is remarkably moving, yet remains wholesome and understated. European cinema at its best is something to behold, providing a strong reflection on the ""human"" character and delivering spellbinding, raw emotional depth while maintaining story line simplicity. Au Revior Les Enfants is truly a brilliant film."

","One movie of Louis Malle , Au Revoir Les Enfants was an OK movie  but probably only because of the excellent acting of Gaspard Manesse in the role of Julien Quentin who is a boy sent to a catholic school in the countryside away from the bombing of Paris during the WWII. In the school Julian meets Jean Bonnet  who is actually a Jew boy who is hidden in the school under fake name.<br/><br/>The issues of the friendship and betrayal are the main pillars around which the acting evolves. There are quite a few social issues explored as well. Looking at the latest movies I have seen I notice a trend  most of them are French movies , about friendship and have something to do with a boarding school or some similar institution  and I guess can be all characterised as coming out of age ones.<br/><br/>Not the best movie I have seen , but still pretty good one and I am glad that I had the chance to see it."

","""To make up for its lack of a moral compass, the public is prey to sudden gusts of kitschy sentimentality followed by vehement outrage, all encouraged by the cheap and cynical sensationalism of its press."" – Theodore Dalrymple <br/><br/>Louis Malle's ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" tells the tale of a young Jewish child who is sheltered from the Nazis (and Vichy police) by a Catholic school during World War 2. The film is the spiritual sequel to Malle's earlier ""Lacombe, Lucian"" - another autobiographical tale about a boy sold out to the Nazis - but is directed with much more skill. This is the glossiest and slickest of Malle's films.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film concerns the blossoming friendship between a young French boy and Jewish boy, and their fears of living away from their parents and home. It is along these lines that the film works best, Malle capturing the confusion, fear, vulnerability and wonder of youth. One scene, a school organised treasure hunt in the woods, is powerful.<br/><br/>While the film thinks it is ""enlightened"" and ""liberal"", it merely offers another form of anti-Semitism. Malle depicts Jews as cute, lovable, superior and exotic, systematically reversing the sinister venalities of Nazi agitprop. Malle's camera is infatuated with young, Jewish beauty, salivating over the Jewish child and fawning over his ""talents"", ""innocence"", ""grace"" and ""allurement"". In boot-licking the Jew's preciousness, the film not only suggests that a less attractive non-Jewish child is less worthy of being spared, but partakes in the very same kind of ""objectification of humanity"" that the Nazis did, such a stance being one of the psychological mechanisms that enabled the Holocaust and continues to fuel knee-jerk anti-Semitism today.<br/><br/>The film is shot in icy greys, whites and blues, and is structured as a series of recollections by a now adult Malle (the tale is partially autobiographical). Malle's camera coddles and sighs over the Jewish boy, and then weeps when the kid is removed, during the film's climax, from the school compound by Nazi soldiers. Interestingly, it is a poor youth who turns the Jewish boy in to the Nazis; working class resentment smoothly misdirected toward society's scapegoats.<br/><br/>8/10 - Worth one viewing."
"jeffjaguar","Null","1","5","23 March 2007"," Nit Picks on Au Revoir les enfants
","The movie is fantastic. I have just seen it for the first time as it is running this month on FLIX. After having watched it several times, there are somethings which while probably minor do confuse me. Perhaps others have the answers.<br/><br/>1. Getting right to the ending of the movie, it is implied that Joseph was the snitch who put the Gestapo on the case. Yet from what I can see the only person who knew Bonnet was Jewish and his real name (other than some in the school administration of course) was Julien. It is pretty obvious Julien managed to keep the secret...his brother had no idea nor did his mom who told him his friend is very nice. How then did Joseph know there were Jewish boys being hidden in the school (I suppose maybe one of the others figured it out from the other 2 but of course nothing in the movie talks to this).<br/><br/>2. In a similar vein, why would a smart kid like Jean Bonnet keep his real name with him in some of his belongings and why would the headmaster have the information to give the Gestapo guy Dr.(?) Muller the real name of at least one of the boys namely Jean.<br/><br/>3. Here is also a puzzle. In the last scene in the infirmary, one of the German soldiers uses the pull down your pants test to ascertain whether Julien is Jewish (either he passed or they found the other boy before the test was completed)...but my question involves this...if it was very uncommon for non Jewish boys to give up part of their equipment very early in childhood, wouldn't they have noticed that Jean and the other boys were missing part of theirs. I find it hard to believe that during a two week period of close quarter living in dormitories and a visit to a public bath, none of these boys saw the others au natural so to speak. Wouldn't that have been a tip off? <br/><br/>4. Finally the movie takes place during a two period in January 1944 notterribly far from Paris...I was in Paris this past January and while it wasn't terribly cold, it certainly wasn't really spring like either and it is evidently cool if not bone chilling during the period of time the movie was filmed. So my question is why were the boys always wearing shorts....was this the uniform required of catholic school boarding school boys in France? Seems not to make sense to me.<br/><br/>Despite these questions, the movie is fantastic and everybody should see it; even if they know the ending."

","This film more than any others I have seen gives me a more complete understanding of the terror that was life in Occupied France,and part of my Family history. The lives of the Priests and others who hid Jews were a reality.This movie brings that reality to my own eyes. My Grandmother was born to a French Socialist family from Nice (Many Italian families,lived on the French Mediterranean Coast and Savoy) who sheltered my Grandfather,who was an American agent,spying for years on Mussolini and French Fascists,predecessors the Vichy Traitors. They also hid many Italian Jewish families fleeing deportment to German Concentration camps. To hide Jews was to put you and your immediate family in horrible danger of deportation and internment in a Camp. Before watching this film what I had was the stories of my Grandparents,Aunts and Uncle who were young at the time.FDR pulled my Family out of France in 1938,since Noni had married my Grandfather and by that time had 4 children and my Mother on the way. All had been exposed and the chance of their assassination,or deportation to Italy or worse Germany was very real.<br/><br/>Louis Malle deserves credit for bringing the unspeakable terror and heroic efforts of normal French folk who outside the Resistance who heroically hid many Jewish families and Socialist Resistors from the North and Paris from Vichy traitors,Nazis,and Italian Fascisti.<br/><br/>It shed a light for me on the actual situation my Mother's family lived with daily. He is to be commended especially for his treatment of the Catholic Clergy in the same situation. Many died in the Camps for sheltering Jews,since his usual treatment of the Clergy is often not so sympathetic.<br/><br/>A great and realistic portrayal by Malle of everyday people caught up within a Fascist Regime and very illuminating for the present time here in the United States. Who knows what we will have to do to do considering the course of the present political situation. Gives me pause. Very sensitive and truthful."

","I have been able to recall many titles featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and this French film is one of those that I remember and was certainly looking forward to watching, from BAFTA winning director Louis Malle (Atlantic City). Basically, set during World War II, and term is beginning at a Catholic school run by priests, and upper class boy Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) and his brother François (Stanislas Carré De Malberg) are attending after being on vacation, and Julien reestablishes himself as the leader of the fellow students. The school sees a new student arriving, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö), who instantly becomes a victim to bullying by the other boys, and of course Julien does not like him for a while. As time goes by though Jean does become much more part of the gang and accepted, and he gains a friend in the leader, Julien even finds out Jean is Jewish and hiding out from the Nazis. There are a few other things happening while the boys attend their lessons and hang out together, such as assistant cook Joseph (François Négret) caught selling food on the black market. The big point come though when Nazis are searching the school, aware that there may be Jewish students hiding out, and in the end Jean and three others are caught and taken away, leaving Julien devastated. Also starring Francine Racette as Mme Quentin, Philippe Morier-Genoud as Father Jean, François Berléand as Father Michel and Peter Fitz as Muller. The cast of young actors all do pretty well, I will admit I did not understand everything going on, but it is an interesting enough story and concept from what I did follow, especially as it is semi-autobiographical based on the past of the director, I suppose it is a Second World War drama to see. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Film not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

Life is good at the school and, except for having no heat and meager meals, the war has little effect on the students until the day the Gestapo comes to class.<br/><br/>This film is based on an event in director/writer Louis Malle's childhood, one that obviously haunted him decades later. It is a war movie for people who hate war movies, focusing on the ups and downs and youthful hijinks of boys at school, until the sudden and shocking conclusion. The boys who play Julien and Bonnet are both naturals and give sincere, touching performances. The war era is faithfully reproduced and it feels like a movie made in the forties, instead of 1987.
