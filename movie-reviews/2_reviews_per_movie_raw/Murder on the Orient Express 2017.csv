","I am not sure why Hollywood keeps remaking and remaking (hello Lion King) films. Well, I suppose it has to do with taking cash from simple folks and a lack of ideas but how about a minor nod to integrity and art, folks? Get some of the latter and stop making and remaking please.
Murder On The Orient Express is as needed in a new film as yet another trashy tattoo on a footballer or another Miley Cyrus affair, er marriage...
Specifically the acting is bad.. the girl from Star Wars should just throw in the towel and the director has forgone colors in favor of grey all over.

This film was terrible. It was dull in script and visuals and also made the boring and vapid morals seem even more tired.<br/><br/>What I also suggest is that the eye for an eye stance is immoral and wrong. One crime does not deserve another. It is understood that Poirot brings the set of criminals to justice, but let's not assume that revenge is justified."

"WylieJJordan","5","353","476","10 November 2017"," Difficult to Review
","Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies, and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressive sets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive case features Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.<br/><br/>I, on the other hand, was massively disappointed, especially by Branagh as a sort of English upper-class colonel with a stick-on cavalry moustache and by the needless addition of an introductory scene at the Wailing Wall. But I am prejudiced. I read the 1934 novel decades ago and again more recently. I liked the 1974 star-studded version with Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and Michael York—despite the fact that Albert Finney was a very poor version of Christie's Hercule Poirot. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the 2010 television version of the story starred David Suchet as the definitive Poirot, and the ending was far and away the best of all the versions with which I am familiar. So I think Christie fans may want to skip this edition of the classic."

"duffjerroldorg","4","294","414","10 November 2017"," From The Vast Agatha Christie Collection
","Why remake Murder On The Orient Express when there are so many titles from Agatha Christie's bibliography that have never been made. Specially this one, directed in 1974 by Sidney Lumet - a genius at having many great actors within a confined space, think 12 Angry Men - with a cast that was to die for. The 2017 Kenneth Brannagh couldn't survive the comparison and it doesn't. I missed the elegance and the wit. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination for his Hercules Poirot here Kenneth Brannagh's mustache will get all the attention as well as Johnny Depp's incomprehensible performance. Then, of course, the score. The original Richard Rodney Bennett became a classic. So, I ask you, was this necessary?"
"m-arsic0708","2","206","287","10 February 2018"," How Agatha Christie was brutally ruined
","This movie is actually a piece of art. It takes a really true artist to ruin Agatha Christie at her best and a Dench-lead cast and come up with a boring Branagh soliloquy. What he has made out of Poirot, it's just unbelievable. I don't remember him being described as a walrus in any of the books where he also has converstations with all involved so that readers/audience can participate somehow. In this movie it's just Branagh, he knows it all, he sees it all and he understands it all. Out of thin air. Such wonderful actors were gathered for this monstrosity and it felt as is they were there only a set for Branagh. And oh yes, when talking about scenery - which ignorant fool came up with alps between Vinkovci and Brod??????? The thing is, there is nothing going on in this film, no suspension building up, no substance. It is just a pale vessel for Kenneth Branagh to try shining. 
Watch 1974 Lumet version. And from what i hear, it's going to be a sequel, Death on the Nile. Watch 1978 John Guillermin version. Branagh should.
My review does not contain spoilers, there's not enough substance to spoil anything."
"man14","3","183","255","9 March 2018"," A Poirot for the clinicaly dumb
","Ever since I heard that Kenneth Brannagh was going to direct, produce and star in this movie that I dreaded this would happen, and it did - Brannagh is so self centered that he made the whole film about himself, turning the rest of the cast into mere decorations. He managed to turn this Christie's masterpiece into a self agrandising piece of crap. Let's just say that it makes the 2002 version with Alfred Molina look like a masterpiece in comparison - and that's saying a lot, because it was simply one of the worst films I'd ever seen.
I don't know who the hell Brannagh is supposed to be playing, but it sure as hell isn't Poirot - not the one Agatha Christie wrote about. Anyone who has read her books about the egg shapped belgian sleuth - and I have, all of them, more than once - knows that he's nothing like the buffon Brannagh plays in the movie: Poirot walking on top of the train!?? Going beneath the train!?? Poirot willingly plunging his shoe into a pile of excrements just so both his shoes get equally dirty, all in the name of simetry!?? For the love of all that is holy! Poirot would have an apoplexy if only one of his shoes got accidently dirty with sh@t, can you imagine him doing it on purpose!? And what about that freaking mustache? It's so damn big it becomes distracting. Poirot's mustache is supposed to be big, yes, but not gigantic! And what's with the fly in his chin? Poirot doesn't have one, what was Brannagh thinking? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't. And don't let me get started on the annoyingly fake french accent he uses throughout all the freaking movie - he even mispronounces repeatedly the plural for egg (oeufs), and Poirot is supposed to be a french speaking belgian! 
Also, on this film Poirot doesn't have conversations with people, as he does in the novel, he simply delivers endless monologues, conjuring facts out of thin air (or out of his ass, is more likely), things he couldn't possibly have known. He looks more like a witch than a detective. And he's everywhere, in every freaking scene. Ego much, Brannagh?
Brannagh's direction is so pedestrian it hurts. All those freaking camera angles - shooting the damn train from every possible position, shooting the action literaly from above, - were so ridiculous and pretensious, it's beyond words. It's the worst kind of in your face grandstanding directing you could get.
The screenplay is beyond bad - it completely butchers one of Christie's masterpieces by adding sex and violence that wasn't there, dumbing down her expert character development and plot, and adding artificial diversity just to please the hollywwod pc bullshit brigade. Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of diversity, but in movies that take place in na era where diversity exists, like today or the future. But in a story that takes place in 1934, in the most luxurious train in the world? Really? Can you really see a black doctor travelling in first class on the Orient Express in 1934? As much as I hate it, the answer can only be one to anyone familiar with the world's history: hell no! Nevertheless, that's what you have: an amalgamation of two characters into one black british doctor in love with a white middle class english girl, all for the sake of hitting the audience over the head with not so subtle references to the terrible evils of racism. If only Hollywood would get it in their thick heads that audiences only want to be told a good story, not to be preached at every time they go to watch a movie...
In conclusion, this is Poirot for the clinicaly dumb. You want to see the real Poirot, as he should be played? Watch the ITV series ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" with David Suchet - he IS Poirot, period. Want to watch the best version of this story? Watch the 1974 version, directed by Sidney Lumet and learn how to correctly adapt Agatha Christie. But better yet, buy the freaking novel and read it - you still know what reading an actual book is like, don't you? Either way, do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of garbage (I'm giving it three stars for the sets and costumes, for Judi Dench and for Johnny Deep, that's it)."
"borromeot","2","235","334","25 February 2018"," A Thoughtless Remake
","Sidney Lumet directed this Agatha Christie classic back in 1974. Albert Finney played Poirot and he was delicious and got an Oscar nomination for it. The rest of the cast was a cohesive group of heavyweights from Ingrid Bergman to Vanessa Redgrave, from Sean Connery to John Gielgud it also had a period reconstruction in scrumptious detail, wit, elegance and an infectious score. None of it is present in this new incarnation. None of it. No, the new version reeks of thoughtlessness and CGI.

","As director and leading actor, Branagh has turned this movie into one of the most excessive, narcissistic films ever made. With so many great actors and actresses, one is left wondering why they would waste their time to be in this production. The director gives none of them a chance to shine. Branagh's mustache is the star of the show and, unfortunately, the only part of the movie I'm likely to remember. With so much star power, I made the mistake of not reading reviews first. If I had, I probably would have avoided this terrible ego trip. Most viewers would do well to skip this one."

The film starts with a relatively entertaining light-hearted action sequence which brings Poirot to the forefront of the story-line. But, it quickly goes downhill from here. We are then introduced to the rest of the cast and we quickly learn they all have their own stories. <br/><br/>After this though, the film becomes incredibly dull and slow. This remake is completely unnecessary and tedious <br/><br/>I have only given it 5 stars because I have significant respect for Agatha Christie's Poirot and it is only the base story-line which rescues it.

"ecastrodesign","Null","288","449","6 November 2017"," This Version Is A Train Wreck
","If you have any affection for Sidney Lumet's 1974's stellar version of ""Murder On the Orient Express"", do not bother watching this new version, you will be very disappointed. Even the poster reflects an uninteresting tone, the font used is modern and lacks any sense of style.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is a great director and actor that has given us some memorable films, unfortunately ""Murder On the Orient Express"" isn't one of them.<br/><br/>At last night's screening of ""Murder On the Orient Express"" I had to use the restroom after about 40 minutes. As I reentered the theater the person entering with me asked me ""Do you think this movie will ever get started?"" I said ""I don't know; I guess we'll have to see."" It caught fire way to late, in about the last 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Indeed, the movie had a painfully slow start, with a completely overproduced prologue that seemed quite unnecessary. The introduction of the characters is messy and it becomes rather confusing as to who they are. The cast is full of great actors, but so few are able to ""shine"" in this production. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is an interesting Hercule Poirot, he seems to be trying way too hard, and for me somehow he never ""owned it."" The extremely grotesque mustache seemed to get in the way <br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer, as Mrs. Hubbard is lackluster and quite flat, until the last 20 minutes where she does get a chance to shine, but by then it's too late, but it's not her fault.<br/><br/>Derek Jacobi, one of our greatest actors is so misdirected in this version that he delivers an insipid performance. Penelope Cruz walks through a part that gained Ingrid Bergman an Oscar in the original, again not their fault.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, it is Johnny Depp who gives the best performance. He embodies his character with the right amount of vile corruptness, and sleaziness that brings life to the screen. He also has the most interesting costumes in the movie.<br/><br/>Judi Dench is elegant and funny but her companion played by Olivia Coleman, who usually turns in stellar performances is totally uninteresting here, again not her fault. <br/><br/>The production is indeed rich and elegant in its production design, and cinematography. The costumes however are fine, but lack a certain panache and glamour we have grown to admire in past Agatha Christie films, such as those designed by Tony Walton, and Anthony Powell. Alexandra Byrne is an extraordinary designer, but somehow it feels like the concept was to be subtle and ""real"". She needed to be bold and adventurous like her work on the ""Elizabeth"" films with Cate Blanchette.<br/><br/>The musical score vacillates from very generic, to frantic and never finds the right tone, never providing a sense of mystery and suspense. Only when true vintage songs are incorporated does the atmosphere come alive.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is such a gifted filmmaker, it is sad to see this film fall short. He is in almost every frame, perhaps he would have crafted a better film if he was not in it. As the conductor of this train, he did not provide an elegant journey with wit and great character development for one of Agatha Christie's finest stories."
"tm-sheehan","5","177","276","8 November 2017"," Why did they bother?
","Why did Kenneth Branagh want to make a third version of this classic Agatha Christie story knowing remakes of classic films rarely are successful?<br/><br/>The previous two versions the film in 1974 with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet are both superb.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen either you probably may enjoy this as I don't criticise the acting or production . It's an interesting cast I enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Caroline Hubbard so classily played in the original by Lauren Bacall and Branagh gives a credible performance as Poirot.<br/><br/>What I missed was the elegance of the original the original score by Richard Rodney Bennett is one of my all time favourite film scores ,used so evocatively in the original film it gave the Orient Express an identity motif forever etched in film history.<br/><br/>The music score in this attempt is bland and the song at the end credits so saccharine sweet and forgettable I've forgotten it already.<br/><br/>If you make a remake film that's so well known you can't help comparing the original cast and in 1974 we had Albert Finney, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall , Dame Wendy Huller , Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, John Gielgud , Rachel Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave to name a few , yet not one of the new cast including Dame Judy Dench eclipses any of the performances of the original film . The costumes and sets are very good in this version but again in 1974 even without blue screens and cgi effects the elegance and luxury of the original is not improved with this version. So to me the good performances and production of this movie were wasted on this expensive film and the tweaking of the story line was totally unnecessary and in one instance concerning the Caroline Hubbard role ridiculous.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away or spoiling it for audiences who haven't seen the original, apart from recommending the 1974 version to this one I was horrified at the hint at the end of the movie that Kenneth Branagh may remake ""Death on the Nile""I sincerely hope not. What next will we a have Kenneth Branagh remake of Gone With The Wind starting himself as Rhett Butler and Anne Hathaway as Scarlett?"
"postmortem-books","2","366","597","5 November 2017"," Unnecessary remake.
","I am loathe to put the boot in to any film but the barrage of publicity for this, plastered all over the BBC news and chat shows - Graham Norton and Andrew Marr interviewing the phalanx of ""stars"" in a suitable subservient way - has pushed this reviewer over the edge. It is a film that didn't need a remake since the original was perfectly acted and nuanced. Perhaps that is half the problem - I know the ""solution"" and therefore the denouement is no surprise- but there is something more deeply flawed with this movie. Firstly - that moustache. Ridiculous and in the end it becomes something that you stare at and wonder just why something so outrageously stupid would NOT get in the way of what words the actor is actually saying. You stop listening and just try and see where it is stuck on. Branagh stomps around the various scenes like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia (even down to walking along the top of the snow-covered carriage as if he was king of the castle) and then addresses the suspects in a scene that is reminiscent of The Last Supper painting. Everywhere he goes everyone knows him. Absolutely everyone. The opening scenes in Jerusalem are unnecessary and only serve to raise Branagh/Poirot into God like status where the population of the city are happy to take his word and trample a suspect policeman to death. No jury, no trial, lynch mob rules. All of which seems to bother the guardian of justice not one jot.<br/><br/>Cut to the train - at last. We hear that the train is full and that Poirot will have to share a cabin for at least one night. As we discover that there are just 12 passengers on the whole train I wondered what happened to all the other empty berths on the other carriages. Let's just pass over that one. We are now introduced to the various characters. I don't know how much these stars got paid for this movie but boy, apart from Michelle Pfeiffer, they don't have too many words to say. The main action is sitting around looking suspiciously at each other. Depp is mostly unintelligible evidenced by his recent performance on the Graham Norton show where he found it difficult to string two words together. It is only Branagh who has the dialogue - and he works it as hard as he can into some kind of Shakespearean dialogue. Judi Dench plays the part Wendy Hiller took in the 1974 film. I know Dench is supposed to be the public's ""favourite"" but Hiller's sneering haughtiness will remain one of the highlights of the earlier film long after this one is forgotten.<br/><br/>In the novel and the 1974 film the train gets stuck in a drift. Here it is struck by an avalanche and teeters on a wooden viaduct. Ain't CGI wonderful? The engine is derailed but never fear he comes a gang of ten workers who will dig away the snow and pull a 100 ton engine back on to the tracks - with their bare hands. Marvellous.<br/><br/>And the music score? Possibly the most disappointing part of the whole film when one considers the classic Richard Rodney Bennett score for the 1974 film. Patrick Doyle's offering is just insipid and uninspired. The closing credits roll with some vapid pop song burbling away in the background. <br/><br/>Well, if you've never seen the 1974 film and you don't know the ending you may enjoy this but perhaps you should locate that earlier film and wait for this to end up on the £3 shelf at Tesco. It would appear, to judge by the final quip by Poirot in the film that Branagh is planning to redo Death on the Nile. God help us."

","If you want to see Murder on the Orient Express, check out the 1974 version starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot. It is a wonderful movie, very close to the book. And guess what.... spoilers...<br/><br/>In this movie...Hercule Poirot does not get attacked by *any* of the suspects, still less shot by one of them who also confesses to the murder.<br/><br/>Apparently Brannagh thought modern day audiences couldn't sit through a murder mystery without 3 fist fights - and a shooting.<br/><br/>Then of course there's the political correctness. It's set in the right time period, the 1930s, but the doctor who has nothing to do with the crime has been morphed with Arbuthnot, one of the killers - and is now black.<br/><br/>I suppose that's okay, if it's true that one black man per medical class is allowed in, in 1930s England...but it's just dumb - and the fact that he actually shoots Poirot - when no matter who he may be, there's no evidence against him or the white woman he's in love with - is just stupid.<br/><br/>Then there's the most egregious bit - the opening where an Iman, a Rabbi and a Priest are accused of stealing a valuable relic at the Wailing Wall where thousands of people of different ethnicities are waiting. And of course it isn't one of these three religious people - no, it's the head of the British police who steals it in order to foment discontent and cement British rule, apparently. Stupid stupid stupid.<br/><br/>Then there's the fact that Poirot has been turned into Mr. Monk. He steps into a pile of dung with one foot. Poirot is a neat freak, and a clean freak, not a 'balance' freak. There is no way in hell he'd step into the dung with his *other* foot, to balance everything out. Just stupid.<br/><br/>The actors do excellent jobs with what they're given. Unfortunately what they're given is awful. I give 5 stars for the performances, and that's it."

","If you have never seen the 1974 original..you may want to see this, may that is. If you HAVE seen the 1974 original, which I refer to as a CLASSIC, stay as far away as you can from any theater showing this waste of time. The original version, directed by the awesome Sidney Lumet and starring the brilliant Albert Finney (an Oscar nominee) as Poirot, was a masterful piece with great writing, directing and a cast that couldn't be beat!! And this new version, Directed by ego-magic Branagh, and starring a so-so cast, with some stellar actors, all being decimated by this production is downright tragic. From the opening piece, set in Istanbul which has nothing to do with anything, with regard to the plot, till it's exceptionally tedious laughable end, taking place in a tunnel in a snow covered mountain, you just won't believe your eyes.<br/><br/>The 74 original showed the opening part of the mystery story, which foretold all, but here that investment comes way in the middle of the things, where it has no place, and after so much disinterest has already occurred. Branagh hams it up, takes all the scenes, gives no space for anyone else to breathe, let along give any type of performance, then appears to be almost clairvoyant, as he seems to figure everything out through thin air. Basically because he never has any legitimate conversation with any of the major characters to determine what happened and why. Oh yes, he's the mystic seer. Maybe stolen from a 1960 Twilight Zone episode. No, more he is ego-centric and arrogant Branagh who can't stand being out of the limelight. You're in the limelight now, Kenny....you screwed up a major production and were all laughing at you, not with you. Arrogance reigns <br/><br/>The use of totally unnecessary CGI is annoying and silly, the action scenes are dull, tedious, pointless, adding nothing to the plot. The plot, for what it is is convoluted. Never really explained. In the original we were given clues, had ideas, questions, we could follow along. Not here. It's as if they made this thinking EVERYONE knows all the answers, and so they skip numerous (and I mean numerous) plot points..but again, the mystic seer, with the most stupid looking and idiotic mustache in history, knows all. Watching this flick, you'll wish Poirot got knifed, instead of Mr Ratchett. <br/><br/>Plot devices that all fail, where do I start, the opening wasted scene, Poirot measuring the size of his hard boiled eggs.(oh, please) A avalanche comes down and stops the train, but oh yes, only derailed the front engine, not the rest of the train, which it certainly would have done. People firing guns at each other, but why? Racial issues being brought up about skin colors and nationalities. And this is entertainment? What were these people thinking? <br/><br/>To my knowledge Branagh is a Shakespeare lover, let me quote this..""How much did revile this film,let me count the ways"". I could go on, but I shall not. <br/><br/>The 1974 version ran 127 minutes, this one runs 114 minutes and feel terminally longer. I squirmed and squirmed waiting for it to end. The music score, non-existent. Star turns, none to be found, excitement in the plot, 0. That about sums it up.<br/><br/>I simply say this, with $$$ as tight as they are, we should only be subjected ourselves to worthy films, especially when they are overblown remarks. The 1974 original is avail on DVD and in the UK and foreign markets even in a nice blu-ray version. My suggestion, spend your money on that and do not support this type of overblown ego-driven dribble.<br/><br/>Bye, bye Branagh, you made no friends with this tripe. You do not work much and it's understandable to see why. I read a UK review earlier that bashed this flick out of the World...good for them, they know junk when they see it. And now, so do I.<br/><br/>For me, I'll stick with the original anyway. As a matter of fact, I'll go and watch it now and wash this toilet water taste from my mouth, and this film from my memory"

The only thing worse than dumbing down and sexing up the story with psychopathic violence and creepy lechers was the hitting- you-over-the-head-with-oh-so-unsubtle white savior references to the terrible evils of RACISM!!! Please, someone save us from Hollywood white male liberals bending over backwards to be politically correct about race and thinking they are sooooo progressive while maintaining the worst female madonna/whore lampshade character tropes and adding stabbings, guns, fist fights and shootings not in the original story. <br/><br/>""Yes, I took a masterpiece and made it into a self serving piece of crap--but that's OK, because there's a black doctor who gets to make some great speeches about how his white male friend helped him get into med school.""<br/><br/>So...let's review. Branaugh ADDED to Christie's original story 1) Poirot's righteous finger pointing at the horrors of racism (adding an empowered black MALE character) and 2) Poirot chuckling with his buddy (wink wink) about buying and selling women for sex. In 1934. In Istanbul. Creating a disempowered female character known as ""the prostitute"" who does not even get a name and whose entire narrative purpose is to stroke Branaugh/Poirot's ego and 3) adding a female love interest whose only narrative purpose is to proof Branaugh/Poirot's ""manhood"" who is literally an inanimate photograph and 4) male characters punching walls, fist fighting, stabbing and shooting people and 5) giving Poirot himself characteristics completely antithetical to Christie's beloved detective. As if we needed any more proof of Hollywood's hypocrisy in the treatment of women and sex in our films and normalizing toxic gender stereotypes in both male and female characters.<br/><br/>And the script! It read like some high school freshman TRYING to sound erudite. ""Overt overture?"" Uh...I was waiting for them to serve a ""cheesy cheeseburger"" in the dining car. Many of the lines would have been more appropriate in a Steven Seagal movie--""Why won't you DIE!"" What!??!?!<br/><br/>Only a fool would take one of the masterpieces of British literature by the great Agatha Christie and make it into a pandering show of ego and arrogance, while insulting the audience's intelligence and perverting Christie's moral dilemma on the definition of justice into a tale of vigilantism and revenge by a bunch of thugs little better than the man they murdered. I am HORRIFIED to think a whole new generation will think THIS detritus has anything to do with Agatha Christie's novel. If I could, I would give this film negative stars.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor. Watch David Suchet's virtuoso performance in the 2010 Murder on the Orient Express. That production did Christie justice and then some. Or better yet, read the book. Remember reading? Then you'll know that Branaugh should be tarred and feathered for what he did to her epic magnum opus.<br/><br/>No, Ken, you didn't have to mutate Christie's story to pander to today's audiences. She is literally the best selling author of all time. Christie needs no help. She appealed to people's humanity and intelligence, creating one of the most popular characters in the history of literature, not to mention a pantheon of assertive female characters and humane male characters, breaking stereotypes 80 years ago that, unfortunately, still survive today. All you did was play to the lowest common denominator, appealing to our baser instincts while maintaining arguably the most brilliant whodunnit plot of all time. So, new audiences think this ""cheesy cheeseburger"" is great, not realizing that they could have had filet mignon.<br/><br/>And the tragedy is--she even predicted you would do it. Strip her legacy of it's intelligence and humanity, add male and female stereotypes and neanderthal violence all the while using her brilliant plot to make money. <br/><br/>And you STILL did it."

","I love this story and I was really looking forward to the remake. With all of today's technology and the real life location shots, I was expecting spectacular. What I got was a dud.<br/><br/>I was not expecting for them to change character names, drop characters, have other characters change their professions, add chases (can you really see Poirot chasing someone?), Poiroit making light of his OCD (really???), a derailment, a stabbing (not Rachett), a shooting, etc that never happened in the story. Also left out was some of the logic leading to the solution. They could have made a splendid movie with all the great scenery, CGI, etc., without changing the actual story. Poor Agatha, must be having fits.<br/><br/>In addition, even though they had splendid actors, only Daisy Ridley and Johnny Depp gave worthy performances. All of the rest were unconvincing, even Branagh.<br/><br/>Then the topper.. the last scene has a officer coming to get Poirot to ask him to go to Egypt to solve a murder on the Nile. What is the world???

"barry-180","4","110","190","7 November 2017"," A revival too far
","I went to see Murder on the Orient Express last night and afterwards thought what was the point? Did Kenneth Branagh do it for self indulgence. In 1974 it was great to see Albert Finney, Laureen Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connerry etc playing the parts. There was a still a certain mystique about film stars, especially the ones from yesteryear. Now on the Graham Norton show we can see how vacuous so many of them are. Yes the scenery was spectacular. The costumes were great. But honestly, really honestly other than having several A Listers or B+ Listers who hardly open their mouths and a Hercules Poirot in Branagh not in the same class as Finney or David Suchet I would say that TV does these thrillers much much better these days. The opening scene in Jerusalem was like something out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But Poirot is no Indiana Jones. The ending which tells us that we can prepare ourselves for a remake of Death on the Nile. No thank you, even if Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks are in it!"
"MR_Heraclius","9","53","88","22 February 2020"," Entertaining and intriguing right to the end!
","I saw this without any foreknowledge of the story despite its history. As a Brannagh admirer I also expected a lot. As such it was a great performance by a great cast. Those who didnâ(TM)t like it perplex me. This is not a modern crime story with action or violence or explosions to distract us. Like Sherlock Homes, Poirot is detective who use his mind and observation skills rather than physical action and violence to solve his case. The filming is perfect, the pace slow and steady, the denouement handled with precision. If you go into this expecting a James Bond type movie ( which I really like precisely because it they are full of action and spectacle but not too much intellectual input !), you will be disappointed. But if you expect to have your mind intrigued and you like to solve crime, then you will not be disappointed. I suspect it will be more enjoyable if you have no idea as to the true plot line, so if you have read the story in the past, it would help if you do not re-read it and you have forgotten some of the details."
"LloydBayer","4","96","169","8 November 2017"," Agatha would be aghast
","Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (following adaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting it mildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam even before the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- star cast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even with the latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turns out to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literary crime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famous character is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feet in horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance. <br/><br/>Shot on 65mm film, aerial vistas of a train trudging through the Alps sure looks pretty. The production design also boasts of lavish set pieces, plush backdrops, and costumes tailored to that era. But really, all we want is an old fashioned murder mystery. Perhaps an amazing display of deductive reasoning before arriving at a twist ending? Surely, that isn't too much to ask. Add the mouthwatering cast in a plot that thickens into one of the most ingenious yet baffling cases penned by Christie and we have a first class whodunit in this day and age of cinema. But as it turns out, this was indeed asking for too much. Like the bloodied victim, something dies very early in the film. And that's before the story starts juggling the remaining 12 suspects into the 12 agonizing labours of Hercules. Or was it Hercule? Either way, Agatha would be aghast."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","151","275","6 November 2017"," You'll never guess who dunnit
","There's a big problem with Kenneth Branagh's 2017 filming of the Hercule Poirot-based murder mystery. and that's the 1974 Sidney Lumet classic featuring Albert Finney in the starring role. For that film was so memorable – at least, the ""who"" of the ""whodunnit"" (no spoilers here) was so memorable – that any remake is likely to be tarnished by that knowledge. If you go into this film blissfully unaware of the plot, you are a lucky man/woman. For this is a classic Agatha Christie yarn.<br/><br/>The irascible, borderline OCD, but undeniably great Belgian detective, Poirot, is dragged around the world by grateful police forces to help solve unsolvable crimes. After solving a case in Jerusalem, Poirot is called back to the UK with his mode of transport being the famous Orient Express. Trapped in the mountains by an avalanche, a murder is committed and with multiple suspects and a plethora of clues it is up to Poirot to solve the case.<br/><br/>Branagh enjoys himself enormously as Poirot, sporting the most distractingly magnificent facial hair since Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Gangs of New York"". The moustache must have had its own trailer and make-up team!<br/><br/>Above all, the film is glorious to look at, featuring a rich and exotic colour palette that is reminiscent of the early colour films of the 40's. Cinematography was by Haris Zambarloukos (""Mamma Mia"" and who also collaborated with Branagh on ""Thor) with lots of innovative ""ceiling down"" shots and artful point-of-view takes that might be annoying to some but which I consider as deserving of Oscar/BAFTA nominations.<br/><br/>The pictures are accompanied by a lush score by Patrick Doyle (who also scored Branagh's ""Thor""). Hats off also to the special effects crew, who made the alpine bridge scenes look decidedly more alpine than where they were actually filmed (on a specially made bridge in the Surrey Hills!).<br/><br/>All these technical elements combine to make the film's early stages look and feel truly epic.<br/><br/>And the cast what a cast! Dame Judi Dench (""Victoria and Abdul""); Olivia Coleman (""The Lobster""); Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""); Daisy Ridley (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""); Penélope Cruz (""Zoolander 2""); Josh Gad (Olaf!); Derek Jacobi (""I, Claudius""); Willem Dafoe (""The Great Wall"") and Michelle Pfeiffer (""mother!""). A real case again of an ""oh, it's you"" film again at the cinema – when's the last time we saw that? <br/><br/>It's also great to see young Lucy Boynton, so magnificent in last year's excellent ""Sing Street"", getting an A-list role as the twitchy and disturbed countess. <br/><br/>With all these ingredients in the pot, it should be great, right? Unfortunately, in my view, no, not quite. The film's opening momentum is really not maintained by the screenplay by Michael Green (""Blade Runner 2049""; ""Logan""). At heart, it's a fairly static and ""stagey"" piece at best, set as it is on the rather claustrophobic train (just three carriages on the Orient Express really?). But the tale is made even more static by the train's derailment in the snow. Branagh and Green try to sex up the action where they can, but there are lengthy passages of fairly repetitive dialogue. One encounter in particular between Branagh and Depp seems to last interminably: you wonder if the problem was that the director wasn't always looking on to yell ""Cut""! <br/><br/>All this leads to the ""revelation"" of the murderer as being a bit of an anticlimactic ""thank heavens for that"" rather than the gasping denouement it should have been. (Perhaps this would be different if you didn't know the twist).<br/><br/>However, these reservations aside, it's an enjoyable night out at the flicks, although a bit of a disappointment from the level of expectation I had for it. I can't be too grumpy about it, given it's a return to good old-fashioned yarn-spinning at the cinema, with great visuals and an epic cast. And that has to be good news.<br/><br/>For sure, Branagh does make for an amusing and engaging Poirot, even if his dialogue did need some 'tuning in' to. There was a suggestion at the end of the film that we might be seeing his return in ""Death on the Nile"" – the most lush and decorous of Peter Ustinov's outings – which I would certainly welcome. He will have to find another 10 A- list stars though to decorate the boat, which will be a challenge for casting!"

","I was so looking forward to this remake.. Kenneth Branagh is so very talented. His live action Cinderella was delightful, But this remake looks beautiful but is so wordy and boring. For the first ten minutes we are shown how clever Poirot is and after a lot unnecessary padding eventually we get on to the train . With all its glory. Great photography. But there was virtually no character development; and the sound was so poor ( even At The Odeon Leicester Square) that I did not have a clue what was going on.(which is partially why there are no spoilers.)In fact it was so dull I nodded off and woke up when the murder had been committed . So I did not have a clue who was dead.( so no spoiler! An hour had passed and the rest of the film trundled along like a slow goods train, whilst Branagh did his stuff. I think he thought he was playing in Shakespeare's Henry the fifth. For at the denouement, he just went on and on and on with speech after speech, in that phoney French accent which was like a bad imitation of Maurice Chevalier. In fact had it been a musical, I was waiting for him to burst into song! Mercifully this travesty ended and we left. Incredibly disappointed.<br/><br/>The original1974 version and the Richard RODNEY Bennett score was such fun which captured the light Agatha Christie feel. This was like a very heavy plum pudding.

"mshavzin","2","83","149","13 November 2017"," Meh. Too much added political correctness which made a boring adaptation just that much more boring.
","Im not sure if they were trying to make it modern, or what they were doing, but all they managed to do was put me to sleep. The re writing was just vile. It completely contradicts the reality of the 1930's. No one would have gone to a black doctor then, not even if he had been in the war, and had been sponsored by someone. It was all about current issues. The word ""race"" was said over 20 times until I lost count. I just got tired of them talking about segregation laws, and whatever else. Not that this isn't a worthwhile subject, but it simply does not belong in a Agatha Christie mystery at all. Then they went out of their way to go after sexism, making sure Penelope Cruz's character was ""trained to fight"" which is also absurd given the time period, and generally absurd given that she is tiny, and a reasonably healthy fifteen year old boy could probably win a fight with her. Agatha Chritie didn't write Buffy. The most likeble character was Ratchett himself, which is a big problem, and the opposite of what Christie wrote. I can't think of a worse adaptation of this work, and I have seen many. Just terrible."

"fletcherc21","6","36","61","10 November 2017"," Fans of Poirot steer clear, for there is no Poirot here
","This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. Branagh's portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.<br/><br/>A strong supporting cast featuring Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, and many other familiar faces performs well. However, no one stands out in the way Ingrid Bergman did in the 1974 adaptation or Jessica Chastain in the 2010 version.<br/><br/>There were also several semi-action moments that were incredibly out of character for Poirot, yet provided no actual excitement to justify the sudden stylistic change. The ending hints at Death on the Nile being the next mystery for this detective masquerading as Poirot to tackle, but Poirot should not be summoned to solve a murder, he simply stumbles upon them whenever he goes on vacation."
"Obi_Bamm_Karaoke","9","188","367","9 November 2017"," A Nice Change Of Pace And A Solid Throwback
","When was the last time Hollywood gave us a true old school style ""whodunit"" type of film? (Don't strain your brain here. You can take it as rhetorical.) These types of stories, where a detective is presented with a crime scene and figures it all out with just their intellect and powers of observation have always been a big part of my life. Trying to figure out the culprit before its eventual reveal was always challenging to me, and putting these stories on the big screen have kind of faded into the background. So, what do you do when you want to bring them back? Call Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>In his latest film, he brings to life one of the most famous detective novels in Agatha Christie's ""Murder on the Orient Express"". He plays the famous (and infamous, depending on who you are) Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, who is taking a bit of a vacation on his way to his next case on the famous Orient Express. Unfortunately, fate has its own plans for him as a murder most foul (I have always wanted to use that phrase in a review) happens during a snowstorm that derails the train. No one is seen by Poirot as innocent as he questions the passengers, follows the clues, and races against time to solve the case before the local authorities arrive and could accuse the wrong person of the murder.<br/><br/>OK, so let me run down the cast for you: Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr., Tom Bateman, Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Coleman, Willem Defoe, and Dame Judi Dench. And yes, they are ALL in this thing, as well as Branagh, who also directed. Given all of that paired with the fact that this runs less than two hours, and I was intrigued on multiple levels. And trust me here: this film does not disappoint. Sure, there are some liberties taken from the source material, but none of them are so far out of the norm that will drive the fans of any previous iterations of this story. Branagh is truly enjoyable as the character who is a genius but has his own issues that actually enhance his powers of observation, and his direction is top-notch here. This is gorgeously shot, including a few shots where there is a nod to the old ways of effects, giving a tighter and more nostalgic feel to the modern telling of this tale.<br/><br/>The performances here are exactly what I expected from a cast of this caliber. With a story that has been around as long as ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has been (the book was written in 1934), there is a bit of a minefield when it comes to bringing it to life that could easily fall down the slope into parody or cariacature, but diverse screenwriter Michael Green, whose resume covers everything from ""Green Lantern"" to ""Everwood"" and even ""Logan,"" is able to write dialogue that lets the actors really get into the skins of these characters to treat them with the proper respect and dignity. Yes, there ARE a few liberties taken with the characters themselves, but there was nothing done that gave me even a little bit of growling. Each character has its own arc and motivations that work into the larger picture in a way that is engaging with no wasted space at all.<br/><br/>There will be people that will find this film to be a bit outlandish, but I feel that those people are those that have not taken the time to really study the genre. Not every film has to dumb itself down to cater to the lowest common denominator, and I really enjoy it when a film tells me to engage my suspension of disbelief and simply entertain me. For great escapism and a reminder of a simpler time, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" achieves this goal for an audience that can truly appreciate its greatness."

His Poirot convinced me and the old glories like Judy Dench, Willelm Defoe and Johnny Depp do their job and do it well, but in my opinion the most interesting notes come from the young people: I personally loved Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, but the real surprise was Sergei Polunin: I mean, for those who saw him performing as dancer, it's not a real surprise, but it's really hard to believe it was his first time in a movie! He has given to his character this melancholy, turbulent and passionate aura, halfway between a Shakespearean prince and James Dean. His expressions, his little gestures, the way he looked at his wife, he made me feel like a teenager who cannot wait to buy his poster and stick it over her bed!

","Diane and I viewed this beauty of a film this afternoon, and we both thoroughly enjoyed a magical cinema event: I use these words because the movie takes you out of your own reality and places you in another world that is not macabre or dangerous but filled with beautiful people, costumes and settings. <br/><br/>Perhaps the reader can tell that I love being removed from the mundanity of our ordinary existence. This beautifully constructed film filled with marvellous actors who are dressed in gorgeous timely costumes and set to work in spectacular train compartments and asked to use a perfect script will leave many cinema-goers anticipating more.<br/><br/>If I were much younger, I would not hunger for the movies from the Directors Period in the 70s and 80s when they were allowed to make Great Movies rather than only the money-men.

","I really enjoyed this movie even though I adore the original. I went in with mixed feelings and the fear that this would be a typical horrible Hollywood remake, well it wasn't. Especially with a star cast like this it would have been easy to just let the writing and directing slide by so my fear was not that irrational. Branagh absolutely shone in his role as Poirot just like the rest of the cast did in their roles. Sure they added to the background stories of the characters but why shouldn't they? And are people seriously complaining that they added a black doctor? Seriously people. I was afraid they would americanize it but they didn't. This movie is not worse than the original. It is not without the Christie Charme. This is the best movie I've seen this year. I enjoyed it immensely and will absolutely watch it again."

","One thing is, that I do not think that Kenneth Branagh do the great Hercule Poirot justice. As a true fan, I think that David Suchet is the most perfect Poirot, and it is obviously too big shoes to fill for Branagh.
Another thing is, that the strong finish, that Christie is a master of, gets kind of blah. It is make to seem, that Poirot cannot solve this crime, which is so obvious, and first at the end it hits him *Sigh* In the novel and in the Suchet movie it is pretty clear, that Poirot knows, but is having a moral dilemma. He understands the motive, but do not condone of murder, and therefore he is less than inclined to solve the riddle, than in his other cases. This fact is totally left out of this remake!
Why do I give it 5 stars then, you ask. The scenery and the stunning sets."

","Why was this movie even made... why did I go watch it... It is a long list of movie stars playing movie stars who play characters in a movie. Each character is a caricature of what they should be. Then there is the gravity defying train - did no one else see this except me? When filmed from outside, the train is tilted about 20 degrees, but inside the train everything is level... this is some Hogwarths stuff.. The scenery where the murder takes place looks like Alps.. in reality it is a plain. OK, I understand this will not matter much to anyone who is either from Croatia or who is not a geography aficionado, but in case any of you were inspired by the scenery and wanted to book a ski holiday there - don't. It is always risky doing a remake of a great movie, and this one is a flop through and through. The first 30 minutes was unbearable.. I thought it would turn into an action movie with the fast camera, bar fight kung fu sh*t, and overly dramatised characters... (I bet Agatha Cristie is rolling in her grave like a revolving door)."

"Euporie","1","13","21","26 June 2018"," Not Agatha Christie's Poirot but something atrocious - zero stars
","Poirot in this film is Romeo, James Bond, some sort of social activist all combined into one:) Everyone knows him and adores him! Physically, he looks nothing like Poirot described in the books. He is not egg-shaped, he has an atrocity of a colour-changing moustache which is not even stuck properly and he also sports some dead-cockroach like goatee. Grossed out yet? 
The writer definitely had no clue of Poirot's character or his traits and his writing is not even good enough for a high school play.<br/><br/>So, Kenneth Branagh just went along with all this as long as he got to be in every scene and mouth long monologues(?) After all, he being the director, protagonist, producer etc. surely had some say in character development? I read a lot of reviews reviewing Kenneth Branagh instead of the film, and I don't blame them at all. It is really hard to tell if he deviated so much from the character to glorify himself or Poirot...Sure looks like Branagh wasting his talent by vying for some non-existent glory instead of playing the character for what it is. He totally sidelined all other characters - why cast Judi Dench when all you can give her is 2 lines? He just seemed pleased to have everyone gushing over Poirot at a glance and act like some superhuman figure! He also keeps laughing annoyingly while reading his book.<br/><br/>I definitely do not have an ear for accents, let alone Belgian ones, but even I could tell that this was an accent very badly done. I mean I took A-Level French and in one of the very first lessons, they teach you that 's' is never pronounced at the end of words like 'oeufs'. Did anyone pay any attention on set??? 
Also can't understand why they had to cheapen every single character, including Poirot?! All the actors, especially Tom Bateman (Bouc) mouth dialogues like they are reading lines off of a placard. Can't blame them - sample this cheesy dialogue from the character Bouc - ""He (Poirot) never judges me for being a terrible person!"" Okay whatever...but I am judging! There were so many such 'gems' that after a while, I just stopped listening to the dialogue and zoned out completely. Seasoned actors are made to perform scenes like this - Michelle Pfeiffer flirts cheesily with Johnny Depp and he sniffs her and then leaves with a disgusted look! Ewwww...And that three holy men thing at the beginning - I don't even...<br/><br/>'Murder on the Orient Express' is not a good mystery as such. Even while reading the book, I could guess the ending much much before the reveal and was bored with multiple chapters of Poirot's questioning. I think they keep remaking it as they can cast a wide variety of well-known actors and keep making money off of their starriness. 
Since everyone is comparing this film to the 1974 version, here is my take on that. I am not a fan of Albert Finney's Poirot either (yes yes, Oscar nominated and all!). He had a grating voice that was like nails on a chalkboard. He yelled and yelled and then yelled some more in his thick, incomprehensible accent. However, he did not glamorize Poirot or try to change him into what he was not and the other characters had much more to do in that version. Only thing that works for Branagh over Finney is that he has a pleasant voice, so you can sleep through his monologues.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, do watch the David Suchet version. It is very very good and much shorter. Suchet also nailed Poirot perfectly.<br/><br/>PS: 1. The song that Michelle Pfeiffer sings at the end seems like it was written for Poirot's long lost love (the woman whose pic he keeps with him), so maybe he should have sung it and made some more mockery of the character:)
2. Now they are remaking 'Death On the Nile'...Why? Wasn't this one bad enough? Someone else should try making more interesting Poirot novels like 'Lord Edgware Dies' or 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'."

"TheLittleSongbird","5","22","41","10 November 2017"," Doesn't completely derail, but doesn't have enough steam
","'Murder on the Orient Express' as a book is, speaking as a big Agatha Christie fan, one of her best with a compelling and twisty story, many characters that are also nicely developed and one of her most ingenious endings (along with 'And Then There Were None', 'Death on the Nile', 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and 'Witness for the Prosecution').<br/><br/>Of the four filmed adaptations of 'Murder on the Orient Express' the only outstanding one is the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, which is one of the best cinematic Agatha Christie adaptations to me. The others are the David Suchet version, which is often considered one of the worst of the series but from personal opinion while very flawed it's better than given credit for, and the 2001 Alfred Molina version which is a mess. This latest version has a good deal going for it but feels like an adaptation too far. Actually saw it a couple of days ago, but was not sure what my thoughts on it were.<br/><br/>Let's start with 'Murder on the Orient Express's' good things. It is a very beautiful film visually, very elegantly shot, lots of stunning scenery, sumptuous costumes that are evocative of the period and a train that has the grandeur and claustrophobic confinement that is necessary. The make-up is also wonderfully elaborate. The story does have some intriguing moments and it is a very clever one in the first place. Poirot is an interesting as he should be. Kenneth Branagh does a very nice job with the visual style, the script is thought-provoking and Poirot's crime-solving is delightful. The relative faithfulness to the source material is commendable too.<br/><br/>He also stars as Poirot and generally is surprisingly good, he is very commanding, suitably steely and captures his crime-solving skills beautifully. He could however have brought out more of Poirot's lighter and more eccentric side, like the obsessiveness, there isn't enough of that here. The cast is star studded and generally the acting is very good. Standouts include Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, a surprisingly well-cast and suitably conflicted Josh Gad and Daisy Ridley, Derek Jacobi and Willem Dafoe also make much of not very much.<br/><br/>Conversely, there are other elements that don't work. The mystery itself is intriguing as a story but doesn't have enough tension or energy. With so many characters and so much focus on Poirot, the exploration of the supporting characters is limited, meaning many of the characters are really sketchy in development. Branagh excels in the visual side of the direction but it comes at the expense at providing enough depth to the mystery.<br/><br/>The film has a slow and awkwardly staged beginning and the ingenious denouement feels under-cooked and contrived for an ending so justifiably famous and brilliant. Just to make it clear, the problem is not the denouement itself, it's the execution of it that's the problem. While the cast are on very good form mostly, an exception is Johnny Depp. Really didn't get the sense that Rachett was a nasty piece of work, like in the book and especially Toby Jones' interpretation in the Suchet adaptation when talking of the previous versions, and that the performance was too much of a pale caricature of Depp's lesser roles. Have really liked a lot of what Patrick Doyle has done, but this is not one of his better music scores. It's not awful, but it is blandly uninspired and its slightly syrupy feel doesn't fit. Oh, and Branagh's moustache is like a character of its own and am really not sure as to whether that is a compliment or not.<br/><br/>In summary, some good things that stops it from completely derailing but the lack of steam makes it a bland endeavour, this wonderful story and Christie deserve better. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

No, I couldn't sit through this film as it was plain irritating. Worst of all was the interpretation of Hercule Poirot with a ridiculous mustache, accent and countenance. And he was too tall, and did not resemble Christie's physical or personality description.
For a viewer unfamiliar with Agatha Christie books or David Suchet's masterful and definitive Poirot, it might be a watchable movie. But as I have been a Christie fan for 50 years, have read all her books more than once, and own all the wonderful TV series DVDs starring Suchet, this movie was a waste of time.

Appallingly awful; it actually led me to revisit the David Suchet version made for British television, and upgrade my previously poor opinion of that strangely conceived version of Agatha Christie's best book.
Of course, neither is a match for the extraordinary 1974 Sidney Lumet film, with its extraordinary cast and transcendent Richard Rodney Bennett score--despite the eccentric (but ultimately quite serviceable) performance of Alfred Finney as Poirot. But the Suchet version is better than this monstrosity.
The less said about Branagh the actor's crazy rendition of the detective the better...other than to wonder how Branagh the director let him get away with it (or those mustaches!).
Poor KB has not been himself since the break with Emma Thompson. Almost all of his excellent films were made before that divorce. Since then he has become progressively more self-indulgent and commercialized.

","Oh goody where do I start. First off, I'm not entirely certain if my review will contain spoilers as of yet but it will certainly ruin the movie for you (not that there's much to ruin anyway).<br/><br/>So off we go. First off, it wouldn't feel like 2017 Hollywood if:<br/><br/>1- the only Muslim in the movie, ""mohammed"", is a super-friendly chef. Emphasis on ""super friendly"" and a good friend of the protagonist, Detective Hercules Poirot (whose name in itself is a joke. You'd get it if you speak French. Poire means Pear in French, and his first name being Hercules, you can see how it all doesn't really fit. It's like Agatha Cristy was trying to copy the eccentricity of the names of Sherlock Holmes and his brothers but failed miserably at it).<br/><br/>2- the only black man in the movie is the highest achiever of them all (there's Hollywood for ya!), being not only a highly skilled sniper and close friend to a Colonel in the US Army, but also a doctor. Of course, he is the one who's in a secret relationship with the pretty white girl in the movie.<br/><br/>3- Which leads us to the evil, monstrous, highly racist German (technically Austrian), who's the only one who can't stand to sit in the same carriage as the black man, even though an elderly, high-strung and snobby Russian princess doesn't mind at all, reminding us of the ever so important, If not THE most important lesson in life: Germans are always evil!<br/><br/>4- The half-jew who poses as the racist German turns out to be a very friendly non-racist person once he is uncovered, how convenient for him and all the jews of the world!<br/><br/>You know, I don't mind these kinds of things in movies when they have a PURPOSE. Not when they're thrown in there like carrots in a stew, just for the sake of it, oh, and for the sake of 21st century brainwashing of course. It's too bad the story doesn't take place in modern times or another evil character would have been Russian, coz of course all Russians want to dominate the world in the name of mazar rascha.<br/><br/>But that's enough about Hollywood, let's get to the main reason I'm writing this article.<br/><br/>The evidence in the movie is not enough to lead to the conclusion. Plain and simple. Not to mention the story being terribly ridiculous! There was a very good chance one of the characters were going hang if Poirot (there's that name again) hadn't been there to actually ""solve"" the murder. But it didn't seem like any of them were very keen to sacrifice themselves in the end of the movie, so why go through with it? Did they not think that one of them would very likely be hanged for their actions? The only one who was truly committed to her actions in the end was the person least suspected of being the culprit (don't confuse this with ""the least likely suspect is the killer"". It's not like that, it's that of all the people involved in the crime, only one was brave enough to accept the consequences in the end). If anything, murdering Johny Depp's character (forgot his name, great performance by Depp though, that man truly never fails to impress) would have been much better if done someplace else than the train, at least in that case the list of suspects would be much larger, and they'd have a much bigger chance to get away with it, but that's on Agatha Christy, who's not even worthy of being Arthur Conan Doyle's secretary, just like Pearot isn't good enough to be John Watson's secretary. Oh, he's not even qualified to clean Sherlock's clothes so let's not even go there...) This entire story is one of those ""the writer/director wants it, so it happens. For an crime story, it's based on behavior based on very weak thinking by the characters, and therefor, the writer.<br/><br/>I went in with an open mind, I truly did, and for that, I was rewarded with a slap on the face. So now I get to slap back everyone involved in making that movie and novel."
"VintageSoul56","3","24","48","12 November 2017"," You Just Cannot Beat the 1974 Version
","The way this version was handled was heavy handed and dark. Not that murder shouldn't be just that, but the 1974 was handled with more of a lightness and the script just breezed along. This version just was so long, too wordy and had many unnecessary scenes, especially in the beginning of the movie (however, I did like the Middle Eastern music playing in the background of part of the beginning). I did like the camera work even though a lot of it was CG. I didn't care for the script delving into Poirot's past. I've always thought that he should remain a sort of enigma. Let's face it, you can't beat the star power of the 1974 version. I only knew six members of this cast. It's good that the younger cast is getting a chance to be in something like this for the experience, but all of them were mediocre. This also included the well known cast and I love Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, but they weren't given much to work with. The only stand out was Derek Jacobi with his (I think English Midlands accent). He was believable in his part.<br/><br/>I think that Kenneth Branaugh is trying to make a comeback of sorts. He was the darling, the new Lawrence Olivier of the 1990's. I personally think that his time came and went. Please, Mr. Branaugh, don't make a re-make of ""Death on the Nile"". Leave that one to Peter Ustinov and you should have left this one to Albert Finney. If you do decide that you absolutely need to make or re-make any of the Poirot's, lose the major mustache and the heavy Belgian accent. I could barely understand what you were saying. Mr. Finney, Mr. Ustinov and Mr. Suchet did not need to lay their accents on thick. A person could actually understand what they were saying. In other words, please try your hand at something else for your film comeback. This wasn't it.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 3 because of the camera work. I did stay till the end of the credits because I thought that I recognized the voice singing the end song and I wanted to see if I was right. It was who I thought that it was. Mystery solved."

Yes, he has assembled a world class cast of superstar actors, but it's Branagh himself, both as actor and Director, who pulls the real meaning of this story out.<br/><br/>This is a tale of loss, sorry, unrequited grief and, above all, revenge. You don't get much more powerful emotions in human existence and these are wonderfully executed here. <br/><br/>It's fantastic, even if you know the plot. Go and see it and watch this wonderful tale again from a different perspective. Don't go just for light-hearted entertainment. It is that on one level.

While reviewing, people often forget the issue with the original story i.e. it's set entirely in the train. Considering the limited space that they had, Branagh does an amazing job with the direction. This isn't just a remake but in fact an entirely different adaptation. Not that it runs away from the main story but it has a sort of different take on it. Apart from that, Branagh easily manages to portray Poirot with all his eccentricity.

","The original movie of 1974 was a classic, with Albert Finney a near perfect Poirot as created by Agatha Christie and arresting performances from all. This is a disaster.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is a director who has never quite bridged the gap between stage and screen. His movies are awkwardly theatrical and never feel comfortable. He's a stage thespian who tries to mimic the same style on screen and it never really works. His Poirot cannot hold a candle to Finney's.<br/><br/>The plot is almost the same with a few cosmetic changes. The support cast are either miscast or too wooden in their performances. Compare the performances of the normally good Judie Densch vs 1974's Wendy Hiller in playing Princess Dragomiroff to see what I mean.<br/><br/>If comparisons are seen to be unfair between the 2017 and 1974 versions, let me add that even as a standalone movie this falls short for the same reasons.

The first thing that hit me is Poirot's accent. I have worked with Belgians for 35 years, and that is, at most, a bad Flemish accent. Certainly not a French speaking Belgian's. Belgian French is pretty much French, and when they speak English they sound more or less like French people. Branagh's accent is not at all that. Probably close to a Dutch or German speaking English. And besides when he speaks French he does not even sound French. I guess this is the problem with actor-directors. They often fail their character because there isn't a director to guide them, and they focus so much on their character that they forget to direct the other actors.

Since the gimmick is to portray the characters as strangers to each other, the major fail is that they do not interact as strangers are want to do. The few ridiculous overhead shots are disconcerting rather than adding to the movie in any way.

This glossy remake tries to be everything to everyone and that's been proven impossible many times over - it's a murder mystery, comedy, drama, romance, spectacle, that only just manages to be a little of them all. Kenneth Branagh, shows off as director and star (Hercule Poirot) and his big international cast probably had more fun than some audiences might - except those who don't expect a great deal from an over baked multimillion dollar production. The trailer too, looked impressive, but also sowed the seeds of apprehension about over promise. <br/><br/>Maybe I expected too much but, it seems from an assortment of reviews, others also felt a little caught out - and to think, already, they are planning to remake more in this series.

"junkmail-48566","1","7","11","26 July 2018"," Avoid this at all costs! See the 1974 Sidney Lumet version instead!
","Kenneth Branaugh receives the raspberries for this unnecessary remake of Dame Agatha Christie's classic novel. Having seen the 1974 version when first released, it was full of glamour, as a period piece set in the 1930s should have been, and each character was fully developed. Branaugh spent too much time and energy with his development of his portrayal of Christie's sleuth, Hercule Poirot, that the development of any other characters failed to occur. Branaugh focused on Poirot's obsessive-compulsive disorder to make his own character three-dimensional, leaving all of the suspects characterizations as one-dimensional MacGuffins, to use a Hitchcockian term. Another weak point in this film is the dramatic score, which contains nothing memorable other than Michelle Pfeiffer's vocal over the closing credits. Lumet's 1974 film contains a score by Richard Rodney Bennett, lushly orchestrated with hummable themes that complement Geoffrey Unsworth's beautiful Panavision cinematography. Although Branaugh's version was shot with 65mm cameras (the same ones used by Christopher Nolan for ""Dunkirk""), the process was wasted here since most of the shots in the film are confined to a set, and only the exterior shots benefited from its use. Super 35mm (what was once known as SuperScope), Panavision or digital cinematography would have been just as suitable for this production. Lumet's film also made use of an all-star cast whose acting skills were well proven in advance. It's unnecessary to list the cast here, as it can be viewed on the IMDB page for that version, however this version has few recognizable names, and some will even enjoy the fact that the murder of Johnny Depp's character occurs less than halfway through the film, and that his screen time is kept to a minimum! Sitting through this poorly-done remake of what was previously filmed with style, class, and glamour in 1974 is a waste of time. If you want to view a great whodunit, beautifully crafted, with excellent characterization, see the Lumet version. Dame Agatha Christie claimed that Lumet's version and Billy Wilder's 1957 film of ""Witness for the Prosecution"" were the only two films that did justice to her literary work."

The train itself and the scenery are about all there is to see in this remake, and the film is easily one of the biggest disappointments of the season (and year). There are times in this film where I could swear the cast is reading their lines off teleprompters--it's that lifeless. Filmmaking 101 says when you make a film version of a book you want to open up the imagination of viewers with visuals that illustrate the words rather than just having characters read the words rote and lifelessly on-screen in static exposition. Kenneth Branagh, as both director and star, lets us down completely, and all of these fine actors are completely wasted, as is Christie's glorious and vivid story.

"CANpatbuck3664","8","35","78","12 November 2017"," Kenneth Branagh Delivers a Skillful and Slick Update That Still Has Enough Emotional Punch
","As much as the Murder on the Orient Express book is appreciated as a classic, I came into this movie without knowing the story. I want to start by talking about Hercule Poirot as a character. This movie really portrays Poirot in a Sherlock Holmes ""esque"" light. There's a point where Hercule takes someone out with a cane that felt like he was channelling Robert Downey Jr. in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I don't mean this as a criticism though, the fact that Hercule is witty and funny along with being brilliant is much needed levity for this movie. Some people have complained that the movie is too comedic but without those opportunities to laugh, the beginning of this movie would be unbearably slow. Those moments are like the spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. So, I liked Poirot and you needed a charismatic character at the centre because the other characters don't get developed much until the murder goes down. This movie looks like an ensemble, but it leans more heavily on Branagh as the main character than you would think.<br/><br/>The plot of Murder on the Orient Express is iconic, but the way movie portrays it, there's almost little to none. We get the initial setup of everyone boarding the train and other than some preliminary chitchat between Poirot and the other travellers and a tense exchange between Ratchett (Johnny Depp's character) and Poirot, very little happens. Only after the murder happens and the interrogations begin do we get to know everyone and does the plot kick into gear. Just like any great detective thriller, we don't know what's going on and we must unravel the mystery just as Poirot does. When we get to see more about the victim's past and what how appalling his/her actions were does the emotion kick and the stakes are raised considerably.<br/><br/>I want to go through the cast name by name and give them all credit but there's just too many names. Branagh is a little over-the-top as Poirot but I would argue that the movie needed that. Its a very theatrical performance (considering his background, it makes sense) but without him chewing the scenery, the movie would have dragged. Michelle Pfeiffer sold out in her role as Caroline, it was nice to see her again. Daisy Ridley shines as Mary Debenham, I hope she keeps picking up more work. Leslie Odom Jr. had a lot screen presence as Dr. Arbuthnot. I appreciated the fact that Johnny Depp pulled back a little as Ratchett but he still borders overacting. If there was anyone I didn't like; Judi Dench was so stiff she was annoying but that was also how the character was written. I normally like Josh Gad but with the screen time divided between so many actors and actresses, he was kneecapped by a lack of room to show his stuff.<br/><br/>When you can't bank on the character development or the plot, you need top notch window dressing to help move things along. Luckily the Orient Express is up to the task. The visual effects, the costuming and the exotic atmosphere transport you to another world. I've seen it done more impressively but they really do a stellar job since the movie had a relatively modest budget ($55 million). We get to go to Istanbul, Jerusalem and travel in snowy vistas. We also get to see past events through an old-timey projector and the characters watch it like a movie. Branagh is wise to linger on this stuff and it adds to the escapism that the story can provide. When you go to a period piece movie, you want to be wowed and dropped off in this new world and I think Murder on the Orient Express accomplished that.<br/><br/>I came out of this movie wanting to go read the book, so I don't want to be too critical. But the biggest downfall of this movie is that much like the train the characters are travelling on, the movie takes a while to start picking up steam. The opening with Poirot is fun but after that first 15 minutes, the movie slows to a crawl. It relies on Branagh and the beautiful vistas to carry it and while I remained interested, I think a lot of people will be mentally checking out. But the movie does get going and I think if you're willing to be patient, you'll get what you want in the reveal.<br/><br/>Talking about that reveal though, I thought it was fantastic. I want to credit Agatha Christie for originally conceiving it but I also want to credit Branagh and the writers for doing a solid job of yanking the rug out from under you. Its an excellent wrap-up and I was emotionally impacted by it. It was unpredictable, fresh and through the efforts of the excellent cast and the shocking nature of the crimes, it raised the rating I was going to give the movie by at least a half a point.<br/><br/>I was excited to see this movie and although it wasn't amazing, I wasn't disappointed by it either. This is an adult movie though; the trailer makes it look there's going to be more action and there isn't. If there weren't funny jokes sprinkled in, the movie would be too dry and other than the fans of the book, the rest of the audience would be bored to tears. I went in a group of 3, 2 of us liked it and the 3rd said it was boring and disappointing. If you like mysteries or period piece movies, this will be up your alley. I left wanting to read this book and they hint at a possible sequel that I would also be interested in seeing. If you're a relatively patient moviegoer that appreciates lavish set dressing, good acting and a unique twist, I'd recommend checking this out."

-Well done visually. Great color palette, sets, costumes, and especially the cinematography
-Impressive cast, and all of the actors who received a decent amount of screen time gave good performances
-Some very good scenes sprinkled throughout. The scene between Branagh and Depp was the only truly great scene in the movie.<br/><br/>The Bad:
-Underused actors. Many great actors are given barely any screen time. Judi Dench in particular only has a couple of minutes. Hardly what an actress of her caliber should receive.
-Awful CG shots of the train. The movie legitimately looks like The Polar Express at points.
-Drawn out first act, including a very unnecessary and poorly done opening.<br/><br/>The Ugly:
-The dialogue/script. The dialogue has occasional moments of greatness, especially in the second and third act, but most of it is unbearably bad. All of the characters just give a giant monologue explaining themselves completely out of nowhere. The movie even had the perfect opportunity to put this exposition into Poirot's interviews with each character, but instead characters just launch into monologue. Bouc in particular is very grating and poorly written. 
-The mystery. In the book, Poirot's detective skills, whilst extraordinary, still felt grounded and realistic. In this, it feels almost supernatural. Clues and leads from the book are cast aside and Poirot pulls all of his revelations from thin air. Very lazy writing.
-The pacing. First act is too long, second act is too short, third act is too long. The film takes it sweet ass time to get going, but leaves out all of the setup from the book, making it feel less like setup and more like 40 minutes of nothing. Less material took more time than more material should have. The investigation, which should be tense and slow burning, is rushed through and feels empty. Rather than letting the audience figure everything out alongside Poirot, the film makes the audience watch him interview everyone and then explain everything. Very boring. Ending was simply drawn out, unsatisfying, and too long.
-The twist. Didn't make sense in the book, makes even less sense here.
-Filler. The film, without filler, is barely feature length, when if done properly it should be well over two hours.<br/><br/>TLDR- Boring and poorly paced, despite interesting visuals. Very disappointing. 3/10"

Kenneth Branagh is not doing a bad job, but the other two just play imo the role of the Belgian mastermind more convincing and with more charisma and with a finer, more delicate humor. 
2nd: even as the cast of the remake is filled with nowadays famous actors they cannot compete with actors like Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery or Anthony Perkins (just to name a few of cast from the 1974 adaption of Murder on the Orient Express).<br/><br/>As the story is known the only outstanding ""merits"" of this remake are the implements of the issue of racism (for some historical reasons imo poorly implemented and presented). An easy way nowadays to get some applause and attention. As the story doesn't gives you the chance to hide behind Fx and action-scenes the attention of the audience is focused mostly on the actors/acting. Well, they all do are decent job, but imo nothing outstanding.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Kenneth Branagh's remake is no pain in the a** but no ""must-see"". If I would have to choose for an evening movie to watch between Sidney Lumet's or Kenneth's movie, I would re-watch the classic from 1974. <br/><br/>Recommendable for fans of the involved actors like Depp, Ridley, Cruz, Dafoe etc. and Kenneth himself of course.

It has a good portrait of some 18 th century look with all those etiquettes and manners. The movie is fully loaded with the part part story of different suspects that made it difficult for the audience to guess the final answer.<br/><br/>As you know most central roles were done by excellent actors and actresses there is no complaint about the acting. All the acting was very much splendid. Only it can be said that they have done it a little heavy. The dialogues are sometimes a bit too much for the audiences to capture.<br/><br/>Over all the movie is a little slow..Like the thriller movies of early 1960's or 70's . But it has many good things to offer. A group of excellent actors together with a fine plot and diffuse suspense has made it a good enjoyable movie. But as i said it is a bit slow and dialogue dependent movie some viewers may experience it as a boring time. i have to say you had better show some patience and you will find the gold. This is A movie that can shake you when you will watch it even for the second time..Imagine what will happen when you go for the first time??????"

","After my disappointment with David Suchet's version, I went to see this with a little trepidation. However, I was bowled away with this. The cinematography is breathtaking, Johnny Depp's excellently portrayed Ratchett is truly a horrible man, and the rest of the cast are just as superb. I particularly liked Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman as Princess Dragomiroff and her maid Hildegard Schmidt. For me, the key elements of the plot were all true to the novel and while a lot of changes had been made I felt they'd enhanced the film. I actually got quite emotional at the point where the full story is revealed and we discover what really happened. And while David Suchet's 'tache might be closer to Ms Christie's description, anyone who's ever seen Belgian entrants to moustache competitions will realise Kenneth Branagh's 'tache is very Belgian. This is now my favourite version of the story."
"BILLYBOY-10","5","9","16","23 November 2017"," Mundane Attempt
","O.K. O.K. I have watched the 1974 all-star Sidney Lumet directed version over a dozen times and still consider it the superior version, even better than the recent one on the made-for-PBS-TV one with David Suchet as Poirot. This version, sadly for me, diverts into some pretty cheesy melodrama, and events which do not appear in either former films and I am now going to re-read Agatha's novel to see if they indeed are in the book. I don't think so. My biggest complaint with this version is that it is anti-climactic in how the director treats the actual murder scene. He breezed thru it with only close up's of the ""stabbers"" whereas the older versions draw out the scene with a further identity of each of them from their individual comments whilst thrusting the blade and even how the each of them vary in how they DO thrust it. Sir John Guilgud in the first version almost dissects the body while poor Ingrid Bergman can hardly pierce it. Very great scene. Also, it is interesting to not that in the Suchet version, Poroit is a deeply religious Catholic and portrayed as such, which is a significant explanation over his torment in concluding the ""first version"" of the crime is the one he must choose to report. I encourage anyone who has not see either version before, to at least view the 1974 one to compare. Thank You."

For too many liberties taken and changes made in this movie. Important clues not in the movie but the conclusion was. What is with that mustache, which is so wrong to the Poirot. Bottom line the movie just did not come together and was cornball. It seemed to me that Kenneth Branagh was having a love fest with himself. If Albert Finny was alive I would be sending him an apology for going to see the re-make. Agatha Christie's family clearly was in just for the money and not the integrity. After the movie I went home and put the 1974 Albert Finny movie on. 200% a better movie which Agatha Christie attended and approved of."

This constitutes the 4th rehash of the original and personally the worse. Performances from the remainder of the cast appear to be ""dumbed down"" and inadequate as Kenneth Branagh steals the limelight.

"joshgibbs-35276","1","8","14","13 November 2017"," Good effort but highly inaccurate and a mess
","Although I am a great fan of Kenneth Branagh but the adaption of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery is full of major holes. For starters they eliminated an important character, colonel Arbuthnot who served with John Armstrong. His famous line ""I prefer a jury of 12 men"" was a major clue to Poirot. Then they renamed the doctor's last name to Arbuthnot for no reason. Secondly, this case happens later in Poirot's career and he is older, and much heavier and bald. The reinvention of Poirot is utterly wrong in this hip sleek back hair with a giant mustachio. The real Agatha Christie's Poirot cannot fight! He is a brainy but physically unfit man. The (Spoiler alert) fight seen with the doctor is another made up seen to add some Hollywood action to the mix. But it is out of place and again distracting. Finally another major flaw is (spoiler alert) the stabbing of Ms Hubbard which is made up to add some sort of diversion that does not exist anywhere else. The set and cinematography is very nice with high production value. But overall this movie fails to capture the real fans and can not appeal to casual mystery fans either as it is too distracting. I was really hoping for a masterpiece with this star studded cast and Branagh acting and directing. But clearly something terribly went wrong as it is the usual case in Hollywood these days. And what resulted is this expensive looking mess of a movie!!!"
"kjproulx","4","18","38","10 November 2017"," A Tedious Viewing Experience
","When a movie revolves around a murder and makes you wonder who the killer is, it really needs to do a great job in getting you invested in the characters at hand. 2017's adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel may just be one of the most disappointing films I've seen all year because it fails to do the one thing that a murder mystery is meant to do, which is to keep you interested from beginning to end. There are many things to gawk at when watching this film, but the story itself definitely isn't one of them. This rendition of Murder on the Orient Express, even though I haven't read the original material or see the other adaptations, is quite the bore and here is why I just can't get myself to really recommend this movie to anyone.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, this movie is wonderfully directed by Kenneth Branagh, but the screenplay for this film ranks pretty low on the scale in terms of Michael Green's previous works. Having written terrific films in Logan and Blade Runner 2049, his past works also include Alien: Covenant and Green Lantern, which were far less than stellar, so I could clearly see a mixture of good and bad throughout this particular screenplay. Focusing mostly on the character of Hercule Poirot, the rest of the passengers are left by the wayside, which is where I feel the film suffers the most.<br/><br/>Getting to know Poirot, Murder on the Orient Express begins in giving the audience a bit of backstory into what is character is all about and once the train gets going, having his character slowly beginning to interact with each of the passengers, the movie seemed to be moving along at a brisk pace, but a certain event occurs, leaving a passenger dead, while also bringing the movie to a complete halt. Everything leading up to the eventual murder on the train was interesting to me, but for reasons that can't be explained here without spoiling, I truly found myself not caring who committed the crime and the movie ended up losing me quite early on.<br/><br/>As far as twists and turns go, Murder on the Orient Express does its very best to trick the audience, but the outcome was very strange to me, making the rest of the movie sort of feel irrelevant. There are many characters to try and flesh out here, and I understand that's a very difficult task to accomplish in scripting a feature film, but when certain characters were given backstories, I felt as though I should begin to care about them more than the others, but in reality, the notion of not really caring about the outcome kept running through my mind. Nearly every aspect of this story was uninteresting to me, but I can't deny that it looks beautiful.<br/><br/>From the sweeping landscapes to the way the camera angles helped move the story along, I found myself immersed in a film that I didn't really care about, which was a pretty frustrating experience. After the conclusion of each big scene, I was sucked back in my rapid-fire dialogue by Kenneth Branagh, only to be bored by overlong sequences of conversations, with only a handful of them being of any interest. This movie had so much potential of being great, but I can't even really call it a good movie.<br/><br/>In the end, this rendition of Murder on the Orient Express tries to be classy and clever, and while the main character of Hercule Poirot is interesting and likable, the cinematography is beautiful, and many of the side characters curious enough to hold my interest, the story itself was sort of a dread to sit through. The conclusion felt odd and nothing felt like much of a revelation to me. I can't see this movie growing a large fanbase, and due to the lack of pacing and character development, I can't recommend that anyone rushes out to see this film. At best, I'd consider a home rental if you're curious, but I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip this. Personally, I disliked this film much more than the portions I enjoyed. Murder on the Orient Express is extremely disappointing."
"ptp-664-500883","5","11","21","26 November 2017"," Opt for the Sidney Lumet version instead
","The 1974 version holds up well even by today's production standards, but the story is far closer to Agatha Christie's original novel and the performances are far better, in part due to far superior screen writing. The set design and costuming of the original are also an improvement to the current version. The exterior cinematography of the 2017 film is the only improvement to the 1974 version, but as the film is filmed mostly in the interior of the train, that is not terribly significant. You can view the original on a number of streaming services in HD for $3.99, so if you have a decent home theater set-up you'd be well advised to go that route and save some money for a more worthwhile production."

It is extremely dull - and that is coming from the perspective of someone who's never seen the original / read the book and has no idea who the killer is - I should have been on the edge of my seat!
(I should mention that I used to watch watch the tv show as a kid so I know a bit about what Poirot should be.)<br/><br/>There are absolutely no clues for the audience and Poirot seems to have some magic source of information that, we audience, are not permitted to to know. There is no feeling of suspense at any point in the film. The sound track was exceedingly dull. The 'evidence' Poirot uses to wrap up the mystery at the end is completely new news to anyone watching the film bar perhaps one or two things but certainly not enough to make the viewer feel in any way a part of the experience. By the end of the film the whole thing just seemed wildly improbable to the point of absolute ludicrousy.<br/><br/>The cast is (obviously) great but I felt all their performances fell flat - no matter how good a cast, you just cannot make up for a dull script, especially in a murder mystery!<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this film is any good must just be a fan of pretty posh people walking around in pretty posh clothes in a pretty posh set (with a couple of good CGI effects thrown in for good measure) because, honestly, anyone with a brain would be bored out of their mind."

There are un-Poirot like action scenes, Branagh's moustache changes every time we see it, they are outside in the mountains without warm coats on and it just feels like it could have been a whole lot better.

","I've seen 6 different productions (1 stage, 3 TV movies and 2 feature movies) and read the original novel through the years.

Even the Japanese adaption which put the set on Hokkaido instead of Balkan is better than this. Unnecessary subplots like the wailing wall case and money stealing only lengthen the movie and shorten the reasoning. e.g., The association of Freebody and Debenham was gone and suddenly, magically, Poirot was convinced Debenham was the governess. Amazing. The association of twelve people in a jury, threatening letter and the no. of passengers was gone. Poirot also didn't need to ask the maid for the first name of the Princess (which is Natalia) so that he could deduce the association N and H in the handkerchief. So, this Poirot suddenly accused the whole team of passengers of killing and they amazing admitted right away. In the original novel, it was only when Poirot ""guess"" quite correctly about what happened in the train on the night of murder then the passengers confessed that he knew everything. Also, an elegant Poirot who insisted on using his grey cells needed to fighter in this adaption. Did the studio require the writer to add some fight scene? This is a fail adaption.

The plot unravels somewhat as you would expect, and the buildup to the climax is engaging like you would expect from a murder mystery... with the acting and scenery, it becomes convincing that the climax will blow you away. (Reason I gave two stars instead of one) But, it doesn't... at all. The plot becomes completely wasted on the outcome of everyone onboard being directly involved in the murder. The fun of guessing the murderer is completely ruined, and it leaves the viewer (me and many others, at least) frustrated that there is basically no point to any of it aside from a web of characters seeking revenge on the antagonist. It is instantaneously converted into a boring tale of morality that resembles a cheesy 80's family TV show. Considering the rapid decline of creativity in the entertainment industry and shift to more machine-like profiteering and pandering, I don't expect much anymore.

It was all so disjointed and pointless, the murder, the journey, the suspects, the raison d'etre of the story. And Branagh uttering these words, as Hercule Poirot: 'I am probably the greatest detective in the world' took things to a new level of banality. It's a great pity, though. I'm sure he started with a half-decent idea. If I damn it, it's also because it's a product of modern cinema, plagued by some very untalented artists, or those too easily swayed by the executives who call the shots. Drama is a very old principle. This film had no drama, no interesting interaction, a complete failure of dialogue. The makers should watch old films and take copious notes.

","This film raises the question ""Should movie versions of books be true to the story and characters."" The core problem is books are long, and films are short. So how do you pick what to film? Given that you have to miss most of book out, does that mean you should add ""new parts"" in lieu of the redacted? I am tempted to think than Kenneth Branagh thinks so. In his version of MOTOE he makes some unique story changes to a Classic tale. The standard justification for this from film makers is that this adds to the ""narrative drive"" when moving from book to film. However, to have Poirot fight like Jackie Chan is so absurdly James Bond-like I wonder what on earth Branagh was thinking! This goes against the very core of the famous Poirot character and his method. (He can solve a crime by simply sitting in office and thinking about all the evidence. Though it is important to note that Christie was quite inconsistent with her characters - Poirot did indeed look for and find ""clues"". Things he often made fun of Hastings for always wanting.)<br/><br/>How does this adaptation compare to others of this well know detective novel? It is a book I know very well. I have not seen the 1974 version for many years, but did enjoy it very much. The BBC radio version is much better than David Suchet version for TV as it is truer to the novel. The Alfred Molina modernization is interesting attempt to deal with the ""problem of the remake"", but is unwatchable. All these versions highlight the problem of the extreme edit that is required for condensing a 350 page novel into 90-120 mins giving rise to the idea that bad novels can make good films, but great novels will result in bad films.<br/><br/>Examples of great book and film: Pride and Prejudice (1940).

I was so offended by the stupid plot changes that I nearly didn't mind, a) adding a black doctor (hope you meet the quota), or b) changing Ms. Ohlsson into a Spanish missionary (can someone venture a good reason other than ""we are short of a mega star with Scandinavian quality so we must make use of Penelope Cruz""?)<br/><br/>Years ago when Miss Marple stories were remade, people were quick to point out that Miss Marple was changed to a distressingly agile and active ol' lady. This time, we have an action-hero Poirot. Ma foi! - is what I think Poirot himself would have said.<br/><br/>But hold the beer. The stupidest plot changes come when the doctor shot at Poirot, AND when the passangers began pointing fingers at each other, given that, a) they plotted together to kill Ratchet, b) nobody expected Poirot to be on the train so any further story was fabricated in a rush, and c) most importantly, they were trying to shift blame to a fictionalized murderer from the outside. Silly still, if you can believe it, after being shot by the doctor, Poirot still offered a theory that an outside killer murdered Ratchet!<br/><br/>If you enjoy an all-star performance, watch the 1974 version instead. That one is not perfect but Sydney Lumet understood that not all the stars could shine so he only gave Ingrid Bergman a 5-minute continuous long shot for her to shine. And boy did she! If you enjoy the definitive Poirot, watch the 2010 version with David Suchet instead. Kenneth Brannagh should stick with modernized Shakespearean stuff - they have the loftiness and gravitas built in so as to satisfy his ego."

","Being a huge fan of Agatha Christie, this movie was such a disappointment for me. Many great actors, but all this movie made me feel was regret for giving it a chance in the first place. All I could see was his oversized moustache. Also, the mountains in Bosnia do not look like Alps at all. And even though it was cold and snow outside, they had no steam coming out of their mouth. My favorite Poirot is and always will be Mr. David Suchet."

The introduction of Hercule Poirot was bad, the ""investigation moments"" were really short and had nothing special, the acting was pretty weird to be honest and overall the movie was a dissappointment for me. Probably I had my hopes too high. Waste of time on my part."

","Why muck with perfection? The original was a perfect film. This was just horrible. I'm a huge Kenneth Branaugh fan but I agree with Vodmoskva; this is totally narcissistic and the casting was terrible. When the original had true stars like Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, and Sean Connery, how in the world do you replace that? The ending was a total mockery of the story and an ego trip for Branaugh. Poirot always has a dominant mustache that is a character of it's own but again, overdone in this version. No humor, as is Poirot's signature - just Kenneth's ego."

","So, I don't necessarily mind adjustments made to source material. Sometimes, what makes sense in a book doesn't quite translate on screen.
But I do mind what Branagh did to Poirot as a character.
I also really dislike the ending which hints at Death On The Nile, promptly spoiling half the story.
I would suggest watching the Poirot series featuring David Suchet if you are keen on ""who done it"" detective stories, as Suchet was by far the closest, most accurate depiction (Ustinov was too fat and over the top for the character)."

Firstly Kenneth Branagh is not hercule Poirot, doesn't look like him, doesn't sound like him, doesn't have his hobbies or quirks, doesn't even involve Hercules his Catholicism (im guessing didn't want to upset the liberals) .....he is best described as general Kitchener in the famous ""Brition wants you!, Join your country's army!)...<br/><br/>Also you can see the whole writing was designed for a modern audience, no whodunnit clever riddles or genius intellect enigmas......simple wiritng for simple people.....maximise profits from the film rather then stick to any actual theme....<br/><br/>You also see some rather stunning political correctness in the part where the train operator tries to convince Poirot to take on the case....saying that either Hakesh or Dr Arbuthnot will likely to be hanged.....firstly Poirot is a catholic which is unbelievably not included, but also means that murder is repugnant to him and takes the case without any prodding.....secondly even in those days they didn't just outright hang men with coloured skin for murder without trial, esp someone in a position such as a Dr.<br/><br/>If your anyone with any Agatha Christie knowledge STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM......<br/><br/>If your anyone with any passion for authenticity or passion for your material STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM....<br/><br/>If your anyone who will watch paint dry or garbage rot THEN GO DO THAT THEN WATCH THIS FILM.....<br/><br/>I wouldn't watch this film for free....."

","This film brings up a poor 3rd - first being the 1970s film with Albert Finney and a cast of real heavy hitters. Apart from Finney being later outclassed by Peter Ustinov as the ""perfect"" personification of Poirot, this film had real class.
Even ITV's David Suchet effort outclassed this meagre offering.
Unless you are a devotee of Marvel Comics and their rather obvious CGI effects, along with 'over the top' character portrayals, you will find yourself looking at this film and simply saying ""Really . . . ?""
I found I couldn't take any of the film seriously. A cast with a few big names, fair enough; except that they either disappeared or had virtually no definitive parts to contribute at all. 
I'm just glad someone else had bought the DVD and I hadn't wasted my money."
"jeffoswald","2","3","4","13 August 2018"," Dreadful
","I am a huge fan of the 1974 Sidney Lumet version. Even if you already knew what was going to occur, Lumet managed to create tension and drama by utilizing an excellent cast and pacing of the plot. The David Suchet version is also exceptionally well done and is a 1b to Lumet's 1a in my opinion. What made these adaptations so good was that they were more or less loyal adaptions to Christie's novel and managed to capture the spirit of the original story. So when I heard that a remake of this movie had been done, I initially refused to see it. Far too many classics have been recently remade and most have been disappointing or downright awful. I wish I had stuck to my original decision.<br/><br/>Alas, I found it on one of the premium movie channels and I could not resist the temptation. I knew that we were in trouble early on when Branagh (whom I usually like very much i.e. Dunkirk) decided to play Poirot not as the dandy that ANYONE who is familiar with this classic character knows him to be. It is like taking James Bond and making him a pacifist.<br/><br/>Then there are the goofy camera angles. What is the point of the shots that literally only show the TOP of the character's head? What the hell is he doing on top of the train? Ugh. <br/><br/>The casting. What a waste of a good cast. Here is a clue for you scriptwriters. When you dramatically change the characters, you dramatically change the script. The story begins to morph into something that is completely unrecognizable. This is definitely the case with this movie. The characters do things that are completely incomprehensible and only adds to the confusion. The classic ""reveal"" scene at the end of the movie falls completely flat. <br/><br/>Here is a suggestion to all of you movie moguls. Instead of butchering classic versions of movies (Murder on Orient, Magnificent Seven, Poseidon Adventure, Ben-Hur, etc etc.) why don't you take some of the mediocre or above average stories of the past and try to IMPROVE on them. If you feel compelled to remake a classic, at least try to be loyal to the original movie and material. After all, we call them classics for a reason."
"ladyinthemists","1","3","4","12 August 2018"," Very disappointing
","I just watched this new version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" last night and was very disappointed in it. As an avid fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot, I noticed that there were quite a few things things that were not quite right. First, foremost and most noticible was the appearance of Hercule Poirot. The moustache was all wrong and the real Poirot had no chin hair at all. Also, his manerisms were quite a bit off. The story line and some of the characters had been altered. The Kenneth Brannagh version of this movie was not a very good depiction of the original story. I doubt that I will ever watch this version again. I can only hope that the new version of ""Death on the Nile"" will be more true to form. Sorry but there is really only one great Poirot actor.....David Suchet IS Poirot!"

Good drama is replaced with cheesy humour , a few of the jokes aren't terrible, but nonetheless the film is saturated with a humour that belies the the seriousness of the plot, detracting from the story.

It is incredibly cheesy and half of the scenes are just pointless, these scenes include the start with the predictable chief inspector being the thief and the stick which trips him up.

"jtindahouse","9","20","47","8 November 2017"," Great cast, great trailer, great film
","I was completely unfamiliar with the story of 'Murder on the Orient Express' going in. I had of course heard of it, however I had never read it, nor seen any of the previous film adaptions of it. I am very partial to a murder-mystery however, and so I was very excited for it. Adding to that excitement were a tremendous cast (including my main man Johnny Depp himself) and a trailer that blew me away. Now all the film had to do was live up to the hype I had created for it. Did it manage to? You bet it did.<br/><br/>The thing that took me off-guard was that Johnny Depp was not only not the star of the film, he was actually playing one of the least interesting characters in the whole film. What also took me by surprise was how much I enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of the character of 'Hercule Poirot'. He was captivating to watch. He left me undoubtedly wanting more. I would happily welcome a follow-up film (which may or may not have been hinted at in the film).<br/><br/>There's a lot of fun to be had in 'Murder on the Orient Express'. While it is a dialogue heavy film, it is exquisite dialogue. The amount of memorable quotes in this movie are far too plentiful to count. The twist at the end (which I'm assuming is the same as the source material?) was probably my least favourite part of the film, however it did make sense and I get it. Otherwise though this is a very hard film to find flaws in. Definitely a film not to missed."
"audacity10","2","7","13","4 December 2017"," Tedious
","Maybe it was that a stage-play was advertised before the start of the film which depicted a ""lovable"" comedic Karl Marx fighting to get his murderous ideology across that set the tone for this tedious movie. Maybe it was that Murder on the Orient Express was itself typically stuffed to the brim with cultural Marxism that unsettled me during it's 2 hour screen time.<br/><br/>So I was already in a bad mood as we entered the world of Agatha Christie's Poirot, following a Jewish boy finding the detective's breakfast in the streets of Israel. <br/><br/>From there the cast of characters start to introduce themselves in a range of absurd (a dancer using his dancing skills to beat up some photographers) or dull (Penélope Cruz moaning on about religious stuff) encounters as we make our way towards embarking the Orient Express. <br/><br/>The train and the scenery is generally excellent in terms of visuals - and to be fair - the visuals are the only saving grace of the movie. This is where my 2 stars are awarded.<br/><br/>From the moment we're on the train, the topic of racism becomes impossible to overlook, and we're ""treated"" constantly with lectures about miscegenation. Ironically (and is always the case) is that while Willem Dafoe's German alias makes outbursts against black people, it shows that the director, Branagh, is inadvertently racially stereotyping Germans as hating non-whites. <br/><br/>But if we can manage to ignore the constant race-baiting, what's left in this film is tedious dialogue and characters I don't care about. In the end, I don't care about who the murderer is and I don't care if they're caught.<br/><br/>And yet, when the conclusion is drawn that they're all murderers, the result of Poirot letting them go free like he was detective, jury and judge all wrapped up in one was extremely irritating. Who was he to decide whether they should go free?<br/><br/>A very tedious and frustrating movie that I've already averted others from wasting their money on going to see."

Still with no expectations I soldiered on. Roughly an hour in we all announced that it must have been all of them who offed the guy. It took the master defective another hour to figure it out. <br/><br/>I seem to recall Johnny Depp saying around 2016 0r 2017 that those who didn't vote for his preferred candidate for president wouldn't appreciate any of his movies or something in that tone.

How does it disappoint? Let me count the ways. For one thing it's a remake and I've yet to see a remake that equals let alone eclipses the original. For reasons best known to the producers they contrive to attach an opening segment set in Jerusalem that has absolutely no bearing on the main thrust of the plot, and perhaps worse they ignore every chance to feature the Orient Express as what it is, one of the most glamorous and iconic trains in the world, for all the footage it gets as, let's face it, a character in its own right, it might as well be the Hastings Flyer and/or the 9.17 to Leighton Buzzard. The outrageous plot - a motley group of passengers all with reason to despise the victim, contrive against astronomical odds to take the same train as the victim and then place a knife where it will do the most good - is so unbelievable it needs all the help it can get, help with this cast, distinguished as they may be, don't have it in them to give.

"peterm1","1","10","21","13 November 2017"," Off the rails?
","I have to confess not to having seen it yet so make what you will of what follows. I have read extensively about it though (and not just the negative reviews) but I have seen enough to be afraid - very afraid. This is a movie where Hercule Poirot has lost weight but his mustache has gained weight. Who would have thought that this seems to be one of the more interesting things about the film. Look, I acknowledge that it is hard to make a movie when everyone knows the characters, the story and the ending. But when will Hollywood at last wake up and call it done. It does not work to remake films and just stuff them full of ""stars"". You actually have to make it interesting and when dealing with a classic story, this means either being absolutely true to the original or have a new ""take"" on the story that engages people. This movie is a feast of stars but few of then strike me as being particularly suited to their role - as glamorous (and no doubt professional) as they all are. For me an ensemble cast has never been a reason in itself to ante up the cost of a ticket. The other thing that makes me itch with annoyance is when I look as the character list and see characters I never remembered in the original story or any of the past remakes. Characters that seem to be more related to Hollywood's mania for political correctness than fidelity to Agatha Christies' plot. But - they just gotta have a token mix of races just to balance up the list and satisfy 2017 sensibilities. But what does this do to verisimilitude and willingness to honor Agatha's original story? People who love Agatha Christie love the nostalgia inherent in those stories - the feeling of being in the 1920s or 1930s. Update that and you had better have something pretty damn good to replace it - you will lose the Agatha fans and not pick up enough patronage from the general audience who probably don't know the difference between Hercule Poirot and Lady Gaga. Maybe I am doing it a disservice but what I am inclined to say is this - you can't put lipstick on a pig. Though apparently you can put an great big monster mustache on Kenneth Branagh. Still not enough for me I am afraid."

","Is it fair to compare this new version with the much loved 1974 film?<br/><br/>Of course it is. It's almost begging for it.<br/><br/>If you put the two films side by side I would defy anyone to discover a single line of dialog that appears in both films. It seems quite deliberate.<br/><br/>It's not out of the question to remake some of the characters, as they obviously do. After all, it's Agatha Christie, not Shakespeare. I prefer the claustrophobic feeling of the first film with everyone stuck on board the train, but to shoot some scenes outdoors is a fair interpretation. <br/><br/>All filmmakers make alterations. But to do so to this degree shows lack of respect for the source material. Such wild moments as the shooting incident (actually, two shooting incidents) will make Christie fans wince. <br/><br/>Branagh is fine as Hercule Poirot. With a better script his performance would be considered memorable. (I wouldn't dare say ""And with a different director"", for Branagh has directed some fine films.) Most of the performances are serviceable, if not particularly memorable. And the scenery is great, if you think that Agatha Christie and CGI belong together.<br/><br/>The ending is horribly maudlin, as opposed to the delightfully tongue-in-cheek feel of the earlier film.<br/><br/>When I was in college, PBS did a series on all of Shakespeare's plays. I don't recall which play it was, but the day after it aired my English professor asked us ""Did you all watch ""Hey, Shakespeare. Up yours!"" last night?""<br/><br/>This isn't quite on that level.

It felt like there were so many lies it was hard to know which piece of evidence or statement was a fact. And it felt fun!<br/><br/>I saw the first incarnation of this movie about 10 years after its initial release when I was 15. I then read the book. It made both better as I could ""see"" the story that much clearer. Watching this retelling has again spurred my interest into a genre which clearly needs even more additions.<br/><br/>One can only hope that Death on the Nile is around the corner.<br/><br/>Suggestion: make it a date night, see the early viewing, and then go somewhere with background music and have a wonderful chat with someone whose company you deeply enjoy. It's that good."

","World famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) takes a trip on the Orient Express and unexpectedly finds himself having to utilise all of his detective skills when one of the passengers on-board the train namely Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) is murdered shortly before the train is de-railed as the result of an avalanche.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, this is my first cinematic viewing of the famous Agatha Christie story (yes I know I must be some kind of philistine) so I don't have the luxury of being able to draw comparisons between other versions of the story - as I'm sure many of my contemporaries will be able to do. Therefore, my thoughts will remain solely confined to Branagh's offering....<br/><br/>And oh dear what a disappointment I found this to be... The story begins promisingly and offers a gentle playfulness that I hoped would be a running theme throughout the film. However, once Poirot gets on-board the train Branagh seems to change tack and fills the film with many stuffy and bloated exchanges between the cast members which I suppose are there to advance the story, but these exchanges are frequently dull and uninteresting.<br/><br/>What mystery there is here (which to someone like me who knew nothing of the story was a mystery) was unfolded in the most tedious and boring of manners... in fact when the big reveal arrived I was long past caring. Many of the cast looked lost and seemed to wonder what the hell they were doing in this film... Branagh stuffs the film with an impressive cast, but wastes a lot of them by giving them next to nothing to do.<br/><br/>I think what makes this film worse is the fact that it feels a little over-stuffed and self-important - it felt to me like Branagh was more in love with the production of the film than the story and I never once felt engaged in what should have been a fairly involving murder-mystery.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the impressive cast or the allure of what you may assume to be a good murder-mystery film.

Mr. Kenneth Branagh, I really don't know by which way or how to praise a genius that he is and also don't know what exactly do I praise him about, is it his direction of the film and the fact that he director a wonderful looking film with great cinematography or do I praise his acting performance which is THE BEST I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR !

"TwistedMango","5","11","26","4 November 2017"," The intensity of playing 'Clue' with the grandparents
","I came into 'Murder On The Orient Express' having virtually no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. For this film to be successful director and star Kenneth Branagh knew he must branch out to ignoramuses like me, but unfortunately in his attempts to do so he may have ended up underwhelming both Christie diehards and casual observers.<br/><br/>The year is 1934, and after solving a mystery at the Wailing Wall, Hercule Poirot (Branagh), the Belgian detective of international repute, must board the Orient Express on his travels from Jerusalem to London. Tragedy strikes the train the same night as an avalanche, leaving it derailed and with a murder to solve.<br/><br/>At no point was I especially intrigued as to who the killer was, which for a two-hour murder mystery is an issue. Neither is there any real doubt Poirot will solve it, leaving the enjoyment to be had from its character interactions and the how of Poirot's discoveries.<br/><br/>The film has a multitude of stars onboard, each with their part to play in the plot. Unfortunately, there are a few characters too many, which does shrink the screen time for each of them. I've read that Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) is an addition not in the novel, perhaps an unnecessary one. That said, the mix of accents and acting techniques blends well enough, and Branagh is a consistent and affable screen presence.<br/><br/>Branagh is also careful not to define the whole film as Poirot talking to people in compartments, and there are some decent exterior shots and even a chase sequence (though why Poirot ever needed to risk his life strolling along the top of a carriage in a separate scene is never explained).<br/><br/>A stand-out performer is Johnny Depp as the sleazy, grasping crook Ratchett. Miss Debenham (Daisy Ridley) has a few decent scenes with Poirot, but her relationship with Col. Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr.) never holds. The decision to change the race of this character from the novel also leads to groan-inducing sanctimoniousness and reeks more of tokenism than high drama.<br/><br/>Some problems with the film must surely derive from its source material. There can be few premises more contrived than a complicated murder being assembled while the perpetrators are fully aware of the greatest detective in the world sleeping a couple of doors down. If a modern screenwriter had conceived this story they would have been laughed out of Hollywood. Perhaps I'm just being a sourpuss who should have a bit more fun with the whole thing, but the plot convolutions do at points undoubtedly make for an uneven journey.<br/><br/>'Murder On The Orient Express' needed to either embrace the campiness of the whole thing or dive into the darkness of it all. There's Poirot sleeping with his moustache-holder, there's a Lindbergh-esque tale of a baby abducted and murdered. It's 'Miss Marple' meets 'Mindhunter'. The Jerusalem scenes at the beginning especially had a BBC Sunday night, Stephen Moffat, irritatingly chummy feel to them.<br/><br/>The wintery vistas, Branagh's over-acting moustache, the Christie twists and turns, there's plenty to take from 'Murder On The Orient Express'. But if you're going to enjoy this film you must leave your disbelief at the station and just go along for a sedentary ride."
"stancym-1","10","12","29","14 November 2017"," Worthy Remake, Full of Style and Visual Beauty
","I am a big fan of the 1974 version with Albert Finney as Poirot and directed by Sydney Lumet. I read that Sir Kenneth Branagh wanted to do a fresh version with a different take so he deliberately did not view the 1974 film. His Poirot is a bit sweeter and more sentimental than the one written for, and acted by, Finney. However, I find him very convincing! There are touches of humor, especially in the first half of the film. The second half is more serious as Poirot realizes he must solve the crime and has limited time to do so. <br/><br/>The cast was excellent, and the scenery whether real or CGI was beautiful. The opulence and grandeur of this kind of train travel in the 1930s came across vividly. If anything, these characters are a bit more touching, a bit less campy and ""over the top"" than the characters in Lumet's film. That's not a bad thing, it is just a different approach. Even at the end, Poirot displays a little unintentional humor because with his perfectionism, he cannot help himself. <br/><br/>It is a very enjoyable film, and Branagh is a fine actor, always. He makes the film work. That and the sight of alps at sunset!"
"moonspinner55","3","6","12","14 November 2017"," ""A riot of clues dropped most conveniently...yet only one appears, however, to be perhaps genuine!""
","In 1934, Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot, traveling by train from Istanbul to London, finds himself in the middle of a murder case after he discovers one of the passengers dead in his compartment, stabbed 12 times in his bed during the night. With the Orient Express stagnant on a bridge due to an avalanche, Poirot has a great deal of time to interrogate all the passengers on-board to determine motive and expose the killer. Second film-adaptation of Agatha Christie's mystery novel had big shoes to fill left behind by the classy 1974 all-star version, although neither picture is particularly suspenseful or exciting, which is probably the fault of the source material (this tale not being one of Christie's best murder stories). Kenneth Branagh both directed this version and stars as Poirot, and his acting has a bit of the sly lift that his pacing and his arranging of key scenes lack. Branagh's opening, with Poirot in Jerusalem defending three holy men on a charge of theft, falls victim to maladroit staging which typifies the rest: a busy camera (or an even busier editor) chasing after the action instead of relaying it. Scenes are squeezed for whatever Branagh is going for--levity one minute, high drama the next--while always presenting Poirot as the master detective, meticulous and unruffled and never doubting his instincts. The problem with this portrait is: we perceive all of Poirot's fussy characteristics within the first 20 minutes--the rest of time is spent admiring Branagh as he repeats himself. The supporting cast is poorly-handled by the director (including a too-sweet young lad in the prologue); the suspects are colorless both in their conception by screenwriter Michael Green and in the performances by a most underwhelming assemblage of players. There are some nice computer-enhanced shots of the train whistling its way through snowy mountain terrain, and we do get a vivid sense of movement from inside the Orient Express before it becomes snowbound on the tracks. However, the final summation is a fizzle, as is Johnny Depp's waxworks-like performance as a disgruntled American businessman, a thankless role formerly assigned to Richard Widmark. *1/2 from ****"
"hlyztrk","4","6","12","10 November 2017"," Below my expectations
","I went to watch the movie yesterday. It's hard to say that the movie reflects the soul of the stories of Agatha Christie. I didn't feel any mystery nor excitement. When I basically compare it to the TV series (an adaptation of Agatha Christie's stories) which are made by BBC for the New Year & Christmas every year, I must say they are far more better and elaborated than the movie itself. I think the scenario of that one kept as simple and superficial as possible with the confidence of working with well-known actors. The producers and the director thought the actors would attract the people and they didn't pay attention to the story which is necessary and it's resulted in a movie which is tasteless and prosaic."

"sascha-17","6","7","15","10 November 2017"," Runs out of steam halfway in
","*** Some spoilers ahead for the handful of people who are not familiar with Christie's classic murder mystery. ***<br/><br/>As a fan of the book and the Sidney Lumet adaptation, I was curious how Kenneth Branagh's take on Agatha Christie's famous story would play out. On paper, all the ingredients for a decent (or even great), modern day adaptation are there: A star-studded cast, beautiful production-design and costumes and a seasoned director with deep roots in both stage- and film-work. And for about half of the film's running time, all that seems to hold the piece together pretty well. There's a sense of ""class"" about the flick: Grand vistas, beautiful art-deco environments, exotic locations and a general flair of slower, more elegant era (not so) long gone-by. I can even live with the director's odd choice of playing the lead-role himself. Branagh sure wouldn't be my first pick for Poirot and he does have a slightly different take on the famous Belgian super-sleuth. This Poirot seems more brooding and ""conflicted"" than any other version I've seen before - but I'm not sure this change adds anything to either the character or to this particular story. On the other hand, we do get satisfyingly quirky moments showcasing Poirot's little eccentricities. His obsession with orderliness, cleanliness and his quick and witty sense of humor.<br/><br/>As expected with this sort of group, the rest of the cast are more than up to the task as well - if they are allowed to occupy the screen, that is. Sadly, a lot of characters are criminally underused. We hardly get to know some players who are vital to the plot and who held much more prominent roles in Sidney Lumet's version. For example: One of the main suspects and an important character overall has so few lines that he almost seems superfluous in Branagh's adaptation. And I think we have the director to blame here, who seems to be infatuated with his own face. Instead of spending more time with the rest of the ensemble, he gives us one long close-up of himself after the other - a decision whose negative impact on the film is exacerbated by a seemingly trivial item - Poirot's facial hair. At some point while making the film, someone must have thought that having ""the greatest mustache in London"" means that Poirot goes through life looking like a walrus. It wouldn't have been a huge deal, if Branagh hadn't insisted to stick this hairy monstrosity in our faces again and again. By the fourth long close-up with the monster-stache center-stage, the audience in my theater were beginning to chuckle. <br/><br/>But I digress ... It's when the titular murder occurs that the movie really fell apart for me. And it's mostly down to unforced errors committed by the script. For example: In a lot of places, this film is closer to Christie's novel than the Lumet-version of the 70s. Little details that Lumet left out are included here - like the fictional Mr Harris whose berth Poirot occupies on the first night on the train. But in other places, the script veers off and tries to trick us into thinking it was headed towards a different conclusion than the source-material. Which, if you know the story and the ending, feels more like an attempt at trickery than actual creativity, because (Spoiler!) ... the movie ultimately does not have the guts to re-write Christie's solution.<br/><br/>And then there's the matter of leaving out crucial details which rob the ending of its original tone. A major point in the original was the fact that the victim had been found guilty and more or less convicted of murder already, but then had to be released due to a technicality. Making his death on the train less of an act of revenge or vigilantism and more like an act of citizens trying to ensure that justice is being served. Branagh's version leaves out this crucial detail about the trial and thus makes the group of murderers seem more like an angry lynch mob ... which in turn makes Poirot's decision to let them go feel out of character for him. In the original, we could comprehend why Poirot (albeit with much inner conflict) decided to let them get away with murder. In this version, we get a hysteric Michelle Pfeiffer and lots of close ups of Poirot staring into space while the music swells in the background. Ultimately, we're left to wonder why this stickler for justice and righteousness would let this particular murder go unpunished. <br/><br/>I also take some exception to the somewhat lame attempts at ""diverse casting"". I have no objections to transforming white characters into ones of color - but those changes should make sense within the story and within the period that's being portrayed. In this particular case for example, it would've made much more sense to re-write the character in question as either an Indian or Middle Eastern man. But going with a black guy, the story has to perform some serious mental gymnastics in order to explain his presence in the story. <br/><br/>I do wonder however, whether someone who goes into this film without any knowledge of the original story will share my concerns and might actually enjoy the film more than I did. If you look past the puzzling decisions made by the screenwriter, there's much to be admired here. Sadly though, I couldn't help but notice the needless changes they chose to make and thus this film, for me, wasn't better than slightly above average.<br/><br/>6/10"
"themovieparadise","7","11","27","15 November 2017"," Better Than I Thought It Would Be
","I was pleasantly surprised by Kenneth Branagh's performance. When he first appeared on screen, I thought that he would quickly become tedious and annoying. However, as time went on, I found myself really getting into his character. Branagh plays him with such ridiculous eccentricity that he actually became rather charming and relatable. Now, it's not an Oscar worthy performance by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think it does say something about his ability as an actor to take these idiosyncrasies that normally would have annoyed me and in turn make them charming, as well as fulfilling his other duties as the director. The film is also very well shot. I was surprised by how much I was getting into the cinematography. Branagh works with long-time collaborator Haris Zambarloukos in order to make perfect use of the cramped quarters of the train. Whether its panning shots outside of the train looking in, or overhead shots looking down on the actors, Zambarloukos makes very distinct and interesting choices that allow for Murder on the Orient Express to come to life in a rather unique way, one that I wasn't expecting from the looks of the trailers."

We hear that the train is full and that Poirot will have to share a cabin for at least one night. As we discover that there are just 12 passengers on the whole train I wondered what happened to all the other empty berths on the other carriages. Let's just pass over that one. I really enjoy a film that keeps you guessing and gives you a few unexpected twists. The orient certainly delivers that. All the acting was very much splendid. A group of excellent actors together with a fine plot and diffuse suspense has made it a good enjoyable movie. The production is indeed rich and elegant in its production design, and cinematography. The costumes however are fine, but lack a certain panache and glamour we have grown to admire in past Agatha Christie films, such as those designed by Tony Walton, and Anthony Powell.

","This particular murder of the Orient Express is almost the perfect snapshot of everything wrong with the bewildered and ailing dream factory of Hollywood in the 21st century: remaking things that don't need remaking, adding presently fashionable political causes - as well as lashings and lashings of CGI - and removing all the qualities which made the originals so beloved in the first place, such as a plausible and well told story, peopled with characters one feels a connection to and can remember 5 minutes after it's over. <br/><br/>Like the Guy Ritchie travesty of Sherlock, Stock & Two Smoking Holmes, Kenneth Brannagh has crowbarred into this genteel whodunnit a glut of fistfights, love interests (for Poirot!), and Hobbit-looking computer-generated backdrops that end up making every outdoor scene look like a video game. Racial themes and dialogue addressing said racial themes are pulled out of the air and clumsily forced into the story where they never have felt the need to appear before in 80 years of dramatizations, and in ways that only hold up or detract from the original tale, taking up time that could have been used to elucidate various plot points (such as the explanation for the number of knife wounds in the murder) which would have strengthened the internal logic of the movie and the emotional weight.<br/><br/>Brannagh, too, is unmemorable in everything but his mustache in his performance as Poirot, and is physically entirely wrong for the part. His Poirot doesn't actually get to bust out his wing chung moves, or pop a cap in anybody's derrière, but it's not far off. <br/><br/>STOP ""REBOOTING"" THINGS THAT WERE PERFECTLY FINE THE FIRST TIME ROUND! The magic of cinema is in its immortalizing of fleeting moments of beauty and greatness for all time - Casablanca is right there on the shelf for you to experience any time you want to: it doesn't need turning into an Adam Sandler musical set in space.<br/><br/>But if you're GOING to carry on regardless, then try be faithful to the narrative you are telling, concentrate first and foremost on a flawless story, and on getting unforgettable moments and performances out of your cast and crew up there on the screen for eternity. This film contains not even one, and all the problems I've listed above will look worse and worse and worse to every successive generation that watches this from here on, until it falls into deserved obscurity and is forgotten completely 30 years from now.<br/><br/>It's a handsomely designed movie, doing its sweaty-faced best to make the sleeping car-bound mystery as big and cinematic as possible, and I applaud Kenneth Brannagh for trying, but I could tell even from the film poster this was going to be a travesty, and it was."
"latinfineart","2","5","10","28 November 2017"," A truly horrific piece of film making
","This absolute turkey of a film, was barely entertaining. I wanted to walk out several times, and only the presence of a few tolerant, long suffering, and bored friends kept me from doing so.<br/><br/>The entire cast was wrong. Branagh was an insufferable detective. Dench was a dreadful princess. Cruz was entirely miscast, as some sort of anti fascist. Johnny Depp was barely there, though he did remind me a bit of a kind of impotent Dillinger. This film was truly awful.<br/><br/>As is suggested by the title, one of the first class passengers is brutally murdered. Poirot, hoping for some rest and relaxation, is pressed into service. One of these supposedly respectable passengers is actually a murderer, etc. Thus begins a mystery that is at turns plodding, irrelevant and completely suspense-free. If you remember the famous third act twist it doesn't even really matter; by that point in the movie the narrative has become such a limp pretzel of halfhearted knots that the big revelation comes off as a whimper and not a bang. This is less a whodunit than a who-the-hell-cares.<br/><br/>Branagh was more interested in the Shakespearean drama than dazzling visual effects.<br/><br/>With ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" he has created a contraption that is wholly devoid of cleverness; a thriller without any actual thrills. He seems chiefly concerned with technically virtuoso camera movements that mean incredibly little both in terms of narrative or character, as well as how to showcase himself (as an actor) completely in any given scene. Seriously, Kenneth Branagh shoots Kenneth Branagh like Steven Soderbergh shot Julia Roberts in the first ""Ocean's Eleven"" – lovingly, with every moment suggesting this is what a movie star looks like.<br/><br/>Sadly, for all of his pomp and forced eccentricity (his walrus-like mustache, his Belgian accent, his protruding belly), Branagh's over sized Poirot can't enliven the movie very much. The same goes for the cast of characters, some of whom have been excellent in other, far better movies this year (""The Florida Project,"" ""Victoria & Abdul,"" ""mother!""). Some, like Daisy Ridley, have the look on their faces like they signed up for something that ended up being altogether different. And no matter how great you are as an actor, it's hard to stay away from the story's inherent stagings, especially in the third act, when Branagh assembles his cast like the participants of the Last Supper. It doesn't feel like a dramatic centerpiece, it feels like a promotional photo shoot. And that's a problem for a movie that should, had it succeeded, built tiny, laser-focused vignettes of suspense out of exchanges of dialogue, camera movements that tracked up and down the train and casual interactions between passengers.<br/><br/>Instead, Branagh presents something like an attractively wrapped present with nothing inside. Ostensibly, it's a well-made movie, with first class production and costume design and some very talented visual effects artists working on very unconvincing visual effects. Even composer Patrick Doyle, one of Branagh's key collaborators, delivers a score that is, like the rest of the movie, both overbearing and tension-free.<br/><br/>Overlong and joyless, it's the cinematic equivalent of a giant, opulent express train trapped in the snow, heaving and off balance."

As a director, Kenneth Brannagh has some visual ideas (a shot near the end deliberately recalls The Last Supper) and orchestrates some impressively fluid camera movements, but he botches the most iconic sequence of the original (the ritualistic re-construction of the crime), and he adds unnecessary ""modernisms"" (Poirot in physical action). As Poirot, he is rather unconvincing, but you get used to him; none of the other cast members stand out the way, for example, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller stood out in the original (Daisy Ridley comes closest).

The film is set in the 1930s and the script is superb for the era coupled with wonderful acting from an all-star cast. Though this film didn't invoke any feelings for me, I was highly entertained and thoroughly intrigued. The film reminded me of the board game Clue, which I loved as a child.<br/><br/> The surprise ending offered by the director, Kenneth Branagh, was well concealed through the film. He effectively keeps the viewer on the verge of figuring it out only to pull the rug out from under you. The production value of this film is immaculate. It is difficult to spot anything in this film that doesn't belong in the 1930s and everything looks authentic. However, with a budget of an estimated 55M, it would be hard pressed to not appear as real as possible. With a gross of over 100M, the film was well able to make its investment back, but it comes as a surprise it hasn't made more.

"mealine","5","3","5","12 August 2018"," Why Kenneth?
","I love Kenneth Branagh as an actor and director. His take on ""Thor"" was Shakespearean and he made it work. His take on ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was a hot mess.
He had a stellar cast, a wonderful and well-known story, and he got in his own way.
I know it is hard to remake a classic murder-mystery and give it a fresh take, but this was a serious fail. I hated the way Kenneth portrayed Poirot. 
I admit that when I read the book years ago, I figured out who the murderer was, but even so, I enjoyed the way the 1974 version strung the viewers along until the big reveal.
In this version, the clues and solution pop up like memes or hashtags on social media. 
I am sorry I watched this and even more sorry to learn that Branagh plans to give ""Death on the Nile"" a go. If it's anything like his ""Orient Express,"" I'll be rooting for Poirot to drown."

","Beginning scene with the wall was pointless. then begins to look promising with an uplifting feel, however this was short lived. Was not impressed with the performance of Kenneth Branagh as Poirot I understand he might of decided to make the character his own & show a different kind of Poirot but it did not work for me. There just wasn't any chemistry, Even though I know the story and always enjoy watching the 70's version & the TV adaptation, but with this I was bored, I found myself checking how long was left as I just wanted it to be over. <br/><br/>It looks fantastic, they already had the story & had a great cast (unfortunately with the exception of Branagh casting himself) 
so how could it possibly fail but it really does! 
I only watched it to the end because I felt I needed to see it through in the vain hope it got better & because I enjoyed some of the other performances but as a whole it was utterly disappointing. I am glad I did not buy the dvd as I won't be watching it again. <br/><br/>If you've never seen the originals and are new to the story you might love it. 
If you are familiar with the story & don't have anything better to do then this is worth seeing once, but I suggest with the sound off to simply enjoy the splender of the set."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","5","2 December 2017"," An okay movie if you aren't looking for great depth or significance
","""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a new American 110-minute film from this year (2017) that is directed by Oscar nominee Kenneth Branagh who also plays the main character Hercule Poirot and the entire thing is based on an Agatha Christie novel. This one has seen many versions already, but I personally am not biased here because I have seen neither and I also haven't read the book. The script is by Emmy nominee Michael Green and seeing how much I loved his work on the recent Logan, I must say I am a bit disappointed here. With this cast, a lot more was possible. We have Oscar winners Cruz and Dench, Golden Globe winners Depp and Pfeiffer, rising stars Ridley and Gad and a couple other familiar faces like Dafoe, a personal favorite. The ending suggests a sequel, so it seems Branagh may not yet be done, but is the success here really enough for another? We will see. I am not disappointed by Branagh, but I am also not too impressed by his turn as Poirot. Then again, he is just an observer for the most part as except before the murder, the film is far more about the other passengers than about him.<br/><br/>I liked that, despite the beard, they were not going for a fun or comedy film (there are only very few somewhat funny moments), but for a dark gritty movie that involves more murder than the one happening on the train. Sadly, the investigation itself was hardly convincing. The ways in which finally every passenger has a dark secret and a motive were certainly unrealistic, even if the eventual solution at least explains it a bit. I am not too much of a fan of that one either that basically everybody did it. The (unloaded) gun scene towards the end was as underwhelming and out of place as his final decision to let them all go. But that's just personal preference I guess. The last 40 minutes or so were still very much on the disappointing side for me and also meant that this is definitely not among the best the year has to offer from the crime genre. The film's biggest pro is the visual side. The costumes and sets inside the train as well as the cinematography and surroundings outside were really just as good as it gets, so I would not be too surprised if the film gets in once or twice at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an okay watch that had many weaknesses though that move the movie closer to forgettable terrain than very good terrain. A bit of a shame as this could/should have been much better. Then again, some flaws may already be inside the original literary work I guess like the (to me) unsatisfying ending. It was still good enough to be somewhat curious about a possible sequel in Egypt and I'd probably watch it if they really make it. However, I am certainly not too enthusiastic about it. Back to this one here: The one area where the film makes no impact or references at all is the time component, nothing about politics or society from the indeed interesting time when the film is set. As a whole, this is a decent whodunit film that may have you guessing for the most part who the killer is and if you pay close attention to the exact way in which Depp's character was killed and the number of stabbing wounds, then maybe you have the right idea early on already, even if you perhaps (like myself) will lose the idea pretty quickly thinking it's too absurd. Sadly, it is not. A cautious thumbs-up from me. Go see it, but keep your expectations down."
"gene_of_aquitaine","Null","3","5","20 November 2017"," Muddle on the Orient Express
","First off, I must confess my love of the 1974 Sidney Lumet version as one of my favorite of all times film, but was excited at hearing of the remake and with a wide open mind anxiously awaited the release.<br/><br/>Famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express unexpectedly, and when the train is caught snowbound and murder is discovered, he is engaged by the train manager who is his friend to solve the crime before the local authorities come to rescue and perhaps botch the investigation. <br/><br/>I did not like this film. The look of the film is very good, Production Designer Jim Clay and Set Decorator Rebecca Alleway give good train and Costume Designer, the great Alexandra Byrne outfits the cast beautifully (though I do question Mrs. Hubbard's après ski pants, such a woman would don her fur coat if she was chilly). The problem here is a very weak script that for starters does not delve deep enough into the interrogation of the suspects for us to follow Poirot's deductions. A fine cast of actors are given very little to do while the sleuth/hero/director gets a lot of screen time taking away from furthering the plot. We also have, perhaps in an attempt to draw younger audiences, more focus on Star Wars' Daisy Ridley (Miss Debenham), Hamilton's Leslie Odom Jr (Dr. Arbuthnot) and Frozen's Josh Gad (McQueen) characters, leaving acting royalty Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacoby and Willem Dafoe out in the snow bound cold. We are also given a pair silly action sequences, one a very public fight by a passenger seeking privacy but drawing the attention of a crowd, the other a brawl actually involving Poirot. Again possibly for the younger DC/Marvel audience but Hercule Poirot is not a superhero and does not engage in knock-down, drag-out fights. Opening up some scenes to outside the train removes the claustrophobic tenseness of the proceedings. But the biggest error here is the complete bypass of the concept of the 12 suspects and the allegory of this self-appointed jury to judge a past crime. The central theme of the novel and story is of justice and the combined group action to correct an error in legal justice and all of this is discarded in the reveal. Also the lack of discussion explaining the household of the original crime seems to remove the underlying theme of family or unity in the story. Overall the film is pretty to see, though some of the sweeping vistas could have been removed for plot development, but I suppose that would have not utilized the 70mm experience. Branagh may be a bit too handsome for the odd, little Poirot character and the adding of racial themes with Dr. Arbuthnot adds something new, but changing him from the Colonel to the doctor, who in the source material helps with the investigation seems odd. Save the cash, watch the lush and lavish 1974 version and wait for this one for free TV."

I really cannot say enough good things about this movie! The actors were believable and charming. The shooting was interesting and clever.

"Keatonics","10","10","26","24 November 2017"," We may be seeing Branaugh's masterpiece-will anyone take notice?
","I have always been a Kenneth Branaugh fan, and in this film he goes beyond anything he has ever put on the screen. I have to wonder, though, why his best work is done as a murder mystery? Nevertheless, it is a true masterpiece. Almost like watching Da Vinci, Picasso, and van Gogh all paint on the same canvass at the same time. Just like any artist, Branaugh paints his film onto the screen, taking the time to make sure every stroke is just right, the colors are true, and the scapes brilliant and alive.<br/><br/>The cinematography is exquisite. From the ever moving camera shooting exteriors from high above, to way below, from rotating around the moving train to fluidly moving and circulating among and around the characters in the cramped space of the train's interior. The magnificent long shots of the train traveling great distances in the dark and snow, to the extreme closeups showing every pour and flaw in the actors' skin (including and especially in the extreme self-aware closeups of Branaugh, himself). The camera sets the tone.<br/><br/>The production design is glorious. The cramped reality of the train's finely finished carved wood interior; the uncomfortable dress and style of the period; the dual images of characters as the camera passes behind the beautifully framed leaded cut glass windows, the dirty and greasy exterior of the train, and the rickety wood trestles it travels over. Even the period Godiva chocolate (can you say ""product placement?"") was convincing. It is the production design that adds the stark reality of the period, both of its beauty and its ugliness.<br/><br/>The script is so strong and characters are so well cast and well developed that Branaugh really did not need the cinematography, production design, costumes, and makeup to carry the film. He could have directed them on a bare stage and still had a great film. The strength of the story and acting added the depth of light and shadow that only a master artist is able to achieve. The actors were directed with the awareness that only an actor's director can bring to the story. The brushstrokes of a master artist.<br/><br/>In fairness, I will also say that sometimes Branaugh's greatest strength is his greatest weakness. The constantly moving camera gave the film a self-awareness that is actually distracting at times. Most directors are not even aware that the camera can be another character in the film, while others just try to avoid camera movement. Banaugh clearly made it an integral part of the film. I had to work hard to look past that, but once I lost the awareness I was fine.<br/><br/>It is a very beautiful film. And it is just a murder mystery. Why was his greatest film to date a murder mystery? That goes to the heart of why the film will probably not win any awards and will get very little recognition.<br/><br/>It was just a murder mystery. And I can't wait to see the sequel."
"PipAndSqueak","4","10","26","4 November 2017"," A no tension crime snoozer
","Branagh has re-imagined our favourite five foot four dark haired dandy detective as a faults finding Teutonic styled giant. We therefore set off on the wrong foot. Poirot's mental tussling with the truth of the story, as it is later explained in full, is therefore lost. Poirot is wedded to the truth, wedded to the expression of himself in his punctilious attention to his personal appearance...up turned moustache and dark hair and all. He must tell a lie or have himself done in if someone in the murdering cabal of train travellers is to see justice done. It's nice to see a full set of famous actors in all the character roles....it gives just a hint that we should take them seriously...as might the operators of the Orient Express and their wealthiest patrons. However, this is not enough to compensate for the already compromised story which thus has to limp on ....and on...and on..through a weather induced derailment and the exposure of the murdering mastermind. It's too easy to fall asleep because there is no tension to keep your interest. I was thankful when this came to an abrupt and unsatisfactory end as I really had better things to do elsewhere."
"mt-95256","6","8","20","5 November 2017"," A solid whodunit thriller, but a mixed bag. Despite a few missed opportunities, Branagh leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances
","It's strange to think that over the last 10 years or so we've had two popular incarnations of world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes, but no real big incarnation of Christie's wonderful Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Although the David Suchet series only ended in 2013, these episodes never reached the heights of popularity like we saw with Benedict Cumberbatch's or Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock. So it's about damn time something was done about it – so thank you Kenneth Branagh! Adapted from one of Christie's most famous novels, this version of Murder on the Orient Express brings with it a very impressive cast for Branagh's Poirot to interrogate his way through and find the murderer. We've seen Branagh take on Shakespeare and even Marvel so how does he fare with a bit of Christie? Well, fortunately the excellent and varied cast keep the film consistently engaging, captivating us as only these fine actors can do; but a lack of consistent style and slightly messy reveals overshadow what could have been quite an exceptional whodunit.<br/><br/>As far as the actual story itself goes, it really is exceptional; it's difficult to fault Christie and her intricate plots and director Branagh and writer Michael Green really do put across the story well. Yet the way the story's told doesn't quite seem to do the book justice. We've seen from BBC's Sherlock that when filmed well investigations can be delightfully exciting and lavishly filmed in a really stylish manner, flashbacks and effects utilised in a way to make each revelation and finding of a clue thrilling. Here however, clues are often underwhelming and almost forgettable, their importance not necessarily highlighted leaving it a little cluttered and making us feel slightly lost at times. All this culminates in a slightly underwhelming finale where we're still trying to play catch up with Poirot and navigate the maze of clues and motivations.<br/><br/>Still, despite this, detecting and investigating the murder with Poirot can still at times be fun, feeling like we're part of the action. This is best done right at the beginning during a sort of mini-case, similar to small action scenes at the beginning of James Bond films; this scene in particular is done very well. A lot of this is down to the quips and jokes that come from Poirot, really making his character and adding a personality to the film. Sadly this doesn't last for the entirety, actually starting to stop around the time of the murder. This is a shame since the film loses an element of its personality when the laughs stop. Still, when they're there, they really do help for us to fall in love with Poirot.<br/><br/>Most of that though is down to Kenneth Branagh, whose performance is excellent. If you think David Suchet is the only one who could play Poirot, this film will convince you otherwise. With an understandable and mercilessly non-annoying French/ Belgian accent, Branagh's incarnation is absolutely likable and played to perfection; you can't have too much of him and that wondrous moustache. The only issue though is perhaps there's too much Poirot; if you weren't already aware of the rest of the cast, you'd be forgiven for thinking they were all unknowns instead of A-list actors. This is definitely a Branagh film, with everyone else in supporting roles but then again, when he's as great as he is, it's really hard to care.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean to say that the rest of the cast are just throwaway celebrity cameos. On the contrary, where the middle section is less detecting and more a series of interrogations, it could easily edge on being dull and monotonous. However this is saved by sharp dialogue and, more than this, the excellent cast. It's a shame they don't interact together more; we usually see them with Poirot as opposed to each other. Still the cast is eclectic and all-starred – quite simply an absolute joy to behold. They make every scene polished and fun to watch, each delivering stand-out performances with unique characters with different sides, never letting us know who we should trust.<br/><br/>Then again, that's what you expect from a whodunit – a tense atmosphere where you can't trust anyone. Sadly there's rarely a particularly tense scene, something that feels particularly lacking. Considering they're trapped in a train because of an avalanche, snow surrounding and isolating them, the barren outside a deathly cold mountain, you'd have thought this would be an excellent way of heightening the claustrophobia and sinister atmosphere. Instead, although the scenery is beautifully filmed, it looks more like a Christmas card than a deadly setting for a murder investigation.<br/><br/>On the whole a solid whodunit thriller, but a bit of a mixed bag. While the style, atmosphere and slow unveiling of the mystery isn't as strong or fun as it could be, Kenneth Branagh and his inimitable Poirot moustache leads a phenomenal all-star cast with some excellent performances. With a sequel set up in the end scene, I think you can rest assured that before too long Poirot will be on the case again."

","I read the book in anticipation for this film, and while I never saw it in theaters (choosing instead to see Justice League the week after, which was still very much worth it), I finally saw it thanks to Redbox. It is a great film, buoyed by Kenneth Branagh's direction and amazing performance as Hercule Poirot, as well as the performances of the supporting cast (especially Michelle Pfeiffer, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, and Johnny Depp), the score by Patrick Doyle, visuals, and complex plot.

They all look extremely bored and uncomfortable. And the ""acting"" spands from looking as bored as the audience to acting way too theatrical ilike they're in a bad play. <br/><br/>I hate Kenneth Brannagh. I hate the way this movie is filmed, like its a play on a stage and not a movie. I hate how fake it looks, everytime theyre ""outside"" the train, clearly filmed in front of a bluescreen, no visible breath and lighting that dont match the background. <br/><br/>This movie is incredibly boring and as about as much fun as watching paint dry. <br/><br/>And the awful, constipated, old looking Johnny Depp, really needs to retire. The last time I saw him act well, was in Donnie Brasco, a 21 year old movie. I'm as sick of him as I am of Brad Pitt.

"everlyerin","1","4","8","13 February 2018"," Has Kenneth Branagh ran out of ideas?
","Seen this joke of a movie, I will not call it a ""Murder on the Orient Express"" remake. It does not deserve to be labeled as such. For all of those who are true Agatha Christie avid readers, fans of the beloved Hercule Poirot, it is quite clear how forced, disappointing and failed Kenneth Branagh is in his poor interpretation of this great character, even mixing a little bit of ""Mr. Monk"" in his desperate attempt at one of the most complex and mysterious Agatha Christie characters, Hercule Poirot. And why, Mon Dieu, why that hideous, absurd, horrendous mustachio?! I can't call it a ""moustache""... I'm sure it was supposed to exhibit the character's eccentricity, but for me, it kind of turned into poor taste, and Hercule Poirot could not ever show poor taste or present such a ridiculous facial asset. It would be the death of Poirot. 
In my opinion, the most memorable and the most accomplished ""Hercule Poirot"" will forever be David Suchet. This man, was, is and will be Hercule Poirot, he walked like Hercule Poirot, he used his ""little grey cells"" like Hercule Poirot should, his moustache was truly the Hercule Poirot Moustache, all of his mannerisms and little quirks were beautifully alive is David Suchet's master interpretation. Anything else will not even come close, so why would a director or actor try to top that? Has Hollywood become so devoid of original film ideas, or great scenarios? 
I guess it did.<br/><br/>Won't even bother to discuss about the other actors interpretations, it's useless and sad."

","Fill a train with a most impressive cast line up, throw in a grisly murder mystery and have the mighty impressive Kenneth Branagh go on a quest to find out who done it and you got yourself a delightful little movie which will most certainly entertrain.<br/><br/>A take on Agatha Christie's popular novel Murder on the Orient Express, the story follows that of detective Hercule Poirot, who is called on business to London, and so takes the last available room on the Orient Express. Though wanting nothing more than to relax and enjoy his journey, he inadvertently finds himself working, when one of the passengers is mysteriously killed. <br/><br/>It's a wonderful simple story which sees detective Poirot go from guest to guest questioning them on their whereabouts on that fateful night. The opening scene did worry me somewhat with it's overly smart-arsed series of events, akin to that of a last few SHERLOCK TV episodes. It risked going off the rails and being too clever, well beyond believable, but thankfully for the main mystery it calms itself down.<br/><br/>The 1h 54minruntime steams by as I sat and enjoyed first class performances from all the cast. Stand out characters were Daisy Ridley's Miss Mary Debenham, Josh Gad's Hector MacQueen, Leslie Odom Jr.'s Dr. Arbuthnot and of course the brilliant Kenneth Branagh as the brilliantly quirky and intelligent Hercule Poirot. Only Michelle Pfeiffer's performance lacked somewhat and took away from what could have been a much more emotional scene towards the end.<br/><br/>For a story that takes place almost entirely on a train, the director uses the limited space well, for as this narrative unfolds, it doesn't feel too claustrophobic, even in the narrow hallways and the tight compact cabins. Shifting the camera into creative perspectives at times helps keep the scenes fresh and visually stimulating (I especially enjoyed the birds eye view of the murder scene). The pacing is snappy and energetic and at no point feels like its running out of steam. Kenneth Branagh should also be commended for the way he juggles a story consisting of such a myriad of actors, by giving each character their own perspectives and motives, helps to keep the viewer on their toes; questioning every nuance and detail and while some are barely given any screen time, most feel substantially explored. <br/><br/>Overall Murder on the Orient Express conducts itself well, an interesting ""who done it?"" mystery that will keep you guessing throughout. Wonderfully paced and fantastically performed. After something a bit different from your usual sci-fi/superhero adventure then this is just the ticket! <br/><br/>You can find more reviews like this over on my website: www.popcornography.co.uk"

","This big-budget adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1934 detective classic has all the elements to suggest a winner: It's got Kenneth Branagh, doing double-duty as director and leading star (as Christie's legendary sleuth Hercules Poirot), a terrific cast of A-listers, and an extraordinarily effective source novel. However, the finished product never seems to come alive: In this version, the mystery is uninteresting, the cast is mostly underutilized, and the tone seems to veer from scene to scene, while the climax is interminable. It's hard to identify precisely which element impacts the narrative the most but nothing feels quite right, and, despite its pedigree, the finished product is a dull, lifeless affair."

","I am reviewing this without comparing it with the previous versions of it. Cause that will make this film a total trash and a total waste of time.<br/><br/>The film started as good and while the film continues, the film gets boring and boring. Plus the bad CGI, a non-sense chase scene, and some of the actors are not helpful at all they are like narrating the lines. Also what's wrong with the Ballet Dancer's Attitude and personality? Maybe cause he got only a few scenes and lines JK. The only thing I like in this movie is the Camera, Kenneth Brannagh and Johnny Depp's act."
"adrongardner","4","2","3","14 October 2018"," No gray little cells were used in the making of this story
","Kenneth Branagh somehow got away with murder here because as both star and director, he drains the life from the vibrant Belgian Hercule Poirot and an infamous case that can't seem to have enough remakes. This one is enough. <br/><br/>I have no idea what Branagh was thinking. The movie is poorly made, full of ridiculously phony CGI backgrounds, terrible acting - this cannot be understood - and an ever-present blanket of boredom. No tension, no intrigue and no depth to character. If you want to watch this instead of properly read the original story, there are no less than four or five choices ranging from superb to passable. This is one to pass, to forget and ultimately to avoid at all costs. <br/><br/>David Suchet and Branagh were both Shakespearian trained and I always thought Branagh got a free pass in most of the Shakespeare productions he gained notoriety for. Suchet, in contrast, has always disappeared into his parts unlike Branagh who seems to only talk louder and only worked to amplified himself. This movie proves that point. Branagh plays Poirot, indeed the whole thing for a joke - and that is a great disservice to rich material such as this."

The seating of all of the ""suspects"" under the arch of the train tunnel was the most preposterous of all. I could go on, but the bottom line is that this was a silly, stagey remake that lacked credibility."

","Famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is travelling on the Orient Express when a murder is committed. The victim was a particularly obnoxious man with a criminal past. As clues are revealed it is apparent that many of the other passengers on the train had a motive to kill him, making Poirot's task of identifying the murderer much more difficult.<br/><br/>Dull and unnecessary. The 1974 version of Murder On the Orient Express, directed by Sidney Lumet, was superb. A great mixture of intrigue, atmosphere and 1930s quaintness combined with great performances from an all-star cast (Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Jacqueline Bisset, Martin Balsam, John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark and Michael York). Finney was perfect as Poirot.<br/><br/>In this version, director Kenneth Branagh somehow manages to make an Agatha Christie mystery dull. It just feels like a straightforward, paint-by-numbers adaptation of the book. Intrigue is minimal, and is often replaced by action (presumably to appeal to modern audiences). Maybe it is because I already knew the solution to the mystery, but the whole thing felt so flat.<br/><br/>Once again we have an all-star cast - Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, Willem Dafoe - yet this time the performances feel subdued and uninspired. Branagh, for all his acting talent, is clearly not in the same league as the legendary Poirot performers - Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov and David Suchet. Even his Belgian accent seems fake! (And don't get me started on the facial hair!). Some of the oddities he imbues Poirot with are quite unnecessary and feel like quirkiness for quirkiness sake.<br/><br/>Unnecessary, just like this movie. Watch the 1974 version instead."

In an enormous betrayal of the character, he eats from the plate of someone he despises. In a further effort to impose 21st century sensibilities on an early 20th century world, we are shown women adept at physical defense, an upper class anglo african physician, aging beauties who speak to strangers of ""women's needs"" and, in a completely gratuitous scene, outspoken embrace of what at the time would have been considered ""miscegenation"".

","Murder On Oriental Express is a film directed by Kenneth Brangan about a famous detective, Hercule Poirot, played by the director himself. He was on-board of a train called Oriental Express. However during the trip there was a murder happening and the killer is being limited to passengers in just one cabinet. Being the best detective in the world, Poriot must try to solve the crime before the police took the matter on their own hands. Right off the back I can tell you that this is Kenneth Brangan's best film to date. His film to be are mostly very classical and Shakespearian, he made mostly Shakespeare film. I enjoyed his interpretation of Thor 1, it has flaws but I enjoyed it. Cinderella is an eye candy film but didn't last a long impression. Jack Ryan shadow recruit is a massive disappointment that derailed the Tom Clancy franchise. I really loved this film and to set the record straight I didn't see the 1970s version or read the book so I came to see the film with blank state. I think this is a very masterfully made film. The biggest strength is its cinematography, the only film this year that came close to rival with Blade Runner 2049 in this category. I highly recommend seeing it on a big screen because it is absolutely gorgeous. There were many long takes and it took its time to use the camera to tell a story, reminds of some old films like Casablanca. This also compliments the acting, which are superb. Everyone did an amazing job. There were many close-up shots and it is, again, one of those films where images tell a thousand words. Some may not like it but I loved. Speaking about acting, the stand out is definitely Poirot. The way I see it, this film is taking from his perspective rather than your normal crime drama. From the start of the film, you can see he is an overconfident detective who is obsessed with precision and logic. But as the film goes on and he is discovering the depth and the cause of the crime as the audience we can see that crime is eating him up and inside and by the end of the film he is completely changed by this experience. The supporting actors aren't there just as show piece, their emotional turmoil pushed the story along. To name every single one actors showed up would take a while. There were no particular stand outs but some of the more memorable ones are Daisy Reily, Josh Gash, Michelle Piher and William Defoe. The writing was very good and there were a great deal of humor too. O, let's not forget about the absolutely amazing score from Patrick Doyle. I loved this movie so much that I decided to wait for 24 hours before I post my review just to clear my head a bit and I have to say I still love it. To me, this is the most surprising movie and certainly the most underrated one. As for flaws, the beginning felt a bit rushed because they have to introduce all the characters also there were few moments where I felt I was watching a detective Conan live action movie when Poirot was rumbling. And I do know that some people may not enjoy as much as I do because the film is made very old fashioned and it is not your average crime drama. But for me I had a great time and I can't wait to see it again. 9/10"
"davispittman","7","8","21","13 November 2017"," Pretty good remake of an Agatha Christie classic
","This is an updated version of the 1970s film version of the Agatha Christie novel. Most people recognize the name Agatha Christie, famous novelist. Christie wrote mystery novels, very good at that. Her body of work consists of things like murder on the orient express, and then there were none (also made into a film), the ABC murders.... plus more. I saw the 1970s film when I was probably too young to see it, but remember it being intriguing and having a very unexpected ending. I will say that for this remake, both of those things still hold true. There are intriguing parts of this movie, and it has an unexpected ending that I really liked and I thought was cleverly done. OK so let's talk about the plot and how it was executed. The plot isn't all too original at first glance. There are a number of passengers on a train, none that having any relation to one another, among them is one of the most famous detectives in existence... and one night the train suddenly stops. They check one of the passengers rooms and discover he's been murdered, stabbed. Immediately, this detective goes to work at trying to discover just who might've had an alibi, but what he discovers really thickens the plot. I won't say what he discovers, just that it makes the film much more interesting and really makes your ears perk up. The acting was well done mostly. I loved Michelle Pfeiffer in her role, Penelope Cruz was good in hers, Johnny Depp fit his well, Judi Dench was impressive as always, and Kenneth Branagh was just perfect for the starring role as Hercule Poirot. The dialogue was good for the most part, there were a few parts where things got a bit dull, and my attention did wander a couple times. That is really the only reason the rating isn't higher than it is. All in all though, it is a pretty good film that will entertain most people who are fans of this kind of movie. 7/10 for Murder on the Orient Express."
"statuskuo","8","8","21","13 November 2017"," Classical Filmmaking
","The scope is massive without it being a stupid brain-deadening superhero movie (God, someone shoot Marvel and DC dead...video games come to life are not FILMS!!). This is real filmmakers making a real film, and by all critics who've bashed this film on this site have overlooked, it is as patient of a film you will see. And if we're to wish pure storytelling to exist in the future, this is a reason to hold it tightly to your chest. Instead of beating the drum to comic book heroes. In this case it is a simple detective tale with characters stuck together in order to solve crime. Director Kenneth Brannagh seems to have an affinity towards both the source material and the Sidney Lumet 1974 version (the train full of stars). So what if you knew the answer to the who-dun-it. You know how most Thor movies end (here's the hint, with your brain melted and fat from stupidity). This film is photographed as old Hollywood. Something desperately missing are, less cuts and more staging. This is the film that showcases it with a great deal of zeal. It's exciting to see camera angles from the heavens that peep in on a intimate conversation. THIS is filmmaking. Or that we see multiple characters introduced throughout the train as background characters. Or that there is a coziness to this like playing the board game ""Clue."" And to top it all off...there is a deeper idea with the detective's story that wasn't in the 1974 version. Can I defend this to the simpleminded film goers today who lambasted this film for everything making films is all about. Oh right, most of you have or will never make a film in your lives. That's why you watch movies and not films. See this movie and re-calibrate your compass to how they're suppose to be made."

","I am a great fan of Agatha Christie in general and Hercule Poirot in particular. When yet another remake of Murder on the Orient express came out I was somewhat hesitant. After all, the one with David Suchet was perfect.<br/><br/>I guess I was right to be hesitant. This is another one of those remakes where you just wonder...why? As a movie it is not too bad but as a Hercule Poirot movie, the classical Murder on the Orient Express no less, it is like buying a piece of prime filet of beef and discovering that the butcher gave you chicken drums when you open the package. Edible but not at all what you paid for.<br/><br/>To me this movie was a blatant attempt to make an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. It was poorly done by a clueless scriptwriter and director and it was deeply disrespectful to the original character.<br/><br/>The movie starts of by introducing Hercule as the pedantic, somewhat weird, person that he is but the attempt is just dumb and silly. Apart from the scene more or less making Hercule look like a jerk, these people apparently know him, why would they serve two eggs of different sizes in the first place? Oh right, because the director thought the audience was too dumb to make that reflection.<br/><br/>Then there are some things that Hercule simply do not do. Like walking on the roofs of train cars, climbing around and chasing criminals as if he was some action hero. He even gets shot and more or less just shrugs it off for Christ sake!<br/><br/>And do not get me started on that grotesque moustache! As I said, an Americanized version of Hercule Poirot. Unfortunately bigger is not always better.<br/><br/>I can go on for some time here so let's move on.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is not that bad. The scenes, the decor, the acting in general etc. can even be said to be good. Unfortunately, for me, this was constantly overshadowed by the brutal slaughtering of my beloved Hercule Poirot character.<br/><br/>Part of this is probably due to the movie trying to focus so much on Hercule that most of the other actors almost feel like ... props, even though they themselves are doing quite a good job of their roles. One reviewer wrote that ""The actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Branagh act."" and there seems to be some truth in that.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a hint of further moves. Personally, I hope there will not be a continuation of this train wreck (pun intended)."

Lead actor and director Branagh seems to be overdoing it a bit, recruiting a star-studded cast who are unfortunately used to just show up and be recognized, rather than actually employ their acting abilities.

","Furbished with polished attire, neat cinematography, star-studded ensemble & a moustache that overshadows everything, the second feature film adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel is a sumptuously produced mystery thriller that's narrated in a dull, uninspiring & uninteresting fashion.<br/><br/>The story of Murder on the Orient Express follows the investigation that's set into motion when a passenger is found brutally murdered on the train. Handling the case is celebrated detective Hercule Poirot who deduces that the killer is still on board and tries to solve the mystery before the train reaches his destination.<br/><br/>Directed by Kenneth Branagh, the movie follows the book closely yet is unable to create moments of genuine interest & nail-biting tension. Characters are poorly written & thinly sketched. The only thing that stands out about Hercule Poirot is his moustache. And further bogging down the plot are its clichéd elements & lack of suspense.<br/><br/>But the film is refined in technical aspects, at least to an extent. Its period setting is finely illustrated. Camerawork is crisp, the images retain their sharpness at all times, and also benefit from its apt use of colour palette & lighting. Editing is a misfire, for the story isn't tightly knitted and twists lack the element of surprise. And the background score is serviceable at best.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Murder on the Orient Express packs an impressive ensemble in Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe & Johnny Depp, and they all chip in with forgettable inputs. Still, it's not entirely their fault, for they had paper-thin material to work with and while Branagh gets the most screen time, he fails to make the most of it.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Murder on the Orient Express is interesting in bits n pieces but for the most part, there is nothing about it that leaves a lasting impression. Script is the main culprit while Branagh's direction is missing the required creativity, and the sum of it results in an adaptation that's faithful yet mediocre & unstimulating. Casual moviegoers probably won't mind its shortcomings but it could've been so much more had it gotten everything right."

","A murder has been committed on the renowned Simplon-Orient Express.<br/><br/>Hercule Poirot, arguably literature's most famous fictional detectives is - coincidentally - on that train.<br/><br/>Those of us who chain-read Agatha Christie's mysteries during her resurgence in the 1970s can recall how the parsed and slow confessions of murder suspects could be thrilling in the trusted hands of a great storyteller/detective team.<br/><br/>This new re-imagining of Murder on the Orient Express, by director-star, Kenneth Branagh, takes Christie's 1934 page-turner and transforms it into a self-conscious melange of hypotheticals that confuse rather than titillate its audience.<br/><br/>For nearly two hours we sit, hopeful, through a litany of plot-thickening star-turns from the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfieffer, Judy Dench and Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>Poirot, undaunted and ever-observant, unravels the spewed clues in good time, briefly considering their merits until his keenly recalled, pre-murder encounters with each suspect leads him to his own formulary of conclusions.<br/><br/>Inside and around the Sturm and Drang exposition of plot is the unremitting scrutiny of Poirot's interior life and an abundance of uncomfortably tight close-ups of the character's overly manicured mustache. This psychological and physical investigation of the detective does little to advance the build-up of anticipation required for the finale of any self-respecting whodunit.<br/><br/>Audience attention is further undermined by a large dose of digitized, gauzy photography which steals the story's thunder out from under itself, as if the Alps - the film's location - needed visual enhancement.<br/><br/>Instead of amplifying the fear and loathing small places can engender, the train's interior, lovingly detailed down to the luxurious thread-count on its upholstered dining chairs, is invisibly pried open at the top to allow cinematographer, Haris Zambarloukis, a series of overhead shots that add nothing but needless cinematic hocus-pocus.<br/><br/>The film's final scene - a bizarre mug shot of the cast, reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper - is a pummeling rehash of the story's twists and turns by the exhausted, Poirot, who throughout the film claims he's in dire need of a vacation from the rigorous mind puzzles that would confound a lesser detective.<br/><br/>By the end of his diatribe we care little about the characters and think even less of their predicaments.<br/><br/>In the end there's only Poirot.<br/><br/>We can see how Agatha Christie, herself, during an interview in the 1960's, began to talk of Poirot - her own invention - as a ""detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep.""<br/><br/>Poirot's popularity did not wane, so Christie - deemed the best-selling author of all time - waited to kill off this central character of 33 best-selling books until her 1975 novel, Curtains.<br/><br/>Upon his literary death The New York Times ran the only obituary ever published within its pages of a fictional character."

","Comparing this version of the film to the 1974 version is like comparing a lavish film production to a rather dull, dark and rushed made for TV movie. <br/><br/>Once again Kenneth Brannah,. who stars and directs, proved he should stick to the Bard. His accent as Poirot is worse than the my spelling of his name. His direction is rushed and boring, the stellar cast has little do or say and the story is an abriged version of the original film.

","In this Kenneth Branagh (My Week with Marilyn, TV Wallander) directed film, screenplay written by Michael Green (Logan, TVs Heroes) based on the novel by Agatha Christie, Kenneth Branagh also stars as Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>When Poirot decides to leave on the Orient Express, directed by his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman), the train gets stopped because of an avalanche caused by heavy snow and this gives way to a murder plot unfolding. The murder victim American businessman Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp: Edward Scissorhands, Finding Neverland) has secrets.<br/><br/>An eclectic bunch of first class travellers include Governess Mary Debenham (Daisy Ridley: ), doctor Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Junior), Ratchett's valet Edward Masterman (Derek Jacobi) and secretary Hector MacQueen (Josh Gad), Austrian Professor Gerhard Hardman (Willem Defoe), American Socialite Mrs Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), Italian car salesman Beniamino Marquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), elderly Princess Dragomiroff (Judy Dench) and her assistant Hildegarde Schmidt (Olivia Coleman), unhappy missionary Pilar Astravados (Penélope Cruz) and the Count and Countess Andrenyi (Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton) and they are all now suspects. The victim was stabbed 12 times, Poirot has to work out by whom.<br/><br/>For me, Poirot will forever be David Suchet, but I was interested to see what this new take on the classic Agatha Christie story would be, especially with such big actors in the roles.<br/><br/>It started well, a great couple of scenes demarcating Poirots' character involving the capture of a criminal at the wailing wall and an amusing set piece when he runs into Bouc.<br/><br/>After this however, it goes downhill. Branagh does not make for a good Poirot (don't get me started on the moustache - does it have it's own twitter account? If not, it should), there are gaping plot holes/flaws (e.g. the film makes a point of telling us that the train is full, which with only 12 passengers does make you wonder what happened to all the other carriages) and I am not sure what technique Depp was using for his character, but it was not working. The film drags apart from the last 20 minutes and the alteration to the storyline is unnecessary and does not improve on the original, rather the opposite.<br/><br/>The scenery is stunning, as are the sets and costumes but the film is ultimately disappointing.<br/><br/>At the end of the film Poirot is asked to go investigate another crime which points towards a planned remake of Death on the Nile. I, for one, hope not."

","Good: The amazing all-star cast of academy award winners. Even though each actor/actress plays their role well, no one was a standout. The setting of most of the movie is the Orient Express, which helps contribute to a trapped and isolated feel and makes you feel as if you were there with the detective. The introductory to Hercule Poirot is great, but as the movie chugs along<br/><br/>Bad: Overall, the movie lacks comedy and heartfelt moments. At times, the accent of Poirot is hard to understand, which leads to clues that are not clearly understood and a story that is hard to follow along. The movie is more of an interrogation of each character, by just going down the huge list of suspects and giving each character equal screen time. It progresses at a slow pace and the clues never lean me towards one person or another. I also did not find the murder to be inventive or creative. <br/><br/>Overall: Even with an outstanding cast, the movie suffers from a generic plot. The movie lacks the engaging aspects of a crime movie and relies too heavily on its cast to deliver its moments. <br/><br/>2.7/5"

","I definitely enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. It was a fun murder mystery. The greatest thing about this movie was, hands down, the whodunit feel. Murder on the Orient Express was very reminiscent of the Scooby Doo or Nancy Drew mysteries from my childhood. The detective, is Hercule Poirot, a borderline OCD character that strives to find an even balance in everything in life. Because of his unique outlook, he has throughout his life become a great detective with the ability to see things that are out of place. While trying to go on a real vacation, he takes the train Orient Express where there is eventually, of course, a murder. The movie follows the detective as he strives to ascertain the murderer by finding clues, questioning the other passengers for motives, and cross referencing alibis. I thought the characters were well played by their actors, the flow of the movie was never stale, and the detectives mustache were on point. Throughout the movie I was switching between which passenger was my top suspect for the case, and the ending did not disappoint me."

","This is Poirot as I have never seen him before. The whole film feels fresh and helps introduce new generations to a classic tale of Christie twists.<br/><br/>The winter atmosphere makes one wish to cuddle up by a fireplace and sip hot tea. All the shots either give a sense of the isolated cold winter outside or the tense claustrophobia inside the train cabin.<br/><br/>Each of the actors give quite good performances. For Branagh, David Suchet's Poirot is a hard act to follow not to mention an Oscar-nominated turn by Albert Finney. However, he makes the Belgian detective charming, witty, likable, and portrays all the brilliance the character has to offer. Some of the other stand outs include an amazingly dramatic Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and suspicious, Johnny Depp oozes all the vile traits for a putrescent man, and Daisy Ridley plays a strong-willed and delightful character perfectly.<br/><br/>This version goes in a not before seen direction by adding heart and emotion into not only the suspects, but even the detective himself. This is rarely seen in other incarnations, but Branagh gives chills of emotions while others leave you in tears by the charged ending.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful blend of classical and modern film that Branagh has gotten so good at over the years with his Shakespeare adaptations.

","Let me just say this is the first version of Murder on the Orient Express I ever saw. I haven't read the book either, but was really curious to see this movie. I saw it in cinema a couple of hours ago and when I came online here, I had to write a review of my own because I only saw negative ones and wondered why. I loved it. It's a movie I'd go and see multiple times. Yes, it can be a bit slow some times, but I think it matches the theme. (Of course, the Imagine Dragons music in the trailer and the hideous modern, blue fonts were a mistake I find odd. True style breaker.) The costumes and set is just lovely, I was blown away by the creative aspects of the camera. There's one shot that's 'hanging on the ceiling' and you look down at two heads. I thought that was brilliant, in that setting at that specific time in the story. Furthermore I thought all performances were good and it wasn't a Branagh one-man show, it was the full cast that got me. I believed their characters and didn't expect the ending of this film. Unlike some people here, I recommend you to see it."
"quinnox-1","8","9","25","13 November 2017"," A Fantastic atmospheric classical style mystery - with great actors/actresses!
","Wow, I didn't see this coming! I had seen previews and since I'm a British mystery book enthusiast, I very much was interested in the movie. But my expectations were not very high, because of all the disappointing drek that Hollywood has been churning out in recent history. Hollywood seems to have been having a really rough time in trying to make good movies lately.<br/><br/>So I was very surprised at just how good this movie turned out to be. It's filmed in a very classical style, and reminds me of older movies, when they knew how to make good movies. Great atmosphere of a luxury train in the 1930s, and the train interior scenes are done in a way that doesn't feel cramped at all, like you might think. It all feels very natural. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast is excellent. My favorite characters and performances in the movie were Kenneth Branagh as the esteemed detective Hercule Poirot, Willem Dafoe as Professor Gerhard Hardman, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard.<br/><br/>I don't know what it is about Michelle Pfeiffer, but I have taken a real liking to her as she has become an older actress. I used to not like her at all when she was ""young and hot"", but now I think she is a really good actress and I'm excited to see her name in a film. Here, she is really superb playing a mature woman who still has a wild streak in her, and she almost steals the entire movie all by herself.<br/><br/>But Kenneth Branagh also gives a sterling performance, and I was very impressed by his portrayal of the detective Poirot in the movie. He was pretty amazing in how authentic the character came across as, and had a hell of a presence in the movie, basically anchoring the whole movie around his performance.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe was solid, as usual, as a fine character actor. And he had a really good reveal type scene near the end of the film, I thought. That said, the acting from all the characters in the movie, both major and minor, was of a very high caliber overall.<br/><br/>The film's mystery is based on the famous Agatha Christie novel, which I must confess I never read. So, the entire plot was a surprise to me, and I have to say it was a damn fine mystery! I now know why this book is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery novels, its quite fantastic! I didn't see the solution coming at all, and even though I have read numerous detective books and seen a ton of mystery TV shows, the climax even surprised me, which shows just how special this mystery really is -- definitely written by a master.<br/><br/>My only real criticism is that the film is shot in 65mm, which gives the film kind of a fantasy, story-book like look to the whole film. A lot of the landscape shots especially looked fake and like CGI because of this. <br/><br/>I prefer the more realistic look that you get from normal 35mm film. <br/><br/>A minor complaint is the film feels a bit rushed to me, and maybe should have been half an hour longer. This is a very unusual complaint coming from me, because I don't like and often will criticize the too long running times of many movies these days. But this movie felt like it could have used another half hour to expand upon, and not feel so rushed.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys traditional style mysteries, it really is a must-see!"
"Mohican15","7","9","25","6 November 2017"," Certainly not brilliant but still rather enjoyable!
","I must admit, after his first directorial debuts with the appalling THOR movies, I was a little hesitant about Kenneth Branagh's latest outing as director (and star) with Murder on the Orient Express, and though there was a fair amount of material to enjoy, I'm sad to say that I WAS fairly spot-on. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there IS enjoyable stuff here but there were also various problems that left me rather disappointed. <br/><br/>Let's first focus on the good things. <br/><br/>First of all, one thing Branagh REALLY does well in this movie with his directing, is he delivers a brilliant and authentic slice of nostalgia. <br/><br/>We begin in 1930s Jerusalem and Branagh captures the spirit and style of that period spot-on. The fashion, the clothes, the cars, the expensive clubs and bars. We see beautiful shots of Istanbul too with the glorious steamboats and the incredible Cathedrals. <br/><br/>We're really transported back in time, but the other way Branagh delivers that nostalgia is with the absolutely breathtaking natural scenery that revolves around the Orient Express's journey. The cinematography in this film is BRILLIANT, courtesy of Haris Zambarloukos and really flies us into the snowy mountains or across the sun- kissed plains. The journey of the train is REALLY beautifully shown all the way through the film. <br/><br/>Another good thing that Branagh captures is the attitudes and politics of the period. He's changed the British Colonel Arbuthnot into an African Dr. Arbuthnot, but this change from the original text is actually really interesting and adds another level to the story. A lot of the characters suffer from period racism, and that is authentically portrayed VERY well. <br/><br/>Another thing is the set design, the interior of the train. It's beautiful, classic and very stylish. <br/><br/>Also, another obvious thing to mention about Branagh's directing is that he does pull together a formidable cast. Almost every member is on top form. The whole line-up from Pfeiffer to Dafoe is great. <br/><br/>Pfeiffer delivers a very emotional and strong performance as Mrs. Hubbard. Daisy Ridley plays a posh heroine and she plays that authentically too. Leslie Odom Jr. isn't bad as Dr. Arbuthnot but his muddled accent IS a distraction. Judi Dench and Olivia Coleman are two other interesting and authentic performances as the Russian Princess and German maid. Penelope Cruz delivers a interesting and surprising performance is Pilar Estravados. The great Willem Dafoe delivers enjoyable authenticity and some charm as the Nazi Professor. Derek Jacobi and Manuel Garcia- Rulfo deliver two very enjoyable performances. Jacobi harnessing his inner Alfred Pennyworth and Rulfo ringing with charisma... <br/><br/>I am however, rather divide on Johnny Depp's sinister businessman Ratchett. He DOES play a thug well but there are STILL ghosts of Captain Jack and he can be a little laughable at times. <br/><br/>Now we've gone through the GOOD members of the cast, onto the bad. Four performances stand out as REALLY poor. Josh Gad, Lucy Boynton, Sergei Polunin and Tom Bateman as the assistant, Count, Countess and train manager. They ALL deliver poor and rather weak performances with Gad, Polunin and Bateman all trying vainly to portray real emotion and Boynton basically playing a female Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>I've saved Branagh's performance for last. I was incredibly divided on his performance as Hercules Poirot which is a combo of Sherlock Holmes and Howard Hughes from THE AVIATOR . He DID deliver emotion and authenticity but there were times when his raving about the ""crime"" and the ""truth"" did feel a bit over-dramatic. His accent wasn't bad but I (personally) think that David Suchet did the best accent. Also, as many have mentioned, his mustache is simply not Poirot, it's more of a John Ruth from the Hateful Eight in my opinion! <br/><br/>Now, the script. It, like the film has both good AND bad points. The dialogue is usually smart, sharp and interesting. It displays Poirot's genius and the personalities of the passengers very well. It really showcases the nostalgia of the times VERY well and slightly hinges on the 1974 film of the same name, but it also really grafts the tragedy and horror of the fictional ""Armstrong Case"" very well too. <br/><br/>However, this version does have slight changes in plot to the original novel by Christie. There are various twists and turns that are interesting but, VERY messy. Things could do to be tightened up a lot in this film. Also, it just isn't exciting and it didn't really grab me at all. There is almost no dramatic atmosphere or tension. <br/><br/>However, all the good performances, great cinematography and interesting dialogue DID deliver a fairly enjoyable picture. <br/><br/>But, as I have listed, it does have problems! <br/><br/>Not bad but definitely a B-PICTURE!"

","Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh, who also directed) is, by his own admission, the world's greatest detective circa 1930. Its true. Using his ""little gray cells"" he has solved some unsolvable crimes. At the start of the film, in Israel, Poirot discovers who stole a rare, bejeweled artifact and it wasn't a rabbi, priest, or iman, as suspected. Now, Mr. Hercule just wants to get back to London. His mode of transportation is the famous Orient Express, from Istanbul to Paris. On board, he meets kind folks like Mary (Daisy Ridley), a governess, Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom, Jr.), the grand Mrs. Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer), a Princess (Judi Dench), among others, and a man described as most unpleasant, Mr. Ratchet (Johnny Depp). In fact, when Ratchet finds out Mr. Poirot is on the train, he asks him for a huge favor. Ratchet, a self-described art dealer, insists someone is trying to ""off"" him and wants Hercule to protect him. Poirot says no, for he has his doubts about who Ratchet truly is. As the train passes through mountains, an avalanche stops the train in the early morning and it is soon discovered Ratchet was murdered in the night, even though he slept with a gun. It appears his late night coffee was drugged. One of the first things brought to life, too, was that the dead man's name wasn't Ratchet, but Cassetti, and as such, was the kidnapper/murderer of a young girl, Daisy Armstrong, some years before. One by one, Poirot interviews the rest of the passengers, trying to find a killer. Could it be his secretary, McQueen (Josh Gad), who was stealing money from his boss? Or perhaps it was the Austrian professor (Willem Dafoe) who seethes with hatred for others? The culprit, whom Poirot DOES uncover, is almost beyond belief! Who done it? Thie classic tale is a feast for the eyes and ears. The scenery is breathtaking and the script witty, amid the horror. Then, too, the cast is superb, each doing fine work, especially Branagh as Poirot. Needless to say, the costumes are likewise wonderful as they recreates the garb of the thirties. Perhaps the only criticism might be leveled at the pace, as it is slow at times. Nevertheless, discerning movie goers will want to EXPRESSLY make a date to view it."
"tboyd10","8","9","26","13 November 2017"," Brilliant Revival of Classic Murder Mystery
","I thought this movie was great! I love a good thriller/murder mystery, but movies nowadays are all about the gore and horror more than the strategy. There is a point in the movie where you realize there are too many coincidences and you can pretty much guess who the killer is, but you really can't say for sure until the very end. I loved all the scenery and vibrancy of the time. Each character in the film is very much their own and unalike others. I have never read Agatha Christie nor seen early versions of this movie, but I really enjoyed her plot. I think the classic murder mystery needs a revival because very many these days leave me feeling down about the world, but coming out of the theater from this one, I felt satisfied. For those wondering, there was no foul language and no sex scenes, so, besides a scene of violence, it's pretty safe for all ages to see. I hope I see more movies like this coming out."

This justifies him taking a classic story and changing it. <br/><br/>Of course, if you already know that racism is bad, I strongly suggest you see the Sidney Lumet version.

","(This is less a traditional review than some scattered thoughts):<br/><br/>First thought/complaint: How in god's name are they out there in what is supposed to be cold and sub-zero enough to give everyone ""exposure"" for so long in just regular jackets and coats? Come on, Kenny my man, do better than that. <br/><br/>Second thought: while the best Agatha Christie movie of this decade still is and will likely remain The Hateful Eight, this is engaging, dramatic and full of robust performances (Johnny Depp hasn't been this good/sleazy in a decade, even as he has a relatively small role, luckily it's not the size but the keyness of it). It actually helped that I hadn't seen another version of this story - yes, shame on me for not seeing the Lumet one, I'll get on it soon - and the ending was sadder than I expected, which is good. Branaugh keeps his audience on his toes and there isn't a false note in the performances.<br/><br/>Third thought: This is not directorially up to par with Henry V and Hamlet, but I'm glad to see Branaugh still has it in in him to make a film full of vitality and visual ideas that are a little wild and a little of the usual (black and white flashbacks, really?) But where it counts, the movie is fully involving and the story shines however you cut it - in that way I'd rank this alongside something like the recent Great Gatsby adaptation: as long as you really get the goods right, and don't go TOO crazy stylistically, what works will shine through (also I mean, Pfeiffer, Dafoe, Cruz, even Josh goddamn Gad are stand-outs, and Ridley's fine too though now she just like has to do a movie where she and Kiera Knightley are sisters, right, like that has to happen now contractually).<br/><br/>Oh, and the CGi... eh.... But my positives outweigh the negatives here. Mostly. It's a wonderful whodunit story that kept me on my toes and had a procedural tone that kept me wholly invested. Not to mention, naturally, that giant mustache that is like a mustache that grew a mustache - or, more to the point, the Human Stachipede."

","I often thought, if the 1974 classic had to be remade, it had to be with Branagh as Hercule Poirot. But it got even better as he was also behind the camera on this remake. First of all, you cannot find anyone better than Branagh to pull this off both as Poirot and as a director. Secondly, the other actors were cast remarkably. I especially enjoyed Judi Dench, Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer. And Daisy Ridley reminded me why it was still worth it to see The Force Awakens in theater, she pulled it off well. <br/><br/>I also have never had the chance to appreciate Branagh's directorial work this much since his 'Hamlet' (1996) until this particular film, the visuals are great,cinematography is brilliant.

My review is based on this version the way I just viewed it on the big screen. And even though the story may be known, even though it's a star vehicle with a group of big names and not all of them get the time to truly show their strength, it works in my eyes. Why? Because of the spherical way it has been filmed. In a way, it reminded me of the Grand Budapest Hotel. And I have to say, I loved it. The book was written for entertainment, the first movie was made for that and this movie has just one purpose and that's entertainment. A good night with visual pleasure. Not to find out who did it, most of us already know. It's the way it is found out that matters. People who say it was an unnecessary remake in my eyes are in love with the first version and rightfully they are. But that does not make their review objective. If you have an open mind, if you like to be entertained. Then go watch this movie and have yourself entertained. For me, it was a pleasure from start to end. Only negative... it's a bit short. And in the end, Michelle Pheiffer can sing a nice tune during the end credits."
"taylorhammons","8","7","19","10 November 2017"," How do you tell a story when everyone already knows the ending?
","Agatha Christie was the queen of all things murder, and in perhaps her most quintessential story, she gives us an ending so incredibly inventive, so inspired, that few have dared repeat it. For the few of you who haven't read or seen Murder on the Orient Express before or had it spoiled for you, I won't tell you the ending. Suffice to say, it's extremely unpredictable and could only have been done by Agatha Christie. <br/><br/>But for those of us who do know the story, how do you make it entertaining when we all know how it ends? Therein lies the genius that is Kenneth Branaugh. In the next installment of a stellar career, Branaugh shifts focus from the comedies of Shakespeare to the suspense of Agatha Christie and proves that his talent knows no bounds. Expertly directed and wonderfully cast, Branaugh's adaption keeps all the charm, glamour and suspense that Christie intended, while modernizing it for a younger audience. And for those who say the story is no longer relevant, I argue that Branaugh's true genius lies in the ability to make a period piece as just that: a period piece. While the story itself may not be as relevant as it was in its day, the lessons behind it are just as true today as they ever were. In perhaps her greatest work, Agatha Christie blurs the very lines of good and evil and causes even the great Poirot to question his long held morality. <br/><br/>Was it necessary? Maybe not. But is that really the point? It's entertaining, the cinematography was beautiful (the murder scene especially), and it stayed true to the source material. I for one, thoroughly enjoyed it. <br/><br/>Now, can we all please petition Kenneth Branaugh to remake And Then There Were None?"
"richard-1787","8","7","19","10 November 2017"," An often breathtakingly-beautiful movie
","""An often breathtakingly-beautiful movie"" is not a common description of a murder mystery, but for me, while this movie had other remarkable features, it was first and foremost often breathtaking beautiful. I'm glad I opted to see it in a theater, with a huge HD screen at that, because it certainly added to the pleasure. Some of what we see is computer graphics, but I don't know when I've seen them used so well.<br/><br/>The cinematography in general is wonderful and often very creative here. Close-ups of faces that make them look just astonishingly beautiful and at the same time full of character. Interesting camera angles. This movie is certainly a joy to watch.<br/><br/>And then there is the acting. I thought Branaugh, a great actor, made Poirot too much of a caricature, but the rest of the actors do a great job with their roles. The camera often shoots their faces close-up, as in older movies, but it can, because these actors all know how to act with their faces.<br/><br/>At times the script seemed too full of clues that we weren't allowed enough time to think about. Perhaps, now that I know the end - which certainly comes as a surprise! - the clues would make more sense on a second viewing.<br/><br/>Still, a wonderful movie, and one that should definitely be seen in a theater. So much of it would be lost on a small screen.<br/><br/>-----------------------------<br/><br/>Since seeing the movie and writing the above, I read the book. The differences between it and the movie are telling. <br/><br/>The end of the movie, the unraveling of the mystery, seemed too abrupt. It was as if the director had run out of time presenting the mystery, and so, rather than letting Poirot solve it a step at a time, he just dumped the solution on us when Poirot calls for a meeting of all the passengers outside the train.<br/><br/>That in fact is evidently what happened. In the book, Poirot works things out one step at a time after he has interviewed all the passengers a first time. Some of his deductions are, at best, far- fetched, but others make sense and are based on clues that we have sometimes had dangling in front of us for some time. <br/><br/>That working out, which takes 100 of the book's 260 pages, is basically discarded for the joint confession in front of the tunnel entrance. <br/><br/>Looked at in retrospect, I can see now that the long episode at the beginning of the movie, not in the book, where Poirot solves a different crime in front of the walls of Jerusalem, and then all the business in Istanbul, should have been tossed out or pared way down. I can imagine it would have been painful to throw away so much footage, but keeping it left no time for Poirot to solve the case a step at a time after he had met all the passengers in the sleeping car.<br/><br/>As I wrote above, before reading Christie's book, what we have looks great. I could understand, however, if Christie fans felt short- changed."

","I must admit, I have no familiarity with any of Agatha Christie stories and have never seen the original of this film so I am coming at this review from the angle of a complete Poirot 'newbie' but I really enjoyed the film. I thought the cast was superb and to me, it felt like a proper 'film' rather than a clichéd 'who dunnit' type movie where you don't actually care what happened if you're honest. I liked the back-story and how things twisted and turned and I thought Kenneth was fabulous as Poirot....he is one of my favourite actors though and I'd like him in anything but jackoby and Depp were both also very good as was Dame Judi Dench. It wasn't the most action packed movie I've ever seen and I do wish that the audience could have been given more in the way of evidence and time to work things out for ourselves as I did feel Poirot kind of got to the bottom of things based on intuition rather than evidence which gave us the audience no hope in getting there first! Other than that though it was superb and I enjoyed it beginning to end, I felt genuinely choked up at the end and this is not something that happens a lot with me. Well done all x"
"paulswift-50066","1","4","9","12 February 2018"," Massively disappointing
","I've read all the books and watched a great deal of other actors playing this role but this has to be the worst, by far. It doesn't look like the character from the books, with a hipster style moustache that was totally inaccurate. Branagh's accent mostly just plain English with little or no accent.
This has a brilliant cast and great cinematography with all the romance and drama of the Orient Express captured, which should've made this a great film. The dialog was quite stunted in a number of places, with people looking at each other wondering what was going on, not just the audience. It's a simple enough story made hard to follow by actors who didn't appear to know their characters.
I can only say that I didn't watch the whole film. I was expecting Hercule Poirot and just got Kenneth Branagh with a massively oversized inaccurate moustache being an English man trying to be Belgian."
"CharlesAncelle","3","4","9","18 November 2017"," No vision or talent.
","What becomes very clear in the first five minutes of the film is how badly Kenneth Branagh has wanted to play Hercule Poirot, seemingly his whole life. It comes out of every pore of his being and yet, his unleashed and unchecked infatuation for the role only leads to a series of poor and mostly incredibly mindless choices.<br/><br/>One of the most talked about ones is clearly the mustache and it is a perfect symbol of Branagh's completely unrestrained and cartoonish take on the story. It's not unusual for the director, of course: restraint is not exactly the first adjective that comes to mind to describe his previous work, but here, it is simply so over the top that it becomes quickly unbearable.<br/><br/>Add to that that his French accent is horrendous when it doesn't disappear almost completely (by the way, all artificial accents are awful in this movie, Judi Dench barely makes an effort to sound Eastern while Willem Dafoe doesn't even try to sound Austrian), and that all the details he adds to the character are so completely British that it is astounding that no one in his entourage ever stepped and said, wait a minute: ""why the hell does Hercule Poirot give a damn about egg size? Seriously?""<br/><br/>He carries around a ridiculous cane that then serves to choreograph an incredibly lame and unnecessary action sequence that, I suppose, was attempting to add some excitement in an otherwise incredibly flat and boring series of interrogation scenes, and other than that, he spends a lot of time yelling for no reason, or making theatrical moralizing speeches that are completely ridiculous for anyone familiar with him: <br/><br/>Poirot's new arc is to recognize that there may be a gray area in our moral code. You have read that right, this incredibly intelligent man who has been in this world for decades didn't recognize until this particular point that the laws of men may be flawed and that everything can't always be black or white. How remarkable!<br/><br/>Last but not least, Branagh was so focused on giving himself screen time that we barely see any of the rest of the cast, which, granted, may not be a bad thing sometimes (Penelope Cruz is stunningly awful), and sometimes quite disappointing (more Michelle Pfeiffer or Lucy Boynton in particular would have been welcome). <br/><br/>I would strongly recommend watching the Sydney Lumet version instead, there is a chance you will actually enjoy it."
"glasslens","6","4","9","14 November 2017"," Thoroughly enjoyable but a very flawed film
","Let's start with the elephant in the room. If you were going to set up a remake of a Hercule Poirot film, you would not in a month of Sundays cast Kenneth Branagh as Poirot. Not just because he is nothing like David Suchet but because he is nothing like the character that Christie describes. In this film, Branagh simply dresses up in a moustache and thinks that makes him into Poirot. Unless he thinks he is setting up a brand new version of Poirot, but he doesn't even do that. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Branagh as an actor but his weakness is that he always plays himself somehow. I expect he was too busy trying to direct. Why on earth try to play the leading role and direct when there are perfectly good directors and far better actors for this part? Truth be said, this has all the hallmarks of a vanity project for Branagh. One suspects that Branagh cannot understand why everybody does not think he is the world's greatest actor and by directing admire him even more. Actually the film is rather well directed but more of this later.<br/><br/>Now, the rest of the cast play their parts well and are clearly well directed. We see them clearly and we hear them clearly as they speak their lines to perfection. The film relies on it's plot and from this point of view it works really well. That said, the previous versions were also very good but certainly not better. <br/><br/>The fight scenes were absolutely ridiculous and if any one thing pushed this film towards being a turkey, they did. Read the book Branagh and learn!!!!!<br/><br/>Now of course this film was not meant to be ""realistic"" in any sense, and clearly the producers and director wanted to product a visually stunning tour-de-force. And stunning it is but in a very unrealistic way - it all looks a bit like a realistic cartoon. The special effects are brilliantly done but they are very very obvious. The bridge, the train in the snow and the station look totally artificial although as I say, very cleverly done. I have only to assume that this ""Hugo"" look is intentional. <br/><br/>Now, I always comment on the cinematography. The 70mm film origination looks stunning especially in the effects-driven swooping shots of the train in the mountains. The camera motion on the train, especially considering the narrow corridors is top class and Haris ZambarlouKos must take credit for doing a great job here. I'm assuming the over use of shots looking down from the ceiling and the tracking shot early on of people walking through the train from the exterior were Branagh driven - they were unnecessary and irritating but some of us found them fun.<br/><br/>Near the end of this film Poirot - well Branagh of course as he is nothing like Poirot, alludes to Death On The Nile. Let's hope that if they have a go at that one, they get a decent Poirot! <br/><br/>BUT actually I thoroughly enjoyed this very deeply flawed film! Unlike a couple in the row in front. Said one to the other, I kid you not, ""Nice cinema, shame about the film""."

","Director/Actor Kenneth Branagh (Dir.: ""Cinderella"" - 2015, Actor: ""Dunkirk"" - 2017) and writer Michael Green (""Green Lantern"" - 2011) toss CGI special effects, a packed and at times confusing storyline, and all kinds of celebrities (Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and a whole slue of others) at this famed Agatha Christie novel turned movie to unexpected boredom. The blame here lies in Branagh's hands, as he stars in and directs. Across the board, the top notch actors seem to be just going through the motions and/or involved in the production as a favor to their friend and theater company member Branagh. It doesn't help that Branagh's direction is overly staged at every turn, to the extend it appears the various scenes start and stop with little smooth transition. So many situation presented just don't make sense here, such as: How does a large train that is derailed get back on the tracks without any machinery? How can characters nonchalantly talk out in the freezing weather without jackets or walking on snow without any sound of the snow crunching below them? If the train isn't not running, how is it that heat, lights and cooking continues, and on and on, and on. One can quickly see how this film will develop from the beginning of the film, where the ""Wailing Wall"" suddenly becomes a site for one of Hercule Poirot's (Branagh's character) cheesy detective resolutions. The story behind Agatha Christie's novel is all there, it's just Branagh's creepy mustache and mumbling dialogue delivery, coupled with the overly staged scenes and lackluster cast, just make this film a monotonous viewing experience."

"rbr-41299","3","3","6","17 November 2017"," A Slightly Different Tale
","Fans of Agatha Christie are rightfully disappointed in Branagh's film because the screenplay changed so much as to make the film a mockery of the novel. I'm surprised the Christie estate supported it. Comparisons are naturally being made with the 1974 Lumet film which closely followed the novel and was a much superior production to this one. There are only a few positives in Branagh's film. The cinematography is outstanding and the set design demonstrated attention to detail. Branagh made the train car interiors wider than actual to accommodate camera angles, a major challenge to the 1974 production which used actual train cars. Also, the much-maligned mustache is closer to the Poirot of the novels than the Suchet- mustache. The actors did the best they could with a bad script, although I think Ridley with her quirky grin was miscast as Miss Debenham, and Depp's portrayal of Ratchett was weird.<br/><br/>Branagh's film makes many changes to the novel. The film opens in Jerusalem with Poirot stepping in a pile of manure (why?) and then shifts to a scene in front of the wailing wall. Poirot has a Muslim imam, a Jewish rabbi and a Catholic priest standing in front of the wailing wall, giving the appearance of an acted out joke. Maybe the screenwriter was trying to inject humor into a serious story, but in my view made Poirot look silly and showed a lack of sensitivity to the holiest site in Judaism. The producer and director deserve to be censured by the Israeli government.<br/><br/>The Arbuthnot character is a black doctor rather than a British Colonel. Perhaps Branagh wanted to preempt criticism from the PC crowd as experienced by the film ""Dunkirk"" for not including black soldiers in the British Army. But, the PC crowd is not concerned about accuracy. Then tension was added to the story with other elements not in the book: the train being stopped on a trestle over a gorge, omitting Dr. Constantine, Arbuthnot examining the body of Ratchett and giving a medical opinion, Mrs. Hubbard being stabbed, Poirot chasing McQueen onto the trestle, Poirot being shot, and Poirot offering Mrs. Hubbard to shoot him since he couldn't live with the knowledge of accommodating murderers.<br/><br/>The final summing up of the case takes place outdoors rather than in the dining car as in the book. Branagh no doubt wanted to avoid the difficulties encountered in the making of the 1974 film. In that film Albert Finney as Poirot had to repeat the dining car summation multiple times in order to get the camera shots of the various characters that Poirot was addressing.<br/><br/>Branagh's film (as well as the 2010 made-for-TV movie starring David Suchet), has Poirot struggling on the horns of a dilemma: bring charges against the 12 people who conspired to kill Ratchett, or say nothing and become an accessory to murder after the fact. Both Suchet and Branagh want Poirot to act as judge and declare the conspirators morally wrong, which Christie does not do.<br/><br/>In the novel Poirot accurately deduces those responsible for Ratchett's death, but remains neutral. He proposes two solutions to the crime, one in which the crime was committed by an outside assassin and the other in which twelve persons on the train killed Ratchett. He leaves it to the owner of the railroad to decide what to tell the authorities. The owner with agreement by Dr. Constantine decide on the assassin. Christie essentially leaves the moral dilemma to the reader.<br/><br/>Liberal film-makers, of course, don't believe murderers should die for their crimes and confuse justice with revenge. In my view the actions of the passengers to kill Ratchett was justifiable homicide. Ratchett was a serial murderer who had not been held to account for any of his crimes. Christie's choice of 12 victims meting out justice is actually based on the Bible since God decreed that those whose testimony condemned a man were to participate in his execution (Deuteronomy 13:9; 17:7).<br/><br/>As an adaptation of Christie, I give the film a ""3."" If the novel did not exist, I would give the film a ""6."" The religious insensitivity of the first act seriously detracts from an otherwise quality product, the poor performances of Depp and Ridley notwithstanding."

","The film ""Murder on the Orient Express"" has been remade many times; the same story; the same setting; the same suspects, and this new installation in the 'remakes' of this film features an amazing lineup of cast members including Judi Dench, Kenneth Branagh and Johnny Depp. The film was directed by Kenneth Branagh himself, who also stars as the world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot, and was written by Michael Green who released three majorly successful films this year alone, in ""Blade Runner: 2049"", ""Logan"", and ""Alien Covenant"".<br/><br/>The film follows ""the best detective in the world"", Hercule Poirot, who must solve a sudden murder on the famous train, the orient express, with a wide range of suspects, motives and means. Kenneth Branagh gives his performance of Hercule Poirot, an intelligent (seemingly) OCD detective who separates right from wrong and serves justice to those via his deductive reasoning and ""little grey cells"", which is fantastic despite the shrub growing off his face (which eventually passes as unnoticeable). In fact, ""The Murder on the Orient Express"" emits spectacular performances from all cast members, who all manage to extract perfectly dramatic and interesting performances at appropriate times - particularly Josh Gad, who also starred as Olaf in ""Frozen"", who gave a great performance as Hector MacQueen. The script employs few physical action scenes, some of which are poorly choreographed or illogical, but supplies ample psychological action which is dramatic, bold and exciting. Set in a winter wonderland, the atmosphere is sufficient for this perfect crime which will entangle minds, including the great Hercule Poirot himself. The film is a great Agatha Christie adaptation which will suit audiences of all ages and preferences, and will not disappoint, despite trailer expectations."

"RforFilm","7","6","17","13 November 2017"," Well acted and visually sound, Murder on the Orient Express is a nice mystery that should make Agatha Christie fans satisfied
","I think it's been a while since we've seen a classic murder mystery film. What's interesting is that there's thousands of books, but not too many of them get adaptations let alone into film. Why? Their not easy to write and they manage to keep a lot of detail to plot and character in order to twist and turn the final answer of ""who did it"". I can only conclude that mystery seems to have a better life on television as in that medium, those elements can not only stretch further then a films runtime, but can probably better play around the viewers ideas on what's going on. <br/><br/>Given all of that, today's movie is a remake of Murder on the Orient Express, based off of the acclaimed novel by Agatha Christie. While I know she has written a large amount of books, her mysteries has been adapted countless times. What made Murder on the Orient Express (and what a lot of mysteries had incorporated) good was how tight and claustrophobic the situation was. It also had the luck of having Hercule Poirit, a detective with crazy attention to detail, to solve the mystery. While he hasn't had the same attention as Sherlock Holmes, he's made his stance has his journeys have filled over thirty novels. Let's see if Murder on the Orient Express can improve from the previous adaptions. <br/><br/>In 1934, Hercule Poirot (played by Kenneth Branagh) is about to embark on a much needed break after solving a recent mystery in Jerusalem. He is still under his oath that within most cases, there is only right or wrong. In needing to return to London, he's given a spot on the Orient Express, which seems to be fully booked. He's approached by an American businessman Samuel Ratchett (played by Johnny Depp) to work for him, but Poirot declines. The next morning, Ratchett is found to have been stabbed to death. <br/><br/>An avalanche has also derailed the steam engine, stranding the rest of the passengers. Poirot decides to take the case to curb his boredom. It's on this train he interviews all the suspects; wet nurse Pilar (played by Penélope Cruz), scientist Gerhard (played by William Defoe), the princess Dragomiroff (played by Judi Dench) accountant Hector (played by Josh Gad), Doctor Arbuthnot (played by Leslie Odom Jr.), traveler Caroline (played by Michelle Pfeiffer), and Mary (played by Daisy Ridley).<br/><br/>I better stop there as most mysteries are best when you know as little as possible. Kenneth Branagh is also in the director's chair for Murder on the Orient Express, and for what I expected, I was surprised. I haven't seen the original, nor have I read the book, but I can say I was intrigued, even if the story is a tad overstuffed. It's common for a lot of mysteries to have a lot of characters, but given what exactly is being solved, it may have benefited to cut two or three of the background characters in order to tighten everything. <br/><br/>Though even with the over abundance of characters, all the main actors shine, especially Kenneth Branagh, whose very likable and a fun guy to follow. His accent and tone has the right balance of over-the-top and subtle makes him seem like someone who could be that eccentric and smart. If I had to pick my other favorites, I'd say that they were Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who do a lot with the material their characters are given. That's not to put a damper on everyone else. This is compelling enough that it goes a long with the long dialogue.<br/><br/>Now for those expecting a lot of action will want to look elsewhere. Murder on the Orient Express is very dialogue heavy, as a lot of mysteries are. Where it can make up to curb boredom is the cinematography and editing. The movie is beautiful looking and contain the element of a grand scope feeling that most Kenneth Branagh movies have. Many of the flashbacks are shown which has a neat ""old Hollywood"" look to them that gives this movie a bigger sense on nostalgia. <br/><br/>I'll give this seven Orient Express trains out of ten. I can't fully embrace this as great piece of art, but I'm glad I saw Murder on the Orient Express. The imagery looks nice enough that I'd recommend that you view it on the big screen. If your not looking for something that is a definite slow burn, this isn't for you. Take the train and see if this kills for you."

","In 1934 world renowned detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is vacationing on the Orient Express as a means to relax his mind. Unfortunately, a man turns up murdered by some­one on their Calais Coach, and rather than let the local gendarmes at the next station flub their investigation, he decides to solve it him­self and hand it to them on a platter.<br/><br/>Based on an Agatha Christie novel by the same name—she being a whiz with words—the title bears considering. It seems to distance itself from any dualism: i.e. not life and death, but murder; not on and off but merely on; not Orient and Occident (East and West) but Orient only; and Express with­out any Impress.<br/><br/>Timothy Materer writes on *James Merrill's Apocalypse* that ""Merrill struggled with the limitations of dualism  In a journal of 1954, he addressed the way dualities interfere with our perception of reality: ¶""' in all circumstances we are deluged with interpretations, simplifications, falsifications of our experience, by reference to non-existent poles, life & death say, or any of the convenient dualities. We think in these terms, see life as Life—and at once it is simpler, slightly evaporated, on its way *away* from reality'."" (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 2000, 12).<br/><br/>An example of this in a train novel is the western *Night Passage*, by Norman A. Fox: ""Harbin asked,'You know him, Utica?'<br/><br/>""'I ought to, Curly. And I think I can tell you why he's here. He's been following me around for a long spell, trying to talk me out of the trail I ride. Now he's caught up with me again. Isn't that it, Grant? You spotted me from the train, so you came after me. You see, Curly, he's my brother. I'm Lee McLain—and he's Grant McLain.'<br/><br/>""Harbin said, 'The hell you say!'<br/><br/>""'That's it, Curly. The McLain tribe balanced up even—one owlhooter, one honest man.'<br/><br/>""'Lee and Grant,' Harbin said. 'You're funnin', Utica'<br/><br/>""'We were Missouri folks, Curly. Missouri was a split state while the war was on, so Pappy straddled the fence. He named his first son for Grant and his second son for Lee.'<br/><br/>""'This is straight, Utica?'<br/><br/>""'Straight as a string. Tie a can to him and send him down the mountain, Curly. We'll likely be shaking the dust of this place by sunup. It won't matter if he talks about this hide­out. And he won't talk any­way. He always tries to keep me in the clear.'<br/><br/>""'I dunno,' Harbin said with a shake of his head. 'This takes some thinking.'"" (New York: Dodd, Mead & Co., 1956, 136–7)<br/><br/>It's not a matter of us and them, but of us and us. Maybe. It's going to take some thinking. And if this example is any indication, the Orient Express detective has his work cut out for him.<br/><br/>The color scheme of ""Murder On"" is amorphous. Only two colors are used much: blue and red; and these but sporadically. There are blue panels on the train, and red lipstick, lights, and wine. Beyond that it's muted earth tones. The whole movie is a waste of a scenic journey, the diverse characters as bland as an unbroken field of snow.<br/><br/>Then we encounter the ""husband hunter"" Caroline Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer) who sports a purple dress (mixture of blue & red) and suddenly a single character amidst all the suspects is flagged, at least visually. But alas, the dancer, too, having blonde hair and red lip­stick wears an orange garment (combo of yellow & red). Since she's eliminated as a suspect on account of lacking the strength to knife the victim with such ferocity, the camera's attention to Mrs. Hubbard must have some significance other than her guilt or innocence. Her purple dress materialized right after dialog about the combining of two elements; that's all we can say.<br/><br/>However, there is noted a common saying in ""Night Passage"" about the combining of disparate elements: ""A forty-four barrel on a forty-five frame./ Never bet aces in another man's game."" The last line would indicate a winning hand that the card player for some reason doesn't want to play, but it's a reach to apply it here. This movie doesn't even mention the saying.<br/><br/>There is, though, a throwaway line at the end of ""Orient"", about the detective's next assignment, which also shows up in the ""Passage"" book. Poirot is being sent to ""Egypt, right on the bloody Nile."" In ""Passage"" one of the brothers involved in a three-way love triangle is said to have visited ""a river in Egypt called de nial.""<br/><br/>Poirot is portrayed as one smart detective, right up there with Sherlock Holmes, I'd say. And he's not bashful about his accomplishments. It's like (Eccl. 8:1) ""Who is as the wise man? And who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.""<br/><br/>This movie is well constructed, and it keeps us guessing until the end. I think Agatha Christie should be her own genre, because those novels all bear her stamp. However, this one is similar to a western I mentioned above, so perhaps one should keep an open mind. I liked Christie but haven't read but two of her novels. Maybe I'll read some more after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The actors also included Judi Dench, Leslie Odom, Jr, Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, William Dafoe, Josh Gad, and Daisy Ridley. They all worked well together and got along off-set, too.<br/><br/>Don't see this one for the scenery as it's hard to even tell when the B&W flashbacks occur, the colors are so muted. If you're looking for a detective yarn, though, this one will fill the bill."
"JamesHitchcock","9","6","17","10 November 2017"," Branagh Does It Again
","The famous detective Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express in Constantinople on a journey back to London. It is an iron rule of the detective genre that wherever a famous detective goes murder will follow in his or her footsteps, and so it proves here. While the train is passing through Yugoslavia one of the passengers, Edward Ratchett, is found stabbed to death. At first sight there seems to be an obvious solution to the crime. Ratchett was a dodgy antiques dealer, and had recently cheated some Italian gangsters by selling them bogus goods. As Poirot investigates, however, he begins to have his doubts as to whether this was the true motive for the murder. Several of the passengers, although they are of various different nationalities and belong to different social classes, seem to have links to the notorious Armstrong murder case. (A fictionalised version of the real-life Lindbergh baby case). Moreover, Ratchett himself may also have had something to do with that case.<br/><br/>It is, or seems to be, an iron rule of all cinematic genres that wherever Kenneth Branagh goes success will follow in his footsteps. (OK, forget the dreadful ""Wild, Wild West""). He began his career with an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" which can stand comparison with Olivier's and has since developed into Britain's greatest actor/director of recent years. In the nineties he directed and starred in what I regard as the best-ever adaptation of a Shakespeare comedy, ""Much Ado about Nothing"" and the best-ever adaptation of a Shakespeare tragedy, ""Hamlet"". His talents are not confined to Shakespeare. As director he was responsible for films as good as ""Peter's Friends"", ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" and ""Cinderella"". He has also acted in a number of other excellent films, including ""Othello"", ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"", ""Valkyrie"" and the recent ""Dunkirk"".<br/><br/>And now Branagh has done it again. He has turned his attention to Agatha Christie and, characteristically, the result is probably the best-ever Christie adaptation, better than any of the entries in the great Christie cycle of the seventies and eighties. As so often before, Branagh is both the film's director and its star. His Poirot is a re-invention of the character, rather different from the dapper little man played by David Suchet in the television series. That luxuriant moustache would perhaps be more appropriate to the late Victorian or Edwardian periods than to the 1930s- gentlemen in the inter-war years were generally either clean shaven or sported a small, neatly trimmed moustache- but Branagh may have adopted it as a way of distinguishing his character from Suchet's.<br/><br/>Poirot is normally thought of as a supremely rational individual who can solve any crime by the exercise of his ""little grey cells"" alone. (The phrase ""little grey cells"" has become as closely associated with Poirot as ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" with Sherlock Holmes). In Branagh's characterisation, however, he emerges as something more than a mere human calculating machine. He is not merely rational but also humane and compassionate, a man whose abilities as a detective owe as much to an empathetic understanding of human nature as they do to pure reason and who realises that, as La Rochefoucauld said, the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. The story's famous twist ending probably does not surprise him as much as it surprises us. He is also wise enough to realise that justice, in the true sense, does not always require punishment.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes some big names including the likes of Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi and Michelle Pfeiffer. All play their roles well, but because, Branagh himself apart, this is very much an ensemble effort, it would be difficult to single any of them out for special praise.<br/><br/>The action takes place in winter and the main drama- the crime and Poirot's investigation- takes place after the tracks have been blocked by an avalanche in the mountains. The train is halted atop a lofty trestle bridge, a wonderful piece of engineering yet at the same time looking flimsy and insecure. This setting enables Branagh to give his film a wonderful visual look, with the stark monochrome mountain scenery contrasting with the opulent luxury on board the train, but (in my view at least) it is also loaded with metaphorical meaning. The idea of a train (or ship, or coach, or bus) as a microcosm of human society is hardly an original one, but here Branagh seems to give it extra meaning. Our civilisation, with all its opulent luxury is supported by structures which are wonderfully engineered yet at the same time flimsy and insecure, even though they are all that stand between us and a plunge into the abyss.<br/><br/>I said earlier that this is probably the best-ever Christie adaptation. I'd go further. It's probably the best-ever cinematic whodunit. Branagh may, however, have a chance to surpass himself in this respect. At the end of the film we hear that Poirot has been called away to a case in Egypt. Does this mean that Branagh is planning his own version of ""Death on the Nile""? 9/10"
"classicsoncall","10","4","10","2 September 2018"," ""I do not approve of murder, my friend.""
","It's been a couple of years since I saw the Sidney Lumet directed version, so a definitive comparison between the two pictures is difficult to make. Both films have an exceptionally talented cast, so in that regard it's a toss-up. From what I can recall though, Albert Finney's portrayal of Hercule Poirot simply cracked me up with all the physical and facial contortions he went through to interpret the character. Kenneth Branagh comes across much more seriously, and his sarcastic barbs to characters that irritate him are done with dagger like precision. Like a lot of reviewers here, I thought the mustache business was a bit overdone, but the best was when we got a view of Poirot waking up wearing that mustache guard in place. Talk about vanity.<br/><br/>If this is one's first viewing of any of the filmed versions of the story, what comes across as coincidence defying probability is the connection that all the riders on the Orient Express share with an old kidnapping case that resulted in the death of a young child. The circumstances become clearer as the story unfolds, and it's done in credible fashion, so one's patience is rewarded. The resolution to the murder mystery aboard the train is one of Agatha Christie's writing triumphs, and is handled well, even after one of the train's passengers takes credit for the killing of Ratchett/Casetti (Johnny Depp).<br/><br/>I'm usually in tune with most reviewers in my estimation of a picture, but in this case, the relatively low score for this 'Murder' seems unjustified. True, director Kenneth Branagh probably gave himself more favorable screen time than necessary in the unfolding of the mystery, and some of the ancillary characters seem rushed. However the period detail and outstanding cinematography compensate for a lot, and Poirot's final verdict is rendered much more skillfully than Albert Finney was able to get away with. In this picture, it just felt right that no one would have to stand trial for murder, and if push came to shove, who would it have been anyway?"

I thought the film captured this well.<br/><br/>There are lots of cinematic shots of sunsets and snowy mountain passes that the train chugs its way along.
The camera often glides along the carriages capturing the occupants through foggy windows or inbetween luggage racks.<br/><br/>The acting and characters I thought were all at least adequate for the yarn - considering they needed to be quite sterotypical.<br/><br/>To enjoy this you have to put quite a lot of effort in yourself.

","For someone who had loved reading Agatha Christie's acclaimed novel - The Murder on The Orient Express, watching the characters come to life in a movie was a dream come true. We obviously expected a great deal from a movie based on the best-selling novel. The problem with making a movie based on a whodunit novel is that some people already know the entire plot. We ensured that we do not read up on the novel again, as to have no recollection of the novel & to judge the movie solely on its merit. We had to catch the 10.45PM show. Due to the movie being in its second week since release, there were three shows per day. The movie had to better be good to compensate for us staying up & travelling late. Kenneth Branagh stars as Agatha Christie's legendary Belgian detective - Hercule Poirot. He also dons the director's hat for the movie. The movie boasts of an ensemble cast which includes Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer & William Dafoe among others. The movie starts off with a Hercule Poirot prequel in 1934 Jerusalem. We are then transported to Istanbul, Turkey from where the famed Orient Express is scheduled to depart. We are then introduced to all the co-passengers (most of whom can shoulder a movie all by themselves). A day post departure, one of the characters is murdered & the trains get derailed due to a snowstorm. It is now up to Hercule Poirot to solve the mystery before the train is pulled to safety & the police arrives. The stage is set for a grand & engaging whodunit. The movie takes its time to get to the central plot, but once it does there never a dull moment. The post interval part will keep you guessing about the culprit. There are several characters with a motive to kill the victim, but who killed him is a question you will be left grappling with. Within the last ten minutes of the movie the killer is revealed. Only those who have read the novel, could have guessed it right. Kenneth Branagh has largely done character roles in the past & that bodes well for the movie. There is no baggage of previous roles. He carries out both his responsibilities – acting & directing very well. He gets into the skin of his character. He embodies all the eccentricities & mannerisms including the French accent of the legendary detective. Not for once will be able to detect his British descent. Post viewing the movie, Kenneth Branagh's face will pop up in your head every time Poirot is mentioned. We loved the cinematography by Haris Zambarloukos. The movie is a visual treat. The Orient Express is the train version of The Titanic. The train looks luxurious. Trivia: It is one of the few movies to be shot on 65mm film since the 1970's<br/><br/>The only issue we had with the movie is its ensemble cast. There are some amazing actors in the movie. You can't help but feel let down by how their talent has been unutilized. All the actors barring Branagh barely have a few scenes to display their histrionics on screen. The director could have just as well cast lesser known faces for these roles. Johnny Depp barely has 5-6 scenes in the movie & is not playing the lead as one might expect. What is an A-lister like him doing in a movie not revolving around him? But barring this once hiccup, the movie is an absolute delight. It keeps you at the edge of your seats. You will definitely not repent watching it. We suggest you watch it soon!"

But in saying that the time passed quickly and I found myself being surprised that it was over because I was so engrossed in it. Sure, some of the acting was was a little bit hammy, but the whole thing was visually stunning and honestly just thoroughly enjoying and captivating. K-Bran was excellent and the whole cast was just perfect I thought. At the very least this is an incredible ensemble film with some impeccable shots.

This movie version of Murder on the Orient Express is a gem! It's challenging to enjoy a ""whodunnit"" when you know who did it! Having read the book and seen a couple of movie versions of this story prepared me not to set my expectations too high. But Kenneth Branagh delivers as both the director and the main star.

Although I had my own theories, I was kept guessing throughout and I was still surprised the twists and turns throughout the plot. The fantastic choice of language and the fantastic portrayal of Poirot by Kenneth Branagh really helped pull it together.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is great. There are some well thought out angles used to portray an interesting perspective and some fantastic use of movement really emphasised the feeling of being on the train. The sets and costumes are also excellent which further emphasised the great use of environments, especially the train carriages themselves.<br/><br/>Some of the casting choices felt a little unnecessary, and there were some characters which really didn't get the screen time they deserved to really understand their stories.<br/><br/>Overall this was a great movie, and I can not speak for comparison to the original film.

Prolonged overhead camera work at times on the train, although understandable is very unsatisfying as you can't feel the atmosphere in the room by seeing peoples facial expressions or mouths moving. It did have me enthusiastically guessing throughout, but after 90 minutes I found my eyes wanting to close and no real incentive to keep them open."

The ride was all fine and good until the train gets stopped and the fact that someone was murdered on the trip.

Barangh does a great job at his role as Poirot and so do many of the other actors in their roles such as such as Odom and Ridley.<br/><br/>My big issue with the movie, however, has to do with the general story of the film. The overall story managed to feel too slow. To put this in perspective, I found the first act to be too long which to me felt like a sign of a slow movie.

"MaxHuskins","5","3","7","13 November 2017"," High budget trash and an absolute waste of time.
","A perfect example of high budget crap. The only thing this movie gets right is the marketing. (Pat your selves on the back creative team behind that, you did a good job and are most likely responsible for 50% of the box office behind this movie.) I felt as it was an absolute waste of my time. This is a high budget movie, filled with top billing actors which are the only two saving graces of the film. It all starts off with an extremely slow first act, filled with pointless character introductions and equally pointless CGI shots. Opening act feels as if someone watched a bunch of old movies thinks a movie is supposed to be but manages to entirely miss the point. This movie has perhaps some of the worst writing I've seen since Suicide Squad and actually shares a lot of traits with it. An ensemble of famous people who play a bunch of over the top but flat and boring characters. It really is the Suicide Squad of non- superhero movies. Out of like 13 people not a single character stands out or feels human. A bunch of loud douchebags. Everyone is written over the top and robotic. I can't blame it on the actors when the script is at fault but you could've just as easily cast Tommy Wiseau and have him run around and yell ""I did nawt kill her, I did nawwt"". The whole plot revolves around a separate crime that we as an audience do not care about in the least. The main character Hercule (I had to look up the names to write this) feels like a cheap Sherlock Holmes and completely fails to portray the ""careless genius"" who is superior to everyone (also who reads Dickens, which makes it worse). They try to establish him as the greatest detective in an opening scene that is so basic and predictable that I as a viewer ""solved the crime"" minutes before the answer is presented, at which we were supposed to be impressed. The casting itself was terrible, they just shoved any A-lister who would say yes with a bonus of an unnecessary amount of bad accents. The rest of the characters were so forgettable I'm not even gonna bother telling you about any of them. The mystery itself felt bland and disconnected. I did not feel engaged at all throughout the movie and kept looking at my clock. The murder, all the clues and revelations felt like they were just dragging out the movie. It was in fact so bland that the Doctor Who interpretation of The Orient Express was just as good if not better. The movie tried to have some comedic moments most of which fell extremely flat. However, the biggest red flag for me was the fact that I was laughing out loud at some of the most serious and important scenes of the movie - including it's revelation and conclusion. I mean there's nothing more hilarious than a character barging into a serious scene with a gun yelling ""NO, I'M THE KILLER!"" Finally, the conclusion of the movie was not only predictable and boring (ruined a great premise/twist though) but just down right stupid. It even featured a possible sequel set up. (Which isn't gonna happen cause this movie flopped). I could keep on ranting about how much I didn't like this movie for a long time, but I'll spare you from it. You want to hear the good? Well, the cinematography was pretty good, also the costumes were great. That's about it. So, if you want to go see an excellent movie that features a train, go watch The Darjeeling Limited, thank Wes and I later. P/S What was up with that ""Last Supper"" shot near the end? I sighed out loud at it.<br/><br/>⭐️ 5/10 - Maybe watch it on a plane if there's nothing better to do? - 5/10 ⭐️"

It has to be said that the plot is massively contrived and the whole thing sags somewhat in the middle, but the cast and direction make the work eminently watchable. <br/><br/>Heading the cast is Kenneth Branagh as the Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot and he is splendid in his clever deductions, while it is a special pleasure to see the return to the screen of Michelle Pfeiffer who is particularly good in a cast-list that also includes male stars Johnny Depp, Willem Dafoe & Derek Jacobi and female talent such as Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley & Penélope Cruz. The director is Branagh who offers us a flashy production with lots of soaring camera-work and plenty of colour and noise."
"binapiraeus","10","6","19","2 December 2017"," A bold venture that became a stunning movie
","Being a lifelong Agatha Christie fanatic, and of course having seen the magnificent 1974 version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" literally dozens of times, I was very curious to see what Mr Branagh, who had actually been bold (not to say crazy) enough to attempt a remake of it, had made out of it. I tried to go into it with an open mind, yet sure that it simply CANNOT be as good as the original. Well, I was mistaken: at some points, it's even better, unbelievable as this may sound. <br/><br/>Where he deems it adequate, Branagh makes some changes and additions, like the very first scene set in Jerusalem, where he also introduces himself with an enormous moustache (make no mistake: Dame Agatha had actually described Poirot many times as having a really big and extravagant moustache!), the fixed idea that his breakfast eggs should have exactly the same size, and a twinkle in his eye. <br/><br/>Then we get to know the first suspects - familiar territory for those who have seen the 1974 movie or read the book, but with a new twist: Colonel Arbuthnot is now a black doctor, which adds a nice note to his romance with Mary Debenham. Then the Istanbul train station - one of those moments where the new version surpasses the old one. A genuine Turkish chaos, through which Poirot, his friend Bouc and the other travellers have to make their way to the train. <br/><br/>We meet Mrs Hubbard - and very soon we stop comparing Michelle Pfeiffer to Lauren Bacall; she's different, but she's just as good. Ditto the other passengers; in some cases, Branagh sticks closer to the book than Lumet had done, and the casting in each case is brilliant. Then the train sets out on its journey - magnificent shots of it moving out of the station and into nowhere. As the plot unfolds, we see familiar elements mixed with breathtakingly beautiful outdoor scenes; while Lumet had decided to keep the whole thing confined to the claustrophobic atmosphere of the train compartments, Branagh enjoys making us see things from various internal and external angles. No matter which approach you prefer, they're both brilliant. <br/><br/>The only thing critics might claim as a minus is that Branagh's Poirot is perhaps a little bit too heroic, even to the point of personally fighting off and pursuing attackers; scenes that were never in the book, but in this day and age a movie probably simply can't do without them anymore. Anyway, as for the portrayals of the famous Belgian detective: while David Suchet simply WAS Poirot, Branagh, just like Finney and Ustinov before him, creates his OWN Poirot - a new version, but a most lovable one. And Branagh does a great job both as actor and as director - after having watched this movie I'd go as far as to say that, actually, he's a genius. <br/><br/>Unless you're totally biased and unwilling to accept new approaches to classic works of literature (like the many different Shakespeare productions that are being played all over the world), chances are you are going to be very much impressed by this uniquely bold and beautiful remake."

","""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a nice look at how mysteries were solved by detectives in an era which had limited technology, as compared to the ultra-modern world of today, which has GPS trackers, hackers, and so many technology-based tools to assist the current detectives.<br/><br/>Please, do not rely on the unnecessary and negative reviews given by many critics for this movie, who are unfairly comparing the film to Agatha Christie's original novel / book story. It is very challenging and brave to make a movie based on a novel and an author so popular, that more than half of the people living on earth know the original story. Yet, actor-director Kenneth Branagh has dared to accomplish this challenging task. Mr Branagh has done an excellent job, both as a director and an actor.<br/><br/>Mr K. Branagh has taken a different approach to convey the mystery by changing a few elements and characters ; this has given this movie (and the story) a fresh touch. Kenneth Branagh has played the great Belgian detective Poirot himself.His performance is brilliant, and he has given the character of Poirot a realistic touch. Johnny Depp shines again in the role of a suspicious crook. Penelope Cruz is quite seductive and plays her role very well.

","Based on the Agatha Christie 'who done it' classic novel, set in 1930's. Staring a magnificent moustache, and co-staring / directed by Kenneth Branagh who plays the genius detective Hercule Poirot. <br/><br/>Set in the limited space of a lavish, luxury train with some really long tracking shots that illustrates the confined atmosphere. At the beginning the passengers slowly assemble at the station, there's a period of character building similar to the film 'Titanic'. The train sets off, we see that Hercule just wants to take a holiday but there's a murder on the train and he's unable to switch off from being the master detective. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the train is stuck by an avalanche and this gives Hercule the opportunity to piece together the evidence. Everyone's a suspect and it turns out have a connected motive. During Hercule's interviewing we learn that everyone' circumstances are connected as well. <br/><br/>The avalanche is cleared and the train reaches its destination. Hercule is met by a military officer and is rushed away to Egypt, a reference to a very possible next film. <br/><br/>With a truly amazing 'A' list cast, this is an instant, old style classic, shot in 65mm really enhances the cinematography, production and costume design. A treat if you're not familiar with this classic novel and don't know the outcome. Recommended."

I think rather that it is a ""big name"" cast, and one that proves that big names do not guarantee great acting.

"Lugo1989","8","4","11","17 November 2017"," Agatha Christie fans might be disappointed, others who don't know the story might like it
","Murder on the Orient Express is a classic detective novel by Agatha Christie released in 1934 featuring the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. There have been quite a few film adaptations of the novel, the most known probably directed by Sidney Lumet in 1974.<br/><br/>Everyone who have read the novel might not be too excited about this film version. Kenneth Branagh does a good job playing the famous detective but if you are used to David Suchet's Poirot, better prepare yourselves to see something different here.<br/><br/>The film itself is very well made, the photography is beautiful, as well as the costumes, all the acting stars do not disappoint and the story is nicely presented. When closing credits start rolling it says ""Based upon the novel by Agatha Christie"" and I think it is important to keep that in mind. It is simply a version of the story and the detective imagined by the director and the writer of this film so not every single detail from the novel is followed. With that being said, it is still a nice viewing experience. I would especially recommend it to all of you not familiar with the story, I believe you will enjoy it."
"stevendbeard","7","4","11","11 November 2017"," Thinking Man's Workout
","I saw ""Murder on the Orient Express"", starring Kenneth Branagh- Dunkirk, Wild Wild West_1999; Johnny Depp-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Dark Shadows_2012; Michelle Pfeiffer-Mother!, Dark Shadows_2012 and Daisy Ridley-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, Lifesaver. This is a remake of the 1974 movie that is based on an Agatha Christie novel she wrote in 1934. She wrote quite a few books about an observant detective named Hercule Poirot, a Belgium version of Sherlock Holmes-she also wrote about a character named Miss Marple or something like that but I did not read them. I remember reading and being a fan of her books on Hercule Poirot when I was growing up. This movie is directed by Kenneth Branagh-Cinderella_2015, Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Thor-who also stars as the famous detective. Kenneth is taking a trip on the Orient Express train traveling from Istanbul to Paris with 13 other passengers-all quite recognizable actors. Johnny, Michelle and Daisy are some of the passengers, all of which have secrets that come to light when one of the 13 turns up dead. Boy, it's lucky that they have the world's greatest detective on board to help solve the case. One of the passengers was involved in a baby kidnapping that took place 5 years earlier. This movie is not an action packed shoot em up but more of a thinking man's workout for your brain, although there is a little physical fisticuffs and some gun play. Oh yeah, I must mention Kenneth's mustache; It is rather big and very well groomed-he sleeps with a mask over it to protect it. At the end of the movie, there is a set up for the next one, Death on the Nile-that is, if this one makes money. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. As I said earlier, I am a fan and enjoyed it enough to buy it on DVD."

The only one incident when Trailer is much better than a movie..."
"jvdesuit1","1","2","4","2 December 2019"," To make a movie you have to understand the character of Poirot: Branagh didn't.
","I have not seen the movie and although Branagh is a famous actor without any possible discussion, by reading the 2 quotes from the dialog here, it shows that he did not understand the character of Poirot and what Agatha Christie really wanted to say thru this great novel.
If I dont mistake Christie did not like Poirot. So she personified in him a kind of macho, misogynist man. He's very proud of his skills as a detective and thinks he will never fail to bring the culprit to his judges. He's also more or less a true catholic. The first error which appears on the first quote is to think that Poirot will listen to his heart. He listens to what is right or wrong and wont fail to do so in all the novels the author wrote; it is an error to make of Poirot another Miss Marple.
The second error is to believe that Poirot will justify himself like the second quote tends to show. He is too proud and his inner debate is for himself and no one else. He will never justify his actions before anyone.
Those two traits of character were superbly shown in the David Suchet's impersonation of Poirot in the television series. There was something of that too in Sydney Lumett's movie although the movie tends more to be a spectacular super production with an extraordinary cast difficult to equal today.Even the music of the film was spectacular with it's theme in the rhythm of waltz punctuating the sound of the locomotive and the rails, and somehow referring to the decadence of the period the late thirties and the horrors impending later.
The television adaptation has a great cast but not really movie stars like Widmark,Finney,Cassel, Bacall and others in the movie.
In the television production Poirot gives us the date of the action: 1936. The book was published in 1934 and make reference to the Lingbergh kidnap case of 1932. But may be that already Christie had some doubts about the political events going on after Hitler's and the Nazis coming to power in 1933. Justice is more and more torn to pieces by those monsters. This revolts Poirot. The ending of the television production is by far in accordance with the character and the way Christie judged Poirot. Poirot for the only time in his life has lost his case in his eyes."
"resireg","1","2","4","4 November 2019"," Worst remake ever!
","I loved the 1974 version of that story directed by Sidney Lumet. Back then, the stroy was plausible, and the characters were interesting and the plot males sense. In the 2017 version, I was expecting to see the same characters, but unfortunately some were simply replaced in prder to fill some affirmative action quota I imagine.<br/><br/>The historical innacuracies are immense, for example the fact that you had black and white interracial couple on the train, and the black man was a ""respectable"" doctor who was some sort of soldier before. The strory doesn't fit, since in order to go to medical school (which was way more elitist back then), you needed years on prep school or private tutoring. Besides, there were black doctors in the US, bit they were part of an elite, and attended the Historical Black colleges and Universities. Talking about affirmative atcion in tye movie, in the end we see a very dark skinned black soldier posing as Yugoslavian, a nation so intolerant that they were killing their own neighbours because of a different accent (most recently in the 90s, especially Bosnia).<br/><br/>Then, we had a Hungarian Prince married to a Jewess girl, when in nobility, we know that interreligious weddings are gery often forbidden (in the UK, there are rules against an Anglican marrying a Catholic for example). That didn't happened then, and even nowadays there ar no incidents of interfaith families in the high nobility (by the room he got, we see the prince was a hot shot).<br/><br/>Then there are the German bashing moment that every Hollywood movie insist when in the year 1934, the country was still a democracy, and the references to ""the war"" are annoyingly every minute, when Agatha Christie's books deal mostly with the upper classes, who are not involved in conflicts.<br/><br/>Again, the director includes some token characters: a mexican chauffer, a german assistant, and a Russian countess, who were almost absent from the plot, and could be better used. There are action scenes that are totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>
In short, the movie sucks!"

"SimonJack","3","2","4","14 June 2018"," A different Orient Express, far inferior
","One wondered if and when someone might take ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" and turn it into a modern, fast-action thriller. Well, this 2017 rendition by 20th Century Fox does just that. Only it still takes place in the 1930s. Except for the supposed setting, it's updated to modern production methods as a vehicle to sate the adrenalin rush needs of a chunk of modern society. <br/><br/>While the plot resembles Agatha Christie's original, it has a huge cast with many more characters. Among them are a priest, a rabbi and an imam. The Orient Express no longer appears as the exclusive train service it was. The dining car looks like the inside of a fast food restaurant - stark, plain and modern. A funny scene has most of the suspects seated, just one or two to a table, in the dining car. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh directed this film and starred as Hercule Poirot. Fox and company shot for a big-name cast but couldn't even come close to the 1974 film with the main characters. The only big names of the principals are Johnny Depp as Ratchett, Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard and Judi Dench as an aged princess. Some other well-known stars had new roles created for this film but with no tie to the original. They include Penelope Cruz, Derek Jacobi, and Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>Branagh's Poirot appears more to be a dashing 21st century detective with a clownish mustache. The mustache is so outlandish and broad one could hang a hat on either end. Agatha Christie gave Poirot a large mustache, but the one in this film looks more like the horns of a longhorn steer. True to the modern need for speed and action, this one has gun shooting, an avalanche and a derailment, outdoor action around the train, and CGI that all but flashes the message, ""this isn't real.""<br/><br/>One can't fault actors for wanting to play in a new rendition of a great film and story. But when the story takes on a different life and the setting departs so much from the feel and sense of original, everyone misses out. The feel of the cast is 21st century, not that of people living in the 1930s. The opportunity to compare performances with those before is lost. <br/><br/>The design for this film seems obvious - to garner the viewing and cash of an audience driven by an insatiable desire for action. With the 2010 ITV production that starred David Suchet, and the original 1974 classic films so well done for Christie's novel, it would have been foolish for anyone to try to match or outdo them. But, something different and quirky just might appeal to a different audience. Apparently, this film did that - for some, but not nearly enough to have it rate alongside - or even near the two great productions of ""Murder on the Orient Express."""

"SaibalBandopadhyay","Null","2","4","14 February 2018"," A visual treat devoid of precision
","To begin with, 'Murder on the Orient Express', in general, is an absolute treat to the eyes for its cinematography, the acting and the music score. It creates that dramatic flair that good movies have in tthem. However, for those who have read the book of the same name by the genius, Agatha Christie, the movie is definitely a step down in terms of content. Nothwithstanding the fact that it is not possible to include every little detail of the book into the movie, but it did feel as if the movie missed out on certain key moments which was quite an important part of the book. The movie began really strongly, with a precise portrayal of the famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, the colourful visual setting and certain other nits and bits did altogether set the stage for a truly pleasing next 100 minutes or so. Tha being said, once the characters were introduced and settled and the movie really picked pace, ironically, it somehow was inconsistent in its approach. It changed pace quite bizzarely and almost rushed too quickly to the end, leaving lots of important moments to the book only. On the brighter side, the performance of Kenneth Branagh, who also is the director of the movie, was really impressive and I never had any difficulties picturing him as the Hercule Poirot, so much loved in the book. He did carry the movie on his shoulders throughout the middle portion. Great support from Penelope Cruz, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench and co. provided with some sort of flair to the movie. One slight blemish that kind of stuck out like a sour thumb was Johnny Depp's performance. In general, I rate him very highly as an actor, and he had treated us with some outstanding performances over the years, but, and it's just a personal inference, he in his recent movies, his acting has becoma quite monotonous and predictable. His voice always takes me back to the Jack Sparrow days and sometimes it helps me liking him more in the movie, but on this particular film, it was more a nuisance than a relief. The movie has it's fair share of inconsistencies, but it all faded away during the final moments, especially in the final couple of scenes. The way it has been put forward is a visual treat and is largely responsible for making this movie from a ""onetime thing"" to a geniunely good movie.
To sum up the movie in a sentence, it is good, but less than its potential."

The only problem is that the characters are little more than facades. They are surfaces without interiors. While it's impressively beautiful, there isn't any blood pumping through this story. It begins with Branagh and his crazy mustache. It's an artifice in place of real character work. It also draws attention away from any real work.

This remake though is at best a Sunday afternoon film on a rainy day - certainly there is not enough to it for it to be able to justify its place in the cinema or as a big blockbuster film. Of course the cast and quality of the production would tell you otherwise, and it is impressive for what it puts on the screen, but it is what it does (or doesn't) do with it that is the problem.<br/><br/>The film has a playfulness to it, but mostly it seeks to have weight to the performances and scenario. It lays it on a bit thick in this regard, resulting in the film feeling a bit dull because it carries itself heavy, but doesn't justify it or make it work. Individual parts are fine, and the film does have plenty to look at, but as a whole it is surprisingly leaden, lacking real suspense, zip, and vigor.

Audiences in cinemas here are laughing most of the film whenever all those high mountains appear on the screen. Even Ms. Christie (way before Internet) gave exact description of the area.

This could have been a modern day ensemble cast re-telling of a classic tale. But thanks to Brannaugh, it instead was a complete and unnecessary overhaul of a great story for the worse.

","I know. I KNOW. Ever since seeing the trailer for the mystery thriller ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" a question has been nagging at you. It's not who among a diverse array of actors including Judi Dench as a Russian princess, Willem Dafoe as a German professor, Penelope Cruz as a depressed missionary and Johnny Depp as a thuggish art dealer, is the killer. But why has a small furry mammal disguised as a magnificent beast of a handlebar mustache in 50 shades of silvery gray taken up residence under Kenneth Branagh's nose?<br/><br/>The hair apparent seems specifically designed to practically steal every scene it appears in during this sumptuous yet ultimately stuffy and overstuffed big-screen return visit to Agatha Christie's most durable novel. It's even responsible for the film's best sight gag. If Branagh, the star and director behind the 21st-century digitally-enhanced stab at bringing this ensemble vehicle back to life wanted to make a statement to distinguish this take on his world-famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot from any other, he certainly has. In the 1974 movie adaptation helmed by Sidney Lumet, Albert Finney sported a pert black swatch with Dali-esque twirls at the ends. Boring, right? Branagh's fuzzy wuzzy is like an ocean wave of whiskers, from ear to shining ear. Best supporting player? That honor goes to that dashing splash of a soul patch on his chin.<br/><br/>OK, I am stalling. Let's accentuate the positive first. The script by Michael Green (""Blade Runner 2049"") does a bang-up job of introducing us to Poirot, a fuss-budget stickler who demands perfectly cooked four-minute eggs and tsk-tsks their imperfect dimensions-and then doesn't even bother to eat them. He is a control freak who insists on balance in everything, from how a tie sits around a man's neck to impeccably baked bread. The place is Jerusalem (actually, Malta as a stand-in) and the year is 1934. Poirot is at the Wailing Wall about to deliver the solution to a crime tied to three clerics of different faiths and a stolen artifact. With the showbiz panache of a Vegas magician, he reveals the perpetrator with an unexpected flourish involving a cane. That sends the message, ""Hey, this could be fun.""<br/><br/>But matters get perfunctory rather quickly when fellow passengers whose baggage clearly includes secrets begin to pop up, including Daisy Ridley (Rey in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") as a porcelain-skinned governess and Leslie Odom Jr. (Aaron Burr in Broadway's ""Hamilton"") as a doctor who attempt to disguise they are an interracial couple. Those marquee credits are bound to draw in the under-30 demographic. But, alas, the only fully fleshed-out being turns out to be Poirot, who moons over a portrait of a lost love and undergoes an existential crisis of sorts when he finds himself unexpectedly confounded when a dead body turns up on the train with an even dozen stab wounds. The luxury locomotive traveling from Istanbul to Calais also comes to a halt about a half-hour in when an avalanche causes it to stop in its tracks atop a dangerous trestle. I wish I could say that the storyline at least picks up steam, but it never quite does especially since it devolves into a series of private interrogations by the imperious Poirot in a cafÃ© car.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer does what she can as a man-hungry rich widow searching for her next husband. Derek Jacobi and Josh Gad conspire as a valet and assistant to Depp's scar-faced hoodlum. Other performers barely have the presence or enough dialogue to make much of an impression including the incredibly talented Olivia Colman as Dench's lady in waiting. In addition, there are veiled allusions to the 1932 kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's baby son, which few besides history buffs will recognize today.<br/><br/>Branagh, the actor, comes through unscathed. Branagh, the director, not so much. He did wonders with making Shakespeare relevant for young audiences with his ""Henry V"" and found a way to make Disney's live-action ""Cinderella"" seem fresh and new. But despite camera trickery with ineffective overhead shots and a long one-take scene as Poirot boards the moving train, there is too little levity and cleverness afoot, especially with a cast whose talent is barely tapped. The key isn't whodunit but how you do it.<br/><br/>However, that mustache-which even grows limp and messy when matters get dicey for Poirot-deserves a place in the pantheon of great follicle-ly enhanced performances. Perhaps it could sit alongside George Clooney's waxed-to-perfection facial accoutrement in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" As for ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" it squeaks by as passable entertainment by just a hair."

Judy Dench, Derek Jacobi and Johnny Depp were as good as always, but I found Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Caroline Hubbard unconvincing. The plot is interesting, if implausible, and the look of the film is fine, although the CGI images of the train moving through the Carpathian(?)

Story is as it says in the title, as our legendary sleuth tries to decipher an impossible murder of a despicable character.<br/><br/>With a stellar cast, modern filming techniques and a decent budget, surely Kenneth Branagh can't go wrong? Yes & No.<br/><br/>The problem is that it seems that this is all a jamboree for friends to get together and have a dress party, which in part is the truth. For most there was little effort needed to play their parts, although for some of the more notable names it was hardly a difficult task anyhow.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is actually the weakest part. Yes, he can act and has the credits to prove it. Yet here, he does so much wrong. His accent is jarring and quite comical, his moustache is a little overdone and again a comical distraction. His acting too is a bit overwrought, but maybe the script didn't help him out. Should have been tailored more for him and the screen.<br/><br/>I was simply disappointed in this one.

This remake is an interesting try, with good casting, amazing photography and very good acting from Kenneth Branagh. It is clear a great challenge to play this role after David Suchet, who's by far my favorite Poirot of all times and the most talented Peter Ustinov, and, in my opinion Branagh interpreted Poirot in a fresh way, focusing on his wits instead of supporting its ""caricature"" side. Of course Agatha Christie at her books praised this features of her detective, but even though, the main power of Hercule Poirot always was his little gray cells and his upright character, qualities that Kenneth Branagh brought to life successfully.<br/><br/>However, I cannot give more than 6 stars because of that almost unbearable,dreadful mustache! Whose idea was that and Why?
Please, if there's another movie, spare us from this mustache.

Why not just go one small step further, change the name and be done with it.<br/><br/>While Poirot was snobby, proud to a fault and at times arrogant (but never attention seeking as that's not how gentleman behaves), this version just seems like more of a overacted parody version of him.
First nails to the coffin was the egg-scene.. Enough about that. The next was the ""step in pile of poo"".. Jeez!!! And from there thing really started spiraling down! One of the last and biggest nails to the coffin was a serious physical altercation between ""Poirot"" and a other passanger. Hercule Poirot was, to say it bluntly, obese. Despite his years in police force while younger, he really had none of the fitness left in him. He actually suffered from it and was forced to take health vacation to lose weight. In this movie, ""Poirot"" fights like Crouching Tiget and runs stairs up and down without breaking a sweat... Again, total, absolutely opposite of the original material.

It should be a wrestle of the minds on observations and logical deductions against the smoke and mirrors of deception. The test of skills for filmmakers and script writers of this kind is to fool the audience in such a way that makes revelationary sense when the truth is revealed. This is not the case for Kenneth Branagh who is both the director and the star who played the famous detective Hercule Poirot. He in his character is too eager to pontificate like a running Wikipedia with mustache with his knowledge on the back story of the Armstrong murder as if he wrote the scripts to both murders past and present. The audience is left passively in the backseat like some numb and mindless spectators to this sport-event like commentary. This isn't how a detective film should be. However, if you decided that it isn't a detective film but a film that questions moral justice over legal justice, the film does present that as a case for Poirot to solve and he solves it quickly in which moral justice prevails. In that sense, the film is not entirely heartless.

However, I see this not because this is somewhat of a cliched ending but rather, the modern day filmgoer is a lot more aware and has seen so much more twists that this is somehow expected. Hence, perhaps what should have been considered is whether this is a good idea to readapt this film that may be al little out of its time nowadays. <br/><br/>However, in spite of this issue the modern day rendition had brilliant set pieces and magnificent camera work followed by brilliant acting that makes this certainly an enjoyable viewing experience. But indeed, storywise I did not find it so intriguing, especially towards the end of the film and that really shouldn't be the case in a crime/mystery drama."
"huginn-74819","9","6","20","6 November 2017"," A must see of 2017
","What I liked about this movie is that Branagh has managed to add action and humor to the story without spoiling the claustrophobic and mysterious atmosphere of the original novel. The care for the details is great, the movie it's shot on 65mm film, not everyone like this, but I find it very interesting. In general, I enjoyed the whole cast, but some impressed me more than others.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh. I like his Poirot, I know that everyone is fond of previous versions but I've always found Poirot's past interpretations too ""two-dimensional"" and repetitive...Branagh has managed to make Poirot a more ""human"" character. And even though many criticize his mustache, I found them much more reasonable than those ridiculous little mustaches that I always see on Poirot's face.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp. I know that lately he's not in his best shape, but it's still Johnny Depp and his sharp smiles are an happy vision for those who have always loved his films. Dame Judy Dench: She is always a guarantee and a living reminder of the blessing that theatrical actors are for cinema.<br/><br/>Penelope Cruz: her transformations have always fascinated me, her acting has a peculiarity that goes beyond the simple ""exotic"" charm of her beauty and accent.<br/><br/>Sergei Polunin. The camera simply loves this guy. I really enjoyed the documentary about his story, Dancer, and in a real movie he didn't disappoint my expectations. He has a magnetic charm and an intensity of expression that remain impressed and he was able to emerge even in a minor role among so many big stars. I hope to see soon Polunin in roles that give him more freedom of expression.<br/><br/>Daisy Ridley: To be honest I hated the new Star Wars film, so I'm happy to saw her in a totally different context much more suitable to her recitation skills.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you, like me, feel real joy in seeing that you always disagree with this pseudo-intellectual critics who are just waiting to destroy movies like this just to show everyone how intelligent and alternative they are, Murder on the Orient Express is the movie for you!"

","First, the mustache. Yes, it's a little strange even for our modern hipster friendly culture. But after its initial shock and awe, it became more of a set piece, always in view but not obtrusively so. Second, the accent. I don't know if any of these other ""reviewers"" have even been to Belgium or have ever spoken to someone from Belgium, but Poirot's accent in the movie is damn close to other Belgian (meaning french) accents I have heard in person. Third, holy crap its a good movie. I was completely entranced through the entire film. I was planning on having a few drinks while watching, like I always do when watching a film (I find it relaxing, a break from the everyday for me). But when this movie was finished, my first drink was still completely full as I was too engrossed in the story to to even touch it. Seriously, if this movie can keep me so entertained as to not even finish a drink during it, its got to be something special."

You feel the cold where the train is stopped by an avalanche. You feel the tension of each passenger, and slowly the story comes together. Watch the credits - the beautiful song at the end is written by Branagh and sung by Michelle Pfeiffer - a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this film - a delight to watch."

"habitaciondeduvi","9","4","12","24 November 2017"," Better than I expected
","This film I think has become a clear example in which bad criticism and low score makes when you go to see you take a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>Yes, it has its negative points. Example of this are some scenarios in which clearly the use of technology or some jokes that Hercules Poirot makes and do not seem to end up fitting with the character.<br/><br/>But the plot, as well as being a very good adaptation of the novel, makes you want to stay stuck to the screen from start to finish. The use of the camera from the ceiling in some moments is a good strategy to indicate the lack of space in the car-bed, getting a somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere, but believable, gives the feeling of being on a train.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is incredible and the dialogues, especially at the end of the film, reflect everything the characters feel."
"dragonwarrior-94899","8","4","12","18 November 2017"," A fresh air of mystery
","Yes, I admit it. It was not what I expected. But, still, the movie was far from a disappointment.<br/><br/>Starting from the plot, anyone can point out how slow paced it is. But let's not forget that it is based on a mystery novel and books are nothing but slow until it reaches the action. I have not read any book from Agatha Christie neither I have seen any old TV stories/movies based on Christie's works, but I can say that it was a full story with a start,middle and an end. No any unanswered questions (ok,maybe this one,how the heck did they walked around in the snowy place with these light outfits?), not any crazy plot twists. The ending was somewhat predictable from me. I really liked the small actions scenes, especially the use of the walking cane.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the colours, the setting, the outfits... Each one is unique on it's own way.<br/><br/>Regarding the music, there are some nice pieces there. Not something fancy with a variety of chords and basses, just something simple to fit the era and feel the mystery.<br/><br/>Talking about the cast, the acting is not something ""special"" but some faces are really fitting to the luxury of the train. Some had more screen time than others but none of them had enough to cover in their shade the protagonist. Although, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo got lost somewhere in the background.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, the one only Hercule Poirot. Kenneth Branagh shined in the role especially in the final confrontation with the murderer. The character is not like the ""modern"" detectives like Downey's Sherlock or Cumberbatch's high-functioning sociopath. He created a humane character,calm and imposing who follows the old fashioned crime-solving by interrogating and counting on clues and rather than making crazy deductions. I had no problem with the enormous double mustache. It gave to Poirot a kind of charm.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a classic story with an amazing lead and a rather impressive cinematography created an underrated movie. It definitely deserves a sequel and I would love seeing Branagh reprising again the role of Hercule Poirot. The movie industry needs more classic stories with this kind of direction, more trains, mustaches and more walking canes in action :P. And, please, don't read these negative reviews. Go watch the movie yourself and make your opinion."

","I was a huge fan of Kenneth Branaugh's early work. He was a fantastic director and made such great movies as Dead Again, Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing - but after he starred in the pitiful Wild, Wild West he seemed to disappear.<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is a Branaugh vehicle. Branaugh is fantastic in the film and his direction is spot on. This is Branaugh showing what he once showed in the past.<br/><br/>While this movie has an all-star cast - Branaugh carries the entire film. Everyone has a fine contribution to the movie, but make no mistake Branaugh raises the bar on this film.<br/><br/>Well worth watching."

","Kenneth branagh revamps the portrayal of perfectionist detective Hercule Poirot in a new take of Murder On The Orient Express and does not disappoint with an amazing cast and visuals while still nailing the books story without making it feel like a pointless second adaptation for the big screen. although feeling like branagh could have made us feel a little more emotionally attached to the characters the movie has very few faults and manages to nail the story although making minor changes to the ending and still leaves room for a possible sequel to another Hercule Poirot mystery case."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Who doesn't love a good whodunit? Don't we all find a bit of guilty pleasure in being the mastermind who solves a fictitious murder case? Has anyone ever been better at crafting an intricate murder mystery than Agatha Christie? Why all the questions? Well, that's nothing compared to what ""probably the world's greatest detective"", Hercule Poirot, must answer amidst the foul play aboard the sleek, luxurious, and snowbound Orient Express.<br/><br/>This latest film version has Michael Green (BLADE RUNNER 2049, LOGAN) with the adapted screenplay and Kenneth Branagh directing and starring as the fabulously mustachioed Poirot (with his own take on the iconic super-sleuth). Like the near-perfect 1974 version, this latest adaptation succeeds in capturing the theatricality, while avoiding any stodgy staginess. Director Branagh shot on film and it pays off in both the stunning snow-covered mountains and landscapes, as well as the tight, precisely-blocked interior shots around the exceptional set designs.<br/><br/>Fans of the novel will notice some shifting of character names, professions and backgrounds, although the vast majority of the story remains intact  including the early murder that occurs not long after the film ingeniously introduces us to each of the characters. The cast is strong and deep, and in addition to Mr. Branagh, features: Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Dame Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Lucy Boynton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Olivia Coleman, Sergei Polunin, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo. All are suspects – well, except the victim.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the novel or seen a previous version, know that the fun is in ride. Follow along as Poirot dispenses zingers throughout, while maintaining a most precise commitment to balance in all things. He is an exacting and fastidious man, and as entertaining as he is skilled in crime solving. Note that the photograph he keeps of his one true love Katherine, is actually a photo of young Emma Thompson (Branagh's real life wife). Enjoy keeping track of the clues and hints, while also tracking the widely diverse personalities, excuses and alibis. Most of the many characters only have a couple of key scenes, and it's quite fun to see what these talented performers make of their moments. Daisy Ridley, Lucy Boynton and Derek Jacobi make the most of their time, while Penelope Cruz overplays hers. Other than Branagh, the star who shines the brightest is Michelle Pfeiffer (fresh off a killer performance in MOTHER!). She continues to remind us just how talented she is, and no, your ears aren't playing tricks  that's Ms. Pfeiffer singing ""Never Forget"" (lyrics by Branagh) as the closing credits roll.<br/><br/>Ms. Christie's outstanding novel was first published in 1934, and is somewhat based on the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and her own train- riding adventure. It's a wonderful and perplexing read  one that will have you changing your mind multiple times on who you believe to be guilty of murder. There have been numerous movie versions over the years, and none have matched the excellence of director Sidney Lumet's 1974 film with an incredible all-star cast alongside Albert Finney's Poirot. Though this most recent movie doesn't reach the timelessness of that one, no movie can capture the detail and maze- like structure of the novel. It's still quite fun – and a true joy- to see the pages come to life (irony intended) on the big screen."

","I watched the first 15 minutes of this film and realized that Branagh wanted to update Agatha Christie's nuanced and deep analysis of ethnics and ethical systems with a 'woke' version. I turned it off in disgust.<br/><br/>After seeing that the film had achieved an IMDB score of 6.5 and made money, I thought I'd give it another look. I love Branagh as actor. Maybe I was wrong?<br/><br/>I watched another 15 minutes somewhere in the middle. Branagh had cast a black actor in one of the roles. In the dialogue Poirot makes a point about the actor's race! What? Was Branagh's condescension and virtue signalling embarrassing for the actor? I cringed.<br/><br/>A nuanced story was turned into a caricature of woke morality. Terrible.

","Another remake of the classic story, so the story is not really a surprise (even though I don't count myself as one of the hardcore fans of Christie). But the story is a classic for a reason, it is compelling and engaging, making the movie entertaining all the way.<br/><br/>That being said, the best part of the movie is the cinematography and cast/characters. First of, the cinematography is top notch. The landscapes, the views and places we are shown made my want to go on a train ride, hopefully in a landscape as dramatic as in the movie. I loved that part through and through.<br/><br/>And I really liked the characters. As I said above, I'm not one of the hardcore fans, but I think Branagh made a superb Poirot. A little different approach than others have portrayed him (especially compared to the TV-series) but very sympathetic and likable. A genius detective with a peculiar personality, but not without warmth and humor.<br/><br/>To go into detail about rest of the cast and characters would lead to a long, long text as the cast is numerous and full of stars. Suffice to say that they live up to their names.

A lot of big stars which make people misguided the murderer ( If you haven't read the novel, be my guest to guess the murderer during the movie). Another thing that makes me satisfied is its plot. The exposition is not cheesy, the complication is well delivered, the climax is added for additional suspense (perhaps) , and the resolution is gold!<br/><br/>I'm out of my words to write about the movie. As one of my acquaintance said, it's like playing a werewolf game. It's a recommended movie to people who like to challenge their deduction skills or maybe to people who trust their hunch.<br/><br/>Even though I did find several flaws in the movie, I think it's because I have read the novel. It's hard to not judge a movie based on novel without comparing with the novel itself (maybe Harry Potter fans would know it lol).

"tye1138","6","3","8","21 November 2017"," Murder on the Orient didn't need a remake.
","Kenneth Branagh is at it again, with a dialog-driven, murder mystery that in a lot of cases, didn't need to be re-made.<br/><br/>As a railfan and 70mm buff, this was a movie I've been anxious to watch for quite sometime. <br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is the very simple ""who done it"" with the twist of a seemingly random journey that puts one of the best detectives in the world, in the heart of a crime only he can solve. The Agatha Christie story has been modified heavily for this new venture, the writers taking some of the best elements of her writing and adding some new twists and turns in hopes to revitalize the story. It's clear from the first scene, Branagh's intentions were to make an ""actor's"" piece, rather than one of sheer entertainment. Where this film falls short is with it's characters, less it's casting choices. Unfortunately, whether due to time or financial constraints, even the most talkative characters feel very flat and missing important dynamics. Every time you want more from them, the filmmakers cut away. Every time the filmmakers show you more, it feels poorly written and doesn't make sense. I would make the assumption it was pretty long and it was substantially cut down. Furthermore, the lead character Hercule Poirot, has a heavy French accent and talks very fast. So much of the critical clever dialog can be missed with the blink of an eye. This is unfortunate because within the script, there are some good moments, it's just the translation from actor to audience, was weak. <br/><br/>In terms of the production, this was a massive undertaking because they couldn't afford to shoot on location, so the entire movie was made on the back lot. This includes the grand station at the beginning, nearly all of the train scenes and of course, the mountain causeway which is where most the film takes place. There is ""some"" real train footage in the movie, but only a few seconds here and there. Unfortunately as a consequence, there are a lot of visual effects shots. Mostly set extensions, but almost all of the wide shots of the train, is done in CG, which is unfortunate. <br/><br/>Branagh only works on film and he felt this movie deserved the ""royal"" treatment and would be entirely shot on 5 perf 65mm. He had worked with 65mm making 'Hamlet' and was excited to do it again. The cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos, has worked with Branagh a few other times and was excited about working on large format. They shot most scenes with 2 cameras, and some of the bigger scenes that didn't have dialog, they used upwards of three cameras. This allowed them to shoot very fast and with a very experienced cast, it was easy to bang out scenes without much fuss or re- shooting. Since the film was being shot in the UK, they used Cinelab UK's 65mm processing machines and had overnight dailies, which was a perfectly acceptable workflow. The camera seems to be always in motion, either on a dolly, Steadicam or jib/crane. This created a really nice look, along with some excellent lighting choices from Zambarloukos. Instead of using green screen outside the windows of the moving train, VER provided the world's largest LED display solution for a movie. Zambarloukos shot plates in New Zealand on a rail line up in the mountains. They shot with both 65mm and digital cameras and wound up only using the digital media for those plates. With that said, the 65mm format was so crisp, you could tell the background was projected, which was a real shame. Had it been shot on anamorphic 35mm, you may not have been able to tell. <br/><br/>I felt over-all cinematography wise, the film was made like a typical Hollywood venture. Outside of a few cool shots, like the Steadicam shot which goes through the entire train and shooting through some of the beautiful glasswork inside the coaches, there wasn't anything really outstanding to see. The production simply felt rushed and they weren't taking many risks, especially in the cinematography department. <br/><br/>In summary, the production felt rushed, post felt rushed and even the printmaking and projection felt rushed. This left me semi-unsatisfied and at one point, I nearly dozed off because frankly, it just wasn't that interesting of a movie. There were a lot of great elements, but no glue to hold them together. Technically it wasn't anything to write home about either, which was disappointing. Even the score was very 2nd rate and lackluster, which was a real shame. There really wasn't any ""redeeming"" value to the movie and that's the biggest problem. <br/><br/>Worth the watch on home video, but now that the prints are about to be retracted, I wouldn't bother seeing on the big screen. Hopefully Fox makes some money off the prints and see's the value in perhaps striking more for future releases."

A top performance and the character was very well written - very human, not cartoonish. The introduction (the scenes before boarding the train) were really great as well, set design, pacing, everything. <br/><br/>The action scenes, while not strictly necessary, did not bother me.

"freemanpatrick7","7","3","8","11 November 2017"," Well, it's not the same old crap
","Was this remake necessary? Define ""necessary"". I saw the Albert Finney/Sydney Lumet version when it was released in 1974. I was only 11 years old when it first came out so I don't remember much of how it affected me. But in the many years since then I have become a fan of Agatha Christie and have seen it again and again, as well as other adaptations. I've always thought that Finney's interpretation of Poirot was a bit over the top. Still it was never as bad as Peter Ustinov's. Fortunately I never saw Alfred Molina's version. And then came David Suchet, who, in my opinion, nails the role perfectly. Any remake is naturally going to be compared, favorably or unfavorably, to its predecessors. In my opinion Branagh's attempt fell below Suchet but above all others. Far above. Any time the director is the star you run the risk of over indulgences and this film suffers some of that. Few actors, if any, can resist the temptation to place the value of their own egos above that of the picture as a whole. Which is not to say that Branagh is a bad actor or a bad director. Nothing could be further from the truth. I just didn't feel like he performed either job brilliantly in this picture. It might be that I'm making the mistake of over comparison to the Suchet version. And taken on its own merits alone this picture is decent, if not great. The acting is superb. The photography is beautiful. I couldn't help being overwhelmed by the abundance of CGI but whattayagonnado? It's everywhere these days. The opening scene and the reveal scene at the end differ greatly from the source material. It doesn't hurt the story at all, it's just different. And I can't think of any reason to have done them this way except just to be different. But all in all it was an enjoyable film, exactly what I was hoping for, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old crap that Hollywood has been churning out over the past few years."

","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed with this movie. Granted I'm a huge Christie fan and I believe David Suchet's version of Poirot is the most faithful interpretation of Christie's sleuth. If you are a hard core Christie or Poirot fan, this movie may be more annoying than interesting. IMHO, I'd watch either the Albert Finney or David Suchet's versions before spending time and money on this. <br/><br/>Didn't Like: - Branaugh did not bother with having an egg head, which is one of the most distinctive physical characteristics about Poirot.<br/><br/><ul><li>the moustache is totally distracting and it was all I could do to listen to the dialogue instead of watching the moustache in fascination. It deserves its own film credit for Pete's sake.

It would be waxed to perfection.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Poirot stepping into the manure pile twice. So ridiculous! He would never ruin his shoes in this manner. While his murmured comment about balance rings true, he would immediately stop and clean the one shoe before continuing. Poirot isn't just focused on balance but cleanliness and tidy are imperative. He'd never be able to stand dirty, smelly shoes plus the fact that the leather would be ruined, would render him incapable of moving on until it's cleaned up. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the scene towards the end where all the characters were seated at the long table, looking like The Last Supper seemed an indulgence and overly dramatic on Branaughs part</li></ul><br/><br/>. - so many flat performances by such skilled actors. Compared to older MOTOE films, the performances were disappointing. I was excited to see all these great actors in one film but sadly they didn't get to shine. <br/><br/><ul><li>the introduction of the characters was tedious and for those not familiar with the story, probably confusing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Poirot holding interviews outdoors without being muffled up in coat, scarf, earmuffs, gloves and seemingly unbothered by the cold.

"zkonedog","4","3","8","11 November 2017"," Tries To Solve Murder Mystery Blandness But Fails In The Attempt
","Coming into ""Murder On The Orient Express"", the main thing I was worried about was that the film would focus so much on the ""whodunnit"" that it would fail to consider ""why do we care"". That is a typical problem I find with hard-boiled mystery capers. Funny enough, ""Murder"" tries to improve in this very area, but ends up completely striking out in a rather muddled mess of names, faces, and half-baked plots.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film sees famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) on a train heading towards his next case. He's hoping to catch some much-needed r-and-r, but when Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) is murdered en route, his deductive reasoning and sleuthing is tested as never before. One by one, he questions all the other train passengers, played by an eclectic ""who's who"" of Hollywood including Daisey Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, & Willem Dafoe (among others).<br/><br/>The reason I'll give ""Murder"" even four stars is because, in all honesty, it does try to subvert its genre a bit by adding in a human element. This is where the spoilers come in, but all the passengers are found to have a connection to the murdered Ratchett. In the end, Poirot must make a moral choice that previously he's never had to make: does he let a crime go because it was ""deserved"", or is it his solemn duty to prosecute to the full extent of the law.<br/><br/>This is actually an interesting twist on the ""whodunnit"" mystery, and could have been used to great effect. The problem? The ""connection"" that all the passengers share just isn't compelling enough to make an audience really care about them. Part of the issue is that instead of really setting up that angle in the early goings, we get 20 minutes of Poirot kind of just clowning around...totally pointless and a waste of time that could have really been used to flesh out the history of the crime that is later examined in detail.<br/><br/>As it is, however, the emotional reason we are supposed to care about these passengers is only given through snippets of dialogue, very short flashbacks, and so many names (in such a short period) that I was often confused by who was who. Not conducive at all, obviously, to what director Branagh was trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Overall, then, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" tried to be something bigger than it is billed, and while I appreciate that effort, it just doesn't work. Unless you have a soft spot for this literary tale or character (Poirot), or are an enormous fan of whodunnit murder mysteries, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed when the credits roll."

","I'm amazed to say I LOVED IT! I truly did. It was gorgeous to look at (money was SPENT!). Going in knowing whodunnit is especially fun when there are people in the audience who audibly don't! I had a great time!<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure people want to know how it compares to the 1974 Lumet film with Albert Finney. And the answer is... IT DOESN'T AND IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT YOU EVEN ASK!<br/><br/>Honestly! That was a FILM! This â€“ and it makes no attempt to hide the fact â€“ is a MOVIE!!! It's a delicious, giant, Agatha Christie themed cake. It's the kind of movie that requires you to eat while you're watching it. So, if you see it and don't like it because ""boo hoo it doesn't compare to the original,"" it's you're own fault you didn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>There are a goodly number of reasons not to enjoy this version on its own merits. But first, the good stuff!<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, director. He keeps things moving at a good clip. It survives the true test of a period piece: I wanted to buy or wear everything in it. It's not easy to make a mystery where everyone over 40 knows the ending! He approaches it with style and aplomb!<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, actor. His Poirot is surprisingly understated; shockingly so when you consider the heinous moustache (it's the kind of moustache that requires the spelling with the most letters). The anacondapillar on his face aside, there's wit, charm, subtlety and grace in his performance. It's not iconic Finney or Ustinov but it'll more than do. In fact, I found him quite moving.<br/><br/>Josh Gad. I am not a fan. I don't find him funny or appealing at all. Except in this because he's fabulous! The character's pathetic slovenliness is actually endearing and the period look really works for him. It's terrific work.<br/><br/>Leslie Odom Jr. I did not see him in Hamilton so this was my first experience. He's beyond appealing.<br/><br/>The very best thing about this film: Michelle F-ing Pfeiffer! Between this and mother! I'm loving how much fun she's having. She OWNS this movie!<br/><br/>Now the other stuff.<br/><br/>A lot of heavy hitters have very little to do. Dame Judi, Derek Jacobi and Olivia Coleman are only here to give the cake some class. And they do! But...<br/><br/>Some of the other characters are given extremely short shrift. The Count and Countess (played by Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset in the original) are played respectively by a non-actor and a relative unknown (Lucy Boynton, who was delightful in Sing Street but is no Jacqueline Bisset) and are barely in it. I'm still not sure how the one Latin guy was involved.<br/><br/>While the movie deserves props for at least trying to make a period murder mystery with at least a few actors of color, it would have been nice if they all actually had stuff to do. But when even Dame Judi is just collecting a paycheck...<br/><br/>The screenplay and some of the acting is a bit cartoony. Daisy Ridley is serviceable. Willem Dafoe is trapped in a character with no way out but DAMN if he doesn't commit to his Choices! Johnny Depp seems like he's in a different movie altogether.<br/><br/>There are unnecessary action sequences and the screenplay's other attempts to get you to where you're inevitably going to end up feel forced: like someone at the studio said ""I think you need a car chase only without cars and on a stalled train."" When people actually start confessing, I was like ""don't DO that!""<br/><br/>The reenactment of the murder is a bit too stylish for me and takes away some of the horror of what's happening, though it does capture some of the rage.<br/><br/>All that said, I really did enjoy myself! If you can watch this movie version without being mired in comparisons to the previous great film (and if you properly adjust your expectations), you might have fun too.<br/><br/>No guarantees."

","This movie got off to a VERY slow startÂ… somehow got even SLOWERÂ… and finally climaxed and all came together with like 17 minutes left. I found myself either bored or REALLY bored for the vast majority of it. It's not that it's NOT interesting... it just never REALLY grabs you like a mystery should. <br/><br/>Protagonist â€“ The detective played by Kenneth Branagh â€“ Very clichÃ© character with a distracting mustache akin to a combination of the Swedish chef from The Muppet Show and the Monopoly Man.<br/><br/>Character development â€“ The only one with any real character development was the Protagonist. The opening scene to demonstrate how great of a detective he is was extremely forcedÂ… mainly because the point of it was just so painfully clear.<br/><br/>Cast â€“ great but grossly underused (considering the talent that was all there).<br/><br/>Costumes â€“ Great. One of the best things about the movie.<br/><br/>Plot â€“ Murder mystery on a trainÂ… I love a good mysteryÂ… but this plot was long and drawn out. I do believe that the end had a (slight) payoff. But if you've seen the original there's no payoff for you. <br/><br/>Score â€“ Lazy and unimpressiveÂ… <br/><br/>Visually â€“ Well the train scenes were pretty cool.<br/><br/>Pacing â€“ Went from slowÂ… to slowerÂ… to OMG please hurry up and find the killer so I can go home.<br/><br/>Overall I wouldn't recommend running out to see this in the movie theater. Even if classic murder mysteries are your thing this can definitely wait for Redbox. I give it a 4 out of 10Â… I don't think this was a pointless remake, I think they just missed the mark.<br/><br/>Find me on Twitter and YouTube for audio reviews @MovieBuffChick1"

","6 November 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Murder on The Orient Express. I have never read any Agatha Christie book and I have never seen any Hercule Poirot films or programs, so I came into this film completely blind. I had no knowledge of who was killed, nor of who the killer was. This star-studded production although not edge of the seat viewing was a good solid murder mystery. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also took the starring role, and produced by among others, Ridley Scott (of Bladerunner fame) this whodunnit was extremely watchable. Good solid performances were given by everyone including the simply smashing Dame Judi Dench. I always suspect it's hard to give an edge to a new adaptation of something seen and loved before, and equally hard to make such a confined set large enough to bring it to life on the big screen. This was achieved rather well, we all hark back to those days of grand travel in beautiful rolling stock, with waiter service and a decadence long since lost on the modern rail system. That's why these films work, they give us chance to explore our imaginations and enhance our dreams. Watching a recent interview with Branagh on The Graham Norton show, he said they built a whole set for the derailed train, mountain, bridge, tunnel etc and the results were spectacular. I googled the film and looked at how many people were involved in the production and post production and all the different jobs, take a look sometime, it's fascinating and easy to see why film making is such a big industry. Only one criticism, what exactly was that growing on Branagh's face and why did it appear to change colour half way through the film........he seemed to go more grey overnight."
"salathe14","9","4","13","10 November 2017"," Delightful for fans of Agatha Christie
","I am a fan of the book, and i go into movies like this prepared to compare and maybe be disappointed, but I was delighted by this adaptation. Unlike the Hollywood Sherlock Holmes, Branagh's Poirot was not over-the-top, but was on point, and the dialogue was perfect. Together they quickly showed the audience the very essence of this prolific character in Christie's works. Much like when I see Austen redone, I feel I know the main characters intimately, and the margin for error by the actor is small, but this portrayal was just right. Thank you Kenneth Branagh. The movie is striking in its look, and the star studded cast does not disappoint. I only felt it was overdone a bit at the end while Poirot solves the mystery. Otherwise it felt genuine to Christie's intent, was very engaging, and made me hope they do Murder on the Nile next. Amazing story, amazingly done. Thank you to the cast and crew."

While you have to get over the ""elephant in the room"" i.e the ""mustache"" this version of the film differs enough to maintain your interest. With a good supporting cast you find once you have seen something before you pay more attention to the detail.

"javi-y-se-acabo","7","3","9","30 November 2017"," Kenneth Branagh Brings Back The Mystery To The Orient Express
","Well, I have to say that I haven't watched the original movie, nor read the book, so I cannot tell if this is a good adaptation or which of the the two is better. Branagh is well know for adapting English literature classics into movies and I think he is really great at that.<br/><br/>The movie tells us the story of Hercules Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who has to find out who is the murder that has killed a person inside the Orient Express. The story keeps you interested, its full of tension, suspense and even drama, and it surprises you at the end in a way I couldn't see coming (I won't spoil it).<br/><br/>The cast is what you could call a Dream Team of the Actuation. You have Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, etc. All of them are great in their roles. They all have a little part in the story, but they all have little moments to shine (well, apart from Branagh that takes the main role).<br/><br/>As a director, Branagh gives us some really interesting shots that are really beautiful to look at, even they were created in a studio. He creates longs shots where he likes to show is big ensemble cast by long panoramic of the train windows or inside the train. He is a usual collaborator with composer Patrick Doyle, who here creates a really beautiful score for the moments where it's needed, but also creates some really tense tracks that help build the tension a lot.<br/><br/>I would recommend you this mainly because it does not happen that much that we have a cast as wonderful as this all together in the same screen and also because it's a really interesting and entertaining movie, a little bit different of all of the modern action blockbusters were are getting again and again."
"alanjudge-30219","8","3","9","19 November 2017"," MatinÃ©e
","Saw this with my wife. Good film for either gender. I had read the book many moons ago but forgot what happened at the end. So I was alongside Poirot trying to guess the culprit. Won't say more on that (spoiler).<br/><br/>Anyway what I liked about this film was the cinematic quality. Branagh used old fashioned film cameras and the plush decor of the Orient Express looks great on the big screen. Especially with all the (Alps) snow outside the train. Gave it a sort of 'christmassy' vibe.<br/><br/>Anyway I always envisioned Poirot as being a little swarthier than Branagh but non the less he does a good Belgian impression. Also I liked how his mustache was shaped just like the old fashionable facial hair of the era (1930s).<br/><br/>Yes there appears to be a black character shoe-horned in to satisfy the liberal cult. But they did not overdo it and it did not spoil the film. In fact even down to the way characters talk it was mostly historically accurate.<br/><br/>Not a classic by any means and for some reason Branagh just seems a tad too Anglo-Saxon to be Poirot but I never felt bored and left quite satisfied. I think Agatha Christie is a great writer and it shows."
"mm-39","6","3","9","14 November 2017"," Well just okay
","With Hollywood running out of idea we have another remake. Murder on the Orient Express is another soon to be forgotten remake. The producers try to make the new version with more of an edge and more P C, but yet try to maintain true to the original story. What worked: The acting was top notch, and the director keeps and even pace. There was no drag time. Kenneth Branagh crushed it as Hercule Poirot and the supporting characters complemented the main character, Hercule, with there limited character arches. What did not work: As much as the makers tried to do a modern upgrade of Murder on the Orient Express the story is still old. The murder mystery genera from the 70's and 80's aka Columba, Mattlock, Murder She Wrote etc follow the Agatha Christie model, which is tired, and old. Changing up a few characters, adds little spice to an old story. Having Johnny Depp in such a minor role is miss use of such a dramatic actor. A surprise ending, and watchable movie. But and there is a but just balances out and make just an okay movie. 6 out of 10 stars"

","I enjoyed the film as it was a night out. It didn't quite meet my expectations but then again I had heard mixed reviews. I guess what it lacked was just that feeling of atmosphere in the carriage. Did we particularly see an evening on board with a meal served ? As they said we didn't really get to know the characters terribly well beyond a few caricatures. I got a little mixed up with the Johnny Depp character and another man who looked quite similar. But overall a good story-go and see it - Kenneth Branagh was good but the moustache was over the top !! And the mix of French (with a translation which I guess you had to do but as I speak French this seemed ridiculous !!) as he spoke a few words of French so we know he is Belgian then into English ! But overall I enjoyed it. Go and see it - its a good film and I hope to see more as I love Agatha Christie and all mystery things like this. I hate CGI but can see it probably saves a whole lot of money in a film like this. Thanks all though - enjoyed the film."
"thecanterburr","3","3","9","12 November 2017"," Awful performance
","To say it short: a film, which made Branagh to show how awesome Branagh is, isn't worth watching. Even from the trailer: ""My name is Hercule Poirot, and I'm probably the best detective in the world"". Really? Was Poirot a poser with strange moustache? I think not, and that starts to annoying in the first 10 minutes.<br/><br/>I was unlucky to read the book after that film- I lost everything - pressure, interest...all that feelings killed that film, which doesn't grab your attention at all. Numerous times I've heard that the film is very beautiful itself. Of course, for a drama. But not for a detective story. Just imagine - the train got under the snowfall, left in the mountains, when another one can come. It's not 100%, that the help will come soon, and you are the only one, who is left to find a murderer! It's sounds like a true horrible detective, which had to have atmosphere like ""Se7en"". As I didn't know who the murderer was, for me it was the only interesting thing. As Branagh left time only for his character, though, we didn't know anything about Poirot, except that he is arrogant and thinks of himself as ""Ã¼bermensh"". The film clumsily tells us that all characters are connected to Armstrong. That can't be a coincidence - no way count, Princess, doctor etc. could be in one place occasionally. Leading to one logical statement, who the murderer is. (still, I wouldn't write it). I put 3 only because of great cast - Judi Dench, Depp (though he performed poorly, for a person who receives such threats), Dafoe and others. Thanks for the spoiled book, will never watch another film directed by you."
"Hitchcoc","6","3","9","11 November 2017"," The Little Engine That Couldn't
","I have to agree with several others who have commented on this film. It lacks any sort of spark. Each actor plays to the camera and there is little interaction among them. Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh's Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction."
"CabbageCustard","7","2","5","25 February 2020"," What? Again!?
","The biggest mystery about this movie based on Agatha Christie's famous novel is why they bothered. It isn't as if this book hasn't been filmed umpteen times already. This movie features great sets, a marvelous soundtrack and many famous and talented actors but it brings nothing to the story that we haven't seen before. To be honest, we certainly wouldn't want anyone to change the story, but if we're going to see it done again we would like to see it done in a way that brings something fresh. Maybe that's no longer possible with such a familiar tale.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh plays Hercule Poirot. He is a very brave man to do so. Most of us remember Poirot played by David Suchet. Suchet is, without a doubt, the definitive Poirot. He has Poirot's mannerisms and quirks down to a tee, his acting is impeccable and Suchet even looks like Poirot, just as Christie described him. I believe that every book Christie wrote featuring Poirot has been filmed starring Suchet, including Murder on the Orient Express. If you are a fan of Christie or mysteries generally, you should look these productions up. Kenneth Branagh looks nothing like Poirot, but then again neither did Peter Ustinov or Albert Finney or other actors who have played the role.<br/><br/>If there is a problem with this movie it is Branagh's portrayal of Poirot. We know Poirot is a very eccentric even narcissistic man, but Branagh goes over the top in portraying these aspects of Poirot's personality. His is not always a subtle performance. In fact there are times it seems that Branagh is envisioning Poirot as sort of an early 20th century superhero. There is one scene where Branagh's Poirot is outdoors walking towards all the other cast members and we see him walking towards the camera with his voluminous coat swirling about him like Superman's cape. There are times too that the landscapes in this movie look decidedly like computer generated images. I suspect some of them are. They are certainly gorgeous but sometimes have a cartoonish quality to them. One other thing I became aware of as the film approached its conclusion is how many secrets Poirot was progressively exposing with absolutely no evidence or clues presented to support his deductions. He was always correct of course, but that's not the point. We would like to see the clues too so we could try and solve the mystery along with him from the comfort of our lounge chairs.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound like I am disparaging this movie. That is not my intention. There is nothing terribly wrong with it, but there is nothing special about it. This movie concludes with the suggestion that a sequel is planned - a remake of Death on the Nile. Honestly people, Mr Branagh et al, don't bother."

"Mike_Devine","7","2","5","25 November 2018"," Branagh delivers on remaking a classic
","Another example of Hollywood trying to regenerate success through a remake, Kenneth Branagh directed and starred in 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Although it opened to little fanfare, the film boasts an all-star cast and has a lot to offer audiences who've been waiting for a whodunit thriller to come along.<br/><br/>On the surface, 'Express' is a sophisticatedly simple mystery that follows the world's greatest detective, straight talking Hercule Poirot (Branagh), as he takes an international steam engine from Istanbul en route to London to investigate a murder. While onboard the train, a number of things happen as Poirot meets many interesting people who appear to be cut from different cloths. But it's something rather shocking that puts the brakes on the extravagant trip (as the title suggests).<br/><br/>The best aspect of 'Express' is without a doubt the plot. There are enough twists and turns to keep your attention, and it's fair to say the reveal at the end is one that's hard to see coming. But the cast comes in a close second, as we get to see strong performances from everyone from Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. But veteran actors really steal the show, including Dame Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and the aforementioned Branagh - there's really nothing to complain about - or find fault in. And it would be remiss not to acknowledge the amazing cinematography. From sweeping views of cities and landscapes to the use of the close quarters on the Orient Express, the camera work is worth noting.<br/><br/>Sure, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is a remake, and as such it must overcome the challenge of not being the original. But Branagh manages to deliver in a genre that doesn't get much attention anymore."

Who else should the reigns be given to then to Kenneth Branagh for such a great book?<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express (2017) follows the famous inspector Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh with a ravishingly wonderful moustache) finishing up a case in Istanbul before taking a well deserved break on the one of a kind train the Orient Express, however while on the train shady business man Edward Ratchett gets brutally murdered and it is up to Poirot to solve what might be one of his greatest cases in his life. Because of spoilers I will not say more.<br/><br/>When you take on a role that has been perfected according to some it can be a daunting task, it can be even an impossible on according to others but Kenneth Branagh takes the character and makes it his own. In this case Hercule Poirot is an obsessive compulsive who is able to detect what is wrong in the world and ""make it right..."" He is also more proactive in this version with him defending himself at certain points him the film. A change that has had some of the hardcore Christie fans cry in anger is the introduction of a past love interest for Poirot, I think it fits the film and the character Kenneth Branagh is portraying as, it also fits into the themes of order vs. chaos and grief. I also believe that Branagh disappears into the role of Poirot, his accent is more believable then any of the previous versions of the character and I just do not seen an actor playing a role I see Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>The other members of the cast are well chosen for their roles, Johnny Depp is scummy enough to be Ratchett in regards to his performance and Michelle Pfeiffer is brilliant as the irrupting Ms Hubbard while insuring she never gets too annoying and remains sympathetic to the audience. There is also a rather interesting bit of casting with Dr Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr) that adds the commentary of race relations in the 1930s, while it does get dangerously close to peachiness at times it works all the same, I would say the film is decently written if some of the dialogue is a bit blunt. <br/><br/>The film very well shot and looks exceedingly beautiful, lots of soft blues and whites paint very breathtaking views of the mountains, the CGI does look a touch cartoonish especially on the wide outdoor shots of the city and the train, this makes it very jarring when the very next shot has the practical effects in full view. I wonder if a few more days refining the CGI would have made it less jarring.<br/><br/>Some might consider this movie to be a pointless remake; I think that would depend on what you consider to be pointless in regards to remakes. I do think Murder on the Orient Express is not a pointless remake because it tackles different angles and makes itself unique enough to stand out unlike the Nightmare on Elm Street remake or the Carrie remake. I really enjoyed this movie."

","There are some people who love this and some who hate this. I'm the former.<br/><br/>I admit the plot isn't perfect. There is some difficulty juggling all the characters, some of Poirot's deductions seem more like very lucky guesswork, and not enough info. is given for the audience to look back and say they could have figured the movie out. Still, the movie was still very entertaining to me. Yes, the original movie was far better plotted and made more sense. However, it was very slow-paced. This one is far more breezy and entertaining.<br/><br/>Visually, the film looks great containing vintage-looking sets and costumes with bright lighting and colors. Music and some creative camera work really set the mood. Stick around for the end credits. There's a very good song there. What the script lacks in plotting, it makes up with good dialogue, both the funny and dramatic variety.<br/><br/>The acting's all top notch, which is to be expected from such an all-star cast. Unfortunately, what with there being so many characters, not all of them get the chance so shine as brightly as others. Still Michelle Pfeiffer, Josh Gad, and Willem Dafoe all have some great scenes.<br/><br/>As for Kenneth Branagh, I really liked him in the role as Hercule Poirot. It isn't easy for a mainstream film these days to star an eccentric middle-aged guy who isn't action-oriented, but Brannagh pulls it off. He plays Poirot's many moods quite well. He's at times comically eccentric, a serious fighter of crime, rude, or extremely likable. <br/><br/>If you don't have the patience for following a mystery and drama, this movie isn't for you. But, I highly recommend this to everyone else."

"montesjerome-55635","9","2","5","21 March 2018"," Not like other Christie films--- but that can also be a good thing
","I watched this movie with hesitation, having already read some lukewarm reviews. But I am a huge Agatha Christie fan. I have many of the novels, have numerous film DVDs-- including the 1974 Orient Express-- and I couldn't stay away. I'm very glad I took a chance on it, and I now have a copy of Brannagh's version.<br/><br/>It is very different from other Agatha Christie films. It's the least faithful adaptation of the Orient Express novel, but for me it's also the most emotionally affecting. This is to take nothing away from the 1974 version, or David Suchet's excellent version as well. But this film delves into the devastating consequences of loss and grief the way few other Christie adaptations do. It shines a light on how death and murder can leave someone twisted, broken, changed forever. It's a theme carried masterfully throughout the movie that pays off in the inevitable denouement in ways you won't see in other Christie films. The climax had me tearing up slightly, because of the magnificent performances, but also because of the perspectives the film takes.<br/><br/>Brannagh's Poirot has more growing to do than in many other films as he anguishes not only with the complex whodunit but with an assault on his world view and sense of justice. Again, a very clear choice on the part of the filmmakers and writers and one I'm glad they focused on.<br/><br/>This version may not be for everyone. It speaks to me, and it could be that this is because I watched the 1974 version as a young person with no attachments, and I watched this version as a parent. If you are fine with some changes from the novel and are open to new perspectives on a classic whodunit, see this version and soak it in."

","After solving a theft in Jerusalem, famed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, is looking forward to a break before his next case. His friend, Bouc, the director of the Orient Express, convinces him to travel on board his train. Seeing the time on the train as a welcome break from crime-solving, Poirot agrees. The passengers of the grand and luxurious carrier come off as an odd bunch of people travelling together.<br/><br/>Based on Agatha Christie's celebrated crime 
mystery novel, the film revolves around the murder of a dubious businessman aboard the luxurious first class compartment of the Orient express. With almost every co-passenger being a suspect, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot's (Kenneth Branagh) sharp deduction skills are put to test once again.<br/><br/>Loaded with mysterious intentions, cheeky humour, clever repartee and an ensemble cast that comprises some of cinema's biggest names, Murder on the Orient Express makes for an intriguing watch. Strangers being stranded on a stalled train makes for a great premise, given the thrill of finding a killer lurking around.
After receiving some threatening letters, Ratchett tries to employ Poirot for his security, but the latter declines. On the same night, as the Orient Express runs aground due to an avalanche, Samuel Ratchett is found stabbed multiple times in the chest and abdomen. With much reluctance, and his friend's insistence, Poirot takes up the investigation. As he gets down to the exhaustive process of interrogation, it is clear that things aren't exactly as they seem.<br/><br/>He maunders on about knife wounds and sleeping potions and missing kimonos. The clues are at once vital, finicky, and dull, and Branagh, perhaps fearful that his tale might be sagging, peps it up with escapades that would have had Christie dropping her teapot. Poirot, who starts by fretting about boiled eggs, finds himself chasing a caped figure along a precarious bridge. He even gets a shot in the arm. The movie could use one, too.<br/><br/>Of the rest of the impressive cast, only Depp as Ratchett and Pfeiffer as Mrs Hubbard make any kind of impression. The film comes closest to giving an insight into its characters when Depp is interacting with Poirot and Hubbard, but since Ratchett is the one to be murdered, that doesn't last long. the snow-capped peaks is so marvellously filmed <br/><br/>On a technical scale, the film scores a perfect ten. The scenes involving the murdered body and the cabin that houses the corpse are shot entirely from above with great ingenuity. 
The only con of this movie is the last dialogue which is a bit sentimental but the pros of this movie overshadowed this con.
Murder On The Orient Express pays homage to Agatha Christie's timeless detective story in more ways than one.
It's a must watch."

","'I can only see a world as it should be. It makes an imperfection stick out like the nose on your face.'<br/><br/>Michael Green's adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is updated and at times thinned out so that the Christie trademark tension slags a bit, but Kenneth Branagh does his best both as the director and the star of the film to recreate enough mystery and visual splendor to make the film work well.<br/><br/>Many of Agatha Christie's insightful comments are intact - such as 'You know, there is something about a tangle of strangers pressed together for days with nothing in common but the need to go from one place to another and never see each other again.' The plot (which must be guarded well for future viewers) is as follows: Having just solved a mysterious theft in Jerusalem, the famed Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), is in need of balancing things in his life with a small vacation, in 1934 Istanbul. Instead, the vigilant detective will soon find himself aboard the luxurious Orient Express on a trip to Calais, sharing a carriage with an eclectic assortment of first-class travellers (Penelope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe et al) and an invisible murderer who walks unnoticed among them. When a sudden massive avalanche blocks the tracks, trapping the passengers in the locomotive, the gruesome murder of a commuter in his cabin will force Poirot to solve a conundrum where everyone is a suspect. In the end, who could be the killer?<br/><br/>The cinematography by Haris Zambarioukos and the musical score by Peter Doyle add atmosphere. It is a worth re-statement of the Christie story if a bit too drawn out."
"ecorazzi_x","6","2","5","3 March 2018"," Insipid production.
","The prologue, which was meant to introduce characters, was too long, redundant and definitely unnecessary. Unfortunately it made audience sleepy. In fact, this movie could lead people to different hypothesis and the end could be a full of surprise. Somehow, it can create discrimination among nationalities. Since this was a remake of an artwork so it was unavoidable that shadow. From film poster design, scenes to clothes, sounds, they are quite inappropriate. Overall, acceptable (not so good) content but bad acting performance and dialogue."

","This is the third version of Murder on the Orient Express I have seen, I have seen the Albert Finney version, the David Suchet (TV movie version) and this Branagh version. All had different prologues and minor plot variations, (for instance in Istanbul Suchet (as Poirot) witnesses and fails to act as local man kills his wife for adultery and suffers a crisis of conscience, in the Branagh version, it is solving the mystery of a stolen religious icon. In the 2017 version, the scenery, photography and digital work is breathtaking.

Within minutes he gets to showcase his detective skills in an amusing way. Not much later, the movie turns out to be loaded with a stellar cast. After some forced introductions the movie starts to feel rushed. There is no build up, no development, just a quick introduction to a group of so called interesting people and it's done.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful, but a great cast can't hide the fact that the movie is rushed, superficial and hollow and doesn't do honor to the fine details that made the original story richer."

","I'm not going to judge the movie in contrast with the book (which I haven't been able to read yet) or any other crime/detective story, but as a movie on its own. The film has a nice vintage feel to it. In the start of the movie you would thought it's just a simple story where there will be a murder and the detective at the end will solve the crime, but it's not just about that. It imprints a question about morality, of justice, of conscience. It would make you think deeply after the climax of the story unravels to you. You may get shocked or say ""Aha! I'm right about it"". But it does leave you to question, was justice really served? What would be your own ending to the story?
The cinematography is great, there isn't a hint of any anomaly to the plot of the story. Though others may see the film's adaptation not great in comparison to its novel, this would still be a great movie to watch."

","I've always been a fan of Agatha Christie, so when I saw this was a remake, I knew I would see it. When I discovered the mega-cast, it became imperative I saw it! But the cast wasn't way I had to see the movie; I had to see it because Agatha Christie is one of the world's greatest murder mystery writers!<br/><br/>So when Hercule Poirot travels towards a case, he decides his ride will be a short holiday. Sadly, he quickly finds himself inspecting a case along his travel! He looks from a countess, to a doctor. From a chauffeur to a footman. From a co-worker to an actress and dancer- so many suspects... but Poirot gets it figured out. <br/><br/>The movie is excellent and visually stunning! With an amazing cast and accents out the wazoo- I loved the movie just as much as the original. Sadly, I can't tell you too much about the movie without giving it away! Even stating the stars and what they do could mess things up for you! Primarily when I say who gets killed - but Dame Judi Dench is magnificent. I'm a little biased...<br/><br/>If you are a lover of mystery and Agatha Christie, Murder On The Orient Express is your movie. Cheers!"

","Kenneth Branagh and and all-star cast ride the Orient Express in ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" a remake of the magnificent 1974 film. The stars, besides Branagh, are Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Judy Dench, Penelope Cruz, Daisy Ridley, and Leslie Odom, Jr.<br/><br/>For those who don't know the story, it concerns the murder on the Orient Express, which is stalled out due to an avalanche. Poirot is asked to investigate and finds many clues and many anomalies.<br/><br/>The care taken with the cinematography, the costumes, the performances, the interior settings of the train, all went out the window when the screenwriter failed to deliver. <br/><br/>First off, we have Hercules Poirot, who looks ridiculous, solving an unrelated case, then talking to a picture of his beloved Katherine. Who the hell is she? Why was this added?<br/><br/>Also, if you know the story, it's possibly more interesting than if you don't. One thing I will say, unlike others, is that the film didn't seem boring to me or my sisters. I imagine you'll find that complaint from younger people, but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>I could have put up with anything, but when a script introduces a clue and Poirot doesn't pick up on - uh, we have a problem. The problem is sloppy writing. On the night that Ratchit was killed, a disturbance is heard, and the porter knocks on the door to see if he's all right. He answers in French. Here he says, ""It's nothing."" In the original film, he says, ""cauchemar"" (nightmare). <br/><br/>Why tell us that and then have one of the characters say that Ratchit didn't speak a word of French, if Poirot wasn't going to realize a) he didn't answer; and b) someone else was in his room. But that clue is never brought up. No, these writers can't be bothered with a petty detail like that.<br/><br/>Branagh is a youngish, attractive Poirot with an absurd mustache - although he is good, it's not enough, and he's not Poirot. It's always a pleasure to see people like Jacobi, Colman, Pfeiffer. It's a good cast, but the original cast was on a consistently higher level with Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Vanessa Redgrave, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery - I could go on but you get the point. <br/><br/>With its extraneous story details and lack of wit, I'm giving this a 6. Hollywood, come up with something original."

I'm here to say that this movie is a very powerful film and extremely well acted by absolutely everyone! Tom Bates is one of my all time favourite actors and he plays a very funny and charming character which from his introduction onwards I realised what a joy ride this movie would be, and I was correct because that's exactly what it was like. The only reason that I can't give Murder on the orient express a 9 or 10 is because I just can not remember the names of these 30's characters + there is so much story for each character linking to a murder that I am not sure what the killers motivation was because I completely forgot lol, but the reason such a big problem like that doesn't ruin the film is because of a revolation that unfolds which I can not discuss as it would then become a spoiler filled review which would completely ruin the experience.

","An entertaining retelling that isn't perfect, but doesn't have to be. As an avid fan of Agatha Christie novels and David Suchet's depiction of Poirot, I found Kenneth Brannagh's portrayal quite welcome. I walked into this movie already knowing how it might end and still found his Poirot likable (Hercule's mustache is ridiculous regardless of the length) and the passengers convincing (but otherwise, as forgettable as the cast in Suchet's Murder On the Orient Express). It was an entertaining movie. It certainly had flaws. The intro scene could have been tighter and some of the passengers could have had more character development, but compared to many of the other titles released this year, I found this movie pretty decent overall."
"davidgee","9","3","11","16 November 2017"," Better than 1974. Yes it is.
","This is the greatest whodunit of all time, and the 1974 movie - directed by Sidney Lumet, script by Paul Dehn - did it full justice. Albert Finney's Hercule Poirot made Peter Ustinov's previous performances seem lightweight (and surely inspired David Suchet's approach in the TV adaptations). Could it be bettered?<br/><br/>Yes, it could. This version, scripted by Michael Green and directed by Kenneth Branagh, is gorgeously lavish, with stunningly digitalised locations and a train with more glamour than the Chrysler building. And a fairly lavish cast, including Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp. Branagh himself plays Poirot; his usual half-Hitler moustache has grown to coat-hanger proportions but the accent is the one we're used to. The previous murder of little Daisy Armstrong remains the bedrock of the mystery, although this is dripped into the story in fragments. There's a new prologue, with Poirot solving a theft beside the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem (digitally inserted into a Malta backdrop), and the unravelling of the threads is more dramatically paced than it was in 1974.<br/><br/>Some of the cast, now as then, are short-changed (Derek Jacobi and Olivia Colman don't get a lot to say). Michelle Pfeiffer has the meatiest part and is superb. Wendy Hiller had recently played Queen Mary in 1974 and invested the ancient Russian princess with all of Mary's Teutonic imperiousness. Judi Dench recycles her Queen Victoria to similar effect here.<br/><br/>It sort of spoils it that most of us know how it's going to end – it would be a heresy against Agatha Christie to change the final scene (staged here with a slight nod to Da Vinci's Last Supper!) – but it only spoils it a tad. I envy those who see it without knowing whodunit. There's a teaser for DEATH ON THE NILE at the end. I can hardly wait."
"rachele_margarita","1","2","6","3 November 2019"," Makes Adam Sandler's Murder Mystery look Oscar-worthy
","I was really looking forward to this movie, thinking it would be an intriguing and atmospheric period piece mystery. With all those big name actors, it had to be, right? Not even a minute into this movie and I already knew I was wrong, dead wrong. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Seriously, how was this movie ever made, or worse, allowed to be released? It felt like a cheap Pink Panther knock-off, with all the subtlety and acting prowess of an SNL skit, and honestly that probably would have more deep and meaningful than the abomination we are instead delivered. Branaugh's acting is so pathetic it's amazing he didn't get banned from ever acting again. What is with that accent? And the French is so bad that even an elementary school French class could point out the many many mistakes. For example, Michelle Pfeiffer's character says ""c'est de rien"" and it translates underneath as ""it's nothing"" which is the literal translation sure but carries none of the context (it actually means thank you). I think my favorite part was when he says ""n'est pas de probleme"" and then it has English subtitles on the screen that say ""it's no problem."" If your target audience is so stupid that you literally need to translate something that basic for them, maybe Agatha Christie isn't the right material for you.<br/><br/>So many other things wrong with it I don't even know where to start. The CGI is a joke, which makes me wonder what drugs some of these other reviewers were on who claimed it was good in any way. It's beyond fake. The train scenes look like something out of a children's Christmas fantasy movie. There's even a scene where Depp and Branaugh are sitting on the moving train and the background doesn't even change for like ten whole minutes. They use the same fake backdrop for the entire scene, without even bothering to add any movement or anything. It's so amateur it makes me angry that these people still have jobs.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, it gets is even worse. There are so many holes and inconsistencies and downright ludicrous things that it's impossible to even follow the storyline no matter how hard you try. For example, a lightning strike causes an avalanche (I haven't read the novel so forgive me if that was part of the actual story; either way, it's beyond ridiculous). They are supposed to have just left Istanbul that day yet they are somehow in the middle of the Alps and also in an impossiblly high, remote snow-covered peak like something out of game of thrones, and yet noone is wearing any winter jackets and none of them ever seem to be cold at all? The doctor went to school in England yet has an American accent? The Judi Dench woman is Russian yet speaks perfect English and has no Russian accent? The Jerusalem townspeople are all gathered around wearing various culturally inappropriate garbs and listening to some foreign detective ranting rather than their own officials, one of whom is a black man despite it being Israel in 1934?<br/><br/>I don't want to use the race of the actors as reason to criticize the historical accuracy of this film, but my God, they butchered the time and place so badly it was worse than 300. The first few minutes of the movie is some of the most racist, stereotypical Orientalist garbage ever put to screen. And ironically enough, the movie then goes on to hammer a supposed anti-racist message into our skills as if we need to be lectured, when they're the ones parading people around in culturally misappropriated costumes and constantly pointing out the race of all their characters, some of whom it feels distinctly clear were only chosen because of their race in the first place. The oblivious hypocrisy is not only annoying it's downright offensive.<br/><br/>This kind of stupidity is tolerable in a comedy movie, where it's intentional, like say, a Jack Black movie. However, here it's just inappropriate and embarrassing. Even the Jack Black of this movie (Josh Gad) is a pale parody of the real thing. And sadly he delivers what is arguably the best performance out of the whole cast.<br/><br/>It's so abysmal you'll be wishing that the train plummeted off the tracks and killed everyone involved. It would be a much more interesting and satisfying mystery than the one we are left with."

On a personal note, I need to start mentally derating the influence of negative reviews. There are too many critics and very little objectivity out there these days."
"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","6","26 February 2018"," Murder on the Orient Express is just as intriguing and developed as it's source material.
","Agatha Christie, Poirot, murder mystery. Suffice to say this story quite possibly pioneered the ""Who Dunnit!?"" sub-genre. With many popular mysteries utilising the same methodologies that Christie famously used in her book. Kenneth Branagh braves an attempt at adapting this beloved story...and thankfully he did. We all know the story. A group of passengers onboard the Orient Express are in the midst of a murder, and it's up to our heavily moustached detective to crack the case. Now, I'm a massive fan of Kenneth Branagh. He is a class act, both in his thespian acting style and his modern directing techniques. Fortunately, his talents are put to good use here. I thoroughly enjoyed this. I kept my expectations timid but secretly I had faith in Sir Branagh. His iteration of Hercule Poirot is inspired. The usage of quick wit, old-fashioned humour and that Shakespearean touch, he is able to create a character that lights up every scene. Then there's the moustache. It needs its own casting credit. It's magnificent. I just wanted him to interrogate a passenger and exclaim ""I moustache you a question, but I'll shave it for later"". His directing style, yet again, is understated and a beauty to behold. A super nice long exterior take as Poirot walks along each carriage of the train. Bird's Eye view of the crime scene as Poirot investigates. Majestic landscape shots as the train passes by. I adored it. Then there's the cast. Wow. Many A-Listers and many thespians to assist in Branagh's portrayal. The whole story has this old-school charm to it that made it utterly watchable. Yes there are a few pacing issues and the culprit's reveal might be slightly underwhelming and totally convenient, but to pluck up the courage and adapt this heavily beloved story is an achievement. This could've been terrible. Branagh modifies the story to make it feel fresh and it works on every level. Who needs superhero blockbusters when you can have a murder mystery with developed and memorable characters."

"MihaiSorinToma","7","2","6","30 November 2017"," A missed opportunity
","After solving yet another mystery, the famous detective, Hercule Poirot, travels with the Orient Express to a distant location for his next case. What he's about to encounter is a deep mystery which involves a murder with many connections and apparently, a culprit which is hard to find. Together with a friend who happens to be the owner of the train, he must investigate, interrogate all passengers and find the killer before the train reaches the next station, while being derailed due to harsh, winter conditions.<br/><br/>It's a remake of an adaptation of a famous book with the same name by Agatha Christie which presents a very strange case of a murder which will prove to be much complex and hard to solve than ever expected. What it originally seems to be another episode of Poirot slowly turns to something more deep, every character seeming to be a possible killer with a motive of his own. It keeps the mystery until the end, generating suspense along the way until the unexpected finale (at least if this is the first adaptation you see).<br/><br/>Overall it's a good watch, especially if you're fond of this genre, but you may find a couple of issues or dislikes like I did, which somehow managed to spoil the overall experience. The worst of all was Poirot's character, with his over-prolonged or double mustache, which simply wasn't on par with the strong, perfect man which the famous detective accustomed us. He often seemed rushed and unconvincing, although the insisted on his perfectionist side, which is rather disappointing when considering his fame. Another bad aspect would be the fact that not all other characters seem to be as well described as they could or should, even seeming out of the picture at times, with too few scenes that would make them important in the conclusion. It left a sense of superficiality which is hard to miss in such films and as a result, the final product seemed to lack in this aspects.<br/><br/>It's a good movie with Poirot but unfortunately nothing spectacular, contrary to its impressing cast. It could have been a lot better if it had a much credible and imposing main character and more attention paid to the characters and even the plot."
"classicalsteve","7","2","6","27 November 2017"," Decent Updating of the Agatha Christie Masterpeace is Not Quite as Mysterious as the 1974 Version
","It's difficult to improve upon the original ""Murder on the Orient Express"" film of 1974. Some aspects are slightly improved while others suffer. I give Branagh some credit for engaging in this project while simultaneously it seemed that a remake which is not as good as the original may have been ill-conceived. The original 1974 film is, by far, the best murder mystery ever shot. Sort of like remaking ""Star Wars IV: A Good Hope"". What's the point? Given there are many great Agatha Christie books which have not yet had large-screen treatment (the David Suchet series was meant for television), it seems Branagh could have chosen another one. And there are other large screen productions which could be greatly improved upon, such as the Peter Ustinov ""Death on the Nile"". <br/><br/>A quick run down of the story. Hercule Poirot, vacationing in Istanbule, is called to take a case back in London. He is to board the Orient Express back to Western Europe. (The Orient Express is a luxury train which runs from Western Europe to the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. Today it can cost as much as $1000+ per day.) All expenses paid, he ""runs into"" several of the quirky characters which are also taking the train. He can't secure a first class compartment right away because the train is full and has to settle for a second class cabin with a roommate. <br/><br/>The train gets on its way, and Samuel Ratchett (Johnny Depp), a rather grumpy antiques dealer, asks for Poirot to take his case. He's been receiving death threats and desires Poirot to help him for $15,000, which would be a king's ransom in 1934, or about $275,000 in today's money. The next night, the train is moving through the snow-clad alps of Central Europe. Some strange things are happening near Poirot's compartment, such as someone who rings for the assistant conductor, and someone leaves another compartment, apparently a woman wearing a flowing dressing gown with a dragon emblazoned on the back. <br/><br/>The next day, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his compartment. The son of the train owners, Bouc (Tom Bateman), pleads with Poirot to take the case to save the train from the disruption of a government investigation. At the same time, the train has hit an avalanche is unable to move forward. The Belgian sleuth reluctantly takes the case. Will he be able to solve the mystery before authorities arrive?<br/><br/>I'll start with the good. Kenneth Branagh, given he will be inevitably compared to Albert Finney and David Suchet, arguably the two best Hercule Poirot's of all-time, makes for a memorable Belgian detective (not French). His performance as everyone's favorite European continental sleuth is definitely better than the choice of Peter Ustinov, who came off like a cross between Poirot, Nero and Mussorgsky in two Agatha Christie films in the 1970's. Branagh more or less pulls it off. His is not a Poirot which will win him any acting trophies (Finney was nominated for both an Academy Award and a BFTA Award for Best Actor for the same part in 1974), but it's definitely not the worst. The cinematography is also exceptional when paired with CGI makes for some spectacular scenes of the Austrian/Swiss alps. Depp is fairly good as Ratchett, and Wilem Dafoe makes a good Gerhard Hardman.<br/><br/>The not so good. There was far more mystery in the original than in the present offering. The Daisy Armstrong case, loosely inspired by the Lindbergh Kidnapping case which was recent to the first edition of Christie's novel, was presented in the original with much more dynamic flair. Newsreel type footage shows the case at the beginning while in this offering, the case is revealed through what appear to be home movies. <br/><br/>Some scenes were a bit melodramatic. I love Michelle Pfeiffer, but here her Mrs. Hubbard is not quite as interesting as her counterpart from the 1970's, Lauren Becall. Pfeiffer's Hubbard becomes over-the-top melodramatic towards the end while Becall's becomes the opposite when things are revealed. Again, a difficult act to follow. Judi Dench as the Russian Princess Dragomiroff didn't have much screen time. In the original, played by Wendy Hiller, Hiller almost steals the show, and keeps up strive for strive with Albert Finney. Even Sean Connery's famous scene in the 1974 film where he, as Colonel Arbuthnot says ""...are you suggesting that I'm fool enough to have entered Ratchett's cabin, murdered him, cleaned my 'peep', and dropped it into the ash tray on my way out?"" Sadly this line was absent from this new production. Unfortunately, I found the final solution less captivating than the original of 1974.<br/><br/>Again, a decent one-watch, but it only made me long to see the original 1974 film. This film is good, make no mistake. But it didn't quite have the wit of the original. Strangely, this film was a bit humorless, save for an opening sequence (not in the book) where Poirot solves a crime in Instanbul. I found that sequence more compelling than a lot of other things in the rest of the film."

This is not to say that the film is ever boring; however, one is advised to board this train with a tall coffee and an empty bladder.<br/><br/>The train-car set used throughout the film is truly gorgeous. With all its clever camera work and CGI blending, I wonder if National Geographic was behind this film. Cinematography alone earns this film several stars... and probably an Oscar. With all its clever lighting, perspective, and composition, ""Murder"" would actually hold up well in black & white.<br/><br/>Don't hold the mega cast against this film; they aren't there so much to dazzle you as to support a story in which everyone truly matters. Even if you know that story, you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>If only the wind-up weren't quite so long and labored, this could be a five-star film. I think Messr.

","I went into Murder on the Orient Express pretty cynically. Another Hollywood remake. Another Kenneth Branagh costume drama. Another packed cast getting mediocre reviews. I thought, at best, it would be an empty, simple and silly little way to kill an afternoon. I was basically rightbut through the high-pitched performances, twisting mystery and loving direction, this captivating yarn slowly but surely overwhelmed my doubts and won me over. Master and enigmatic Detective Hercule Poirot is sucked into a job while on vacation, wherein a man on his train has been murdered, and one of the other passengers is the murderer. The cast is chockfull of talent, which lends to the action-packed fun; not ""action-packed"" like a Marvel flick, but more in the puzzlement, patter and performances. It's wonderfully old-fashioned in that and so many other ways: the regal look; the wry, almost poetic dialogue (""There was right, there was wrong, and now there is you""); the Shakespearean melodrama. The only thing I wish is Branagh and the studio would've shot it all, not just the flashbacks, in black-and-white, to really give it that classic, larger-than-life hutzpah. Now before you think I'm blind to its faults, let me reassure you. The cinematography, while often beautiful, is just as often obnoxious. The CGI train and scenery shots are jarringly cartoonish. The final explanation to the whodunit is more than a bit convoluted. However, the power and fun Branagh imbues in his films and actors make this a train trip I would love to take myself again and againthough only in movie form. The murder might not be as fun in real life."

","Full disclosure, I never read the book or saw the original movie that every other reviewer has mentioned. Obviously I am going to track it down soon. Because of this my impressions of the movie are from the point of view of someone who had no idea what to expect, only that someone was murdered on a train in the 1930s and a quirky genius guy was there to find out who.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed this movie, and was impressed by the way the film pulled me into the world it sets up. The sets are spectacular and the CGI is stunning without being over the top. The impressive cast did not put on their best performances, although there were not a lot of lines or screen time for any individual (besides Kenneth Branagh) to work with. Branagh did an outstanding job and I found his character walked the line between being eccentric and unbearable just right.<br/><br/>As someone who was unfamiliar with the plot, I can see why the book was popular and now has two movies. It is very exciting and fun to follow. Many reviewers are complaining that there never should have been a remake, but I feel there is enough of an audience in the same situation as me to bring fresh eyes and excitement. I loved the movie and would gladly see it again.<br/><br/>Also, my mom has read the book and seen the original movie, so she knew the plot and still sat wide eyed next to me the entire time. I think this movie has a lot to offer and would recommend it to anyone looking for an escape into a high class world of mystery from a time before electronics solved crimes."
"BadSausages","5","2","6","16 November 2017"," Disappointing (some comments may be considered spoilers)
","Beautiful sets, especially of train cars. But, other than the first two scenes, and first few minutes, of the film, in Jerusalem and Istanbul, all we see are four train cars: the Pullman Coach (sleeping compartments); the Dining Car; the luggage car (briefly); and the bar car. Almost all of the film takes place in the sleeping and dining cars. These are very narrow, confined spaces. So, the action is very limited. This isn't an action movie. But all that anyone can do is stand or lie down in a compartment in the sleeping car, stand or sit in the dining car. We're not talking about the absence of running, jumping, chasing, or whatever. We're talking about the near absence of body movement. Head turn. Vertical arm movement. Maybe a small hand gesture.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, of course. Top notch cast. The main cast (Detective Poirot, the Victim, and the Usual Suspects) includes Legends Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi, Stars Kenneth Branagh, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, Establisheds Josh Gad, Olivia Colman, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Marwan Kenzari, Lucy Boynton, and Leslie Odom, Jr., and Newcomers Sergei Polunin and Daisy Ridley.<br/><br/>I'm familiar with the works of the Legends and the Stars. I'm not at all familiar with the works of the Establisheds. I saw clips of Josh Gad in the abomination that is Disney's live-action Beauty and the Beast. Not particularly impressive, but that's no surprise given the vehicle. But I liked Gad's performance here. I liked everyone's performance. Never heard of Sergei Polunin. And, no particular reason, I don't expect to hear of him again. Among the Establisheds, it seems to me, Gad and Odom are the two most upwardly mobile.<br/><br/>Ridley's only other film work, of course, I know. Really no surprise that she, rather than some other similar age actress with more film credits (and I mean no one in particular), is here. Ridley held her own in good company. She, too, seems to be upwardly mobile.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there wasn't much for any of the actors to do. I've never read the book and I've never (unless I've surpassed the memory of it) seen the 1974 film or any other adaptation. From what I understand, this is pretty much the standard version. Nothing unusual. Which makes me wonder why anyone cares at all. I found the story to be not at all interesting.<br/><br/>The film has two components: physical searching for clues; and interviews with the suspects.<br/><br/>Every interview goes like this<br/><br/>Poirot: ""Who are you and why are you on this train?""<br/><br/>Person: ""I'm person X, profession Y, going to Z for A reason.""<br/><br/>Poirot: ""No. You are person M, profession N. You are lying. And you are a suspect.""<br/><br/>There are 13 of these. Maybe a quarter of the film.<br/><br/>(Possible Spoiler) I thought the solution was obvious before the halfway mark. I mean, after two or three interviews of suspects, it became, ""WTF? Is anyone not ...?"" And the answer is, ""No. Everyone is ..."" Which doesn't leave anything to the imagination.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of mystery fiction. I haven't read any. I have no intention of reading any. I've seen some TV mysteries: Columbo (not whodunit, but howcatchim); Murder She Wrote (my mother loved this, of course); miscellaneous others over the years. It seems to me, a good mystery doesn't drop all the clues at the beginning, but drops them in what seems to be a natural sequence.<br/><br/>I don't know how this story was told in writing or previous adaptations, but it seems to me the writers of this film should have rearranged things quite a bit. There were no really dramatic moments. No ahas. The actors weren't part of a cohesive whole story. They didn't interact in any meaningful way. There weren't dialogues so much as a bunch of brief monologues or just statements.<br/><br/>(Compare, for example, with the scene in You've Got Mail where Meg Ryan, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, and Heather Burns are standing at the cash register talking about the rooftop killer. I like these actors. But a scene from a silly little comedy shouldn't be, but is, better than any scene in MotOE 2017.)<br/><br/>And some of the things that people say and do, maybe they're supposed to be red herrings, but, in the end, they just don't fit. For example, papers being destroyed to prevent discovery of a crime that the criminal had no reason to commit; and one person taking blame for what another person has been accused of doing, even though the blame-taker knows the other person didn't do what the person has been accused of doing, and neither of these people handle the situation in a (dramatically) reasonable way. Worst of all, when these things are happening, we already know they aren't correct or relevant.<br/><br/>(Possible Spoiler) The only dramatic moments are those that appear in one of the trailers; about 60 seconds of a two hour film.<br/><br/>And who the hell is Katherine? or Catherine?"

","Dear oh dear. What an ordeal. The pictures were pretty in some sort of vulgar way, but this film really can't hold a candle to the David Suchet version from 2006 which, in my opinion, exceeds the rather drab 1974 version with Albert Finney (I never saw the 2001 Alfred Molina version). <br/><br/>What's wrong with the new Branagh version? Really, other posters have said it all. The script stinks, mainly because it's as subtle as a kick in the butt, especially in its attempts to be politically correct. Just to name one instance, in this version Mary Debenham is in love with a black doctor, and Hercule Poirot advises her to come clean since ""this is not America"", as if the US had the market cornered concerning mixed-race marriage. By all means, do let's forget the 1919 race riots in Britain and that the Nuremberg Laws were just around the corner, for all to see, in 1934 when the film is set. And somehow, in between the postcard-pretty pictures and the political correctness, the plot is avalanched. Nobody really cares whodunit or worries one jot about any of the characters, and when Hercule Poirot advises the murderers to shoot him to escape the noose, it occurs to you that it would have been a blessing if they had done so 90 minutes ago. The sporadic forays into action scenes only help to remind us how far Ian Fleming is removed from Agatha Christie. Not that Christie is a master novelist; her plots are often hopelessly contrived and needs help from filmmakers, and never more so than in ""Orient Express."" Several films have succeeded in coming to her aid. This doesn't."

","It was Mrs.Peacock in the conservatory with a dagger!<br/><br/>Everyone loves a good murder mystery, this film allows the audience to watch the mystery unravel before their eyes as if they were playing the classic board game of Clue. Murder on the Orient Express was written in 1934 by Agatha Christie, is one of the most well known mystery novels of all time. Kenneth Branagh brings this clue-like murder mystery novel to life. Branagh stars as Hercule Poirot, the worlds greatest detective looking to take a much needed vacation after solving a theft in Jerusalem. During his travels, Hercule runs into his old friend Bouc, who happens to be the director of The Orient Express, he is offered a room on the train after receiving a case from London. <br/><br/>Once aboard the Orient Express, Hercule is met with thirteen unlikely strangers together just for the sake of traveling. One of the first characters we meet is Mr.Ratchett (Johny Depp) a business man who had made many enemies in his line of work. He had begun receiving life threatening letters and asked Hercule if he could be his body guard. Hercule declined and that same night the train was thrown off the tracks due to an avalanche and Mr.Ratchett was murdered. It was clear to Hercule that the murderer was still aboard the train and he must find his killer before they kill again. <br/><br/>The Orient Express is the setting for the remainder of the film, this luxurious and gorgeous train transports you back to the 1930s. The film was shot using 65mm lens which allowed for brighter colors, texture, and emphasized the significance of lighting. The use of lighting in this film had to take you back to the 1930s and that's just what it did. The 1930s primarily focused on the use of high-key lighting, this is often unflattering and can be difficult to work with. However, Branagh uses this lighting to his advantage and brings out the beauty of every character. The music in this film was transcendent and brought you back to the 1930s with music by Patrick Doyle. His classical style of music was a perfect fit for the movie and time period it represented.<br/><br/>The breath taking long shots bring you aboard the Orient Express with the rest of the cast. The entrance onto the Orient Express is a two and a half minute continuous shot that is very well choreographed. This shot introduces the characters that will be riding along with Hercule, this single shot brings you through the entire train and gives you the feeling that you are actually aboard. This single shot was by fair the most impressive shot taken during this film, to have all the characters in the perfect spots and to move at the appropriate times in order to get just two minutes of film must have taken days. This shot used elaborate blocking elements such as other characters, windows, and props to signify the camera movements, in this shot the characters become apart of the mise-en-scene. The significance of using the continuous shot gives the scene a seamless view and really allows the audience to focus on the beauty of the set and emphasizes the mise-en-scene. The cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos also uses the reflection made by windows to create the divided personality of good vs evil within the characters<br/><br/>This film has beautiful scenery, amazing shots, music that transports you, and breath taking lighting. However, your enjoyment will be dependent on your familiarity with the story, this remake feels as if its main focus was to showcase the stars of this film. Having read the book and seeing the original film, the typical final lineup scene of the suspects felt over dramatized and used to emphasize the talents of each actor. But if you are unfamiliar with the killer and are still engulfed by the mystery, then the resolution will blow you away. The final resolution brings forth character development for Hercule and ends the film on a positive note. With this being said, the experience of viewing this film allows for the audience to escape their own reality and take a trip back in time, which is the sole purpose of film."
"John-564-342449","6","2","6","11 November 2017"," The 65mm cinematography is marvelous, but Sidney Lumet's 1974 version is still superior
","The only reason, why I write a review for this rather mediocre film is the stunning 65mm cinematography. <br/><br/>I've seen it on a big screen, sitting in the center close to the screen and it was visually very impressive: The amount of detail you get with 65mm is astonishing and a reminder of how poor many digitally shot movies look today compared with 'the good old days'. The actors' skin looks organic, the highlights are not 'blown out' and you see a great richness in color and contrast. Because the movie demands for splendid production design and costumes, the 65mm can shine in its full glory.<br/><br/>Like Kenneth Branagh's update of ""Sleuth"" before, this is an inferior and misjudged version of well-known source material. In this case, Branagh was a victim of the Baz-Luhrmann-school: The direction forces a comical style on the material, that's too over-the-top even for Agatha Christie's rather artificial murder mysteries. No, I'm not only talking about the now infamous mustache of Poirot, which is so absurd-looking, that it distracts from the story, but everything else is slightly off, including the good cast, which does not compare to Lumet's 1974 ensemble. Lumet's film is a small masterpiece of direction and ensemble acting, where every element is in its place and the plot works. I still remember how much fun it was watching it on TV as a child. And it was so well told, that I understood the rather complicated plot then, but now - even as an adult who knew the story - I found it hard to follow. You really get the feeling, that neither the screenwriter nor the director are especially interested in the mystery aspect of the story. They focus instead on grotesque behavior, funny accents, racism in 1930s Europe and all looking 'postcard good'. And it does, but people who see this expect some excitement and elegant storytelling, too. <br/><br/>Sure, some people already know the ending and the movie is easy to spoil, but a huge part of the young audience didn't read the novel or saw the other versions, so there would still be the possibility of a great mystery. I don't understand, why they cared more for comic effect than suspense and surprise. The audience is smarter than that and deserves better...<br/><br/>Reading Agatha Christie and seeing Lumet's adaptation is like assisting Hercule Poirot in solving a crime. That's the fun of it: You usually get all the information you need to participate and it usually plays fair with the logical conclusions, even if it's far-fetched. But in this movie the mystery is told so fast, that there is no chance of participating - and therefore no suspense. This movie fails at understanding the appeal of Agatha Christie novels. It was never the mustache. <br/><br/>And the few inventions by the screenwriter, that are not part of Agatha Christie's novel as far as I remember, are trying to make Hercule Poirot's character 'more complex', I think, but that's not the point of Christie. Poirot is only an avatar for the audience who wants to assist in solving an exciting mystery. Poirot is not the center, therefore all additional scenes to give him a 'character journey', to introduce him in Jerusalem and give him a 'big dramatic speech' at the end are distracting additions, because it all takes away from the mystery-solving-fun. The storytelling is out of balance. I'm pretty sure, Agatha Christie would have hated this one.<br/><br/>Recommended mostly for the 65mm imagery and the production design and costumes, but don't forget to see Sidney Lumet's superior version, too."

"ranblackman","6","1","2","25 April 2019"," Not too good, I do prefer the original.
","This film, from renowned actor\director Kenneth Branagh, is sorta let down for many reasons. First, it makes far too many unnecessary changes. The ending, in my opinion, was done so much better in Lumet's original, it's much more subtle. While the ending here has pretty much the same meaning, it's a little overdone and melodramatic. The directing as well I feel is a bit on the showy side, lots of weird angles that don't seem to serve any sort of a creative purpose, other than to show off how clever the cameramen can frame scenery.<br/><br/>Speaking of the scenery, that's where I will lead into my positives. This film is gorgeous, the winter months, the sense of isolation, even the way the trial is filmed in these are damn good, as are some of the cities and locations we visit at the beginning. The acting as well is across the board impressive. We have to likes Of Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Jonny Depp, Penelope Cruz, and even Josh Gadd, an actor most known for his more comedic roles, is even good here. The weakest length is, unfortunately, our leading man, his accent was kind of overdone to me, he has his moments, and I would not call him bad, but that was a distraction.<br/><br/>All in all, this film really did not need to be made. The only reason I can think off is maybe Branagh wanted to make a closer adaptation of the book by Agatha Christie, which is a sound reason to do a film like this, however, I've heard it's not that at all, (I kind of have to trust other readers here, as I have not read it myself, for the time being). That's kind of the biggest problem with it. It has its good qualities and is perfectly watchable, but it fails to have any sort of a reason to exist. I would say it a rental, but I am more inclined to persuade you to rent the original film."

","I've never been a fan of murder mysteries, especially where murder seems to be so contained and their explanations seem to be so rational. Yet, I very much enjoyed the ride here, the absolute attention to historic detail, the train, the time period, Hercule Poirot's French accent, his occasional and natural use of French, his idiosyncratic passion for Dickens, his outrageous mustache, his strict moral code, the extraordinary murder plot, the endless characters, and of course his investigation, which leaves no stone unturned. Many found this movie boring or even unlikeable, but I was captivated from beginning to end with just about everything, especially Branaugh's performance and the fact that he directed and produced the whole thing. Bravo!"

","Kenneth Branagh is a great artist and his interpretation of Agatha Christie's famous detective is more than passable. This is a great looking film and the actor's presence alone gives it an old school charm. Perhaps the most welcome thing about Murder on the Orient Express is the big-budget foray into a genre that motion pictures have all-but-forgotten: the classic murder mystery. The film isn't too long to wear out its welcome and there's something impressive about being surrounded by such impeccable detail and so many familiar faces. Although the film will work considerably better for newcomers to the story, there's enough here to appeal to veterans. And, although Branagh is no Suchet, he's good enough for us to accept him, if for only two hours, as one of Agatha Christie's two celebrated detectives. Just for not being a superhero or other CGI laden half assed effort I suggest you go and watch Kenneth Branagh's Murder on Orient Express."

"Thanos_Alfie","7","1","2","5 October 2018"," Hercule Poirot on duty...
","""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a Mystery and Crime movie which is based upon the novel of Agatha Christie. In this movie, we watch Hercule Poirot trying to get some free time after all the cases that he has solved but eventually he is recruited to solve one more. While he is traveling with Orient Express, the train accidentally gets stopped because of a small avalanche. This is the start of his investigation because Hercule Poirot knew from the start that a murder was planned and he wants to find out who is that person on this train who was able of committing such a crime. <br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had a very good plot and the storyline was simply breathtaking. The interpretation of Kenneth Branagh who played as Hercule Poirot was very good and I also liked the interpretations of Daisy Ridley who played as Miss Mary Debenham, Leslie Odom Jr. who played as Dr. Arbuthnot and Judi Dench who played as Princess Dragomiroff. I have to admit that the direction which was made by Kenneth Branagh was very interesting and gave the audience a different perspective of seeing some scenes in the movie and of course made them change their view of understanding who committed this crime.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe that ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a great movie to watch because it has a very interesting plot with many plot twists that will keep you alert and you won't get bored at all. I have to say that if you are a fan of mystery movies then this is your movie but even if you are not, give it a try and I am sure you won't regret it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much."
"jmec-49547","9","1","2","29 September 2018"," Don't believe the negative reviews, this is an original take on a well known mystery
","I have to say I couldn't disagree more with a lot of the reviews on here slating this film, to the point that I'm writing review which I seldom do. The comparisons with the 1974 Albert Finney version are by and large baffling. Yes, it had an excellent cast, but Albert Finney as Poirot was not one of them and was thoroughly annoying and far too shouty throughout. Brannagh in contrast offers us the Belgian detective in a much more measured way with a smooth combination of deduction, wit and measured anger when required. The cast of this version are largely excellent too and do not let the film down, and Johnny Depp exudes understated menace. Visually the movie is stunning and the way it is filmed is varied and original giving you the impression at times that you are eavesdropping and observing private conversations. Most watchers may well know the story but the suspense is still there nonetheless despite what other naysayers may contest. This was a cinematic delight, and all the more a pleasant surprise because I do know the story. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed!"
"Tweekums","8","1","2","20 September 2018"," An enjoyable murder mystery with a famous twist
","Following a prologue, where Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, exposes a thief in Jerusalem, our protagonist heads to Istanbul where he boards the Orient Express, bound for London. After dinner he is approached by a man who claims to be an antiques dealer who feels in danger after selling dodgy goods to the wrong people. Poirot declines the request for help. The following night the train is derailed by an avalanche; when the compartments are checked the man is found dead... with multiple stab wounds. Poirot is soon investigating; the problem isn't a shortage of clues but an excess... each pointing to a different suspect. Before the case is solved he will uncover truths about the dead man and how various people on board are connected to him.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see just how unpopular this film appears to be as I really enjoyed it; perhaps that was because it was quite a while since I'd seen any other Poirot mystery so could accept Kenneth Branagh, and his ridiculous moustache, in the role. Despite knowing who did it before watching the story was fun to watch. The case provides plenty of clues to keep our protagonist, and the viewer, guessing. Even if you know how it ends seeing how that conclusion is reached is entertaining. The all-star cast does a fine job bringing their somewhat over-the-top characters to life. The opening scenes are somewhat superfluous for anybody familiar with Poirot but serves as a nice demonstration of how quick thinking he is for viewers new to the character. Overall I'd say this was an enjoyable film but acknowledge that may be a minority opinion."

The story has a lot of holes for someone not familiar with this novel or older adaptations. There are no any explanation of Poirot conclusion. The thing that bothered me the most is main character - Poirot. The actor was trying, but it was simply not good enough. His english with French accent is more like english with Polish (reminded me a lot of John Malchovich) . It was really bad and obviously this role did not fit to its actor.

","One of the passengers on board the exquisite Orient Express is murdered, and only the legendary detective skills of Hercule Poirot can bring justice. Every face should be familiar as the phenomenal cast are put against Poirot's line of questioning.<br/><br/>
The biggest draw to this film is undoubtedly the cast. Each member gets their chance to shine from relative newcomers like Daisy Ridley to seasoned professionals in the shape of Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi. Meanwhile, the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Johnny Depp, Willem Defoe, Josh Gad and of course Kenneth Branagh mean you're never wanting for talent on the screen - the sumptuous 1930s costumes and set decorations also mean there's always something interesting to look at.<br/><br/>As characters are introduced across the opening 30 minutes, it's interesting viewing until one of their fellow travellers is brutally stabbed in a frenzied attack. It'll be lazy to simply say it runs out of steam or comes off the tracks once the titular murder is committed, but there's no other way to describe the middle portion of the film.<br/><br/>One by one, Poirot interrogates the passengers and begins to piece together what happened on the night of the slaying, but it feels more like the actors are being paraded to do their bit to camera and then promptly leave, rarely to be seen again. That said, it's fun for the audience to play along since nothing is confirmed or denied until the final act when the suspects are confronted by the detective. Without wanting to spoil the end (as I'm sure there are people, like me, who don't know the outcome in the book), the pay-off is ultimately worth the wait and even a little clever.<br/><br/>This Agatha Christie adaptation is sure to be the first of a series which will see her moustached detective (hell, is he moustached!) solving cases all over the world. Indeed, the closing scene shows that they're planning for the famed Belgian sluice to go to Egypt next. If what follows is anything like this initial helping, it will be a nice alternative to the samey Marvel mush.<br/><br/>Best Quote: ""Some men have a good look. All they have to do is keep their mouth shut and they can take home any prize they want. Still the mouth opens."""

The film is enjoyable enough but I'm glad I didn't pay cinema prices to see it. 
I guess it will probably more acceptable to younger Christie fans who haven't seen Sidney Lumet's 1974 classic with its fabulous ensemble cast and sumptuous settings.
All in all, compared to the earlier version, it's just a bit lacklustre.
That said, I'm looking forward to remake of Death on the Nile and hoping that the producers stick more closely to the original story."

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. In truth a highlight for me was in the VD ""extras"", old clips of Agatha Christie herself explaining her writing and where inspirations came from.<br/><br/>This is a sort of vanity project for Kenneth Branagh, directing and also starring as Hercule Poirot, a fictional character who is the best detective in the world. He sounds French but he is from Belgium where, near the French border, they speak French.<br/><br/>The term ""Orient"" has not meant the same thing in all historical times. Derived from the Latin it vaguely refers to places East of Europe. The Orient Express in this story is carrying mostly Brits and Europeans from Turkey to Calais for an eventual leg to England or Germany.<br/><br/>So Poirot and others board the train and at night a notorious man is found murdered. Poirot's task is to use all his detective skill to solve the murder. It is eventually solved but the real entertainment are the characters themselves.

"FamousGirlfriend","5","1","2","3 March 2018"," Not a Poirot we wanted or even needed, but a brief moment of entertainment
","This film isn't awful. It just terribly disappointing. It had lots of potential, the actors were doing fine, the scenery is pretty and there was obviously lots of money put into the project. <br/><br/>Branagh's take on the character of Poirot isn't that bad. His accent needs some work and the fact that Poirot is vain and as meticulous with his appearance as with everything else, should have been noted. Poirot dyes his hair dark and has those dandy moustaches, that old Western movie moustache of his doesn't really fit the character. Apart from this, Branagh's Poirot is NOT bad. If you look back at Peter Ustinov's Poirot in Death on the Nile from 1978 you see that Branagh's Poirot is more true to the books. <br/><br/>Death on the Nile from 1978 was well-made and well-written, though. Murder on the Orient Express is messy, script, cinematography and all! The landscapes and surroundings are oftentimes beautiful, and some of the shots are really great. However, very often it feels like the director of photography, or whoever, didn't really know how to make the shot or when to cut. Sometimes a shot starts out beautifully and leads us in a grandiose way just to break off and end in some dubious jump cut. It's so anticlimactic.<br/><br/>In the very beginning, Poirot's quirky personality gets pushed down our throats - with commentary! You really don't have to be TOLD why he does things the way he does, just show it. That's one of the benefits of this new hot thing called Moving Pictures, you can give the audience a chance to watch, think, understand, instead of just telling it to them as if they were unintelligent children. It's a detective story, if there's no mystery, there's no point.<br/><br/>While the original detective story is dark and chilly as well as intelligent and comedic, this take on Murder on the Orient Express is far less about uncovering the mystery of the murder and the mystery of human nature, and more about an ensemble cast in an adventure flick, a bit like Indiana Jones. Branagh's Poirot is very nimble for being an old man. <br/><br/>Then there are the things that are just plain stupid. The film hints at the possibility of a sequel, a death has occurred on the Nile, but that's ludicrous, since Poirot was present while that death occurred in Death on the Nile, not snowed in in Yugoslavia. And while I accept the artistic freedom when making the Swedish character Greta Ohlsson a Spanish subject, why naming her Pilar Estravados, as is the name of one of the major characters in the book ""Poirot's Christmas""? Are these supposed to be clever nods to Christie fans? Because as a fan, I just find them idiotic and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Though I wouldn't mind seeing Branagh reprise his role as Hercules Poirot, some adjustments should be made, but most of all: take care when adapting the stories! Agatha Christie wrote simple, fun and clever books, stick to that. Don't try to put in old flames of Poirot's in dusty picture frames and other pointless things into the film just because you can. If you want to change something for artistic purposes, be sure that you know what and how to do it. The British Poirot series have made countless changes during the series run from 1989-2014. That's right. Watch that if you haven't already."

","With all due respect to Mr. Branagh's ilustrious career as actor and director, one question arises in my mind: WHY? Why ruin an exceptional book, and a brilliant who-dunnit plot, only for the ambition of YOU playing the Master of little grey cells? Yes, Albert Finney played a poor Poirot in 1974, mumbling around and shouting, but the assembly cast was remarkable: starting with easy-to-hate Ratchett/Widmark, to the other exceptional actors. Of course, the 2010 version, with David Suchet ((= Hercule Poirot as would've been blessed by Dame Agatha Christie herself...) was the most accurate, from start to finish, beautifully played (even there, were some weak characters but, Poirot WAS top of the act). Now? Poirot involved in fist fighting, holding a gun (?), watching with deer-like eyes to his lost love Katherine (not Vera Rossakoff, everyone?). climbing on top of the train, Arbuthnot changed as rase and behaviour (sorry, Mr. Connery!), Penelope Cruz was not a good choice, even Johnny Depp plays a poor Cassetti, going down the hill, and easily forgotten, the Andrenyi guy a martial arts expert (really?!) and, of course, THE moustache (like a cavalry colonel in India or Burma, in late 20's). Of course, some hints of a different view on the plot arised from the trailer, a while ago but, come on, folks! Sorry, but I think I've lost 114' of my life, watching this poorly directed/played so-called ""remake"". Unfortunately, the world of cinema continues to go down, slowly, living out of remakes (Death Wish on the run, right?), poor acting, and vision lost. Hardly a fresh adaptation of a brilliant book: where is the thrill of any Poirot mystery? Long gone, after the 25 years Poirot/Suchet reign, sorry. The Sherlock Holmes from Guy Ritchie was not Jeremy Brett, but it was fun to watch. This one, no.

It gets so carried away on landscape and cinematography that it forgets to engage and immerse us in to this story that should have had me at the edge of my seat waiting to find out the killer, instead of waiting for them to just get to the punchline. <br/><br/>As well as that, they did not take enough advantage of their fantastic cast. The likes of Judi Dench and Johnny Depp are wasted in this movie, playing characters that are given no scope, and they get nothing to do. I understand that Branagh wanted a star studded cast, but a lot of these characters simply are not given enough to do, leaving Oscar calibre performers in the gutter. <br/><br/>Has its moments, but not enough of them. Murder on the Orient Express certainly thinks it is a lot more exciting than it is, worth a look if you are a fan of the novel, but if you are looking to be thrilled, you have many, far better options. <br/><br/>
A detective must try and solve the murder of a wealthy gentleman aboard a train with many suspects. <br/><br/>

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","30 November 2017"," Kenneth Branagh's semi-serious, welcomed alternative to Sydney Lumet's frolic version
","Although there had been several renditions of this Agatha Christie's all-time classic (on both movie and TV screens), Sydney Lumet's 1974 star-studded work is the best known. Branagh, in his ever-soaring undauntable spirit for adventure, after tackling such varieties as Sleuth, Thor, Jack Ryan and Cinderella, now turns to Christie. While he hasn't exactly attempt a stunt of Christie-to-Shakespeare conversion, his MOTOE comes with a moody, philosophical edge that is a welcomed alternative to Lumet's pure fun version. Well, maybe not.<br/><br/>Two of Christie's best-known work, ""And then there were none"" and MOTOE, have similar settings: predetermined large number of suspects (10 and 12 respectively), enclosed environment (island and stranded train) where the murder(s) occurred. There are also marked differences. In the former, characters are murdered one after another. Here, there is only one murder, and a detective happens to be on hand.<br/><br/>Illustrious private investigator Hercules Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), while taking a well-earned rest on the opulent Orient Express from Istanbul to the French coast, is approached by fellow-passenger Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) who offers a princely sum to hire him as bodyguard. Ratchett has made many enemies in his shady business dealings and has recently received threatening notes. Poirot flatly declines. Overnight, two unrelated events occur. First. the train derails but no one was hurt. Ratchett, however, is found dead in his cabin, with multiple stabbed wounds. Reluctantly, Poirot accepts the case. Ratchett's secret identity is soon unveiled: a notorious criminal at large, who kidnapped and murdered a little girl Daisy Armstrong in a sensational case some years back. That one crime set off tragic chain events and several other deaths (victim's pregnant mother, father, initially wrongly accused party) and ruined more lives. Then, one by one, fellow passengers are traced back to someone who had suffered from the Armstrong case. Everyone had motive and opportunity.<br/><br/>As mentioned, Director Lumet took a light approach, aptly matched by Albert Finney's slightly caricatural portrayal of Poirot. Branagh, the director as well as the actor, takes a different (more serious, for want of a better word) approach. The fun is still there, but there are shades of melancholic as well as dark moods and emotions.<br/><br/>First, we have a very different Poirot here, Belgian accent notwithstanding. At the beginning, his eccentric insistence on ""balancing"" is depicted humorously, even farcically. His breakfast eggs must be identical twins. After stepping accidentally on a pile of animal manure, he cheerfully steps on it again, with the other foot! But ""balancing"" takes on a different shade towards the end, culminating in his agonizing struggle between legal justice and human compassion. And then, the biggest difference: poignancy is palpable every time he stares at the pocket portrait of deceased wife Catherine, murmuring her name.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Branagh's endeavor to give this familiar classic is new look, both visually and substantially, is evident. There are things he has done that clearly had not been contemplated by Christie, or Lumet, for that matter. Here are a few examples.<br/><br/>The murder scene is first introduced from OUTSIDE the victim's cabin: the audience see nothing, only hear the characters' description. Later, a bloody (but not necessarily gory) visual is shown as a direct overhead shot of the victim lying on his bed in the chamber. Variety is introduced to the scenes on questioning the various suspects. There is one sequence with three of them covered in parallel, quick inter-cutting short scenes. Another one takes place in the snowbound outdoors, on two facing chairs across a table, set up in front of a train tunnel some distance from the derailed train. Still another one is in the private car of an aristocratic couple who, with diplomatic immunity, never appear in public, until the very end. Most impressive is the ""final solution"" scene, where the suspects sit behind a long table set up at the entrance of the said tunnel. Just a fraction of a second after encountering this visual, you can't help but have the Last Supper conjured up in your mind. Personally speaking, all of the above have their appeal. On the minus said (yes, Mr. Poirot, balance) I find the two action sequences (kung-fu at the beginning and gun-shot/melee in the end) tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie, hence quite irritating.<br/><br/>There is a huge temptation to compare the two star-studded casts, in 1974 and 2017. But then, it would not mean much to those who have not seen both. Those who have would have plenty of their own observations and opinions. So, I'll stay mum."

","Murder On the Orient Express seemed to be exciting and with a clever plot in the trailer. Kenneth Branagh starring as the detective, with a murder on the train and everyone is a suspect. The film tries to recapture the mystery drama and the element of the train into that genre. But the story felt a little sloppy as by the end of the movie you try to piece together the clues to see if they add up. Kenneth Branaghs acted brilliantly as the lead role of the film, but the can't save the film from it's plot-holes and rough script. The movie's reveal of the killer isn't what you'd expect, some may like it, other may not. But with Daisy Ridley's performance, Willem Dafoe's, Michelle Pfeiffer's and Penelope Cruz's the film was entertaining but wasn't expected from the source material of the novel it's based on. Kenneth Branaugh's directing and producing wasn't what it was when he directed Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, Macbeth, and Cinderella. Also he was producer of Thor: The Dark World. Michael Green wrote the screenplay for the movie previously he did Green Lantern back in 2011, this year's Blade runner 2049, Alien Covenant and Logan. With a resume like that and improving himself from the boring script of Green Lantern you'd think the script would be smooth but not so much. Overall the film has it's problem's it really come's down to opinion."

","This is one of those ""they don't make movies like this anymore"" films that I'm glad did get made. It's a simple story that is easy to follow and it is a story first and foremost. It's not one of those films where the protagonist attempts to dazzle you with his intellectual brilliance, or where he challenges you to a duel of wits. No. It is a process of discovery and the detective, throughout the story, keeps his cards open, letting you know as much as he does. I loved Kenneth Branagh's style of acting. When I found out Johnny Depp was in the film, I automatically assumed he had the leading role, but he didn't. I haven't seen Kenneth Branagh in any other film prior to this and I'm very pleasantly surprised. He managed to completely win me over. The character of Hercule Poirot is all about charm and elegance, and this actor managed to pull it off. In fact, he was the most believable of all the fictional characters on the train.<br/><br/>I loved the atmosphere. Loved the choice of angles - to shoot lengthy scenes from the outside of the train, or to go full overhead like in a computer game. Everything about the movie I loved. Even though I've seen and heard the same story retold a dozen times I never get tired of it. This movie did it justice.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

","Murder on the Orient Express is based on the novel of the same name, by Agatha Christie. It tells the story of Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot(Kenneth Branagh). When he is traveling on the train known as the Orient Express, a passenger on-board the train gets brutally murdered. Now, it is up to Poirot to use his skills to find the culprit, before it's too late. <br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is an awesome film. Director Kenneth Branagh has masterfully adapted Agatha Christie's source material. As I haven't read the book, I kept guessing as to who the murderer could be, right till the last few minutes of the movie. The suspense has been brilliantly maintained, throughout. The reveal in the end, was slightly disappointing for me. The ensemble cast's performances, are the highlight of the film. Kenneth Branagh is spectacular as Hercule Poirot. Branagh nails Poirot's French accent, without overdoing it. Daisy Ridley is excellent as Miss Mary Debenham. Leslie Odom Jr. is great as Dr. Arbuthnot. Tom Bateman is superb as Bouc. Penelope Cruz is amazing as Pilar Estravados. Josh Gad is fantastic as Hector MacQueen. Johnny Depp is good as Edward Ratchett. Derek Jacobi is impressive as Edward Henry Masterman. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding as Caroline Hubbard. Judi Dench could have been given a bigger role, as Princess Dragomiroff. Olivia Colman is effective as Hildegarde Schmidt. Willem Dafoe is flawless as Gerhard Hardman. The supporting cast is perfect. Murder on the Orient Express is worth a watch, for fans of the source material & fans of whodunit movies."

","I have to own up and say that I didn't watch the whole of this film at the cinema and would not dream of buying or renting a DVD. Unfortunately this film is an example of why cinema attendances are falling through the floor.

Completely pointless opening sequence to pretend the film has something original to offer and then a slapstick pastiche rip off of the 1974 classic with zero charm, zero dialogue, zero soundtrack plenty of dull, lumbering monologues and in total a clumsy excuse for film-making.

"bachir-08","3","2","7","18 November 2017"," Should've been better.
","First of all, I feel obligated to share with you what this movie means personally to me. I have read the book by Agatha Christie twice, then watched Sidney Lumet's 1974 take and adored revisiting Hercule Poirot's investigation every single time. Albert Finney perfectly captured the essence of the character and the M. Lumet's directorial skills left me on the edge of my seat for the entire run time of the movie. ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is my favorite Agatha Christie novel, and Hercule Poirot one of my favorite literature characters. Having said that, it is with absolute sorrow that I say that Kenneth Branagh's remake made me leave the theater utterly disappointed. The movie's not all bad, of course. One thing that really caught my attention was the set and costume designs. Everything looked authentic, and I can see the film getting a couple of Oscar nominations in these two categories (maybe even win one à la Suicide Squad). Something that was talked about a lot was the cast. Everybody did a good job but unfortunately nobody was given a real chance to shine. I found some of the casting choices unnecessarily distracting and questionable (Daisy Ridley, Josh Gad or Johnny Depp). Kenneth Branagh was okay I guess.. But Albert Finney was a superior Poirot in my opinion. As I mentioned earlier, I found the movie to be very disappointing, and here is why: The film was tonally inconsistent (it started off goofy and over the top to suddenly take a much more serious approach), there was no character development, the cinematography could've been better.. But the thing that annoyed me the most was the screenplay. The dialogue was cheesy, some added scenes took me out of the general ambiance the movie was going for, and I never felt included in the investigation. That movie added nothing to the original. In fact, the few scenes that were added ruined what is one of the best detective stories ever written. And that's too bad."
"ignatiusloyala","3","2","7","18 November 2017"," Appalling
","Murder on the Orient Express will make Agatha Christie turn in her coffin: this adaptation resembles nothing she wrote and it would have been fine if significant revision had resulted in something good but in this case it has not.<br/><br/>Standing on the back of a successful adaptation starring Albert Finney, it is understandable that the producer wanted to make this version different to avoid direct comparison. However, remaking Poirot as a character does not work, not when the character is already so established - Branagh's Belgian detective is emotional, lacks cool, sulky and dull, i.e. he does not look in any way like Christie's Poirot. By way of comparison, Sherlock gives us a new Holmes too, but the classic and modern Sherlock still share some likeness to which audience can relate. <br/><br/>More importantly, Sherlock retains logic in its storytelling, as opposed to Murder on the Orient Express, where Poirot's solution of the case seems heaped upon speculations. They might not have been speculations - as the book has all the clues - but this adaptation leaves out a lot of information essential for solving the case. As a minor spoiler, not all passengers were interviewed and one wonders how Poirot came to guess so many things right. Add all these to the phony ending, and you have a star-studded whodunit murdered by a disastrously poor script."
"littlebittykitties","6","2","7","13 November 2017"," World famous, infallible detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. Sit back and let him do all the thinking!
","Murder on the Orient Express<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, Director <br/><br/>Overheard during Previews of Coming Attractions: ""Well, I like Liam Neeson, but that looks stupid.""<br/><br/>We feel ya, lady seated in the next row back. We like Kenneth Branagh, and Johnny Depp, and Judi Dench, and Willem Dafoe, and Michelle Pfeiffer, and Penelope Cruz (well, sorta), and Josh Gad and Derek Jacobibut this movie is stupid.<br/><br/>OK. Maybe we're out of line to say such a thing about this lush production full of all these beautiful people. There were at least a couple of noteworthy elements to this 70mm spectacle: 1. Branagh's mesmerizing mustache and 2. that super cool avalanche.<br/><br/>It probably is unjust to impugn a film when you're not the intended audience. And there was fair warning. We knew going in that it was an Agatha Christie murder mystery; that Hercule Poirot would treat us like Perry Mason treated our mothers back in the day – rudely! Condescendingly – as though they were in the room, but unworthy of a glance let alone intelligent participation.<br/><br/>But we went to MOE anyway. The previews were just so pretty.<br/><br/>Also, we grant that it's not reasonable to downgrade a movie that we slept through, even if we snoozed only a very few minutes, 10 at the most. <br/><br/>But let's be clear:<br/><br/>Hercule Poirot is not normal. Yes, yes, we know, that's the premise. He's extraordinary. By his own declaration, he's ""probably the greatest detective in the world."" But come on – nobody is that deductively gifted. Nobody. <br/><br/>We wanted to set aside our disbelief, but we just couldn't. Maybe because he is so irritatingly smug as he plies his powers of observation; though admittedly Branagh in the role brings a more likable facet to Poirot, maybe when he gazes regretfully at the photo of his long-lost love, Katherine. (It's actually a pic of a young Emma Thompson, Branagh's ex!)<br/><br/>And once, when he was rejecting the gangster Edward Ratchett's (Johnny Depp) request for Poirot's services as a body guard, did he seem to be acting on normal, believable human instincts. <br/><br/>The rest of the time Poirot ricochets from suspect to suspect, exposing their most obscure inclinations and carefully secreted skeletons with barely a glimpse of their knuckles. He revealed Gerhard Hardman (Willem Dafoe) as a phony because of a misplaced accent on one syllable of one word! Lucky it had no impact on the plot.<br/><br/>Hercule Poirot doesn't play nice. He has all the good clues and won't share them. His mode of operating is to spring them on us when it's most likely to make us, embodied in his shadow tag-along, feel dumb – less competent, less insightful – than HE is. We want to play along with the detective thing and feel at least dull-normal in our ability to track. But Poirot keeps all the real clues for himself, never giving the viewer a fair shot.<br/><br/>Speaking of which: Too many red herrings! O.M.G! Every passenger has a perfectly good motive and opportunity. The ins and outs of the convoluted threads of the intertwined lives of the complex relationships and the improbable likelihood of their all having E- tickets on the same train on the same day, across this scary computer- generated landscape – well, it's more than an earnest crime solver can endure.<br/><br/>The resolution is beyond implausible. Don't worry, we won't spoil it for you here, but rest assured, if you're a normal, investigation- loving, CSI-binge watching, Forensic Files geek, you will be so angry by the time you get to the Last Supper tableau in the finale, you'll want to turn on your cell phone right there in the theater and, and, and...what? Call your mother? Tell her what she already knows: All this exposition of the inexplicable (in reasonable, believable terms) makes a movie-goer want to spin around and explode.<br/><br/>Perfectly good actors left us unmoved because even though MOE is a period piece, NOBODY ever thought those thoughts or plotted those plots or did those things. In this script their characters are useful only in delivering misdirection. So Golden Globe winner & Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer, as Mrs. Hubbard, is only to be avoided. Golden Globe & Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe, as Gerhard Hardman, barely rates a dismissive shrug. And Golden Globe & Oscar winner Judi Dench – Dame Judi! – whose glances can wither, seems bloodless and full of moth balls. <br/><br/>Only Daisy Ridley, as Miss Mary Debenham, truly engages and challenges Poirot, and grips the audience with a true air of mystery.<br/><br/>So, yeah. We probably weren't the intended audience and this is a biased review. This story, this movie, is of a time gone by. If you can still enjoy Sherlock Holmes talking down to sweet old Watson, you'll be fine. If you don't mind being treated as a lame second fiddle rather than a full on partner in solving the crime, well, this is the show for you. Have fun watching Poirot in action.<br/><br/>For today's mystery fans and crime solvers, not so much.<br/><br/>*********<br/><br/>Six Degrees<br/><br/>Daisy Ridley in Murder on the Orient Express 1.

And it made me wonder just what Branagh's intentions were with this version of Agatha Christie's novel. Was he trying to make it more light-hearted? More comical? More campy? In the end, he only succeeded for sure in making it more boring.<br/><br/>A film that goes from absurd to dull will not earn much recognition for anything other the sheer acting talent that it wastes.

"Aly200","7","2","7","11 November 2017"," A Decent Remake of a Classic Mystery
","Before everyone gets annoyed about this film being an unnecessary remake, consider how long it has been since the acclaimed Sidney Lumet feature film. The modern master of Shakespearean films, Kenneth Branagh, decides to step behind the camera and also don the famous mustache (though more unconventional) of Agatha Christie's famous Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, in this slightly updated take on the classic whodunit thriller.<br/><br/>A brief overview of the plot: Detective Hercules Poirot boards the famous Orient Express for a much holiday from crime. However this is not meant to be as one of the passengers is brutally slain in the middle of the night and each of the other twelve passengers is a suspect as each harbors a dark secret and motive for murder.<br/><br/>The script for the film is basically the same as its source material. This film does put a little more emphasis on following its detective around than on development of the primary players in the mystery which does detract from the story at times. However the core answer to the mystery is the same as in the conclusion of the novel where Poirot presents his theories on the crime and the solution becomes clear.<br/><br/>As the famous literary detective, Branagh provides his own unique take on the character. He does capture Poirot's brilliant arrogance that help make his sleuthing skills renowned. Adopting a more believable French accent than his predecessor, Albert Finney, Branagh does mind his pronunciations though his natural British accent is slightly audible but doesn't take over and derail his faux French. The acclaimed actor-director does tend to focus a little too much on his character during intervals of the main mystery, but has the gravitas to lead the charge and bring the story full circle.<br/><br/>Branagh and his casting directors do a decent job of filling the shoes of the 1974 film's illustrious cast of characters. Only two characters are changed from the original novel and prior film as the elegant Penelope Cruz plays the role of the missionary (Ingrid Bergman previously played the same role with a different name, but was German like the novel) as a Hispanic woman to match Cruz's own heritage (a not unwelcome change as it doesn't take away from the part she plays) and the talented Leslie Odom, Jr. plays the role of Colonel Arbuthnot, a doctor in this case instead of a straight-forward solider as Sean Connery in the original film, and provides some diversity as he is African-American. The likes of Dame Judi Dench (Princess Dragmonoff), Olivia Colman (Fraulein Schmidt), Daisy Ridley (Mary), Willem Dafoe (Cyrus Hardman), Josh Gad (Hector McQueen) and the gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer (Mrs. Hubbard) also grace the cast with their unique talents, but none quite get the development they really deserve but all work with what little is given to them and craft their characters into enigmas that cannot be trusted. And lastly is the 'poor' victim, Ratchet' played by an ever sleazy Johnny Depp; finally a diverse role for the actor during 2017 after ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"". The actor develops believable mannerisms that give cause to also distrust Depp as Ratchet, yet Depp doesn't turn into a cartoonish figure. He remains aloof and mysterious and with his demise, a figure who gave all but Poirot and his friend, Boc, reason to off him.<br/><br/>Behind the camera, Kenneth Branagh displays his usual keen eye for crafting an atmosphere that puts the viewer in the story with the characters. With a fully built train model, complete with claustrophobic corridors, we are as trapped as the passengers of the Orient Express. The director's decision to also film on 65mm film (like fellow British filmmaker Christopher Nolan) lends to the 1930s setting of the film, giving an old-fashioned feel to the film's aura.<br/><br/>Give this one a chance and you might enjoy even if you might know the story already."

","As with any film centered around a mystery, there's a thrill in following the evidence, trying to figure out the whodunit and the how. If you go back to it afterward, you may find a new tidbit here or there, but the original thrill is gone.<br/><br/>Such is the case with the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film to look at, as are many modern films, and it is fun to immerse into the period of the 1930s, especially the details of the crime (which revolve around a case that is based on the real- life murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932), and the mystique of the Orient Express, for as one character muses, how fascinating it is to see a group of people with nothing in common but the shared need to go from one place to another, forced together, never to see each other again.<br/><br/>The characters, too, are interesting portraits of the many types of personas familiar to the era, with the most stereotyped personified in director Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of detective Hercules Poirot. Like the critically acclaimed 1974 adaptation of Christie's novel, this film assembles an all-star cast to fill the roles of murder suspects, including Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, and more.<br/><br/>The film expertly weaves the tapestry of the crime and the many, many red herrings that are left by the murderer, as well as Poirot's attempts to establish a motive to explain the crime. At each turn he finds links, but something eludes him until the grand reveal at the end.<br/><br/>However, it's that grand reveal where the film can feel a bit lackluster, especially if one already knows how the story ends, for as best as I can tell, this film does not add an new twists or surprises to the original Christie story, and when the reveal finally happens, not only does it feel somewhat underwhelming because it seemed perfectly obvious all along, but the motivations is played without a sufficient amount of weight.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the reveal wouldn't be powerful to someone unfamiliar with the particulars of the story, but for someone who is, this film's replay value is essentially nil.<br/><br/>However, this film's brilliant performances and dry wit throughout makes this film enjoyable for anyone with a taste for mystery and wonderful theater, for this film feels more like a traditional play than a film, and it's the better for it."
"Steven2168","8","2","7","8 November 2017"," A solid mystery with fatal flaws.
","Murder on the Orient Express is a very enjoyable and pleasant experience, even with its fatal flaws.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh shines as the star and director. He simultaneously portrays Hercule Poirot, an amazing character you empathize with, and gives Agathe Christie's tale the cinematic treatment in an engaging way with style (having not read the novel). The cinematography, production and costume design, and music is also very good.<br/><br/>While the ensemble supporting cast does very well with the very little they've been given (Michelle Pfeifer and Josh Gad being the stand-outs), the film could have benefited from adding an extra 15 minutes to flesh them out, to make the film's big reveal more effective, even if the ending was already emotional. Also, the film suffers from its inability to ""show, don't tell"", especially from a mystery. You aren't able to solve the mystery with Poirot, as the film instead uses flashbacks and exposition scenes.<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is a solid mystery that could've been much greater, but still a very pleasant and entertaining time."

","I did not mind the digital snow. What I minded was the lack of character development that reasoned in very shallow characters which concluted into a film that dragged more than it deserved. Don't get me wrong. I still liked it. But when you waste a cast of such tremendous actors like Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Willem Dafoe it is destined to end up in a disappointment. I also do not try to compare it to the nearly flawless original of 1974 but if I did and see where the other one succeeded and which this remake failed it comes to one big thing: The fantastic investigation and interrogation scenes, which were here rather shallow and unimpressive. But to sum up the good things: Cinematography was fantastic. The images we got were outstanding and unforgettable. It created a nice atmosphere. I did like the score, even if it was a bit inconstant at times. The Production Design and general look were extremely satisfying. Some of the acting was good too. Kenneth Branagh for instance did a great performance as Hercule Poirot and perfectly nailed that character. I would not mind to see him revisiting that roe in the future again. Michelle Pfeiffer was great and the only time when I say one of the cast was better than its original counterpart. Johnny Depp held himself very well. No complains about him. Penelope Cruz was fine, but she is no Ingrid Bergman. Judi Dench was wasted but I did enjoy her scenes. Daisy Ridley also showed some versatility and I always like Willem Dafoe doing Germans accents. So yeah no complaints about the cast itself, just about the material some of them were given. Sometimes I felt they were given the most emphasize on Branagh' schnauzer than on the characters, who actually are what makes the story interesting."

","I thought this movie was absolutely thrilling. While I agree that Hollywood needs to calm down on the remakes and start valuing original content, I thought this movie was simply fantastic. Why do people say that this movie was an ego boost for Kenneth Branagh? Seriously, why? He's the main character of the story. The other actors each had smaller parts than him. Yes, I did read the book, and I have to say that they were very similar. If the story was told even partially from another character's point of view the plot would have been completely spoiled! As for Daisy Ridley's performance, I thought it was great! Please judge her honestly apart from Star Wars. It's pretty obvious that she receives biased criticism. As for the ending, I was incredibly moved by the cast's performances-especially Branagh's. He really showed a passion for justice the entire movie, and he realized what a grey area the crime committed lies in at the end. Perhaps this is why the color palette is particularly dull in the movie, to represent the grey areas of justice? Or perhaps I'm being pretentious and looking too much into the artistic decisions. Wouldn't be the first time! Overall, I loved this movie, and I'm shocked to see why so many people hate it. If it's only a preference, then fine, but I'm reading a lot of reviews that seem ignorant, arrogant, or biased from the start. I was thoroughly entertained the entire movie, even after I had already read the book. Give this movie a chance!

","I enjoy remakes, perhaps that is why this movie was on my list to see ASAP. Hollywood has grabbed up the rights to many Agatha Christie books with varied success; Death on the Nile, The Mirror Cracked and the1974 production of Murder on the Orient Express, all beautifully done with a cast of Hollywood glamour stars of the era. I have them all in my library of classics. When the BBC produced the Hercule Poirot series I got addicted. The productions are movie length, made for television and David Suchet as Poirot is masterful. Suchet's version of Poirot in Orient Express should be considered definitive. The script is true to the book and deals with the story conflicts in a powerful way. Now for this most recent attempt... The cast is great but I need to agree with comments of other reviewers. It felt like a vanity piece and I can only say ""Why?"" David Suchet has already claimed that prize."

"WooderIce64","8","1","3","16 January 2019"," Solid Adaptation
","Agatha Christie is widely considered one of the best mystery writers of all time, and Murder on the Orient Express is widely considered one of her best works, so it's a perfect combination for a good movie. This is, of course, not the first time this novel was adapted for the big screen, and the original 1973 version is a classic. This version doesn't do much to add to the story, but it still succeeds. Here, the best parts are the acting, with an A-list cast, and the cinematography. The cast includes the likes of Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Willem Defoe, among many others. Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Hercule Poirot was enjoyable to watch and loyal to his character in the book. And the moustache. That alone deserved the Oscar for ""Best Makeup and Hairstyling."" The costume design was fantastic, and all the characters, despite being familiar faces, look great in their period clothes. The set design was equally good, with the train itself looking classy and elegant. The whole look of the train and the people on board brings the viewers back to the 1910s, to an age of transcontinental train travel.<br/><br/>The movie does have its faults, however. It is a two-hour movie, so it can't be as in-depth as the book, but it's stupid how fast Poirot figured out the connection between Ratchet and the Armstrong case. And, as stated earlier, it doesn't really do much to add to the story. I don't have a problem with that personally, but some may consider that a detracting element. And, of course, it's not exactly like the book. While it would be nice if the movie were completely true to the book, nothing particularly egregious happens in this version. Even still, this is a very solid movie, and a great adaptation, especially for the faithful portrayal of Poirot.<br/><br/>One thing that must be said; Murder on the Orient Express is notable for its plot twist. If you haven't read the book and don't know what happens and how it ends, go read the book. The book is much better than any film adaptation, and the ending is all the better. In this version, the only changes to the ending are how it goes down. Poirot tells his findings outside the train. Either way, don't find out the ending by watching this version."

","I was and I suppose, still am, loyal to the older Albert Finney version. Especially the music! The classic score seemed to make it even more amazing and glamorous. But as I have watched this newer redo several times, I have concentrated more on the characters, the dialogue, and the scenery. I love the scenes of the train going through the mountain areas with the thunder and lightening before the avalanche. Just that made me wish that I had taken a chance and gone to the movie theatre to see it. That was AWESOME! A really nice touch. And when Poirot sticks his head out of the door of his berth and asks, ""Did we die?,"" it's hysterical. 
But the beginning of the film was puzzling. I have read the book. Where did this strange small crime that Poirot needs to solve before he gets on the train come from? And the even stranger issue of his breakfast eggs not being perfectly matched, ""I blame the chicken,"" Poirot says, as he runs off to other business, was just plain weird. But I digress.
Johnny Depp actually makes the character of Ratchet even more sinister than Richard Widmark did. And when 'Ratchet' tries to pretty much buy Poirot to be his bodyguard, so to speak, Poirot declines by telling this person who looks like a criminal, ""I do not like your face,"" Ratchet's fate is pretty much sealed. No one would be able to keep this terrible person safe. Those of us who know the story, are clued in (pun intended) to how it ends. They all did it. 
But the bottom line is this. Give this film a chance. It's very entertaining. And since our NEW Poirot is now heading to Egypt, us Poirot fans know why. And I will see the next one in the theatre. Tickets to see a movie with all the cool sound effects on a really huge screen, are not that expensive."

","Yes the ending is rather morbid and unfulfilling however Mr. Branagh captures the essence of the Belgian detective such that he brings him new life. The movie does stumble at times but this does not stop its effect. If you have read the book, you will know that this is not one of the better mysteries of Agatha Christie. I like the timing and emphasis on Poirot's idiosyncrasies as well as the flight of events. What suffers is the supporting cast as they don't energize their characters well enough but being fair that may be because of the nature of each person's relation to the events that occur. We should not worry that it is a remake but rather how well it communicates the story. I like that they are bringing back these mystery stories to a new audience and this movie does not disappoint in this attempt."

"tinvillanueva-16935","8","1","3","11 June 2018"," Not as Bad as You Think
","SUMMARY: If this film had an awesome script, it would have earned more than it did (think Jumanji, Thor 3 numbers) . It's well-made and entertaining at the most. Poirot in 2017 is struggling to find himself and does it at the suspects' expense. <br/><br/>DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IF: <br/><br/>1. You expect an on-point remake of the book. - You have the 1974 remake for that. Or for an on-point image of Poirot or if your distracted by his cat-like of a mustache, check out David Suchet. That guy basically lived Poirot. <br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is a plot-driven book so all the characters played their part in the big picture of the crime. Orient Express 2017 made a futile attempt to know more about the characters and Poirot, which given the time allotted would have been impossible anyways. So the audience ends up with bits and pieces of half-baked people and an even more puzzling detective with his own inner turmoil. Again, this is not a wrong perspective but a good script would have tied everything together. <br/><br/>Several characters were miscast and even if some of the characters had massive potential to be liked, the script does not expand on them through their interrogation scenes or their storyline. This, in my opinion, is where the film failed. <br/><br/>Strangely enough, while some of them I felt were miscast, the cast had chemistry. <br/><br/>2. You don't like vague dialogues - The big weakness of the film is the screenplay. I haven't watched the deleted scenes yet but the script was the let down. It had a good cast but did not maximize it. Orient Express is a beautiful film and directed wonderfully but there were times when it was a pain to listen to because of the cringe-worthy exchange between characters. It just proves that a film comes down to script, casting and budget regardless of storytelling. The debunk screenplay is pretty much the main reference on why everything went wrong. <br/><br/>3. If you want to see a decent amount of screen time for a character who is not Poirot - The film is more about who Poirot is while solving the Murder on the Orient Express so it's pretty pointless to ask for a monologue for, say, Olivia Colman's character. <br/><br/>4. You have an irrational dislike for Kenneth Branagh - No, it's not an ego trip of a film. He happens to direct and star in it--if he were only the star, I'd figure you would be less annoyed. If you don't like him then there's nothing one can do. Don't watch. There are several movies on the plane or more DVDs to choose from. I am amazed to read paragraphs dissing him. That's not an opinion. You don't like him or his films, that's all. It's not The Human Centipede or a Lars Von Triers movie and even they seemed to had more support than him. <br/><br/>DO WATCH THE FILM: <br/><br/>1. If you want to be entertained - I found the film funny sometimes because of motherhood statements that Poirot or some of the characters say, which I am still figuring out why they say it. Having said that, DON'T ANALYZE. Branagh as a director gives perspective to those who have not seen, read or hear the book so in the case of enjoyment, he succeeds (for me, at least). Some of the best scenes are those where Poirot interrogates the suspects as well as when the cast are in groups together. The chemistry between most of the actors (except Johnny Depp) is great, <br/><br/>2. Amazing production value - Production and cinematography is class. Again, if this film had a good script, it would have been up for awards with a more outstanding box office draw."

While Michele Pfeiffer gives the bravura performance here I'm afraid she's no match for Jessica Chastain in the Suchet's version. Johnny Depp does an adequate job as the bad guy however Toby Jones does a far, far better job in Suchet's version. Here's a brief quote from these pages about Toby Jones: ""one of greatest stage and screen actors both in his native Great Britain and internationally"". All in all the Suchet version of Murder on the Orient Express is substantially better in the acting department than this version. In the Suchet version the tension is held right up to the very end. You just don't how everything will pan out in the Suchet version until the last minute or two. This is still an excellent production but the Suchet version is far better in every single respect."

","What to say? It is a dull movie, Kenneth Branagh's Poirot isn't convincing at all, his French accent is bad, his mustache too big ... damn! Johnny Depp did not get the Ratchett's character right as well.
The ending!!!! Poirot almost crying, .. really ( I would not even speak about the sequences where he stares at his girlfriend's picture... that is not Poirot) !?? <br/><br/>What about the sequel , ""Death on the Nile"" ? At the end, a guy goes to Poirot and tells him there has been a murder in Egypt, probably opening the door to the famous "" Death on the Nile"". The problem is that the movie doesn't start by the murder and Poirot is already on the Nile when it occurs ( both in the book and the previous version of Death on The Nile). <br/><br/>The only good point is the photography.

","Review:
I'm really in two minds about this movie, because it certainly looked great and the period was portrayed well but the storyline started to get on my nerves after a while. The whole ""whodunnit"" aspect seemed to go on forever, and all of the suspects had there own reasons to kill Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) because of his dodgy past, so Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) seemed to be going round in circles for most of the movie. You didn't really get to see Poirot's genius, because it was mostly based on interviews with the various suspects, so you didn't get to see him put together various clues like we usually do. On the plus side, the cast was great, and you get to see another side to Johnny Depp, who wasn't in the movie for that long but he did make a big impact. As for the plot, it wasn't anything different to the usual movies that have been adapted from this popular story, so I wasn't left feeling that it was anything amazing. I was also pretty disappointed with the whole outcome of the plot, mainly because it didn't take much detective work to find out that they were all lying, so from that point of view, it seemed like a total waste of time. Another main problem with the film, is that it was a bit too coincidental that every suspect that was in the posh part of the train, had a connection to the suspect, which didn't take a rocket scientist to work out, so that also made the outcome pretty poor. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with this film, and I also wasn't that impressed with Branagh playing Poirot, so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Not that great!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
Although this movie made a decent profit at the box office, which was mostly based on the cast, I personally think that Kenneth Branagh wasn't the best choice to director and star in the lead. His version of Frankenstein was terrible, and I wasn't that impressed with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit but he did kick off the Thor franchise pretty well and Cinderella was also watchable. He also directed Henry V in 1989, Dead Again, Peter's Friends, the great Much Ado About Nothing, In The Bleak Midwinter, Hamlet, Love's Labour's Lost, As You Like It, The Magic Flute and Sleuth starring Michael Caine and Jude Law. He is rumoured to direct Death on the Nile, which is another Agatha Christie classic, but I personally hope that he doesn't take the lead again, because he lacked wit and the stunning detective work that David Suchet brought to the role. With all of that aside, you do stick with the movie because you want to see who caused the crime but once you know the outcome, I cant see many people watching it again.<br/><br/>Budget: $55million

","I wouldn't say that this movie is some cinematic masterpiece. The cast is amazing with a list of award winning actors and actresses known for incredible performances; I expected something much different than what was delivered in this film. <br/><br/>The beginning was great. It started out on a high note with some decent humor and action. Unfortunately as it packs on the mystery, what works on paper starts to play out a little awkward. Still the movie remains bearable right up until the end, when Poirot confronts the guilty party. The overacting ramps up ten notches and becomes cringe worthy."

","Since everyone is slagging of his moustache, I thought I'd better start by saying what a splendid moustache Branagh decided to wear. He even had a genius moustache cover for when sleeping.
The photography was beautiful. The camera movements around the train, the shots through distorting glass where everyone had two faces, the interesting camera angles were superb. The CGI was extraordinarily brilliant, especially the shots of the train chugging through picturesque landscapes. The period feel was captured wonderfully. 
The staging was brilliant. Having the train perched on a high trestle bridge whilst the investigation was conducted was a stroke of genius, as was the recreation of the Last Supper painting when all the suspects were lined up. 
I knew who done it already. But that didn't spoil it, because the business with Poirot handing the gun over and saying they should shoot him, was a wonderful surprise trick. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me it was a perfect cup."

","""My name is Hercule Poirot and I am probably the greatest detective in the world.""<br/><br/>Voila. We Belgians can also be proud of the Hercule Poirot phenomenon in addition to our world-famous beers and chocolate. Probably the best detective in the world. And yes, he comes from this tiny country in Europe. The fact he's actually a fictional person created by Agatha Christie, we forget for a moment. This vain, anything but modest, equiped with an enormous moustache, ingenious Belgian detective has already been played by a whole series of actors. But for me it's David Suchet who lived up the most to the image of Poirot.<br/><br/>What should you do when making a film of a world-famous book by Agatha Christie and you know in advance that a large part of the audience knows the story and the ending already? Well, the best thing you do is to gather a star cast and using the necessary digital magic tricks to ensure a wow effect. Whether this is sufficient for most moviegoers is a question for me to know and for you to find out. However, I wasn't that impressed. Ok, the first bird's eye views of a Orient Express cutting through the landscape and those swirling camera movements in the snow, look breathtaking. But that's obviously not interesting enough.<br/><br/>So, after the introduction of Poirot (Kenneth Branagh), who got an overwhelming mustache, one can calmly reel off the list of familiar faces. And those are certainly not the least. Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michele Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Derek Jacobi, Olivia Colman and Leslie Odom Jr. are introduced one by one. And then we just have to wait for the train to set of and someone is killed, after which Poirot can start sniffing around for the killer. Fortunately for him, a fresh avalanche causes a delay in such a way that he can unravel the exciting mystery before the authorities arrive.<br/><br/>Exciting? Well, not for me at least. I've never been a big fan of classic detective stories like those of Sherlock Holmes and consorts. I always thought it's a bit stiff and not really entertaining. Or it must be such a beautiful film as ""Mr. Holmes ""where the retired detective tries to solve a final case at a leisurely pace, before his memory completely abandons him. In ""Murder on the Orient Express"" there is no sluggish pace, because all suspects on the train must be analyzed by Poirot and provided with a solid motive. And all in just under two hours. That is a lot to show in such a short time frame. The intro, the introductions, the murder, the investigation and then the announcement of the perpetrator. And all this interspersed with stylized images of both the interior and the exterior. It sometimes felt rather hasty.<br/><br/>Perhaps you've lived under a rock and never heard of Agatha Christie and this world-famous story. In that case you should definitely give this movie a chance. Is it worthwhile for the others to take the trip to the cinema? Well, if you want to admire the general splendour of the Orient Express, then you definitely should do this. And furthermore, the grotesque, oversized mustache of Branagh will certainly leave an impression. For me they can come up with an extra category for the Oscar award ceremony. That of ""Oversized decor pieces""!"

","I saw this film before reading the book, or watching the other films, so I could judge it first as it's own thing. And I liked what I got. The acting in my opinion is very nice, especially with Josh Gad. The mystery is also good. Even when I figured it out, I found myself enjoying to see the characters trying to solve it. One of my favourite things in the movie was the music. It creates a wonderful mood and really stands out. I actually stayed alone in the cinema through the credits, because of the music. Although the song by Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't that good.<br/><br/>After seeing the film, I read the original book to compare them, and to be honest this movie is a pretty good adaptation. There were some differences, like in the book Colonel Arbuthnot and Dr. Constantine are different characters, but in the movie Arbuthnot is also a doctor, so we don't have Constantine at all. There is also some added action in the film. 
These little changes did not bother me, but one downside of the film would perhaps be Poirot himself. He is a much nicer and warmer character in the book. The acting is still good. His personality is just a little off.
Overall I think this is worth seeing!"

","They just don't make movies like this anymore, and I am glad someone decided to make this.  The newest film version of the Agatha Christie classic murder mystery MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is a throwback to an earlier age of movie making - lavish costumes and scenery, a slow- ish moving plot and good scenery chewing scenes acted by an All-Star cast giving everything they got.<br/><br/>Credit Director and star Kenneth Branagh for bringing this old chestnut to the screen.  Clearly, Branagh, wanted to bring old fashioned movie-making along with modern CGI to bring this twisted story of murder to the screen - and he (largely) succeeds.  The scenery, costumes and sets are lavish to look at (which is why I would recommend you see this on the big screen) and Branagh's acting take on one of Christie's iconic detectives, Hercule Poirot, is fun and engaging, with a mustache that goes on for days.<br/><br/>But, it is the All-Star cast that will bring (and keep) you in the theater - and they deliver (for the most part).  Michelle Pfeiffer proves that she still has it, Daisy Ridley is showing that she is more than just a ""Jedi"", Willem Dafoe continues a late career resurgence, Dame Judy Dench is...well...Dame Judy Dench and Derek Jacobi, Penelope Cruz and Lesley Odom, Jr and Josh Gad all have their moments.  But, the ""surprise"" for me of the bunch was Johnny Depp.  He was just about the strongest part of this film (acting-wise) in a part that is ""normal"", gone are the quirks and kinks of hiding under layers of make-up for the Pirates (and other) films.  He just, plain ACTS and he does it well.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film?  Well, no.  It unfolds VERY slowly.  Branagh lingers his camera on the sets, scenery and costumes and lets the acting unfold as organically as it can be.  As a result, I heard more than 1 person snoring during parts of this film in the theater I was in.<br/><br/>So, grab some caffeine, and enjoy an old-fashioned murder mystery.  It's worth the journey.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  B (""A"" for acting, scenery, costumes), (""C"" for pace)"

It does have a good look about it, but the star-studded cast is wasted upon the aforementioned stock characters. As Presented, Poirot himself is just not interesting enough to carry a movie.

Kenneth Burough is tall enough to be Hercule Poirot and his mustache in this movie is too much. Well, this first appearance makes me judging other things, especially the plot. This movie is a remake, so does the murder and the ending. This is not surprising, because while I was searching the murder weapon along with all characters, I could not find it, so that I had assumed that the ending must be remake too. Well, the imaging of the train, snow, old cities, wardrobe are amazing. I can not bear it if this is coming from modern time, with good quality and angles. This movie is really having a great fashion designer and imaging Director, but for the plot director, I am quite disappointed, even though this movie has a big budget with such kind of actors, Johnny Deep, Penelope Cruz, etc, but the plot is not interesting, is boring, and is predictable.

"mirkobozic","6","1","3","11 November 2017"," Semi-successful but visually impressive.
","When I first heard of this new adaptation, there were two things that came up to me: why do we need an another take on the world's most famous murder case after two successful adaptations, and why in god's name Branagh wants to put himself in the shoes of David Suchet, THE Poirot incarnation in most people's minds. It's a losing battle almost by default, like comparing the bland Kate Middleton to the glamorous superstar that was Lady Diana. But anyway, I decided to give the poor guy a chance to impress me and maybe,do a decent job. This proved to be a false hope from the moment I was confronted with that monstrosity right in the middle of his face, which was so distracting that you couldn't concentrate on the talking whenever his face was in focus, which is quite often. Here, he's trying to solve a murder case in a compartment of the luxurious transcontinental train Orient Express, and each and every one of the title characters seem to have a motif for murder.<br/><br/>There are-to be fair-a couple of novelties Branagh brought to the character and the film itself- his version of Poirot (while equally impeccably dressed), has a sense of humour that Suchet was lacking, which occasionally borders on slapstick. The opening plot is completely irrelevant for the main story save for the fact that it was obviously used merely as an excuse to enchant us with Poirot's little petty obsessions and his little gray zellz. Also, in the breakfast scenes we can see Branagh visibly enjoying the role which reassures the viewer that this movie just might be worth the while. The new Poirot is also much more romantic than his predecessor and not afraid to show it (if talking to a photo qualifies as affection). Ultimately, the new sleuth is in a much better shape and doesn't need Hastings to chase a suspect down a dangerously fragile railway bridge. But. Branagh (doing double-duty both as the main character and director) assembled a whole galaxy of superstars to embody the suspects (in the former version, only Jessica Chastain was a known name). What works great on paper proved tricky on film, since there are too many suspects for the director to give each one enough screen time to seduce us with their personalities. <br/><br/>Instead, we get just a taste of the immense talent with which the famous train is loaded, and many act merely as prototypes instead as full-fledged characters. While Michelle Pfeiffer uses every opportunity to shine as the flirtatious Mrs Hubbard, someone as charismatic as Judi Dench is reduced to a grumpy princess Dragomiroff who isn't doing a lot of talking but alas, a lot of dog-fondling. This might just be the single biggest issue of this reiteration of Agatha Christie's novel: all those A-list actors are underemployed in the whole scheme of the script. Johnny Depp, of course, plays the shady victim, and Penelope Cruz doesn't really impress as Pilar Estravados, a character borrowed from ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". There are some factual misinterpretations: Vinkovci, in Yugoslavia, where the murder takes place, is in the continental part of the country which happens to be as flat as a chess board, and the scenery in the movie rather resembles the Alps. <br/><br/>Other than that, the redeeming qualities of the whole undertaking are the gloriously executed production design: the glamorous Art Deco interiors, the stylish costumes and the breathtaking panoramic vistas of the surrounding scenery. Details from the train are the icing on this semi-successful cake: the table settings, the white tablecloths and decorative lights, the lavish armchairs and the delicious desserts delivered by waiters in white suits. If there's one thing you'll take away from all this, no matter if you liked the film or not, it will be the urge to take a train ride to anywhere at the earliest opportunity. And that might be a success in itself."

","In this new rendition of Agatha Christie's 1932 murder mystery, Murder On the Orient Express, director Kenneth Branagh stars as Hercule Poirot; the world rebound Belgian inspector. In this all-star movie we see actors such as Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and Willem Defoe. However, many of them were given not much more than cameos as Branagh perfects his own part.
During a lavish trip on the Orient Express, famous inspector Hercule Poirot expects a relaxing journey instead has to race against time to find a murderer. As an avalanche blocks the Orient Express, Poirot uses this to his advantage to find the killer. Not only is everyone on the train a suspect, we soon come to learn that many of them have a strange connection to the Armstrong case and a motive of revenge for the fallen billionaire.
There have been many depictions of not only Agatha Christie's Murder On the Orient Express but also the famous inspector Hercule Poirot. Hercule Poirot is described as a very confident man, who is very attentive to details, as said ""I can only see the world as it should be. And when it is not, the imperfection stands out like the nose in the middle of a face. It makes most of life unbearable. But, it is useful in the detection of crime"". In this version, I feel that Kenneth Branagh played Poirot exquisitely, but a tad bit overdramatized at times. As for the rest of the all star cast, we see Josh Gad portraying Hector MacQueen, the private secretary to Ratchett, he shows more of a range that we normally don't get to see from him. As always Michelle Pfeiffer, was amusing and entertaining as she played the rich chatty husband finder Caroline Hubbard. Other actors such as Willem Defoe and Judi Dench, though perfected their roles as a German professor Gerhard Hardman and the Russian Princess Dragomiroff, were given not much more than underwritten cameos. I feel that the screen time could have been better divided betwixt actors.
The overall design of set, costumes and makeup almost perfectly match the time period and create the cozy but yet mysterious atmosphere. The wardrobe matches the time period as well as the characters themselves. The women wore long silhouettes that go just above the ankles, which were a new trend in the 1930s, as well as pantsuits and pinned up hair. Men wore suits which was proper in Europe, very few wore leisure wear as it was not the custom in this time period. For example, Inspector Poirot's attire matches his OCD personality, he wears a clean cut suit, everything is is place including his facial hair. The setting of the train quite accurately represents the furnishings of those in the 1930s, a very lavish a luxurious club car represents the feel that the Orient Express is trying to convey.
If you have ever read or seen Agatha Christie's Murder On the Orient Express you know the whole whodunit mystery. Branagh gives us this new version with snip its of humor sprinkled in, its dazzling, exciting and overall a must watch.<br/><br/>Branagh, Kenneth, director. Murder on the Orient Express.

","Wow, I've read some other reviews and they're all over the place. First of all, I haven't seen the other versions, nor have i read any Agitha Christie, but this Movie makes me want to do both. I really hope they make a sequel. To me, a seriously good movie in a period of extreme crap being put out by studios, it was just so refreshing. <br/><br/>In response to other reviews, specifically those who really hated this movie, I saw all of those things mentioned: focused on the main character, rather steady in pace compared to the rise and fall of modern movies, and so on. I feel like this approach really adds to the responsibility/reaction of the main character in the end. It gave that sense that they were all connected and left the main character on the outside, and then when it resolves, he is drawn into their condition and grief and even has to sacrifice himself as well... this is brilliant!"

"cherold","7","1","4","24 March 2018"," Pretty good, really
","Murder on the Orient Express is Kenneth Branaugh's comfortable but generally somewhat uninspired take on the traditional star-studded, handsomely-mounted Christie adaptation.<br/><br/>Some things are very good. I really like Branaugh's version of Poirot. While not quite as perfect as David Suchet, Branaugh is appealing and thoughtful, and it's wonderful that there is finally a Poirot with the sort of over-the-top mustache one always imagined from the book's descriptions. I prefer him to Albert Finney, who was never my concept of the character.<br/><br/>I also really liked the final reveal, which got a fair amount of drama out of the traditional detective-explains-it-all scene.<br/><br/>The cast was quite good, particulary Johnny Depp as something other than a cartoon character.<br/><br/>Some things put me off a bit. Giving Poirot some OCD seems both unnecessary and a rip-off of the TV series Monk. And putting Poirot in a couple of action scenes was just odd. These sorts of attempts to add flash to Christie rarely work out; the woman knew how to construct a story.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was enjoyable but never quite riveting. I knew the solution, so for me it was about watching the way it was all done, and it felt generally a little muted. I was interested, but rarely fully engaged.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie there's a reference to the book that was used as a sequel to the last MOE. Are they going to try that one again? It didn't work out very well last time, and Christie has a lot of books to choose from, but I guess I'm okay with that.<br/><br/>I recall enjoying the 70s MOE more, although I don't know what I would think of it now. As recent Christie adaptations go, it's not as good as the minseries of And Then There Were Done but it's much better than the dreary Crooked House. I do hope they do a sequel, but I also hope they get a little more life into any future productions."

","This movie had a plot twist that makes you smack you forehead because it was in your face the entire time, and the reason you wouldn't put it together is because it has never been seen in recent murder mystery media.

"danielfnemes","9","1","4","16 March 2018"," Superb cinematography
","I have heard and red negative comments before seeing the movie and I prepared for worse.
Instead, it was a pleasant surprise. Most of the people who gave negative reviews addressed the ""version"" of Poirot which is not faithful to the book, the pace of the movie which is too slow, the other great actors who could not develop their characters. There is also great nostalgia in comparing it with the ""perfect"" Sidney Lumet version. I will not argue on this issue, I will say only one thing: get over it people!. Get a life! It's not the Bible, it's just a book which has been translated into a movie. There is no ""perfect"" version in art. I mean look at the Guy Ritchie version of Sherlock Holmes. Nothing could get further from the books. But I like it as well as I like the Granada series which is so brilliant and accurate to the books.<br/><br/>I say the movie must be watched at least once for the visuals. The cinematography is fantastic. The colors, camera angles, costumes, sets, landscape, the atmosphere are just gorgeous. One can say anything about this movie but cannot deny it is very good looking one.
Go see the movie and feast your eyes. You will not regret it."

","I want to start with saying that I am a Christi fan and a Poirot fan and have watch the classic movies and tv show. I really wanted to love this new adaptation and found that while its not close to a favorite I did manage to enjoy it. I did wonder why they chose to make it and would have rather seen a different story used. I think that this movie is aimed at drawing new viewers instead of pleasing old ones. Maybe I am easy to please but I recommend giving the movie a watch, and if you enjoy the story to try the classics if you are new to them."

"DeBBss","6","1","4","16 February 2018"," Had High Expectations...
","Murder on the Orient Express had a great trailer, and it looked promising on paper, but with terrible execution and boring characters, Murder on the Orient Express is an average movie. I was expecting Murder on the Orient Express to be a hardcore murder mystery, and it falls short on that part too. I thought that the movie was going to be in the perspective of Hercule Poirot and it would share Hercule's thoughts throughout the movie, and in some parts it does do that, but at the same time it doesn't. I was so excited for this movie, because of the unique setting and the A-list actors, but this movie shows how a poor script can ruin a movie. I think the biggest flaw is the characters, the motives of the murder was just weak, in my opinion. The only character that does seem one bit interesting was Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>Story: 7/10<br/><br/>The story is average at best. But the biggest issue was the execution, I think the execution is a very important part in a murder mystery, but this movie was just all over the place. The issue was that there was too much characters that the movie tried to make a subplot off of. Every passenger killed ratchett, and there was a lot of passengers in the movie. Every passenger had their own motive to kill ratchett, and all of their motives were connected into one thing. Each character had their own mini subplot, and honestly, there all weak. Murder on the Orient Express attempts to juggle all of these subplots briefly. If Murder on the Orient Express removes all of the weaker characters and focuses on the more important ones, than the movie could've had more time to explain the more important subplots. As I said before, I was expecting a hardcore murder mystery, and this movie really doesn't deliver it. I wanted to see Hercule find clue after clue throughout the movie, but he only really does that at the end. Overall, there's too much subplots that causes one dimensional characters that affects the story greatly.<br/><br/>Characters: 5/10<br/><br/>The characters are the biggest flaws. Due to the lack of recognition to the characters who committed the crime, the cause of the murder was weak. I wanted a strong motive behind the murder, but they did it because of something that Ratchett did in his past to another family. And I have to say, why kill Ratchett on a train, and why do it when there's the best detective in the world on it. They could've done it somewhere a little more logical. The twist at the end was pretty good and I wasn't expecting it, but I wasn't shocked, maybe it was the delivery of the confession that made it weak. The movie thinks it's clever by putting a twist so unique, but that's it's issue, as I said before, I wasn't shocked. The murder of Ratchett was done out of justice from the murderers. I thought the victim was the good guy and the murderer(s) were the bad guys, but it was the other way around, which was clever. I think evil motives are stronger than good motives in a murder mystery movie, and this movie slightly proves my point. Overall, all of the characters are one dimensional, except Hercule Poirot and the motives were on the weaker side.<br/><br/>Action: 7/10<br/><br/>The cinematography in Murder on the Orient Express was amazing, and I was surprised how cinematic it really was. I do have to give recognition to Kenneth Branagh for acting as a main character and directing as well. The movie is very slow, and it's almost hitting 2 hours long. The trailer made it look a bit more action packed, but there was only one chase scene. The visuals are very well done, using all sorts of styles, which makes the cinematography look even more better. I do have to mention that the movie could have been shorter. Some scenes just took too long, and it just makes the movie feel so much more boring. Overall, this movie proves that sometimes it doesn't matter how well a movie was filmed, basically it's style over substance.<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express tries to do too many things all at once. It focuses on a murder, but with too many characters and subplots, Murder on the Orient Express goes all over the place. If Murder on the Orient Express focused on one primary goal, then this movie could have been better. Murder on the Orient Express was already nailing it's own coffin when they decided that all the passengers committed the crime. And yes, it's based off the book, but it wouldn't hurt to cut some parts in the movie that were irrelevant. I recommend Murder on the Orient Express to the fans who read the book or watched the original, but not for people who want to have a good time and enjoy a movie."

","Murder on the Orient Express<br/><br/>Most train slayings occur when tramps board a boxcar filled with drunk hobos.<br/><br/>However, the choo choo in this mystery is too ritzy for silly rail yard homicides.<br/><br/>While returning to London aboard the famed Orient Express, the equally eminent Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is propositioned by a fellow passenger (Johnny Depp) looking to hire the detective to protect him for the duration of their journey.<br/><br/>It's not until the man turns up dead does Poirot grasp the seriousness of his offer. Intrigue, as always, he gathers the other passengers/suspects (Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, PenÃ©lope Cruz, Daisy Ridley) and interrogates them.<br/><br/>In the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's whodunit, Branagh manages to pull off her meticulous sleuth, but stumbles as the film's director. While the reveal is still a classic, the real crime is the underutilized supporting cast.<br/><br/>Sadly, most killers in train related deaths are distracted engineers.

","I'm not sure what is with the harshness of every single review now days, I don't know if it's just cool to hate everything and have absolutely no joy in your life anymore, but I'm sick of it so I am going to start reviewing more movies now. At the very least the ones that I feel aren't being given a fair chance or rating. Seems like every single movie just gets slammed now days.<br/><br/>This movie is excellent. I have to start off by saying that I haven't read the book, so if you're the type of person who's read the book and are excited to see the adaptation, I cannot comment on whether you'll be disappointed or not. Movies rarely seem to live up to the book though there are exceptions of course so let's not get stuck on that. I just feel like it's very hard for a two hour film to live up to who knows how many hours you spent on the book. There's only so much they can do with the time they have.<br/><br/>I personally went into this movie knowing nothing about it besides what I saw in trailer and read in the plot synopsis here on IMDB. And the movie was fantastic. Now I have to say, the trailer gave me the impression that the movie was sort of a comedy, and to me the movie was quite different. It has a tiny bit of comedic relief here and there but it is a fairly serious film. The trailer does not do the movie justice.<br/><br/>The movie does try to be a puzzling ""who done it,"" but towards the end you may be able to figure out what's going on. This doesn't subtract from the movie at all. It's well written and adapted, and EXCELLENTLY acted. I would suggest people watch this for the acting alone, it's fantastic. <br/><br/>This a great little film and I loved all of it. It's unique, has a great setting, and enough mystery to keep you wondering for almost the entirety of it. It has a fantastic cast of A-list actors, all of whom play their well written parts extremely well. There's a bit of comedy sprinkled in here and there, and it's a very enjoyable hour and forty-eight minutes or so."
"darreneisnor","10","1","4","6 January 2018"," First timer, so I loved it!
","This movie was a lesson in ignoring middling reviews and going to judge for myself. This movie was fantastic! A throwback to a different age, this is a ""whodunit"" that captures the feel of classic film, but with incredibly cinematography of 2017. I was very confused when reading many negative user reviews here at first, but I soon realized this group was largely make up of folks who had either read the book or watched the 1974 original film. So if you're like me and haven't experienced any older iteration - I hope you enjoy this modern take as much as I did!"
"Coventry","7","1","4","22 December 2017"," Agatha Christie certainly doesn't need to be ashamed
","Yours truly is a massive admirer of Mrs. Agatha Christie! If her hand-written grocery lists ever become published, I will surely read them and watch the film adaptations! Many people in my surrounding asked me if I was ecstatic when the news got spread about the upcoming and hi-budgeted new version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Well, yes and no. Contrary to general belief, there certainly isn't a shortage of Agatha Christie adaptations. The ""Queen of Crime"" died more than 40 years ago, but just recently I purchased the newly released mini-series ""And then there were none"" and ""Witness for the Prosecution"", which are both produced by the BBC and star an impressive list of famous players. Indeed, there hasn't been a cinematic adaptation in quite a while, but personally I didn't see the need for one. Fans of Christie's work can easily enough find the aforementioned mini-series, or a variety of other TV-series, on DVD, but are her writings still appealing enough to be shown on the big screen? After all, Christie delivered old-fashioned whodunits and convoluted detective stories that invite the audience to guess along for clues and red herrings, but my impression is that people generally don't care for these anymore. Whodunit stories have evolved into CSI showcasing and modern detectives turned into superheroes who are able to solve a crime before it properly happened, like for example in the new ""Sherlock"" series with Benedict Cumberbatch. Of course I'm happy there is a new Christie adaptation, but honestly I was even more concerned that it would flop at the box office. Kenneth Brannagh even took an additional - but comprehensible - risk by choosing ""Murder on the Orient Express"" as his project. Partially thanks to the fantastic 1974 film version directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Albert Finny, this has arguably become Christie's most well-known tale and literally everyone who saw the film or read the book will have remembered the denouement. <br/><br/>But once again it turns out that I was overly worried! Kenneth Brannagh's ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is by no means a masterpiece, but certainly an entertaining and very competently made mystery/thriller. I'm grateful that it remained a traditional adaptation that treats the source material with great respect. In other words, Hercule Poirot luckily didn't rejuvenate into a martial-arts action hero, while the cinematography and decors are kept stylish and sober rather than turning the whole thing into a hyperkinetic and winnable trendy ""The Matrix"" clone. And the story? Well, the story is still powerful enough to remain surprising and absorbing. Just as the 1974 version, this film can rely on an impressive all-star cast including names like Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench and Dereck Jacobi. Some of these big names have really few screen time, but they will lure people to the theater nevertheless. Kenneth Brannagh himself depicts an admirable and likable Hercule Poirot, although perhaps the size of the iconic mustache is slightly exaggerated."
"john-671-183998","9","1","4","22 December 2017"," Engaging and fun, even if you have seen the earlier versions
","Very entertaining film. Excellent cast and spectacular cinematography. I found this version much more compelling than Sidney Lumet's 1974 picture. I also appreciated Kenneth Branagh's more thoughtful interpretation of Hercule Poirot in contrast to Albert Finney's over the top histrionics in the earlier version. There are some dramatic scenes which are a departure from the earlier version, but they help develop certain of the characters and the overall story remains intact and suspenseful. Highly recommended."
"rdnyscott","10","1","4","13 December 2017"," Branagh means you must watch closely
","When I first saw this movie, I wasn't even aware it was directed by the same guy who directed Thor, and yet I already sensed some similarities! When I discovered it was the same director, I watched the movie again and enjoyed it all the more, this time realizing I needed to watch it a bit more closely. My opinion is the opening at the Wailing Wall truly introduced us to both the detective and some of the other main characters in a meaningful way, and one thing I love is this director knows how to bring meaning to his movies with every choice he makes, no matter how subtle. Naturally, the first time I had no clue who the culprit was, but the second time I was catching the clever clues and realizing that we are watching a performance about a performance. Things that seem disturbing the first time are actually humorous the second time, because you understand the motives behind that behavior much better. Shallow, stereotypical characters gain depth when you realize that they are trying to distract the detective, and even making up some of their stories as they go. I have no clue when Hercule truly had it all figured out. The way his mind works, it could have been earlier than portrayed. When I saw the preview, I was so used to the Hollywood formula that I didn't think I needed to watch the movie. The culprit was the missionary. Even if I was wrong about that, I was sure I knew who had not done it. Turns out I DID need to watch the movie, and I'm so glad I did!"
"OllieSuave-007","9","1","4","11 December 2017"," A rather good detective movie.
","This is a rather good detective movie based on Agatha Christie's popular crime novel. It features an all-star cast aboard the Orient Express, in which the train's derailing was complicated by a murder. This leaves the only detective on board, Hercule Poirot, to solve the crime.<br/><br/>The film starts off pretty slow, and it was rather too theatrical in the beginning scenes in my opinion. However, the movie picks up steam when we are introduced to the passengers on board the Orient Express and the suspense builds after the murder takes place. While there is little or no action at all in the movie, much of the excitement and intrigue lie in each of the character's testimony and whereabouts during the crime, and Poirot's investigative methods.<br/><br/>Solid acting by everybody, and plenty of unpredictability on the whodunit question. A real attention grabber and some emotional drama and humor mixed in as well.<br/><br/>Grade A-"
"rubenm","6","1","4","3 December 2017"," Agatha Christie, 21st century style
","It sounds like a fun idea. Take a classic Agatha Christie-story which has last been made into a film more than forty years ago, put together an ensemble cast with a mix of Hollywood stars and British stage actors, and see what 21st century film making can add to that.<br/><br/>As for that 21st century treatment: computer generated effects can certainly spice up even a traditional film like 'Murder on the Orient Express'. I was impressed by the images of the steam train moving through Istanbul as it must have looked in the 1930's. Or by the scenes in which an avalanche descends from high up in the mountains on the fast moving train in the valley below.<br/><br/>Another modern element that director Kenneth Branagh touches upon very briefly, is the interesting question if our criminal law system is morally just. It's a pity that the screenplay doesn't give this subject more than a few remarks, because it could have added an extra dimension to this traditional film.<br/><br/>Apart from this, the film is what you'd expect it to be. The cinematography is breathtaking: everything looks picture perfect, from early 20th century Jerusalem to the high mountains where the train gets stuck. The stars do what they are supposed to do, but in a film like this the emphasis is more on the story and the claustrophobic setting than on the acting performances. It is a pity that great actors like Judy Dench and Derek Jacobi don't get more screen time, but that is the consequence of an ensemble cast. It was nice, though, to see that Michelle Pfeiffer is still going strong. It had been a while since she was cast in a major big budget production.<br/><br/>Of course, the screenplay demands a rather considerable suspension of disbelief. Some story elements seem to come out of the blue, and viewers have to keep very concentrated in order not to miss some detail that is essential for the crime solving process. But that's not unusual in a screen adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel.<br/><br/>'Murder on the Orient Express' is nice entertainment, and it is good to see that Hollywood is still willing to invest considerable budgets in this kind of traditional film. But this is not a movie that will surprise the viewer.<br/><br/>After having seen this film, there is only one mystery to be solved: will Branagh take on 'Death on the Nile' as a follow up project, as the last scene of 'Murder' suggests?"
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","4","26 November 2017"," for those who have watched Sydney Lumet's 1974 version, this redux can only eat humble pie
","For the sheer grandeur of its production design, Kenneth Branagh's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS reboot is something should be fully appreciated on the silver screen, shot in 65mm film (a rara avis today), the period setting which it punctiliously re-enacts is a fetching treatment for a sore eye (although it would soon give way to a single-location detective procedurals when the train is halted on a truss by an avalanche amid the white wilderness), but for those who have watched Sydney Lumet's 1974 version, this redux can only eat humble pie, both in regard to its structural design and the central interpretation of Agatha Christie's beloved Belgian gumshoe Hercule Poirot. <br/><br/>For starters, the murder mystery is almost exactly the same as its antecedent, whether it is due to the hallowed reverence to its source material or screenwriter Michael Green's incapability to ginger up the whodunit scenario, clearly and dishearteningly, slavish safety is the keynote to adhere when it comes to remakes, why bother if there is no substantial upgrade in the making? A transposition to 21st century would be a nice idea for instance. <br/><br/>Perhaps, just to gather a star-studded cast can justify its own existence, with Branagh's gonzo- moustachioed Poirot hogging the spotlight, who is even granted a tepid prologue comes about in the Wailing Wall to introduce his fastidious quirks, and Branagh infuses an edgier temperament into Poirot's no-grey-zone presence of mind, but the over-familiarity of Sherlock Holmes is a dangerous sign of losing the detective's own distinction (since the Nile-cruising sequel has already been green-lit), also his underdeveloped omniscience begins to tell when magically, he gets the hang of everyone's carefully concealed identities, bearing in mind it is a time before Google, everyone! <br/><br/>Approximately 10 minutes is fairly doled out to each of the rest core members of the cast, where most of the sequences are commonplace shot-reverse-shots and red-herrings are dished up, save some innovative camera arrangements either looking from the ceiling or outside the train. But despite the embarrassment of starry richness, only Michelle Pfeiffer's widow Caroline Hubbard (channeling some more soft-headed levity against Lauren Bacall's stern predecessor), manages to steal some thunder in the reveal, plus lending her exquisite voice in the song ""NEVER FORGET"" over the end credits.<br/><br/>The biggest artistic license is needless to say, the gorgeous THE LAST SUPPER tableaux vivants when Poirot pompously solves the puzzle, we must hand it to Branagh for the flourish, only pitifully it is also at the expense of the film's own plausibility, because the whole act conspicuously reminds us, as if there were no other passengers on the supposedly fully-booked Orient Express other than those circumspectly postured suspects, or rather, alluding to a more dismayingly insidious note, that the class stratification has completely forbidden those in the less fancy coaches to even disembark the train whereas those privileged few are allowed to step out of harm's way in face of their final judgement, this really stings."

","The new adaptation of Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express impresses with lush settings, a gloomy atmosphere and great acting performances, particularly by Kenneth Branagh as clever detective, Johnny Depp as arrogant gangster and Judi Dench as arrogant aristocrat. <br/><br/>On the negative side, the investigation on the train is a little bit rushed. The movie exposes plenty of theories for a potential murderer but doesn't go into detail. It's at times difficult to follow the numerous characters and their motives to commit a murder in the second third of the movie until the final third wraps it up coherently. Another negative element is that the introduction to the film is a little bit long and also unnecessary as it doesn't really add anything to the character development.<br/><br/>Those who have never read Murder on the Orient Express or watched one of the numerous movie adaptations will obviously be surprised by the clever story. On the other side, if you are already familiar with the story, there aren't many new elements to discover that would justify to watch this film.<br/><br/>Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is an entertaining, profound yet stylish adaptation of one of the greatest crime novels ever written. It's important to continue to honour this novel that has changed the world of literature. On the other side, this version is neither as detailed as the novel nor as charming as Sidney Lumet's version of the seventies.

","""I need a holiday, I need time in my hands"" (sic), are the words of Hercule Priorot with the acute if not astute observance of a famous detective renowned for his excellence in detecting. Accordingly, it seemed, Priorot ate my words as that was my sentiment as I went to see this film adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel at the cinema recently. <br/><br/>The film's cinematography laid bare the scenery through which the steam train chugged through snow clad mountains. The film set left, it seemed, nothing amiss, and the attention to detail, from the decor to moustaches to hairstyles of the period, was perfection itself. And yet, such extravagant a visual feast seemed worthy of more than the modern day cinema with its minimalist theatre and pop corn munching audience.<br/><br/>And while the period was given attention to detail, the director, Kenneth Branagh, who also plays the Belgian detective, forgot that in a freezing cold setting we should see breath belching from the mouths of the characters during the outside scenes in the frozen isolation of the mountains, where the Orient Express runs aground. Likewise none of the characters appeared cold, or shivering. This is especially given that they are all suspects in the murder case.<br/><br/>The suspects are played by such a rarity of an all star cast with none other than Kenneth Branagh, Johhny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dame Judy Dench, Derek Jacobi, Willem Defoe and Penelope Cruz to name a few.<br/><br/>And so if you love murder mystery, and Agatha Christie and plush, period settings and snow covered mountains, then take a look at this film."
"bottomsgaming","4","1","4","20 November 2017"," All that talent, and so little for anyone to do
","I'll start by admitting I've never read the Agatha Christie novel or the original film. I don't have any details from the original story affecting my opinion of this, for better or worse. Branagh's 2017 version is a competent tale of revenge and redemption, complete with a star-studded cast and an Oscar-worthy mustache. Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it.<br/><br/>I'll get right to it--the movie is boring. And I don't mean that in a ""needs more explosions/I prefer all the MCU movies"" sort of way. I actually have a predisposition for slow paced, dialogue driven films. The thing is, there actually needs to be interesting dialogue/characters for any of it to work. Just about every major character in this movie is played by a well known actor or actress. This alone does not make them interesting, however, and as the movie plods on, we realize that none of them have anything notable to say or do outside of Branagh's Hercule Poirot. Branagh himself actually puts out a respectable performance, and the mustache really is glorious, but no one else has the material or screen time to be anything more than a vehicle for the plot to get to its underwhelming conclusion. <br/><br/>Everything looks pretty enough. The movie is well-shot, the costumes are full of life, the characters all look important. Then we find out that the only notable thing about every single person on the train is the fact that they're all coincidentally tied to an older case that (also) coincidentally is the one case that haunts our main character. This leads to the obvious conclusion that every guest must be tied to this in some sort of conspiracy, right? Well, yes. That's it. Except most of the audience will figure this out an hour in, and then be forced to watch the greatest detective in the world slowly figure out the same conclusion over the next hour. This would be fine if the movie was building to something greater and unexpected, or was filled with characters that are fun to watch, or included any instances of smart dialogue that wasn't ham-handedly explaining the simple-yet-rushed plot to the audience. <br/><br/>In the end, all we get is the expected conclusion (delivered by Poirot in a five minute expository monologue) tied together with some late themes of revenge and redemption. Nothing about Murder on the Orient Express is explicitly bad or incompetent, but it all just feels simple, rushed, and watered down. Any interesting moments are short lived as the plot rushes to its tired, ""It was everyone"" ending. Not the worst movie you could find yourself watching, but possibly the most uninteresting."
"gcsman","8","1","4","19 November 2017"," A classic reworking of a classic mystery
","This is clearly Kenneth Branagh's work above all: he's the star, the director, and the co-producer, and you can feel his influence from start to finish. And that's not a bad thing. If you're going to give this amount of control and influence to one artist, he's certainly among the better choices. Even if you happen to know the plot and the really quite clever key to the murder, you'll enjoy this movie thoroughly. On one level, it's just a lot of fun to see the all-star cast of supporting players mix and match with Hercule Poirot as they go along, just like it was in the 1974 film version of the story. It's a genuine classic.<br/><br/>Branagh himself plays Poirot with an engagingly different slant than in previous takes on the Agatha Christie character (notably David Suchet, Peter Ustinov, and Albert Finney). While just as cerebral and quick-thinking, Poirot here is rather more emotional: he reacts to crime almost as if it's a personal insult and attacks it with almost the intensity of an avenging angel. The urge to solve this murder (or any murder, as we see right at the end when a messenger tells him that he's needed to solve a new case of violent death ""on the bloody Nile"" (!)) even overrides his desperate desire to take a long-needed vacation. He just can't resist.<br/><br/>Big names or not, everyone else in the cast is excellent and I won't mention them by name because you will enjoy them all once you see it. The cinematography has a warm color palette that you can settle right into, with added long shots of mountain scenery that are beautiful in their own right. Period costuming, the setting inside the train, the ambiance of high society of the time -- everything is nicely put together.<br/><br/>Totally enjoyable movie-going; no deep messages about human nature of the meaning of life, but just a classic story told in a classic way told through a first-rate production."

"halseyad","2","1","4","17 November 2017"," Mixed Messages (Why Make the Movie?)
","It seemed as if this film was meant to have viewers arrive at a deep, introspective consideration for human life, but it fails miserably by missing the compassion within the death by public execution that takes place.<br/><br/>When we see remorse in the passengers for their act of killing a murderer (someone who should be killed), we are lead to believe they have done something wrong; that they should not have held him accountable for his actions. This is evident by one women's attempted suicide after they had been discovered and also by the inspector's inability to be content with the ending (once it is fully revealed). <br/><br/>The story really falls apart when we compare the inspectors quotes from the beginning and end of the movie. When the villain asks him for protection, the inspector refuses on the grounds that he ""detects criminals, not defends them."" He even says something to the effect of ""you want to deal with gangsters, you will suffer the consequences.""<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, however, he clearly has lost his marbles because he says, ""sometimes the scales of justice are unbalanced; may we all find peace with it."" If he really was as astute and rational as he was portrayed to be, he would have realized that their actions put the scales back into balance. There was an injustice committed and the real bad guy was previously running free until they stopped him. There were prolonged consequences for the man, and they had caught up to him. <br/><br/>The passenger's actions rectified the unpaid/delayed punishment and now they can move on with closure. It's as if the man representing law and order would have preferred to let the killer go. This film could have been a great argument for how sentencing someone to death can be a loving act that truly magnifies the value of life. Instead, it sunk into a black hole of moral relativism, where the protagonist is confused with right and wrong.<br/><br/>Make up your mind, Hollywood! You can't simultaneously value innocence and condemn justice!"

","This is one of the most recognised of all the novels by Agatha Christie, the 1974 Sidney Lumet / Albert Finney film is the most memorable of the adaptations, there has also been the TV movie with Alfred Molina, and TV's Poirot with David Suchet, this was the latest adaptation, directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Hamlet, Thor). Basically in the winter of 1934, famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Sir Kenneth Branagh) looks forward to taking a break from his work, after solving a a theft in Jerusalem, he is travelling to Istanbul, aboard the Orient Express. Other passengers travelling on the train are: talkative American socialite Caroline Hubbard (Michelle Pfeiffer); unpleasant American businessman Samuel Ratchett (Johnny Depp), his American secretary Hector MacQueen (Frozen's Josh Gad) and his English valet Edward Henry Masterman (Sir Derek Jacobi), elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (Dame Judi Dench) and her German maid Fräulein Hildegarde Schmidt (Olivia Colman); Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolph Andrenyi (Sergei Polunin) and his wife Helena (Lucy Boynton); former military sniper Dr. John Arbuthnot (Leslie Odom Jr.); governess Mary Debenham (Star Wars' Daisy Ridley); Spanish missionary Pilar Estravados (Penélope Cruz); Cuban businessman Biniamino Marquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo); and Austrian scholar Gerhard Hardman (Willem Dafoe). The morning after the train's departure, Ratchett tells Poriot he has received many death threats, he tries to secure the detective's services for a high sum, but Poirot knows of Ratchett's criminal reputation and refuses. That night the train is caught in an avalanche, the train is derailed and the passengers are stranded, besides this, Poirot is disturbed numerous times during the night by strange noises, and characters passing his cabin. The next morning, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin, next door to Poirot, the detective and his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman), director of the Orient Express, work together to solve the case. The body examination reveals Ratchett was stabbed 12 times, some wounds were slight, but at least three could have resulted in death, Poirot recalls the noises, it is indicated the murder was around 1:15am. The train is held up by the deep snow and the train on a high bridge, so the murderer is still among the passengers, and a number of clues could pinpoint to the suspect, including a broken pocket watch, a pipe-cleaner, a woman's handkerchief with the initial ""H"" and a fragment of a burned letter. Examining the letter, Poirot discovers that Ratchett was in fact Mafia gangster Cassetti, five years ago he carried out the kidnapping and killing of infant Daisy Armstrong, daughter of wealthy British Army Colonel Hamish Armstrong, overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labour early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby, a French maidservant named Paulette committed suicide, and Colonel Armstrong consumed by these tragedies killed himself as well, and Casetti fled the country with the ransom, betraying his partner, leaving him to be executed. Poirot, Constantine and Bouc begin their interrogation of the passengers, with Poirot questioning them all one by one about the night of the murder, each passenger have a motive to kill Ratchett, so any could be the murderer. After concluding his investigation, Poirot gathers all the suspects outside in the train tunnel to present his solution, he has formulated two possible scenarios to explain the murder. The first is the simple solution, based on several clues suggesting that Cassetti's murder was the result of a mafia feud. Poirot then explains his second and much more complex solution, where every suspect has a link to the Armstrong case, and has sufficient motive for the murder. After explaining each of the suspects' reasons to kill, a flashback reveals that Ratchett was sedated, the pipe- cleaner and handkerchief (a Cyrillic ""N"" resembles a Roman ""H"") were planted, incidents which disturbed Poirot's sleep were contrived to confuse him, each of the passengers then stabbed Cassetti in turn, in an act of justice. When Poirot finishes his explanation, everyone is silent, the detective challenges the passengers to shoot him, placing a gun in front of all suspects, they all know he can expose their plot, as the one who orchestrated everything, Mrs. Hubbard grabs the gun, but instead tries to take her own life, but the gun is unloaded, Poirot wished to see how the suspects would react. During this time, the rescue crew have placed the train back on the tracks and cleared the snow, Poirot concludes that there is no justice to be found in the case, and Ratchett deserved his fate, he states that for the first time he will have to live with imbalance. In the end, Poirot tells Yugoslavian police it was a lone killer, allowing all suspects to leave, he leaves the train at the next station, there he is approached by a messenger, informed about a death on the Nile, he has been asked to investigate, Poriot accepts the case and taken by car. Branagh has the most brilliantly ridiculous huge moustache and is good as the insightful detective, the supporting cast of famous faces all do their parts well also, there are not too many big changes to murder setup and conclusion, obviously there are necessary tweaks to add more scale, with the odd pacy moment and action out of the train into the white wilderness, including the traditional ""gathering"" scene, it just about keeps you guessing, and its period detail and alternative style are fine, it is a wonderfully performed and interesting murder mystery. Very good!"

","'Murder on the Orient Express' is the latest addition to the ever growing 'style over substance' club. A film that is beautiful to watch, with no shortage of stunning mountainous scenery, but beyond the surface, it lacks much of what is expected from a whodunnit mystery thriller. If anything, the visuals work to the film's disadvantage. Cutting away to a shot of snow capped mountains in between scenes doesn't exactly help to build and hold any sort of tension.<br/><br/>The pacing is also too slow for my liking, with the murder and subsequent whodunnit mystery taking too long to arrive. Even as the mystery starts to unfold, there's a lingering feeling that the film is cruising along and never really gets up to speed. For production value, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is excellent, but visuals aren't enough for a film like this, especially when you consider the material they were working with."
"isaacreynolds-51776","6","1","5","13 November 2017"," Murder on the 'Mediocre' Express
","Movie Review: Murder on the Orient Express (2017)<br/><br/>Director: Kenneth Branagh Studio: 20th Century Fox Genre: Crime, Drama, Mystery Release: 2017 Run Time: 1 Hour 54 Minutes IMDb Rating: 6.8/10 Metacritic Score: 53/100 Rotten Tomatoe %: 58<br/><br/>First Impressions – <br/><br/>This film is the fourth adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, following the 1974 film, a 2001 made for TV movie and a 2010 episode of Agatha Christie's Poirot. I had a budget of $55 Million and features and all star cast.<br/><br/>The Plot – <br/><br/>The movie opens with the establishment of our detective who must solve the case of an artifact thief in Jerusalem. Soon after he is granted passage to his next destination on the famous Orient Express. However, during a troubling weather event, the train is stopped and a murder takes place. It is up to the detective to find out who is responsibly for the murder, and everyone is a suspect. The main problem with this movie is the problem that most movies that are adapted from novels or other literature have; it is severely missing details. Details that without we cannot become invested in various elements of the mystery and the entire film for that matter. The movie is well focused once the murder is discovered but without some important information that we as viewers are denied, it becomes difficult to understand at parts and throughout I couldn't help but question why I should care about certain things.<br/><br/>Characters and Acting – <br/><br/>While directing, Kenneth Branagh also stars as the main character; Hercule Poirot, a Belgian man who describes himself as ""Possibly the greatest detective in the world"". Branagh does a fine job playing the character and giving him a great identity but unfortunately that's where the interesting and stand out characters stop I'm afraid. It's almost a shame and a waste that this movie is jam packed full of talented and A-List actors but none of them shine whatsoever in their roles. They lack to convey anything interesting in the slightest, they have very little screen time between them and spend most of the movie staring outside of a train window. It's impossible to talk about the actors roles without spoilers but the A-List includes: Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Willem Dafoenot one of these actors give a necessarily bad performance but are incredibly under utilized to say the least. A big problem at the beginning of the movie and few times throughout was some of the line delivery was a tiny bit corny and silly, that being said the lines they were delivering didn't fit the context of a movie or a scene and it just felt as if they were reading some lines straight from the novel with little to no direction or context. It was incredibly distracting but only happened a few times with one or two B list actors.<br/><br/>Film Techniques – <br/><br/>This movie has some creative camera work and interesting shots that utilize the setting of a train well but can at times be distracting. For example, when one shot involves weaving through the windows outside a train whilst two characters are talking it comes difficult to focus on what is going o when you only see them for mini-seconds at a time while the rest of what you see fro that scene is just the metal of a train. The music is fine and the small amount of action is gripping enough; the movie uses a surprising amount of CG for it's set pieces and back grounds, it ranges from not half bad to clearly fake.<br/><br/>Tones and Themes – <br/><br/>The tone of the film is consistent and it shifts well from the serious mystery to a few light moments of humour here and there. The theme of the movie is justice, but it gets more complicated than that when some things unfold. <br/><br/>Conclusion – <br/><br/>This movie did it's job in keeping me intrigued throughout with it's mystery and entertained me enough to feel like satisfied with the performance of the main character but with it's lack luster usage of it's great cast and lack of overall detail, it didn't deliver on a memorable or intense enough murder mystery. <br/><br/>Would I Recommend? Yes<br/><br/>Would I Watch Again? No<br/><br/>My Score – 6.6/10"
"autisticreviewers","5","1","5","13 November 2017"," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","Having seen the 1974 one with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet...this one just felt pointless and unnecessary. You all know the plot so there's no need to go into what the story is about. There was just something about this film that just didn't work. The pace of the film was way off...it leaves you bored and not making you feel like you want more or sending chills down your spine etc. You just can't wait for the movie to end. There's honestly no difference from this one compared to the original, no changes are made except for how the train stops. The CGI was very bad and it makes the 1974 one look like it had the best effects ever. Kenneth Branagh being the director felt wrong and out of place, not that we've seen other directed movies he's done but with this he just doesn't capture the imagination like he could have.<br/><br/>We have all these great actors (one of them being Oscar Winner Judi Dench, and several other Oscar nominated actors) and they all seem wasted. As a movie where all the characters have to be well written and crafted and likable or interesting we don't seem to care about any of them. Not the actors fault it's just the director Kenneth Branagh failing to bring them to life. In the 1974 version they all got brought to life. The only actress that shines here is Star Wars's Daisy Ridley as Miss Mary Debenham. She brought so much energy to her role that it's obvious that Ridley is talented and is rising to be one of the greatest actresses! All in all it's not that bad, but it just wasn't really necessary to be made. Maybe see it at a cheap theater, or rent it when it comes out on DVD. Our opinion is to stick to the 1974 version. 2/5 stars. Jay and Nick- The Autistic Reviewers."

","Who doesn't love a good mystery? Murder on the Orient Express is one of the most famous mystery novels of all time, written by Agatha Christie, and now has two big screen adaptations. The first, made in 1974, was critically acclaimed and featured some of the greatest actors at that time. The second, released this weekend, features another fantastic ensemble cast, and manages to be a serviceable crime-mystery-thriller, if not as exciting or shocking as some would hope.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as Hercule Poirot, the ""greatest detective in the world"". While the rest of the film consists the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr, Lucy Boynton, and Daisy Ridley. Safe to say, it's one of the best ensembles any film has ever compiled, and truthfully, they actually do a great job of giving each actor a scene here or there to show their talent. At the very least, I found it nice to have such a famous cast because it's nowhere near as obvious who is at fault when it could be any one of these award winning actors and you would believe it.<br/><br/>I think where the film struggles is its script. The problem is with the way the film is constructed. It's very difficult to put together a good mystery, I can acknowledge that. But having the background of the characters pretty much laid out in front of you within the first half of the movie, raises an eyebrow before an eyebrow is supposed to be raised. Of course, I can't get into the major specifics without spoiling the surprises, because there are definitely some surprises. I just found the way the film was written to be interesting and not the way I would have gone about things. I guess my point is, less is more when it comes to revealing things.<br/><br/>Branagh brings the most out of the script that he can, even considering the enormously difficult task of balancing serious subject matter with quippy humor. That part of the film is impressive, as is the cinematography and production design. There are mind blowing long shots taking you through the train that bring you right into the Orient Express as if you're just another passenger. Surely, the production design will get a strong Oscar consideration, even if the overall film is a bit of a letdown in terms of award hopefuls.<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is far from a perfect film, and can be a bit of a mess in some sequences, but it's an enjoyable film that presents a worthy mystery of telling. Sometimes that's all you can ask for.<br/><br/>6.7/10"
"neobateman","6","1","5","11 November 2017"," A competently made remake that no one asked for.
","I have not been too kind on Hollywood remakes. Generally they take a film that was very successful and want to 'recreate it' for younger audiences, hoping that it would make even more money. However often these films are the remakes of brilliant originals and whilst these remakes can be very entertaining, they are still miles away from the quality of the original. Murder on the Orient Express is such a film. It has an amazing cast (like the original) which consists of great names such as Kenneth Branagh, Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz and Josh Gad. All of these actors give their everything, in particular Branagh who is amazing as the eccentric Hercule Poirot. He manages to recreate the character but also keep the traits that made him so memorable when the likes such as Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov played them. However the rest of the characterizations felt dull, I was uninterested in them plus I saw the original and knew how it ended. So even in that category the film failed to surprise me. What made the original film so good was that when Poirot was investigating it felt like that he was investigating real people. The characters were all flashed out well thanks to excellent writing. So when Poirot spots something odd, you as the viewer are ultimately challenged to re watch and check whether you can see what he sees. You were investigating with Poirot. In this adaptation the characters were so one dimensional that I honestly didn't care. I knew the ending of the original and so didn't care about the actual murder either. The film looks beautiful, it has awesome camera work and costume design. The actors do great and Branagh will no doubt catch Oscar buzz for his performance. I only recommend this film for audiences who have never read the Agatha Christie novel or seen the original film. This is because that way at least the murder remains interesting, if we know the conclusion the film loses much of this effect. The original had great characters that were three dimensional and felt real. There was re watch value, this film is a perfect Netflix watch. If you have never seen the original you will be entertained while it lasts but you are not encouraged to watch it again (at least I'm not)."
"trinaboice","8","1","5","11 November 2017"," Beautifully made with a disappointing fizzle
","Grade: B<br/><br/>Rating: PG-13, 1 hour 54 minutes<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: With an incredible A-list cast, this is a well-made, stylish ""Who-dunnit"" mystery directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars as the Belgium inspector Hercule Poirot. <br/><br/>It's extremely picturesque and beautiful, yet slowly fizzles with a disappointing reveal of who the murderer is.<br/><br/>Uplifting theme: ""We seek the truth from within, not without."" â€“ Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) ""Sometimes the law of man is not enough."" â€“ Pilar Estravados (Penelope Cruz) ""poison of deep grief"", healing, peace Revenge Right vs. wrong and everything in between<br/><br/>Things I liked: The period pieces and costumes of the 1930's are beautiful. You don't often see movies that take their time telling the story. Both the time period and the style of movie-making seemed old- fashioned. It was shot in 65 mm and really immerses you in the various environments. The sets are incredible. The all-star cast includes the talented Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leslie Odom Jr., Daisy Ridley and Derek Jacobi. Kenneth Branagh was absolutely outstanding. You might wonder how old Judi Dench isÂ…She was born in 1934, making her 82 years old. There was some humor, although the tone was a bit inconsistent, beginning with a very light feel and then remaining mostly dark for the rest of the film. There were some really great camera sequences. One scene was shot from above the characters as they talked. Another scene was shot from outside the train as it scanned the people walking down the hall through the windows. You really feel the movement of the train and feel like you're on one. There is a reference to a murder on the Nile, possibly a sneak peek into a sequel, but definitely a reference to another one of Agatha Christie's books called Agatha Christie's Poirot: Death on the Nile. Speaking of the author, Agatha Christie's Poirot: Murder on the Orient Express was her best-selling novel. The movie begins at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem with some gorgeous vistas and a funny sequence. One of these days, I'm going there. There are some beautiful vistas in Istanbul. One of these days, I'm going there too. Michelle Pfeiffer sings ""Never Forget"", which was co-written by director/actor Kenneth Branagh. Wow, he was really busy with this film. The photo of Katherine, Hercule Poirot's lost love, is actually Emma Thompson, Kenneth Branagh's real ex-wife.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: Some say it grinds to a halt, rather than get more intense. Yeah, it's true. The ending is anti-climatic. In the 1974 version of Murder on the Orient Express, the star- studded ensemble had equal moments of importance; whereas this version doesn't go into much depth with each character and kind of fizzles. A lot of movie critics are comparing it to the movie Clue which was able to develop characters much better. Daisy Ridley's character is way too young for her character, who should be much older. Sergei Polunin is a famous ballet dancer in real life, but we don't get to see him dance at all! Instead, we get to see him beat up some people. All of the actors were great, but felt underutilized. So much talent wasted. I heard a lady sitting near me say, ""That mustache has to go!"" Hercule Poirot's double- decker mustache is ridiculous, but his mustache mask is even worse.

","With its all star cast this adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic has bums hitting seats as soon as it was announced, and thankfully in my opinion it lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Everyone involved gives a good performance, and the action has lots of entertaining twists and turns. It was a big ask for Kenneth Branagh to replace David Suchet as Poirot in our minds, but he puts a different spin on the character that is entertaining.<br/><br/>I have not read the original source material, so can make not points about how accurate a retelling it is, but for nearly two hours of escapism I found this to be an entertaining film."

","Kenneth Branagh directs and takes the role (and the moustache) of the self named 'Worlds greatest detective' in this star studded production of one of the worlds most classic novels. With supporting cast including Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, PenÃ©lope Cruz, Judi Dench. Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad, Daisy Ridley, and Leslie Odom, Jr.. This beautifully stylish, suspense mystery based on the best-selling novel by Agatha Christie, the world's best-selling author is a treat for film fans like myself. With stunning cinematography, costumes, and locations, Murder On The Orient Express has me hooked from the opening scenes in Jerusalem, to the gorgeous train journey through Europe Kenneth Branagh has directed a film that makes you forget that the film for its most, is set in a train carriage and works wonders with the cameras, including some lengthy camera tracking shots that will make film makers smile with admiration. As Hercule Poirot, Kenneth makes him his own, and whilst we all still love David Suchet, I now declare that Kenneth is a Poirot for what I hope is a long series of films to come. Within minutes I was 'yep, he is indeed Hercule' with his insanely unique moustache and OCD 'quirks' making up the slight comedic moments in this tale.<br/><br/>Even though some people may be familiar with the novel or previous screen adaptations of Murder On The Orient Express, there is still a lot to love about this revisiting, and watching the film whilst not recalling the story, but watching it with someone who was very familiar with the story and its plot twists. We both adored this film the same amount. In the world of bang bang action movies, treat yourself to a very cinematic film in your home this March.<br/><br/>There is also the announced 'sequel' to the film, due out in 2019, which if Murder On The Orient Express is anything to go by, will most definitely be a pleasure to watch and experience."

","Director, thespian Kenneth Branagh with this offering hands down deserves best director awards for this whodunnit. Impressively Branagh, with a screenplay by Michael Green, based on Agatha Christie's 1934 novel juggles both lead actor and director duties with intricate well planned ease. <br/><br/>Produced by Ridley Scott's Scott Free productions, every frame is a picture, the period with sets and costumes are finely recreated. The star studded stellar cast including the likes of Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, the excellent Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer and Star Wars actor Daisy Ridley deliver first rate performances, in an adaptation with enough nods and tweaks from previous incarnations to remain fresh as Hercule Poirot's famous Belgian Moustache. <br/><br/>A simple must see for film sleuths."
"st-shot","4","1","6","17 November 2017"," Suicide on the Re-make Express
","Even if it had not been done before (and very well at that) this return trip on The Orient Express turns out to be a rather tepid mystery excursion. Given its cast and author's (Agatha Christie) pedigree it lags well behind the locomotive powering it as director/ lead Ken Branagh gets sloppy with wasteful incidentals and issues unrelated to the mystery at hand.<br/><br/>Hercule Poirot agrees to hitching a ride on The Orient Express from Istanbul to Paris. When a shady character (Johnny Depp) is brutally offed, Poirot is enlisted to solve the crime with a captive audience of suspects in a snowbound train waiting for AAA to rescue them. <br/><br/>While I find the story to be one of Christie's more unsatisfying offerings it does offer up a dozen fun characters and suspects that can allow major stars a chance to ham it up. The cast is A list (Judy Dench, Derek, Jacobi, Michelle Pfieffer, Penelope Cruz, William Dafoe) but the performances mostly D as they are barely able to muster guilty expressions. There are some fine montages of the locomotive flexing its powerful muscles but moments where it looks like an American Flyer set up in a department store window as it moves through the snow covered terrain. <br/><br/>It is impossible for me not to mention the 74 classic if only to highly recommend it as well as the managing of the cast in comparison's to Branagh's half inspired handling of his. Director Sidney Lumet (12 Angry Men) excelled at balancing and involving his cast who nearly to a member give wonderful broad performances. Branagh on the other hand lowers his suspect count, all but ignoring some of the other passengers implicated. Branagh himself is little less than a mawkish ghost of the brilliant Albert Finney's Poirot who conducted on stage the energy and fun that is missing in this present day version, it is simply the little engine that couldn't. It should have never left the station."
"hunter-friesen","5","1","6","15 November 2017"," A floundering beginning and middle make this film go from whodunit to who cares
","An adaptation of Agatha Christie's famous novel, Murder on the Orient Express has finally been released after months of Kenneth Branagh promising it will be an exhilarating experience. This film should have been a great mystery thriller because of the all-star cast and amazing source material. However, all that star power and pizazz can't save a plot with poor pacing and a director that can't decide how to use his cast appropriately. <br/><br/>The film opens in 1934 with famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) solving a missing jewel case in Jerusalem. While in the city, Poirot meets an old friend, Bouc (Tom Bateman), who happens to be the owner of the famous Orient Express. Poirot is persuaded to ride the Orient on his way back home to Belgium. Along on the train are thirteen other finely dressed passengers. There's the governess (Daisy Ridley), the lustful widow (Michelle Pfeiffer), the gangster (Johnny Depp), and a host of other riders. One of the passengers is murdered after the first night and the culprit is one of the passengers. Poirot must use his world-renowned detective skills to catch the killer before the train arrives at its destination. <br/><br/>The biggest problem the film has is the beginning and middle phases. The pace is uneven as it shifts from starting out slow when introducing Branagh, then quickly speeds through the rest of the characters when they are boarding the train. Characters are given little backstory to make them stand out apart from each other. Johnny Depp and Josh Gad are the only actors who have a fully fledged character that is memorable to watch and care about. The rest just fill in space and patiently wait their turn to get a few lines here and there. It makes it really hard to care about which character is the murder when none of them are that special to begin with. This lowers the level of suspense and mystery which in turn makes the film drag until the final act, which is actually really well done.<br/><br/>Branagh as the director is another problem the film has. He constantly makes the wrong decision when it comes to camera placement. The amount of overhead shots is staggeringly high and they really don't serve any purpose other than to confuse and annoy. We also have a tracking shot of Poirot boarding the train that could have easily been improved upon if Branagh had filmed it from another angle. <br/><br/>The production aspects of the film are really well done as they make the famous train setting glamorous and pleasing to the eyes. The decorations inside and around the train are lavish and really give off the impression that this is a luxurious haven for the wealthy elite. The costumes for each passenger are also really well done. They are the defining traits of the characters and the main thing that we remember them by apart from their faces. <br/><br/>The acting here is inconsistent and only a few of the actors stand out in their roles. This is because the film has to juggle over a dozen important characters and their story arcs in only two hours. What we end up getting is a lot of Poirot and Bouc, but little of everyone else. Poirot himself is a very annoying character that tries to walk the line between eccentric and dramatic. His mustache is even more annoying to see on screen and it too is given more time than it deserves. It looks as if Branagh put it on to say ""Hey look at me! I look funny and you should laugh!"" <br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives a surprisingly good performance as the runaway gangster, Ratchett. He gives off a suave, but dangerous look that works perfectly for his character. He commands every scene he has while also playing well off everybody else. Josh Gad and Derek Jacobi also do a good job as Depp's assistants. <br/><br/>Both Daisy Ridley and Leslie Odom Jr. struggle in their medium sized roles. They try too hard to be memorable and end up making things worse. The absolute worst performance comes from Sergei Polunin and Lucy Boynton as the Count and Countess. They are insufferable to watch as the barely speak fluently and act with the same skills as an overly serious high school theatre student that is trying too hard to impress the director. <br/><br/>Veterans Judi Dench and Michelle Pfeiffer do a respectable job in their criminally undersized roles. Dench plays a princess that knows she is more important than everyone on the train. Pfeiffer plays a widow that is searching for another husband as she recovers from her second divorce. She gets some show-stopping scenes at the end of the film, but it's too little too late for her character. <br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is a moderately watchable drama where the stakes never feel that high and the suspense never reaches its potential. The quality of the film is like a seesaw with each scene going from good to bad to good again. It's an inconsistent pattern that makes the film average with not many redeeming features to remember it by."

These people are at different social and financial levels, but they could all afford to travel abroad, get on a river boat first, then aboard the most luxurious, expensive ""Oriental Express"". <br/><br/>How they communicate with each other,? <br/><br/>How they assign themselves with different tasks and roles to target just one person? <br/><br/>How they can all timely meet the timetable to carry out the final act? <br/><br/>They are not related to each other, they don't even know each other's relationship to the victimized person, yet every one of them loved and so loyal to the deceased guy and vowed to revenge him for the injustice. <br/><br/>Who's the major planning person? <br/><br/>Who designs this big avenging project and murder plan? <br/><br/>Who provides the logistic and financial supports? <br/><br/>How they communicate with each other on a train if they don't smart phones through the texting method?

"LogicIsEverything","Null","1","7","2 February 2018"," Watchable but highly unlikely to happen in that era
","This novel and its modern day adaptation of it only proved one thing: The females' logic and their reasoning ability are indeed not quite fully developed. It also explained why the ancient female-controlled tribal structure was gradually phased out to be replaced by males. All of Agatha Christie's so-called murder mysteries, just like nowadays murder mysteries written by female authors, lacking reasonable logic is the common problem that resulted why I always shy away from most of the female mystery writers, i.e., pure imagination without any logic foundation, full of poor reasoning and self fulfilled laughable justification. <br/><br/>This ""Murder on The Oriental Express"" and her ""Murder on The Nile(?)"" are the two typical ridiculously written murder mystery cases. This murder case is crafted in the early nineteen century. We might have the primitive communication techniques such as telegram and telephone, but still not as popular and convenient as today's smart phones. Lower working class won't have such luxuries to contact each other by phone or telegram, albeit a bunch of unrelated strangers who didn't know each other. So how could it possible these people communicated with each other and make up a plan to get together and get the exact timing and timetable to go to a foreign country, aboard on a luxurious Oriental Express that usually only be affordable to the higher class rich people? The don't have iPhone or Samsung smart phone yet, they don't email, they don't have PC, they don't even have APP that could allow them to text each other, to cover up each other in a group murder on a train. <br/><br/>From the very beginning, the storyline, the plots, the scenarios....are simply ""IMPOSSIBLE"", how come it could be further developed into a murder case? But, if based upon what I've pointed out at the outset, the female take-everything-for-granted logic could make everything happen, no matter how ridiculous it might be. That's why we have so many cartoon-like characters in this novel and in all of the adapted movies. You can still enjoy the film or the novel, but first, you've got to make yourself a moron to accept all the illogic dramatized and exaggerated crap."
"JamiroBontes","6","1","7","10 November 2017"," A fine murder-mystery film
","There is a murder on the Orient Express and Hercule Poirot played by Kenneth Branagh is trying to find the murderer. He has twelve suspects that can be the murderer but he has to find which one is it, while also everyone isn't really helping because no one is really answering his questions.<br/><br/>Let's start with the performances, everyone is truly great in the movie especially Kenneth Branagh. He gives one of the best performances of the year. The beginning of the movie is very unexpected because it's very light hearted and funny. There is a scene were we see how good Hercule is at being a detective and then the next scene we get told how good he is, even tough we just saw it. When the murder happens then the movie starts getting good the story is very interesting and we are invested in it. But when you know who the killer is after that they try to make this statement about revenge and it's just stupid and not logical, no spoilers.<br/><br/>This movie is fine, it's perfectly watchable but the end is just dumb and it's a shame because I felt like this could be one of the best movies of the year and it's not even close. It's a movie with a good story, great acting but the tone of the movie is just all over the place. If you want to see this movie then know that it's nothing special, but if you have doubts then just skip it."

","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I was a little disappointed by the incorrect portrayal of Poirot with a large gray mustache, as in the books he had a small black mustache. The way the story was set up was interesting, and like all of Christie's novels, there were many plot twists. It is a good mystery movie."
"alindsay-al","7","1","8","7 November 2017"," A decent mysterious film
","After seeing the trailer for this film I actually had some anticipation for this film and after seeing it I enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a group of people being investigated on a train after a mysterious murder. Kenneth branagh plays famous detective hercule poirot and he is fantastic in this film. He nails the accent and it is so entertaining watching this charismatic performance from him. He also nailed the brilliance of the character and made his discoveries seem pretty genuine. There is a huge supporting cast in this film so I will just talk about the main ones, daisy ridley plays a governess in the film and she is really good. Sometimes she is a little wooden but she delivers a charming character with some interesting features about her. Johnny Depp plays an American gangster in the film and he does a good job, he isn't his usual cartoony self here and I liked him in this more serious role. Something similar could be said about josh gadd who is really developing into a great all round actor. Michelle pfiefer is in this film and she delivers a good charming performance that makes her an interesting character in the film. Willem Dafoe and judi Dench also do good jobs in there smaller roles. The story is interesting as you are following the breadcrumbs with branagh as he attempts to solve this mystery. However, this film is the definition of the journey being better then the finish line as I wasn't a big fan of the end reveal in the film. It just felt cheap and the easy way out that didn't really give me a sense of satisfaction. The script has some decent humour and drama in it, but it also has some over the top dialogue that took me out of the moment, also this film is guilty of exposition dialogue on a few different occasions. The style of the film is very lavish, which works and seeing the different interrogations made this film feel interesting if a bit repetitive. It felt like a very linear by the numbers film which does overall hurt the film. Overall I enjoyed this film but it isn't a truly memorable experience."
"pikegarver","9","1","9","30 April 2019"," Best Version
","This movie seems to get piled on by both critics and users. There's always the comparison to the revered 1974 ""classic"" by Sidney Lumet. I enjoyed this movie so much, I rented the original with Albert Finney as Poirot. I found it unwatchable. Finney's portrayal was cartoonish and way over the top. It reminded me of Charlie Chaplain talkie and nobody likes that.
I first saw some of this movie in a public setting and was immediately drawn in. After not being able to find an affordable rental,I purchased it from Directv. After rewatching it yesterday it still delivers. All the actors that get dumped on are brilliant. Johnny Depp is very convincing and Kenneth Branagh is brilliant. I also thought Penelope Cruz' performance is vastly underrated. Those elements, combined with the sweeping 65 mm cinematography give this picture an old time Hollywood feel with a few nods to modern day political ""niceness"". I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."

Movie is like a 6, oh it's a fun remake, starts way to slow, but not needed to be made as a remake and not as good as the original. Depp is like a 10++++, just amazing here. So I rated it a 9."

Even though whenever I see a movie that contains many famous people, i can automatically conclude that the movie is weak and the director used those actors to boost the revenue, but not with this movie.
The movie talks about murder that happens on a train that got blocked on railroad by snow and the detective on board tries to find the murderer. The movie was performed in a way that every 10min makes you suspect someone but then something happens and you change your mind again and suspect someone else."

","How many remakes of this will there be?<br/><br/>This is a lavish star studded presentation of a timeless tale. The attention to 1930's detail is excellent, the scenery superb, the camera angles are all excellent. Brannagh holds the Belgian accent well. Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer steal the film with Depp being remarkably understated. <br/><br/>So why only a 7 out of 10 ? The first scenes are all totally unnecessary and not even in the book! The ""prostitute in the kitchen"" aside .... (where did that thread come from ? ) ... I was unsure of the purpose other than Brannagh's bombastic monologues. The ending... oh my ! ... was definitely not in the book. And the ending paves the way for another film. But knowing the book in question, I am unsure how they will work that one. Brannagh is rather too bombastic and sharp to be an excellent Poirot but he works it well. Not all the characters on the train are the same as in the book. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the film well enough.

"TaylorYee94","8","0","2","20 June 2020"," Well planned out with details on camera walk, settings, and mise en scene
","1. Camera walking is very original. For example, the way the camera was set up above the heads of Poirot, Bouc, and the doctor, observing the murder scene without actually showing it is effective to bring out more curiosity from audience and to amplify the violence behind it. One more, I love how the camera captures each suspect's face so it looks like Poirot observes and reads into each one's expression as he walks by.<br/><br/>2. The director takes advantages of the fact the murder happened on the train. It's limited, secluded and close-to-each-other space. Audience can only see a part of what's happening because the camera zooms in, implying there are so many other things going on outside of this frame and keeping the suspense. The train, the table, the dining area, and many props are pleasure to look at.<br/><br/>3. It is a joy to find hidden message behind mise en scene. At the ending, the train heads into sunset in contrast with the snowing station where Poirot got off. While the station is gray, sunset is warm orange; audience can expect brighter future for the passengers. When Poirot boarded the train, it was one long-take so audience can expect hectic chaos the detective runs into, and the director can tell the audience 'follow him with this journey of mystery'. Last but not least, THE MIRROR!!! It was brilliant idea to show two or more faces using mirrors.<br/><br/>4. Deduction point on storytelling. I did not watch older version of the ""Murder on the Orient Express"", so I'm not sure how it managed to tell complex story more efficiently. However, newer version incorporated too much of a story, and it was a little bit everywhere"

","This has the potential to be nominated for some serious Oscars. Boasting a star-studded cast and an exciting plot, this promises to be one of the best films of 2017. It diverted some from the book at the beginning, but that was actually a better choice. In the book, I felt I was thrown in without any context, and had to figure out the settings and characters. The movie took its time getting there, in a good way, and it was all the better for it. It established the characters clearly and made it easy to suspect each one of them for different reasons. Although the acting was good, there were still a few moments that fell flat. Johnny Depp's ""New York"" accent in particular. It was so obviously fake. And there was one scene where two characters are having a conversation, but one's back is turned to the camera and blurry. I hate that. It distracts, and sometimes makes it hard to follow crucial bits of dialogue, especially when a character's accent is hard to understand. This movie did something I thought would never happen. It made me like Josh Gad. I've been ragging on him for years about how I find him loud and annoying, but here, that doesn't happen. Maybe it's because he's in a more serious role, as opposed to a comedic one. Maybe ""comedy"" is his weakness, hence why he feels the need to shout every line but when he's in a serious role such as this one, he's got some serious accting chops. I wasn't blown away by his performance, but I was at least impressed. I'll go into future roles of his with an open mind, because this proves he can be a good actor. There was also some witty dialogue and some of it very sharp and snarky. The book did not have this, and it's a welcome improvement. If you're looking for a movie to make you feel smart and sophisticated, go see this. It's mostly worth it.

I hope that this mistake will be avoided in the next episode. There is just another error in the movie: some characters dress light clothes to be in a snowy iced mountain. Branagh has found its perfect tuning with the cinema by this character and the environment he plays. He offers a representation of Hercules Poirot astonishing almost metaphysical in its concreteness."

","I'm of the opinion that classic music no longer suits our modern world. I'm not saying Beethoven is bad music because an argument could be made that it is the best music ever composed. It's just that it isn't the music of today. Well, the version of Murder On the Orient Express is like that. It looks very good and the acting is tops, it's just a slow, unexciting movie. Today's audiences need to actually SEE the murder (if not the murderer) and watch the blood flow.
When the TV show Murder She Wrote went off the air it wasn't because it didn't have ample viewship. It was because those who tuned in were older and therefore not as susceptible to advertising. This Murder On the Orient Express was a contemporary, movie version of that phenomenon."
"dalelandkaties","7","0","5","21 February 2020"," A testimont to Branagh's directorial talents but falls a little flat.
","It has taken me ages to get round to watching this film - despite being a huge Agatha Christie fan - and I was not disappointed. That said, I was not wowed either.<br/><br/>The absence of David Suchet, who I was clearly not expecting to see going into this, is still hard hitting. He is Poirot! And it took well over half an hour to accept Kenneth Branagh as the acclaimed detective. However, he provided a powerful performance throughout the film as he highlighted many of Poirot's obvious quirks and a suitably sufficient Belgian accent. The moustache is unusually different but noticeably iconic non the less.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is full of big names and noticeable faces, from Daisy Ridley to PenÃ©lope Cruz. The biggest of these by far was the doomed salesman, Johnny Depp. Unfortunately, much like every film I see him in now, I only see a shadow of the actor he once was and far too much Jack Sparrow still peeking through in his performance. Thankfully, he isn't on screen for long and does play the sleezy salesman with sufficient success. Many of the other performances fell flat for me too, with many underdeveloped characters and dry dialogue. Josh Gad was able to break out from this however in his role, perhaps due to an extended screen time or further action based sequences.<br/><br/>There is not much to speak of in terms of plot without spoiling the film or reiterating the book. But, as previously mentioned, Poirot and the other characters are introduced hastily and with mild success. Their back stories are brushed over in a helpful way as their paths that led them to the Orient Express are unveiled. Whilst this is necessary for pace of the film, it makes it hard to find a connection with many of these people.<br/><br/>Much of the cinematography in this film is outstanding, with excellent overhead shots within the compact compartments of the train carriages. There is also a shot near the end that appeared to perfectly resemble that of The Last Supper, which is a superb nod of what is to come. For this alone, this film is worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was another testimont to Branagh's directorial talents and has left me yearning for further adventures of Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was another testimont to Branagh's directorial talents and has left me yearning for further adventures of Hercule Poirot."

"Offworld_Colony","5","0","1","17 February 2020"," A strange duck of a movie.
","Branagh drives a nearly flawless performance as actor but a less than interesting one as director. The script has some lovely poignant lines and a stellar cast is engaging, certainly when the murder occurs and the train stops. But I suspect the flaws of the film lie in the photography, which is neither engaging, thematic, or smart. I imagine a better director might have been able to create images either using technology to evoke a period feel, like Scorsese's Hugo, or use lighting and texture and shorting style, like Scorsese's The Aviator, to generate a classic overarching tone to the piece. But it does neither. The lighting is flat and placid and the set and costume design and colours are not settling or sumptuous. I wanted more theatre from Branaghbut his work here is a little average. There should be little clues in every scene as to the backstory of these characters and their connection or intention, little red herrings in the directing, the ways characters are introduced should say something. When a tracking shot or an overhead pan or a long take is used it should be for a purpose within the narrative and the mystery.
But the tired and damaged Poirot is a nice, humanising take, something I certainly didn't expect. And even though I knew the ending, it made for good viewing as it rumbled along."
"metztex","6","0","1","16 January 2020"," Not great, but not that bad either
","Bottom line up front: This adaptation of the classic Agatha Christi's book is a decent who done it story and is very exacting in the details. While the film does not seem to follow the original book too well it still follows the book enough to allow the viewer to be engaged. This film also has a spread of characters filled by many cultures, which Christi did not do in the book, to appease the PC police, it is passable in this case.<br/><br/>While I am not an Agatha Christi guru I have read this particular book and felt this film was a decent adaptation to the original story. The detective was exacting and in some ways compelling but that is pretty much where it ends. The suspect's, which many are played by well known actors/actresses are good but felt their talents would have been better spent on other projects. This was evident by the lack of character development in many cases. If the character development had been better I think this film would have benefited greatly but probably would have suffered from time limitations.<br/><br/>Cinematography is pretty good and the effects, when needed were well done and complement the film. Plot line follows a Christi like line but does take a few liberal turn to appease the PC police. This is usually annoying but is not as bad in this film.<br/><br/>If you are an ardent Christi fan I would avoid this film as it is likely to upset you. If you are a mystery fan more than a Christi fan, you may find this film worth watching."

So all these strangers on a train until one of them is murdered and its up to Kenneth Branagh to solve the mystery. I've never read Agatha Christie before, but I like a good mystery movie because I can use my brain to figure out who the killer is. The first half of the movie is good, well maybe not the beginning, which I felt was out of place, but when were introduced to everyone on the train and a murder goes down, that's when the real drama begins. And after that that's pretty much it actually. I found myself bored and uninterested in the mystery and what was going on that I lost focus. The movie is entertaining I'll give it credit, but the problem with this is that it's a star-studded cast, but only half of them get any screen time. They choose to focus on half of the characters and the rest they leave in the wind. We don't get any character development for Willem Dafoe or Judi Dench for example and its not until the end where the characters we forgotten have a backstory that feels rushed. And by then its not interesting anymore its an entertaining murder mystery with no real development at all. I was really disappointed overall."

","Admit I don't recall the original, but I'm guessing when Agatha Cristie wrote this masterpiece, Poirot wasn't exactly famous, and he wasn't introduced as such in the book.

Missed the first five mins, and I don't know whether the killer hunted down Poirot to ask for his help, and that's how they got on the same train, but even if that's the case, I don't see it making much sense.<br/><br/>I mean they managed to get the killer on the train and booked the whole trip to extract their revenge, and they invited along the only person in the world who could solve the crime. That's just trying too hard ...<br/><br/>Maybe a better adaptation that better suits our time would've been to start from the ending of the film.

"Rodrigo_Amaro","7","0","1","13 September 2018"," Fine experience but it'll never beat Lumet's classic
","Yet another clumsy remake of a powerful classic trying to emulate its steps, throw a big cast and big budget, make some improvements in order to cash 
in and maybe entertain its new viewers or mostly the ones who can't stand ""old films"". To talk about this ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is kind of more of 
the same specially to those who watched Sidney Lumet's brilliant psychological study starring Albert Finney as famous detective Hercule Poirot. Most folks 
had seen that movie, gave it a shot to this one and thought ""well, there's something missing here"" or ""it's not good enough"". Lead actor and director 
Kenneth Branagh had one thing in his favor while making it: speed. The story flows more like an adventure flick in some parts, with some great exterior shots 
at times ruined by weak special effects while Lumet's film was more like a play where you could catch every nuance of each actor and each character the more 
the classic story progressed - and to resume for those who haven't seen it, Poirot investigates the murder of a mysterious man on board of the Orient Express 
while the train is stuck in the snow, interrogating all of the passengers, important figures or people of little relevance. 
 
I'm not a detractor of Branagh's film, in fact, I had my share of good time with it and find it very stylish, impecable costumes and art-direction, and 
in times where plot twists are common place for the same type of project, to bring back a little bit of class and long dialogues is something that it's worth 
seeing. The cast doesn't disappoint despite not having one prominent performance in it - and that's why the 1974 film was the better one. Branagh is a fine Poirot 
but far too eccentric (and I'm comparing it with the books written by Agatha Christie, who presents him as a man of rituals and manners but Branagh makes him look 
like a Phineas Fogg, evidenced in his opening scene with the eggs); Johnny Depp, PenÃ©lope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, 
Josh Gad (finally breaking from his usual annoyance) are all good but no stand-outs here - maybe Dafoe grabbed my attention the most. 
 
However, I've found it an exhausting experience not just because I already knew what was going to happen but mostly the rush in presenting some things 
and slowing down anothers - the ending felt like a disappointment if compared back (sorry for the repetition) with the other film - of which I wasn't much of a fan 
during my first viewm neither the book (that chase sequence between Poirot and MacQueen was dumb). Lumet's ""canon"" version never loses momentum despite the play aspects of it, you're intrigued through it all while Branagh reserves some 
thrills here and there and then it becomes a snooze fest halfway through. It's like much ado about almost nothing (no pun intended with Kenneth's previous film), I 
haven't felt it was a necessary film or one based of Agatha's novel that was needed to be remade - she has several great mystery books that weren't made into a film 
or just became TV projects, I'd like to see a version of ""After the Funeral"". Good news is that the movie's apparent success excited Branagh enough to the point of already announce that ""Death on the Nile"" will come and perhaps new audiences will be interested in following the footsteps of the incredible Hercule Poirot. Challenge is: that one was already made in 1978, also an Oscar winning film and with a stellar cast; difference: as of now, I still haven't seen it. We'll see. 
 
Conclusion: ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is fine, entertains but it's far from being on the level of quality and memorable works where a gathering of movie stars makes you feel impressed or overjoyed with the experience. 7/10"

Granted they occupy first-class compartments, and the rest of the coach cars may well be filled withe invisible hoi polloi segregated from everyone rich, famous or had a motive to murder, and forbidden to enter the club or dining cars. It seems the screenwriter was determined (thank heavens) to speed along the journey by ignoring each inconsistency as if it were a third-class passenger trying to enter the clubcar or an avalanche threatening to impede the pace of his plotting. 
On my plus side are the performances, evero one of which equalled or bettered their 1974 incarnation. Of course, no one EVER betters john Gielgud in any role, but I preferred Branagh to Finney, Although AF is a favorite, i found
d his Poirot a bit too stodgy and forced. Michelle Pfeiffer reminded me she knows an d uses her craft, as did Johnny Depp, who masterfully and consistently chose an intonation and vocal rhythm unlike I've heard before from him.
Does anyone know the background of Sergei Polunin? Is he related to that clown genius Slava Polunin?
Also on the plus side for me was Kenneth Branagh's direction. The 1974 version moved like cold molasses, and some of the acting seemed like star turns rather than ensenble work. I appreciated Branagh's comparatively brisk direction that momentarily whisked us though and past an infelicity in the script. The denouement chugged and then halted along with the train. Perhaps it was blocking: the actors arrayed in a row, waiting for Poirot as if they were at an employment agency agency awaiting a chcck and, hopefully, their next gig. Yet I do not regret for the two hours spent in their company."

","Wow...kind of unusual that I would be so at odds with most of the reviews, here. But I LOVED this remake! I do have to admit...I wasn't the biggest fan of the 1974 version, so maybe that's why. And it's not that I just reject older Agatha Christie movies. I loved Death on the Nile (1978), and Evil Under the Sun (1982). But this remake was beautifully shot, well written, and DIDN'T move at a seemingly glacial pace, which is something that occasionally annoys me about a lot of early 70's films. I love film from every time period, but seriously...I think the popularity of quaaludes had an obviously quantifiable effect on the films of the 70's. Everything was soooooooo drawn out and kind of boring. And washed out, color-wise. Yes, yes, I know I'm going to catch a ton of s**t about this. Anyway, I thought the actors did a fine job, and I especially have to single out Branagh for his take on Hercule Poirot (and his directing!). I would never have believed anyone could replace Peter Ustinov in my heart as Poirot, but he made the character his own. He went with a more serious, more complex and tortured, more inward-looking Poirot, instead of the quippy, sassy, amused and amusing Poirot that Ustinov gave us...which is not to say Branagh's Poirot was humorless...""Forgive me, I am Belgian"" had me laughing out loud. It was an interesting choice, and a smart one, in my humble opinion. I absolutely cannot wait to see him in Death on the Nile (if the hint of a sequel at the end of this film is portentous)!!!"

","Although not a patch on the 1974 original, this totally unnecessary remake proved to be not as bad as first feared. Kenneth Branaghs portrayal as Poriot which I initially viewed as hilarious in the extreme given the ridiculously comic moustache he donned for the role culminated in a rather convincing performance with me totally buying into him as Belgiums finest ever detective. The film although beautifully shot is still just a little too glossy and smooth, lacking the atmospheric tension of the original. The plot is pretty faithful with the cast doing what's expected of them, although some like Penelope Cruz had peripheral characters who offered little throughout. Remaking a whodunnit especially a famous one seems rather pointless, as most people will know who the culprit is anyway. But nonetheless I was pleasantly surprised, it is worth a watch and if Branagh returns as Poriot in Death on the Nile as is hinted at in the films finale, then those little grey cells may get another outing."

The 1974 version of Murder On The Orient Express was better, there is no doubt about that, and it's not because we already knew the outcome now. This version looked all too dramatic to me, and even with big names as Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, or Michelle Pfeiffer, you don't get a better movie. Why they chose a British actor (Kenneth Branagh) to play the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is also something I can't understand and that I can't approve. There are enough good French or Belgian actors that can speak English that would do better with this role. Kenneth Branagh's French imitation accent is just not believable, certainly not for a Belgian like me. Agatha Christie's stories are just better as a book than as a movie, that's just a fact.

No rest for Poirot.<br/><br/>Since this is a remake many of us know who did the murder either from the 1934 novel by Agatha Christie or the 1974 movie.

An antique dealer Samuel Ratchatt (Johnny Depp) whose real name is Cassetti, who got away with a kidnaping and murder of a child Daisy, the daughter of the well known Armstrong family. He was stabbed 12-times, some strong blows some shallow.<br/><br/>Notables: Josh Gad as McQueen, as a secretary to Ratchatt; Michelle Pfeiffer as American socialite, Mrs Hubbard and also Linda Arden; Daisy Ridley as Mary Debenham the Governess to Daisy Armstrong; Judy Dench as Princess Dragomiroff; Derek Jacobi as Edward Masterman, Ratchatt's valet; Penelope Cruz as Pilar Estravados, a former nanny; Lucy Boynton as Countess Elena; Willem Dafoe as Gerhard Hardman a Pinkerton agent; Dergei Polunin as a Count Rudolph; Daisy Ridley as Governess Mary Debenham; Leslie Odom Jr as Dr. Arbuthnot; and Tom Bateman as Bouc, the Director of the Orient Express.<br/><br/>Josh Gad did a great job and he should stick to drama and not comedy where he is never funny.

","I enjoyed this film - I wasn't sure that I was going to, based on the reviews I'd read - but I did enjoy it, in a mixed kind of way. This despite the fact that I remember the 1974 version, and the TV series version with David Suchet fondly. <br/><br/>A lot of films nowadays tend to be big budget, all action, sweary-mary kind of films. It was refreshing to see a movie that was entertaining and suitable to watch with family members from teens to seniors. <br/><br/>Hardcore fans of Agatha Christie may not be to happy with this adaptation/remake because of the way it's been Hollywoodified - maybe the finger can point to Kenneth Brannagh for this, as he directed and starred in the leading role (which can be seen as a vehicle for his success/reputation). Elements of the film had been modernised, primarily to meet expectations of it's potential audiences, rather than to drive the films on. It was fast paced, moody, sexy and clever at different times - but I don't think it actually needed to be or should have been. The cast was undeniably brilliant, and between them they probably have a massive trophy collection - but did it need to be? I suspect that if the cast was an attempt to do a star studded feature like the 1974 version then it meets that expectation. If the cast was chosen for acting prowess, then perhaps unknown stars could have faired equally well because the film isn't about personality and connecting with the characters, it's about their story. (Perhaps the use of superstars was a clever way of diverting the obvious revelations from the audience so they kept on guessing 'whodunnit' too.)<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book or seen the other versions you might get more enjoyment out of this than anyone who knows the story. Either way though this was a decent family film which wasn't offensive and was made to fit for modern audiences. I'd watch whatever follow-up is planned (and hinted towards at the end). 6 out of 10."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","4","26 February 2018"," The bones of Christie's mystery are at least good enough to carry this update for the uninitiated
","It doesn't take a detective to deduce that this remake/reimagining of Agatha Christie's esteemed novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was about 20th Century Fox trying to overloading a movie poster with big names in hopes of big box office returns. Yet in the hands of Kenneth Branagh, who directs and also stars, the film avoids a complete slide into gussied up, hollow period mystery.<br/><br/>Branagh plays literature's second greatest detective, Hercule Poirot, whom screenwriter Michael Green (who had a huge 2017 with ""Logan"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"") wisely treats as the centerpiece of the story. Poirot could simply have fulfilled his functional purpose as the audience's eccentric mystery-solving surrogate, but the film commits to him as a central character, whose journey in some ways supersedes the crime itself.<br/><br/>Hoping for some respite aboard the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to France, Poirot reluctantly becomes chief investigator on a case when a passenger is murdered on the train. He then interrogates the passengers, which include the likes of Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Oliva Colman, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr. and more, slowly revealing secrets and deceptions until he cracks the case. <br/><br/>Having neither read Christie's novel nor seen previous film adaptations, I can't comment on how this update compares, but its tried and true bones provide sufficient entertainment. The film relies a little heavily on interrogation scene dialogue and the glee of Poirot spouting off some genius bit of detective work from evidence we hadn't considered, but the twists that clearly made ""Orient Express"" a classic find a way to work their magic regardless of any changes or tweaks in this version.<br/><br/>That said, Branagh's tone is one of fantasy and heart more than a gritty, claustrophobic thriller. He's more interested in the thematic elements that complicate and layer the truths that Poirot uncovers than crafting a gripping, heart-pounding genre film. Curiosity is the entertainment factor he wields rather than suspense. It's meant to provoke our intellect and our sense of wonder above anything else. <br/><br/>Green's script misfires mostly in regard to the mystery within the mystery, or the backstory that Poirot uncovers which proves to be integral to his solving the case. It doesn't quite make the necessary emotional ties. Yet Green's commitment to playing out Poirot's personal story arc and coloring in who he is with some small details makes up for it. He's a character I certainly wouldn't mind seeing on the screen again.<br/><br/>The actors playing the passengers don't get nearly the same legs to stand on, so most of the flashy names on the marquee are just that, flash. Only ""Star Wars"" star Daisy Ridley manages to show off some chops in her brief scenes and in a way Gad gets to show he can do more than comedy. All in all, despite each getting one-on-one time with Branagh, there's not much in the way of meaty, dramatic content.<br/><br/>Given my inexperience with this classic mystery story, it's impossible to say whether this version has enough to hold on to for those with greater degrees of familiarity. My instincts say it might be a close call - knowing the truth will surely place more strain on Branagh's interpretation of Pourot. So climb aboard at your own peril if you hold a deep reverence for Christie's novel or Sidney Lumet's 1974 version. Objectively, it's an engaging film suitable for mainstream tastes. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

I am still surprised this movie (which had an amazing story and phenomenal actors) didn't really amaze me. 
Before i give detailed feedback, I must say that the camera work in this movie is astounding. 
Okay lets talk about the story... the story is absolutely brilliant but had very poor execution. I felt bored in between, which is never an ideal situation in a crime/thriller. 
Lets see the acting. 
I was quite disappointed with performances from Johnny Depp and Willem Dafoe. I was incredibly impressed by Josh Gad, who really showed how flexible he is as an actor.

Using creative angles you rarely feel that the cramped setting of a couple of carts in a train is ever an issue, rather it's taken advantage of well by using the long lengths of the carriages. You're sometimes intimately placed in the middle of the conversation and sometimes looking down upon the cast which you can recognize immediately by the unique styles of each and every one.<br/><br/>If you, like I, have not seen the original we can consider ourselves lucky (at least according to user Bob-the-movie-man) and I do consider myself lucky to have went into this movie knowing about the original but not yet seen it. I will certainly take the time to watch the classic as well, as should we all, all the more reason to if you liked this film.<br/><br/>Short summary: While twists and turns are expected in a murder mystery you'll find yourself enjoying the ride even if you do solve it before the reveal is shown. I do find myself missing some comic relief but I guess I am comparing it too closely to Clue. A cozy and enjoyable ride on the orient express, don't forget your ticket!"

","This film tells the story of a talented detective who tries to solve the murder of a passenger on the Orient Express.<br/><br/>In order to portray how talented Poirot is, the logic and reasoning sometimes jumps several steps ahead. As a result, he knows information out of the blue, which undermines the credibility of the story. Another thing that distracts me is the accent in the film. I could not understand most of the dialog, and had to turn on the subtitles, which almost never happens!<br/><br/>Otherwise, it is a pleasant film to watch, as there are so many recognisable faces and really big names.

"siderite","6","0","5","18 February 2018"," A fundamentally passive experience, unlike a whodunit should be
","Of course, there is the matter of the source material, which couldn't have been changed significantly. However, I am here to argue that this movie was a failure for meeting none of the expectations it created.<br/><br/>First, as a murder mystery, it should have allowed for enough evidence for a viewer to solve the case. Instead, every time Poirot made a leap, he was using information we didn't have, that he was aware of apriori of the events in the film.<br/><br/>Second, there is the issue of the great cast. You expect something like this to not be much in the way of story, but that it would shine on the strength of the actors:Kenneth Branagh, Johhny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Penélope Cruz and so many others. Instead, we get a bit of each, a bit theatrical, a bit over the top in some cases, even a few moments that really felt fake (although in hindsight, if the actor is playing someone who is lying, maybe they did well?), but nothing shiny. No depth of character, no emotional buildup, nothing. The absolutely best scene comes from Willem Dafoe, at the end, completely ruined by the blunt interpretation of Pfeiffer a few moments later. Branagh's obviously fake mustache had more screen time than any of the stars in that great cast.<br/><br/>And third, there was the story. A violent act that causes much pain is explained mostly through Poirot's description and fractured images that are supposed to make the viewer understand. Yet there is no transition from there to the present. We don't care about the event, the characters and we are completely unaware of how everything fits and how people got to this point. As a result, other than Poirot's intense stare and the nice stage sets, there is no story. I had more fun watching the introduction of the detective than in all of his solving of the train case.<br/><br/>Bottom line: For what it attempted, it failed at every step. For what it promised, it failed to deliver. With pain in my heart I can say that this was substandard."

","The concept and plot is good. I didn't guess the murderer. As usual, Agatha Christie fooled me every time. But there are a lot of things in the movie which I don't like. Firstly, I want to say that it's better than Crooked House. This film is a little bit of drama and a little boring. But at least it didn't make me feel sleepy.<br/><br/>Second, the accent is killing the film. I know that some people like to have real national accents. But for viewers, the accent is quite difficult to catch, especially for me. I put a lot of effort on listening. So, I prefer British accent or American accent. Thirdly, it might just me. I don't see the built-in translations for French. Not everyone in the world knows French, you know. Thankfully, the one I watched had Chinese translations, so, I could understand what they were saying in French language.<br/><br/>Finally, some scenes are not clearly, especially the camera angle changed when they shot the dead body. The viewer can't see the wound on the dead body clearly. That is the only fact that made me angry. Maybe the director didn't want viewers to be afraid, I guess. But my opinion is that if we could see the wound on the dead body, it'd be great.<br/><br/>Finally, the train.

","I avoided this film for the longest time because I have serious reservations, and rightly so, about this trend of remaking films. Not even the star power of Johnny Depp could pull me into watching this film under normal circumstances. It was not until I was utterly desperate for something to watch that I relented and gave this film a try. I am glad that I did. <br/><br/>First off, I am an Agatha Christie fan. Murder On the Orient Express is one of the crown jewels of the Christie crown. So, naturally, there was a preponderance of skepticism from the start. I mean, how could anyone but Peter Ustinov play the indomitable Hercule Poirot? This was an open and shut case.....that is, until Kenneth Branagh took up the mantle of the saucy Belgian's mustache. <br/><br/>Branagh's performance gives more than enough reason to overlook certain creative liberties taken with the plot or the fact that someone actually had the unmitigated gall to commit acts of cinematic terrorism such as casting Josh Gad McQueen in this film. Branagh truly is the rightful heir to the role of Hercule Poirot and I hope to see more of him. Perhaps in my second favorite Agatha Christie tale, Death on the Nile? <br/><br/>The writing and directing in this film were good. Johnny Depp's character lacked depth as did most of the other characters. Michelle Pfeiffer was her usual glorious self as was Judi Dench, Willem Defoe and Derek Jacobi. Nevertheless, the strength of Branagh's performance is more than enough reason to overlook the liberties taken with the plot and the casting misfires. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised with this film and look forward to more Hercule Poirot a la Kenneth Branagh."

","Kenneth Branagh is famous for recreating theater on film. That is exactly what he did with a story. But sadly this wasn't a play but a mental exercise. And it shows.

It works in a book and will get you in a zen state (yes there is scientific proof that actually happens) but in a movie the mind wanders and.....that is a bad thing.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning, the actor are great in the limited time they get to shine..... I even like this version of the Belgian detective that is (for me) a far cry from the man portrayed in the book.<br/><br/>It is a valiant effort that tries to stay true to the dry story telling of Agatha Christy.

Don't watch it mainly for him.<br/><br/>Yes, Depp plays the character who is central to the story, and the promotional materials concentrate very much on him, but this is something of a hoax. Just watch the trailer and you have gotten the best of him in this.<br/><br/>The producers are just desperate to make the project look relevant, because the movie itself is not that good.

But I will save you some time, 105 minutes in fact, and tell you right now that it's not worth the time.<br/><br/>""Murder"" is big budget moviemaking at its laziest and most soul-less. I like how it all looks visually, and finale ain't actually half bad - especially compared to the rest - but there's nothing to write home about, as they say.<br/><br/>But let's make a feeble attempt to begin at the beginning, shall we? The great detective Hercule Poirot is back, this time played by Kenneth Branagh who also directed the joint.<br/><br/>The story takes places mostly on or around the titular train, and it's based on a famous novel by Agatha Christie, first published in 1934. I was suprised to learn from IMDb that, so far, it's only the sixth screen adaptation of the classic.<br/><br/>I usually find movies based on classic literature, Shakespeare or otherwise, boring, but Branagh sure likes them a lot. His last work as a director was 2015's ""Cinderella"", and now this. How refreshing was to see him try his hand in modern mainstream fare such as directing the first ""Thor"" or the latest ""Jack Ryan""... but now it's back to the literature.<br/><br/>""Murder"" is Branagh's attempt to introduce Christie and Poirot to blockbuster generation, and he has chosen to do it in the form of a christmas movie, or something in the vicinity of. Fairy tale for adults, if you like.<br/><br/>The visual side is cute indeed, bearing resemblance to Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" and Robert Zemeckis's ""The Polar Express"" and maybe the first ""Harry Potter"". Almost everything happens on the train, so the scope is not too epic. It's actually still more suitable for a (tele)play than a big-budget movie, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Too bad the result concentrates on looking like something straight outta classic Coca-Cola christmas ad, rather than offering, say, witty dialogue or storytelling. Because once the yummy visuals wear off, you may notice how shallow and frankly boring the movie actually is.<br/><br/>Yes, there's a rather impressive cast involved, including Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer and Willem Dafoe, among others, but the ony character with any cinematic heft or meat on bones is Poirot played by Branagh.<br/><br/>He's got enough conviction to act himself through the shallow material, so his hero may have at least something resembling depth or three-dimensionality.<br/><br/>All the others are there just to collect a paycheck, or to oogle their eyes at Depp, maybe. If you've seen the promo materials including the cast recollecting their favorite ""Depp moments"" on set, you'd probably agree with me.<br/><br/>I don't hate, but also don't ""get"" the Poirot's moustache choice. What's the point of looking like having just escaped from a Dr. Seuss movie, especially ""The Lorax""?"

If it weren't a cast jam-packed with stars, it would have been even harder to care about them. Because there were sooo many characters, I found myself a bit bored at times.

","Murder on the Orient Express is a decent remake of a classic. <br/><br/>The positives include a veteran cast and a solid script. Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot is always going to attract the inevitable comparison with David Suchet's performance. <br/><br/>Certainly the latest Poirot incarnation has a somewhat different vibe heavily emphasising the characters obsessive compulsive disorder. A little too much in my opinion but this is a minor point.<br/><br/>The feel of this film captures the essence of Christie's thriller but shifts the story's emphasis in a way that wont appeal to all. Previous incarnations of this story have tended to focus on the ""who dunnit"" aspect slowly unravelling a predictably complex story of murder. <br/><br/>This film flattens and compacts the sleuthing to emphasise the emotional trauma and loss that in some respects is really at the heart of this story. In that sense this film is hugely successful . I have not seen a version of this tale that made as strong an emotional connection with me. <br/><br/>Ultimately whether you prefer this film or older editions is really going to depend on your expectations.

","When young, I was a big fan of Agatha Christie and I've read most of her books. Most of them have a ""unexpected twist"" at the end, which is probably the reason one just need to grab her next book. Needless to say, A. Christie was a master in playing games with readers mind. But you know how's with the stories that have ""unique"" twist at the end: one is surprised (jaw-drop) only reading/seeing them for the first time.
Murder on the Orient express is no exception: if you know ""the story"", then there's no point to watch this remake. Actually, compared to the book, this remake is quite poor and I can imagine, those who didn't read the book, may be disappointed (in sense ""what made this title so famous?""). We have a bunch of great actors, but none of them leaves a mark -except K.Branagh playing famous detective. I would blame a script for that. Let me explain:
In A.Christie's books, reader has always the feeling he can solve the mystery. Of course, reader's guess is usually wrong.. still, even after the crime is solved, reader still believes he could solve that, if he would pay enough attention when reading. Now, in this movie, that feeling doesn't happen.. it can't happen, because there's no time for small details and hints.
Regardless of my title above, I recommend the book.<br/><br/>Being picky about details myself: landscape between Vinkovci and Brod (where story happens), is in reality totally flat."

Kenneth Branagh, I think is a bit rigid, a bit strong. The subtleness and the mischievousness of David Suchet is what I missed may be. The plot can't be wrong as it is a classic in itself.

","It's not easy to adapt Agatha Christie to screen in 2017, and it is even more difficult to take upon 'Murder on the Orient Express' which already had a fabulous and stars-blessed version made in 1974 by Sidney Lumet. The queen of the detective novel created superb mysteries, but there are challenges in bringing them to screen, as her characters are quite theatrical, always hide and seem to be something else that they really are, and the confined enclosure where most of her stories take place does not fit the requirements of dynamics in modern action cinema. It's a challenge to turn the bright mental exercises in her novels into screen action, especially as most of the viewers would know the ending. A challenge that can be compared with bringing to the cinema screens the text and characters of Shakespeare. So, maybe it takes a director and an actor that already brought to screen the plays of Shakespeare to assume the challenge and the risks. The name of this director is, of course, Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>The approach chosen by the director for this version of Murder on the Orient Express does not try to 'actualize' the intrigue into the present time, but does the contrary - it is very specific about the exact year of the plot, 1934, exactly the year when Agatha Christie's book was published. While keeping the structure of the intrigue and the format of the 'train story' it invests much of the writing and acting efforts into developing the characters. First of all it's Hercule Poirot's life itself which is enhanced with the memory of a lost love, although more details may have been left for the following episodes. Branagh himself assumes the role of Poirot, with Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe and a wonderful supporting cast providing color and personality to each one of the characters, whatever time they catch on the screen.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the experience of watching this version of the classical murder story, even if the solution of the mystery was known to me from the beginning. I believe that Kenneth Branagh succeeded to find the right balance between the old good way of making films with a good story combined with nuanced acting, and the modern visual techniques that place the action in a spectacular landscape adding an aura of fairy tale. The ending alludes to the next episode in what may become a series, and I am looking forward to it."
"tmpsvita","7","0","2","5 January 2018"," A fascinating transposition
","Taken from the homonyms novel of the world-famous writer Agatha Christie, this ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is presented as an alternative film version to that of 1974.
What most attracts the viewer is surely the cast that makes use of many big names such as Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Penélope Cruz, Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Derek Jacobi, Judi Dench, Willem Defoe and Kenneth Branagh, who also directs the film.
Being a choral film, however, none of the roles allows us to offer memorable performances, given the limited amount of time available for each character, even if all manage to provide more than discrete performances, except for Branagh who, being the protagonist, naturally has more space and, also for this reason, he is distinguished from other interpreters and gives the public a perfect transposition of the famous inspector that is well interpreted and that, thanks to its characterization, mostly aesthetic (the bizarre and huge mustache), manages to be immediately recognized by viewers who have already read the famous book, because he is simply the same, or at least I could not ask for a better transposition for this character.
What instead differentiates this film particularly from the book from which it is taken, is the narrative structure: if the book is linear (the various interrogations are carried out one after the other) and precise, especially in the details, the film is much more dynamic, fast and less linear; this decreases the possibility for the spectator to be able to process the various clues but allows the film to be much more entertaining, light and if we also want fun and engaging; a type of narration that lends itself much more to the big screen than to the pages of a book and, for this reason, I consider a right choice that of Branagh to make everything more movement, thanks for the most part to a dynamic editing, a presentation of the characters more hurry but functional and a pressing and immersive soundtrack, entrusted to the two-time Oscar nominee, Patrick Doyle, who had previously worked with the aforementioned.
As for the direction is also very dynamic, Kenneth Branagh uses, in fact, often the use of dollys to be able to achieve many long and precise machine movements, moreover many of the shots are studied in detail and, if on a hand, this scrupulous search for the perfect film gives an excellent aesthetic appearance, on the other it hurts a bit the fluidity of the film: in some moments I have had more time to notice the various virtuosities of the director than to pay attention to the story, precisely because in some cases distracted me. Despite I liked them (the virtuosities) some have me just surprised and pleased, I would have preferred a little 'more naturalness, in some moments, by the director without having to always have to look for the perfect framing or the perfect camera movement.
For the rest I was very impressed by the cinematography that gives the film a modern look without betraying the historical period in which it takes place.
In general I found it a great transposition and a good entertainment film that can satisfy various types of public without disappointing any.
Now I just have to see the 1974 film and wait for the future sequel of this version."
"magnusmax","7","0","3","4 January 2018"," Murder on the Orient Express: A Chugging, Steaming Adventure (Murder on the Orient Express Spoilery Review)
","Murder on the Orient Express is a delightfully calm and thoughtful picture, presented by director and star Kenneth Branagh in the now-novel 70mm film, and thus becoming only the fifth release in such a format during the current millenium. Though I passed on the opportunity to view the film in 70mm, I can safely presume on the elegance accompanying all of its lovely artistically panoramic wide angles. I deeply appreciate a contemplative and tranquil film - standing in such sharp contrast with the inundation of clamorous, loud and often witless matter we are ceaslessly confronted with - and Murder ticks these crucial boxes.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book on which this adaption was based, nor can I very succinctly recall the 70's rendition, and so I can hardly comment on the originality or possible modifications this version may have entertained. Regardless, it is hardly an understatement to say that the ending largely ruined the film for me. *SPOILER ALERT* Sadly, Poirot fails in his post as detective when he essentially looks the other way, allowing the guilty criminals to part ways and leave almost entirely unchastised. At an earlier point, the Belgian detective had remarked on how he saw only good and evil - no grey areas. However, by the end, our supposed hero (and this seems to me the true motivational power behind the story) has ""converted"" to a sort of corruptive empathy which leads him to deny justice its due - something he ironically tries to avoid, in the very act of negating judgement on the felons. True justice requires the requital of damage rendered, yet in this case justice has come to Rachett, while the murderers (let it not be forgotten what a great offence cold-blooded murder is) escape scot-free, without any necessary reparation for their wrongs. Perhaps the outcome would be somewhat different, had the offenders admitted their culpability and thenceforth resolved to make recompense and amend their lives for the better. For all the audience knows, another murder would not be unthinkable to these people, since as Poirot points out: Once one has murdered a first time, it is far easier to murder a second. As it is, Murder monstrously humanises an act obviously heinous - the premeditated theft of another's life. *SPOILERS END*<br/><br/>Moving on to a happier subject, the film's acting is reinvigorating and fresh. Rather than the crowded number of Oscar-winning or nominated actors and actresses obstructing the story, they all lend the afore-mentioned an interesting facet; in the face of which, unfortunately, some feel a little sidelined or unexplored. Kenneth Branagh's Poirot isn't so damnably distracting as some reviewers have made out, although admittedly his wonderous moustache does draw the fascinated viewer's eyes at times. More concerningly, at some point during the movie, he faces away from the camera, and his large and all-too-smooth ear shows itself evidently prosthetic. He is a man with flair and yet sentimentality plagues him, reminding him from time to time of his lost love of former years. Josh Gad plays a slippery yet finally emotional character (somewhat redeeming in the face of such horrors as Olaf and LeFou) who delivers an interesting performance. Daisy Ridley adds a fresh face to the cast, proving her talent is not limited to intergalactic battles. Johnny Depp plays a thieving, extortive rogue well - a personality surprisingly distinguished from his previous roles. Altogether, the varied cast functions far better than I originally anticipated. <br/><br/>Visual effects aid the story without casting too great a shadow of trickery over the movie on a whole. We see lightening and plenty of snow, but they aren't too gratuitous. I noticed that throughout the film, especially the first half, we are presented with a number of delicious vistas which set a rather uneven mood. Though the spectacles are artfully produced, they seem a little meaningless, failing to really push the sum atmosphere of the movie, as they do not (for the most part) carry well into the following interior train sequences. Murder is also an interesting film, as it seems to me to fall into a unique category - hardly a standard crowd-pleaser, yet not exactly an arthouse production. Instead, it seems to play with elements of both worlds, becoming thus a sort of hybrid, at least in my opinion. Some shots in this movie seem largely artistic, but in most senses it takes an approach more widely pleasing. The cinematography delivers very thoughtful, aesthetically pleasing and unique angles <br/><br/>In closing, I recommend Murder on the Orient Express not as a morally sound piece of cinema, but certainly as an entertaining, considerate story that will be especially effective on viewers unaquainted with the mystery's solution. It is a credit to the team who put it together, and had I missed seeing the movie in the cinema, I would eagerly await its DVD release."

","The David Suchet version is still my favorite. This story is an important one in the life of Poirot and the end should be emotionally wrenching. I didn't get that same sense of conflict and emotional distraught, confusion, and rage. When I first saw previews I was so excited because I thought Depp was going to play Poirot. I can see him being the best Poirot ever!!! I'm so confused about the casting. Why? The way he throws himself into a role and embodies the character so fully, not to mention his convincing french, and wry smile. Wow, what a miss."

","A mediocre murder mystery movie. If you're not familiar with Christie's Poirot stories or David Suchet's version of Poirot, you might find this film more entertaining than I did. David Suchet does so impeccable job as Hercule Poirot that it's almost impossible to beat. And as someone here already said, Branagh's Poirot is from time to time more like Mr. Monk than Mr. Poirot. Branagh's Poirot has too many quirks that don't feel like ""Poirot's quirks"" but more like Mr. Monk's or someone else's. So, I'm sorry to say, but I didn't like Branagh's Poirot.<br/><br/>The plot has a couple big holes in it, which makes the film bit clumsy. Maybe the erased scenes would shed some light to few things. Nevertheless, the film is ""easy to watch"" and scenery is beautiful. Not a mind-blowing spectacle, but not totally garbage either.

Even the story has told many times and you know how it will end, it is still enjoyable to watch this kind of old fashioned drama. Only one thing doesn't feel quite right. Somehow Kenneth Branagh don't impress enough as Hercule Poirot. Maybe he is too young to be Poirot or maybe it is that he can't act enough of Poirot's accent. Despite of this little blemish, Murder on the Orient Express is very enjoyable movie. Scenery at Istanbul is beautiful. Dramatic mountain views makes some tickle feeling for crime story. Scene at the end of the movie ""The Last Supper"" is quite dramatic and metaphorical and it ties story telling nicely together.

"aarosedi","Null","0","2","20 December 2017"," More of an exercise for the cones and rods of the retina than it is for the grey cells
","I just can't help but admire Mr. Branagh's Poirot's pampered moustache where you could see those wavy greying streaks still looking fab and untouched even with the Wagon-Lits snowdrift mishap. He never even saw the point in having those be dyed jet black as per the usual. He is damn good looking to be able to pull off even a silverfox version of Poirot because after all what matters is him having that same tenacity and conceit that the always eccentric Christie character is known for. I just hope he will not do a Lazenby after teasing the audience for a potential sequel at the end of the film. Poirot needs that workcation in Egypt and it would be interesting to see Mr Branagh in a setting that's more humid, because at this particular point in time, Kenneth Branagh is Poirot.<br/><br/>Having said that, how I feel this film stacks up with the previous MotOE adaptations would be for me like saying that the S Lumet 1974 version is up to my chest level, the 2010 ITV series episode is up to my eye level, and the 2017 version would be just above my knees. But I would have to assume the path that Mr. Branagh took for his adaptation is the one that leads to the introduction of Agatha Christie's brilliance to a new generation of readers or viewers. A more global audience perhaps is never a bad thing even though this meant sacrificing some of the substance in favor of the gloss. Gloss is good.<br/><br/>Mr. Branagh chose to establish a lighter tone for his film compared to the two darker well-known incarnations of MotOE while still retaining the seriousness given the gravity of the crime that is to unfold. Foregoing the motif of tabloid journalism, for instance, that is in the 1974 version. He's having none of it, and chose to shoot it down, so to speak, with that Count Andreyi bar scene. The strong undercurrent of Catholism that is apparent on the 2010 version was also toned down, incorporating a scene at the start of the film where three religious leaders being involved in a crime scene, perhaps as a gesture to be more inclusive to people of other faiths, which I don't object because the themes explored in the novel are indeed universal. Mr Branagh just made it more palatable and easier for everyone to digest. And if that meant the introducing some melodramatic elements to the film, complete with that Douglas-Sirk-film-ish song that was played in the rolling of the end credits, Amen to that.<br/><br/>The gorgeous and opulent sets in display in the interior shots are just as alive as any character that could have been another murder suspect. And owing to some dramatic licenses that Mr. Branagh took in his MotOE version, I think perhaps he even would have preferred the victim choking instead on some of those Belgian chocolates on the buffet table. That would have been quite a scene, and in my opinion, a way more cooler and sweeter murder weapon. Pun intended.<br/><br/>My rating: B-minus."

Can't say I'm a big fan of Depp the last few years but the scenes he had he did very well. He also had one of the funniest throwaway lines I've seen in a while. Something about dogs... the rest of the cast, including greats like Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer and perhaps a future great like Daisy Ridley all did very well and showed their chops in the scenes they had. <br/><br/>I couldn't really take it all that seriously but I enjoy that in my movies sometimes.

In general his pompous narcissistic acting style distracted me from following the story. The rest of the cast is glorious, although several of them get very little time on screen. The most interesting character in this remake is Johnny Depp's Ratchett but of course he is only in the first half of the film. Also the count and countess characters (the count is played by one of the worlds greatest ballet dancers Sergei Polunin) get hardly any lines or screen time, and we dont see Polunin dance for one second all though the characters are described as ballet dancers. The derailing of the train is very hard to believe, and 'the last supper' at the end of the film is so over the top and tasteless, as is Kenneth Branagh's lines 'Only two people know the truth, one is God and the other is Hercule Poirot!' - a pompous line delivered in an equally pompous way, honestly....Mr Branagh is one of the most overrated actors of our time.

And in my opinion... i was dead wrong.<br/><br/>The movie begins very lighthearted. Not only showing Hercule Poirots remarkable skill, but also explaning and especially showing, that he is not a genius, but in fact a broken human being who needs to right the wrongs, so his inner balance can remain.<br/><br/>Hercule Poirot explains, that he sees the world as it is supposed to be.

Right and wrong.<br/><br/>After the murder, the whole perspective starts to shift. The more time we spend with the characters, the more they become 3-dimensional.<br/><br/>The black and white starts to blur into grey. This contrasts with how Poirot sees the world and he needs to come to grips with the world being grey.<br/><br/>That's why the focus of the movie doesn't really lie on the actual murder itself, but on the Impact it has on our hero.<br/><br/>When he discovers the real reasons for the murder and how it happened, the movie gives us one obvious but very strong Picture.<br/><br/>The last supper. The orchestrator sitting in the middle. 11 collaborators around her. But one seat remains empty. The seat of Judas.<br/><br/>Because Judas isn't part of the collective. Poirot is Judas.

","It is a shame the way this was directed, the first 20 min has some overacting and some scenes that don´t really match the style of the rest of the film, out of place and weird. Branagh is unable to film anything that is not from his own culture and it also has to take place in his own country, and here he has an international cast and action in a foreign country - that apparently brings some serious problems problems. A cast full of stars with Christie´s story should bring crowds to the cinema and what does bring instead is pure disappointment. Add a ridiculous, very distracting mustache on the main character (what is the point of doing that? such a stupid decision), some unnecessary scenes, pointless conversations here and there making this kind of boring - Poirot starts an interview in German but he turns to English after 2 sentences, it makes no sense, but it is kind of what happens with the entire movie, the first part seems to take one direction then it turns into another. No surprises why the average IMDB rating is so mediocre - avoid it, wait for the next film version of this novel or watch the classic film with this same name from 1974 by Lumet - he knew how to do this."

","This movie pulls you in for its colours and costumes. Everything is great to look at: the movie succeeds because of its world-building. For the whole 114 minutes I was drawn in: not so much by the intrigue and mystery, oddly, but its aesthetic. (Really, I think this is true of most movies and books: if we already know the plot, don't we re-read books like Lord of the Rings just to walk in Middle Earth once again?) So, A+ for aesthetic. I liked living in this world for 114 minutes, it's rich: one of the characters even comments on it, saying something like, ""Don't you just love it? All these people in cramped conditions, with the gentle rocking of the train.""<br/><br/>Where the film falls is the acting. Despite all of his Shakespearean adaptations (his version of Hamlet being one of the best I've seen, what-what) Kenneth Branagh is not a great actor, and his Franco-Belgian accent makes his dialogue hard to comprehend sometimes. And Branagh threw in a bit of virtue-signalling, with all the commentary of race. (Take that, Trump!)<br/><br/>But Branagh's not the only one with funny accents, oh no-no, there are funny accents to be found throughout. I don't know any of the cast, but no one's especially great except for William Defoe, Judi Dench, and Sir Derek Jacobi (gotta put that ""sir"" in there). Nevertheless, Defoe alternates between bad German and bad Brooklynite and Judi Dench and Derek Jacobi speak in voices as well. I don't know. I felt at times I was watching a kid's show.<br/><br/>And, honestly, I find the plot wanting as well. Whoa, calm yourself: I know the movie's an adaptation and Agatha Christie is revered worldwide: but, spoilers: getting, what was it: 12 people to agree to kill someone is, and let's be honest now: contrived. Yes, yes, the passengers all had a good motive (they were stabbing Johnny Depp to death, teehee,) but really. It makes me think of that ancient Chinese myth about the monks who kill someone by each taking a bite of the person. They do this because if each monk takes a bite then no one can say who the murderer really is: but guys, that was a myth. Fantasy. No matter how heinous Depp's ""victim"" character was, it's incredulous to think that so many people would come together to aid in the person's killing: and then go on to lead normal lives. (Yes, Poirot frees them all. Shame. They *murdered* someone: a criminal who was bound to be ""whacked"" in due time anyway.)<br/><br/>That said, ""Murder"" is a welcome change of pace from the drivel that is killing cinemas. It establishes its world very well, but I'm not sure if its one I'll return to see."

","Director Kenneth Branagh's cinematic adaptation Agatha Christie's classic whodunit ""Murder on the Orient Express"" qualifies as lush, atmospheric, but sadly pretentious. Clearly, Branagh and ""Blade Runner 2049"" scenarist Michael Green don't subscribe to the adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" This big-screen remake doesn't surpass director Sidney Lumet's superior version from 1974 that c0-starred Sean Connery, Michael York, Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Richard Widmark, and Anthony Perkins. Branagh doesn't muster a cast the caliber of the Lumet version, and he wears out his welcome with a running time that clocks in mysteriously under two hours. The Lumet version was far longer, but it rolls back a lightning speed. Branagh and Green have maintained the same time period, but they have changed up some of the murder suspects. The austere British colonel that Connery portrayed has been replaced with an African-American doctor who is having an amorous relationship with a Caucasian lady. Unlike the Christie novel, the film doesn't have the train come to a stop because of too much snow on the tracks, but because the train has derailed. Furthermore, Branagh and Green have tacked on a prologue that is entirely dispensable. Honorable mention must go to Jim Clay and his production designs as well as the set decorators. If you have read the Christie novel, you will not be surprised at anything that happens, except for Hercule Poirot's OCD that enables him to ferret out the criminals. If you haven't see the Lumet version and you haven't read the novel, you may find the film rewarding. Nevertheless, Lumet's version tops Branagh's rendition."
"eagandersongil","7","0","2","11 December 2017"," The already trivial story of murder
","A film with caricature performances but that amuse, script that intrigues but it does not stop seeming a great script of series, in spite of being inspired in the great book of Agatha Christie, and a good direction. Agatha Christie's books full of mysteries, intrigues and twists are phenomenal, a pity that today would hardly work in a visual audio work, the fault of the thousands of series that do this, perhaps not always with the same perspicacity, years and 24 episodes per season, so the whole mood of the mystery of the movie nowadays is almost trivialized by the infinity of similar audiovisual works, even though it may not contain the same charm. The film pinpoints attempts to address social issues but does not focus on it, the focus is all centered even on the unfolding narrative of the murder in question, and that is a good thing. The film has a very good direction, almost all happening in a claustrophobic train with narrow walls and tiny rooms, the director arranges subterfuges to gain space in the train and to show its history completely, for example, the great cameras with vision panoramic view from above, or the sequential plans lining up characters, besides having a beautiful photograph, but a rhythm that makes the viewer feel too much the floor of the film. With a spectacular cast, it's hard to say anything negative about the film's performances, but even with a magic cast, we do not have any masterpiece in terms of acting, but Kenneth Branagh does well as Hercule Poirot. The film changes some details in book relations, many serve and crutch for character development, and some are very well developed and others not, the film deals with justice and reminds of glimpses up to spectacular ""twelve men and one sentence"" in the final speech , but it's just a fun and enjoyable movie."
"t-viktor212","7","0","2","9 December 2017"," A single mistake
","I was quite saddened when I walked out of the cinema: it was very hard for me to accept that, while the film was nearly perfect in almost all technical aspects, a film that you could feel that those involved took their effort in making it as perfect as they could, it failed at one of the most important: its pacing.<br/><br/>Let's immediately start with this issue the film had, which ultimately resulted in the rating I chose to gave it. The problem was that, particularly the whole murder solving part of the film, felt almost rushed, too quick. It all felt too obvious, almost too simple in deduction, as if anyone could have solved the case (and I, not having read the book or seen the previous film, did solve it a bit earlier than the revelation scene, due to the way clues where showed). My assumption is that producers allowed only a short lenght to the film, for commercial purposes, which lead to heavy cuts on that part of the film. I personally think that it would have been wiser to cut some of the scenes from the first third of the film: it takes about 10-15 minutes for the viewer to finally be aboard the Orient Express. Those 15 minutes, which did introduce Poirot and the other characters, could have been shortened or even cut altogether, in my opinion, even though they where fun, as they didn't focus on the main story. With a better pacing, the film could have decisively been saved.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't enjoy was the score: it felt too lightening, especially in the revelation scene, when it should have been much darker, and it being too lightening in that scene ruined most of the moral ambiguity that the finale required.<br/><br/>Despite these two aspects, Murder had outstanding photography (I particularly liked the final shot), the settings (The choice of not displaying the revelation scene inside the dining hall, as, it is my understanding, Lumet's version did, but a much more scenographic setting), and notable is Branagh's impersonation and acting of Poirot, did with great cure, and which I particularly liked.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I do consider worth my ticket, although not at the levels of satisfaction I hoped. I hope that, for the planned sequel, Branagh will reprise at least the role of Poirot."
"pranderson063095","8","0","5","7 December 2017"," Refreshing Remake of Poirot, Finally
","First I do question those who are panning this movie so very much. It is hardly as bad as their opinions make it sound. Also, the complaint or question of why yet another ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a bit of a reach. That this viewer has seen, this is the second filmed for the big screen (1974 & 2017). Two television movies have been made (2001 & 2010). <br/><br/>In our opinion one of the made for TV versions (with David Suchet) is the only TV one that is respectable as it fit very well in the long- running Poirot series for TV with Suchet. In 1974 Albert Finney filled the role of Hercule Poirot and he along with Suchet, presented the character of Poirot as a near fancy man. Suchet certainly did Poirot for many viewers in our generation what Rathbone did for the Sherlock Holmes character. Albert Finney in the 1974 film may have set that tone as he did little to establish Poirot as anything different. <br/><br/>That is the really refreshing thing about the 2017 film and Kenneth Branagh gave us a Poirot that has backbone and not so much silliness. Yet, he remained the refined character which we believe Agatha Christie originally created. Even his mustache had character instead of being some pastie glued on each day. Branagh is already a favorite out of his Wallender series in both English and Swedish. As an actor he has breadth and many faces. We found ourselves cheering his significant physical encounters and cannot imagine either Suchet, Finny or Peter Ustinov (in the 2001 TV version) engaging the other passengers/suspects as is seen in this recent film. Peter Ustinov on both the Nile film and the TV modernized version was almost embarrassing. Here, we see a respectable Belgium able to stand and hold his position. <br/><br/>Granted the 1974 was cast with much more care and used significant quality actors across the board. This one petered out and is why it get an 8 rather than a 10 from this viewer. It is not difficult to see that one film really had a cast of quality heavies. Besides Albert Finney as Poirot there was also Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, John Gielgud, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Vanessa Redgrave and Ingrid Bergman, who won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Greta Ohlsson. That made 10 out of 12.<br/><br/>This version was lacking significantly in the cast of notables. the notables included Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penélope Cruz, Dame Judi Dench, and Willem Dafoe. Only 5 of 12. Even of these few, Pfeiffer and Cruz are not in the league of the previous list. This was a disappointment for this viewer and perhaps some of the reason others downgrade the movie.We even have to say Depp was totally miscast for this movie. The man just couldn't bring across the meanness necessary to be one deserving of what happened.<br/><br/>Over all the story is told well in spite of name and ethnic changes that had to fit the actors cast for the parts. Always pressed to have diversity, stories are rewritten and original threads dismissed in order to achieve that diversity. Original intent and custom of the era are cast aside for the sake of the ever present need to be ""PC"". And while the cast suffered some weaknesses the main character HP, the man with the little gray cells was much better and more on the mark of how the original story created him to be. And if they are going to change names and ethnic origins for the story's characters then we can indeed say, ""Love That mustache."" And I'll bet Sam Elliot could get a bit jealous of it too."

","I saw this film at the request of a friend, and was less excited going in than I usually am when I go to see a new movie, as I saw this movie getting mediocre reviews. That being said, this is a very decent film. If you like movies that are shot and acted in a very traditional way, you'll like this film. That is to say, it's a murder mystery, which isn't done much these days, as well as mostly shot in one small location, which doesn't happen in most films as of late. It has some really great talent in it as well, but does do that thing where there's big name talent that doesn't do much (like, Judi Dench is great as always, but WHY IS SHE HERE SHE HAS LIKE ONE SCENE). If you already know the story of this film, as it is a remake, you could probably skip it, as from what I can tell there really isn't anything new done here. It's very well shot, with the acting and directing performance from Kenneth Branagh being very notable, he does a great job in both roles in this. The whole cast does a pretty good job (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad, Judi Dench and ESPECIALLY William Defoe are all favorites here), although there are a few corny line deliveries and the computer effects and makeup are sometimes kinda distracting (at one point I turned to my friend and asked; ""It's 2017, why does the train look like the Polar Express?""). Overall, I'd say if you're a fan of old movies, you'll like this film. It doesn't have anything offensively bad with it, it's just not the best film in the theater right now. 6.8/10"
"austrohungaro","5","0","4","3 December 2017"," Why, why, why, Mr Branagh?
","Went to see it with my friends this afternoon... as one thinks that a title like this has to be good and there's somehow no way they can destroy such a wonderful story, but the changes made by Mr Branagh to the story are absolutely meaningless, they add nothing to the plot and simply answer to... do they ever answer to any reason? Maybe the market. Let's check out a few of this changes...<br/><br/>1- The character of the Swedish nanny has been changed and now is, I guess, a Spaniard... a Spaniard because Pilar is a thoroughly Spanish name, although... Estravados? Such name doesn't exist in Spain but, yes, there is a Pilar Estravados in Christie's book Hercules Poirot's Christmas. Really can't think of a reason for this change. My compatriot Penelope Cruz isn't a great actress, let's face it, but she's well known here, in Italy and in Hollywood -I wonder why-, so maybe... are you using her as a decoy to trap the Spanish speaking public? As for the name... are you perhaps thinking Mr. Branagh, that if this movie works well -I very much doubt it- you can start directing an Agatha Christie movie every year and maybe you want to include Ms Cruz in one or more of them? Heaven forbid! <br/><br/>2- The character of the Italian chauffeur has been changed and now is a Latin guy!!! Are you being politically correct Mr Branagh? Really, if dear Mrs Christie wrote about an Italian driver we want to see an Italian driver on the movie adaptation, if she included in her story a sweet Swedish nanny, we want to see a Swedish nanny. Especially because the change you've made ads Absolutely nothing to the story. As for the name... Biniamino! are you inventing names too? You're such a creative guy! A Mexican guy with a misspelled Italian first name, so very creative. And the last name, Márquez... maybe because Márquez is the only Spanish name you remember after the famous Colombian writer? But including Manuel García-Rulfo in the movie you're calling for a Mexican public... you're a clever guy, Mr. Branagh! <br/><br/>3- And yet another change. The role of Colonel Arbuthnot isn't a Colonel anymore, it's a doctor and, oh my, he's black. You're so very politically correct, Mr. Branagh! You could have used a black actor in the role of the colonel... but wait, I very much doubt there would be retired black colonels in the British army in the early 30s, so to be politically correct you've made a believable Scottish character vanish from the story to create a black doctor in the 1930s Britain that travels around the world... I don't find quite believable this part of the story. The story takes place around 1930... not in the 80s. Of course the change of character here changes something in the story: Dr. Arthbutnot shoots Monsieur Poirot... wooooooow, that's a bit of exciting action in the movie! Really, Mr. Branagh? <br/><br/>4- Why changing the character of the French conductor from the father of the poor French maid who is falsely accused and commits suicide to the brother of the poor French maid who is falsely accused and commits suicide? Wait... Marwan Kenzari is a good actor, and he's a hot guy. Also he's a Dutch of Northern African descent. Once again, you're catering for all public, don't you Mr. Brannagh. There are great French actors of Northern African descent who could play the role of the father. But they don't attract young girls, don't they? <br/><br/>4- I'm not going to talk about more character changes, but really, is there anything less convincing than a Hungarian duke that's a classic ballet dancer? And this ads SO very much to the plot, really! <br/><br/>I couldn't help but laughing at Monsieur Poirot running after and fighting with Mr. McQueen... so very not Agatha Christie's, but some action was needed in the movie, wasn't it Mr. Branagh? Really, a movie like this relies -or should rely- on good acting and a good director. The acting isn't bad at all... not too sure about the direction.<br/><br/>The main reason for not liking this movie is that changes on the plot can be made when adapting a novel (or maybe should be made), and so did Mr Wilder when he filmed Witness for the Prosecution, and it even seems Mrs. Christie loved it and congratulated him for the changes made, but changing characters in a story that ad nothing to the story in order to attract every possible public that's plain bad direction, that shows no interest in the story, just a wish to make the movie more profitable. <br/><br/>Finally, I absolutely hated the final moment when the British officer tells Monsieur Poirot that he's needed in Cairo... are you really thinking of filming an unnecessary version of Death on the Nile? Are you perhaps trying to turn Monsieur Poirot into a sort of Art Deco James Bond? Are you threatening us with a Hercules Poirot franchise? Oh my, they're right: the movie business is really f*cked up!<br/><br/>Bye bye Mr. Branagh, I guess we'll never meet again at the movies."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","0","2","3 December 2017"," A decent, but forgettable Sunday afternoon flick
","Murder on the Orient express is a forgettable Sunday afternoon flick. There is nothing special about it, there are no stellar and breathtaking performances, there are no nerve wrecking scenes or spectacular music. This is a movie I would recommend if nothing else is on the TV (and I do believe that was the intention).<br/><br/>Two things must be distinguished from one another. The first is the directing and acting, and the other the story. The first is spectacular, the other is a cliché to the point of non belief.<br/><br/>Branagh's direction is surgically precise and to almost every point flawless. His effort to make the movie look and feel like a novel was achieved as one can actually see where some chapters end and others begin. He has no unnecessary prolonging of scenes or dialogue, the execution is ""to the point,"" bright and concise. The viewer is never bored or tired as Branagh switches from scene to scene, depicting character after character, and the background changes simultaneously as the characters and scenes. There are also interesting camera angels and long one-shot scenes that make the movie visually very interesting. But there is much more to a movie than just technical and directorial precision.<br/><br/>The actors had a really ungrateful job. Most of them had just a scene or two in which the were expected to execute their roles and lines to utmost perfection because no second chances were given. That does explain the all star cast consisting of Dench, Depp, Dafoe, Pfeiffer, Cruz, Jacobi, Gad etc. All of them did their jobs respectively but most of their performances lacked heart and or soul (with the exception of Gad who was really quite good at his role and Pfeiffer who had a little more to say than the rest of the cast). The most disappointing were Cruz (whose performance was way over the top) and Odom Jr. (who was not fit for the role at all). <br/><br/>Most of the discussions were pointed at the performance of Branagh himself. His take on the legendary Poirot was, different than what we are used to. NO comparison will or should be made. All of the actors who portrayed Poirot had their views and ways they approached the character, and so did Branagh. As his directing, his acting is flawless, precise and his ability to switch emotions and portray different thoughts just with an eyebrow or gaze is amazing, not to say a bit disturbing. Even though he is not what we are used to as Poirot, he really did an amazing job and stands out among all the other brilliant actors with which he worked with on this movie.<br/><br/>The story is, another problem. Considering that the novel was written about 80 years ago, the standard that we are used to in murder mystery thrillers today is far beyond what we are served here. It is unfair to criticize the screenplay when the source material hasn't aged well, and if one pays close attention to all of the clues, at a certain point somewhere at the middle/last third of the movie it is really not that difficult to put all the pieces together. The conclusion lacks a climax because the viewers are still under the impression of what we today consider cliché, that the grand reveal becomes anticlimactic. And therein lies the greatest problem. No emotions, no thrills, no WOW factor. Just a bland, expected conclusion that leaves one a bit disappointed. Again, that says more about the aged novel and not the screenplay.<br/><br/>All in all, entertaining and suitable for more than one viewing, but unfortunately forgettable. I cannot shake the feeling that not much more than that was the general idea of the movie."
"StregaAsuka","6","0","2","3 December 2017"," Too Much Ado about Nothing on the Orient Express
","If you haven't read the original novel nor have watched the 1974 movie, you will like the movie. But if you are an Agatha Christie's fan or have done one of both before mentioned, there is a high chance that you won't like the movie (as that is my case).<br/><br/>This movies highly differs form the original source material. Here we are presented with Poirot solving another case before embarking on the Orient Express. Then we are presented the characters in a very rushed way and finally the crime happens and the action begins. Yes, there is action. And the question we are all asking ourselves is: Since when Poirot and action are on the same page? Since now, apparently. Instead of following the path that the previous (and brilliant) installment did, which is: there is a murder, then we spend the whole movie solving it following Poirot inquisition; here there is too many adding that don't add anything to the story: chases, going out of the train, going back in, questioning this one, questioning the other one, and worst of all: and indecisive and lovesick Poirot. And I can only ask: why!? Why!!!?<br/><br/>Then we have the whole cast. It is clear here that they wanted to do as in the old movie, bring a huge international known cast (more or less) and make a masterpiece. Sorry, but nope. Having many movie stars doesn't mean having a good movie, and here we have the perfect case. Personally, none of the cast members gives a good performance of their characters. which is normal, seeing as they changed tha characters and made them less interesting than in the novel.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the story. The character introduction is a bit of a mess up, pointing out things about the characters that are irrelevant and adding more things than necessary. Moreover, the whole movie too much Americanized, it doesn't have the tension or the interest that an Agatha Christie work would have: too much action, too many unnecessary kind of cliffhangers and the way of solving the mystery too rushed and too dramatic. Again, unnecessary.<br/><br/>The movie will be a unforgettable one with the time. If you really want to enjoy a good work, go watch the 1974's version of Murder on the Orient Express, there you will appreciate what is reuniting a star cast."

","i'm writing this review from a perspective of someone who hasn't read the famous novel nor see the 1974 feature film based on it.<br/><br/>first of all, i do hope the character, Hercule Poirot played by Kenneth Branagh can be present in another movie(s) with another case(s) despite of what happened with this one.<br/><br/>Murder on the Orient Express is starting as an intriguing and appealing movie, with the beautiful 1930s background, with the quirky Poirot solving a rather quick opening exposition. I don't get hyped because of the casts but i expect something grand from the main case and how 2017 can squeeze the elaborate occurrence happened in the train.<br/><br/>the positive vibe that i get from the beginning of the movie is constantly becoming bland repertoire among the detective and his suspects. i wish they prepare this movie more serious, in a sense, with an exception of the ending, the whole movie is rather boring, there's no suspense or thrill. i am clueless on how much the movie deviates from the book but i lost the same excitement i got in seeing other distinguished detectives or crime-solving movies.<br/><br/>however, it is concluded with a stunning ending that in my opinion can do some amend to salvage the movie.<br/><br/>i am not sure how much were skewed from the source due to the filmmaker interpretation, and certainly as someone who hasn't read the book i cant compare both of them, but after seeing this movie, i think it's rather a disappointing one, again, with an exception of the mind-blown reveal at the end accompanied by a question about the value of justice when justice is fail to be served.<br/><br/>i am quite satisfied with the start and the end but i think the movie can be more interesting in the middle, its just too plain. i wish i can give 7 but 6.5 for me."
"tom-43722","7","0","3","2 December 2017"," A perfectionist dealing with imperfection
","I'm referring to both myself and Kenneth Branagh's character, Hercule Poirot, in the title. This isn't a perfect movie - then again very few, if any movies are - but it's far, FAR better than The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi combined. I'll get into why I'm comparing it to those train-wrecks later. First, I should say that I haven't read Agatha Christie's novel so I don't know how faithful this is. The only version of this story I've seen was from Doctor Who, and that version took place in the future, in space, and had a Mummy who lets you live for 66 seconds when you see it.<br/><br/>With my ignorance of source material out of the way, let's get to the actual review. The most interesting character in the movie is Hercule Poirot, which works fine since he's the lead. A brilliant detective (albeit a somewhat egotistical one, as he proclaims himself ""the best detective in the world"") and a perfectionist through and through, right down to requesting that people straighten their ties, his character arc is about realizing that justice and injustice can depend on people's points of view, and that not everybody can be separated into the categories of good and bad. There are shades of grey, which throws his view of perfection, be it perfect innocence or perfect villainy, into question. Kenneth Branagh did a good job at directing the movie, but it might have been better if he'd let someone else do that, because he stood out more as an actor than a director. His ridiculous mustache and strange accent were somewhere between charming and annoying but what made him likable to me were his perfectionist tendencies, as I'm a perfectionist myself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, since the movie has to juggle so many characters, some performers don't get the amount of screen-time that they deserve. Branagh seemed so focused on crafting the film around his own performance that he forgot to give his co-stars time to shine. For example, the legendary actress Judi Dench has played many different roles such as Queen Victoria and Lady MacBeth and holds a special place in my memory as M from James Bond, but she wasn't given much to do in this movie. Penelope Cruz's character also receives little attention although she has enough time to talk about Lucifer and God. Even Michelle Pfeiffer, who looks incredible for a woman who's rapidly approaching her sixtieth birthday (she's well over twice my age but she's somehow managed to stay attractive), didn't leave much of an impression, for better or worse. With so many characters fighting for screen-time, it's hard to become memorable.<br/><br/>However two performers outside of Branagh did manage to be memorable, one in a good way and one in a not-so-good way. Despite looking at the cast before I entered the movie, I didn't recognize Johnny Depp at all whilst he was playing Edward Ratchett. He didn't have much screen-time but in the time that he had, he was sleazy and clearly had a shady past, but fear motivated him to carry a gun wherever he went and request Poirot's help, showing that he was still human. I literally never recognized him as the same man who brought us the eccentric Jack Sparrow, perhaps because he looked presentable instead of a drunken mess. It seems to me that Johnny Depp has a rather forgettable face but that works in his favour because it allows him to get as close to literally disappearing into his characters as a live-action actor can get.<br/><br/>Now let's get to why I mentioned The Force Awakens. Daisy Ridley is annoying. Her voice sticks out like a sore thumb and she doesn't seem to be very bright, but the most annoying part... was that she actually wasn't that bad in this film. After her lousy performance in The Force Awakens, I was ready to tear this performance apart, but she toned down the over-the-top expressions and even her irritating voice suited Mary much more than Rey. One can always tell it's her voice and it doesn't blend in, but due to the time period and her character's social class, it doesn't sound nearly as out of place as it did on Rey. Ridley is just a pretty face with little brainpower behind it, but she's better here than she was in both of her Star Wars movies put together, which plays into my understanding of Poirot's story arc. Just as he must come to terms with how good and bad, as well as justice and injustice, are not black and white, I must come to terms with the fact that Daisy Ridley's not a terrible actress and my judgment isn't always perfect. It seems that supporting characters are more suitable for her, which emphasizes how poorly cast and directed she was in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. It also proves that, for all his faults, Kenneth Branagh is a far better director than Jar Jar Abrams or Ruin Johnson (pardon me for the immature name calling but frankly, those two hacks deserve it)."

","Murder on the Orient Express is a lavish, entertaining film that will grab mainstream audiences in an instant. Based on the hit Agatha Christie novel, Murder on the Orient Express follows Poirot as he attempts to solve a case of (you guessed it) murder on the expensive, upper-class European train, the Orient Express. This is clearly a massive ""star actor"" vehicle with many famous faces popping up all over the place. Michelle Pfeifer, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, the suddenly famous Daisy Ridley and of course acting directing star Kenneth Branagh. I must say I enjoyed the film. It never dragged; the pace was solid all the way through. The visual are stunning (although quite obviously fake) and the cinematography is very interesting with the films use of birds eye view for each cabin. The acting on the whole was good although no one ever took any of my interest. There wasn't a defining character that really interested me and invigorated the story. Judi Dench was Judi Dench, Johnny Depp was a less drunk Johnny Depp, and Kenneth Branagh was witty but rather plain to say the least. These problems all most likely arise from how many star actors there are and how little screen time any of them receives mainly to the size of the cast and how short the run time is. Kenneth Branagh is an interesting person. He is clearly a very clever individual capable of directing and starring in his version of Orient Express and his acting is always on point. However, he never really shines. I don't personally hold anything against him but I have never once really seen Kenneth Branagh become engrossed in a character. I feel that he has the potential but never feels he wants to push it. Watching his directing is almost like seeing the same thing occur. I never feel he really pushes the story, style and talent to its most and therefore the final product is a little lacklustre. I feel the real problem behind the film is actually the story. I hate to say this (because of how much of a literary genius Christie is) but the story is actually a little drab. The mystery is interesting while it exists but the ending feels like a cop out. I understand it was probably the first to use this type of ending as a device but there's a reason mystery stories that end in that way have no future. The mystery excites and hypes people up to find out who the killer is. And then it's all of them. I mean, come on. I get that they got around the massive coincidence factor by stating it was all set up before hand and Poirot just happens to be there but I can't stand it. Sorry Ms. Christie. I don't think it's all down to her though. The film obviously adapts from the novel and while the major story elements are there the film will condense and adapt them which I feel has clogged up the story a little. While it never drags, that doesn't mean it doesn't have problems. The film will impress people and make a lot of money, which is what it's designed to do, but at the end of the day the film stands with the words ""Blockbuster"" and ""simple"" all over it. Will it attract attention and make money? Yes. Will it be remembered in 5-10 years? No."

","'MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A new cinematic version of Agatha Christie's classic 1934 murder mystery novel, which has been adapted into films three times before. Kenneth Branagh directed, produced and stars in the movie; as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Poirot is in charge of investigating a murder on the famous Orient Express. It was written by Michael Green, who's recent writing credits include co-scripting 'BLADE RUNNER 2049', 'LOGAN' and 'ALIEN COVENANT'. The film also features an all-star supporting cast including Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad and Johnny Depp. Ridley Scott also served as a producer on the flick, and it was shot on 65mm film. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (although none are really raving about it), and it's also done modestly well at the Box Office too. I found it to be well made, and mostly (at least mildly) entertaining, but I'm definitely not raving about it either. <br/><br/>The story begins in 1930s Jerusalem, where the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) is solving a case. He's then expecting to go on a highly anticipated vacation. Before he can go on it though, he's given a telegram asking for his assistance on another case. His friend Buoc (Tom Bateman), who now directs the famous 'Orient Express', offers him a three day ride to his destination. Poirot meets a variety of different characters on his trip, including an American criminal named Samuel Ratchett (Depp). Ratchett asks the detective for his help, in acting as his personal bodyguard, but Poirot declines (stating that he doesn't aide criminals, he only catches them). Later Ratchett is killed, and the train is derailed by an avalanche. While the passengers are all stranded there, Poirot conducts an investigation to find out who killed Ratchett, and of course it has to be someone who's still on the train. <br/><br/>The movie is beautiful to look at; it looks like a classic big screen epic at almost all times. Branagh is of course a very talented filmmaker, and actor too, and he doesn't disappoint here. Most of the rest of the celebrities have little to do though; with the exception of Pfeiffer, who's always good in almost everything she does (it seems like). The story is a classic mystery as well, but (as I already said) it's been done multiple times before, and there's nothing really new here. I did have a mostly good time watching it though, but it's also nothing that will stay with me for very long.<br/><br/>Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"

","Ahhh the movie... To be honest I expected something more from it. Me and my friend decided to go see this movie because Jhonny Depp was starring in it. I liked it how in this picture Jhonny Depp was not playing ,,himself,,. Everyone knows him as the fun, charismatic and a charming actor.But here he was different in every way possible. I guess this movie was a new experience for him which he handled pretty well. Enough about Jhonny Depp let's talk more about the movie. The movie is set around the 50's, a lot of Stalin references. The main character is Hercule Poirot who thinks that he is the most clever man on earth. The directors tried to make him charming and a bit egoistic but it in my opinion they failed because the character became to good to be true. So Poirot ends up stuck in a train with a murder on his hands. Man was I disappointed how the ,,mystery'' was solved. It was so hard to keep up with his motives, you have to hear every single word that he says or you will end up sitting there and not understanding anything. The thing I liked about the movie is Hercule Poirot's mustache, I don't care if its fake or real it looked damn great to me. Also the landscapes really caught my eye as they were pleasing as hell to me All in all I would definitely not recommend this movie to my friends."
"redpaperweight","6","0","2","24 November 2017"," Tenseless
","Let me start of by saying that I loved the scenery/decors, the costumes, the hair, the accents and most definitely the mustache! The idiosyncrasy of nearly every character was also delightful I must add. As such the movie was a wonderful experience for the eye indeed. The unexpected humor of Poirot and the pile of poop he steps into is also an add-on to the authenticity of his character.<br/><br/>However, unaware of the book by A. Christie it tries to capture, it was a bit of a disappointment to only be able to experience Johnny Depp for such a short period of time. I understand that he was the one to be murdered but why not let him have another character so we can adore him so much longer? Now Poirot was definitely an interesting character as well, but not close to the performance of Depp. Poirot does make we want to have a walking stick very badly though...<br/><br/>Onto the main problem of this movie and that is the lack of any real tension. I simply felt none of it, I never was sucked into the movie that much that I actually was waiting for the murderer to be discovered. The fear of having to sleep on that train with a potential murderer was completely lacking. Even the ending, where Poirot comes to his final conclusion that every single suspect is the murderer, feels anti-climatic. The gun being dry fired didn't manage to pull me in.<br/><br/>Summarized: eyes say yes; brain says no; heart says no."

","The first thing to say is that I didn't read or watch that story before even did not watch story line or trailer before. So this movie provide me a satisfactory story. It is worth mentioning that I was thinking the friend of Hercule Poirot is the murder who has the ability to summon all the victim in the same train and familiar Hercule Poirot's inferential model which can mislead him easily. That makes me malicious surmise the only innocent people except Hercule Poirot. But the movie itself seem a little chaos for the too long prologue and too short supporting characterizations depiction which makes me too tired to remember almost 60% characterizations in a few minutes. At last, there are a few redundant plot in this movie. For instance, why those murder want to put the bloody clothe in Hercule Poirot 's case? Why the black lieutenant shout at Hercule Poirot ""Why you didn't dead?"" but those bugs doesn't affect the main line。 In conclusion, if you didn't read the story before then it is a worth watching movie."

","Watching Murder on the Orient Express is like playing a game of clue. Trying to solve the murder mystery with several suspects that may or may not have a motive. However, the film is less fun than playing. Murder on the Orient Express draws some great performances. Especially, the best detective in the world Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh). Who is great at solving mystery crimes from the tiniest details that every one would miss. He happens to be on the same express train with several other people that played by an ensemble of talented actors like Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daisy Ridley. When there is a murderer at large, Poirot will have to follow every single clues and theories to who is the suspect. And how every one in train compartment has a connection of some kind? <br/><br/>The direction, tone, and set are fun and visually impressive to look at. With the train being stuck on the snowy mountains and blocked by an avalanche. The performances were also great. Kenneth Branagh did great as the character and tried making it a lot of fun to see him on screen with his compulsiveness and awkward personality. Sure, they can continue with multiple films with the character in different mystery stories. <br/><br/>The few problems I have the film is. It can be very slow in the middle of the second act. So slow, it can be boring at times and you can easily lose interest on were the story is going next. It has its uneven pacing that could have had better editing and maybe trim down a few overlong scenes. Also, the climax with the mystery and twist revealing itself and playing back a few scenes to recap on how everything was done didn't feel like much of a surprise. It just did not have the exciting build up to even care for what was going on. <br/><br/>Overall, Murder on the Orient Express is a fair mystery drama film. A great cast ensemble. A spot on direction and tone for its mystery feel. It was a little longer than it should have been and the slow pacing did not help build the excitement at all.<br/><br/>I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars."

","This movie was a bit of a shock for me. I saw all the trailers, and said to myself each time after seeing them, this is going to be great. For the first half of this movie I was right, it was tension filled and entertaining. It took me right along for the ride and I felt like I was the detective solving the mystery. But as I kept watching, my interest kept leaving me, I watched this movie deconstruct itself by the minute and by the end, I found that I had forgotten the overall point of this movie. All of the character alibis became more and more convoluted as I couldn't solve this mystery what so ever. Then once it tells me what actually happened it seemed so stupid that I felt very unsatisfied with the final product.

","Incredible Hercule Poirot returns and it's Murder on the Orient Express that will have to take his presence once again. Going into this movie knowing how Poirot established himself as great detective you will probably find it very delightful and sweetened but as soon as serious action and plot kicks in you will realize that it's not what you thought it will be. You have seen how serious cast of the movie is and without blink of an eye you will want to see this, it's not to blame you but after coming to screening of it the excitement will come down as movie starts to come to it's end. Samuel Ratchett is murdered and Poirot tired and on vacation gets into his role and solves the crime one more time. It started pretty amazing and with potential but as story went it just kept losing it's so much needed tension and it will just lack that mystery that keeps movie like this going. Pieces of puzzle start to get into it's places as you find out more and you realize movie is trying to play tricks with you but if you have been careful you will not get distracted and will find movie pretty astonishing from directing point of view and there are some pretty beautiful scenes in movie. Plot is also great but somehow it just can't live up to it's true potential which will get you stuck to you seat and in wonder what will strike next. Directing of Kenneth Branagh was pretty amazing and also his contribution as main character Hercule Poirot as which he gave a truly good performance proving his talent over and over. Rest of cast featuring Penélope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr., Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley and Tom Bateman gave probably as much as any of them had some of them even stole scenes more than others but they didn't have that power of intimidation that could help us being dragged into picture and scenes. Movie was stunning to watch, cast was very good at their job but they just could get their hands on attracting audience enough to care for all mystery. One more thing portraying journey and placing actions of movie between Vinkovci and Brod was pretty amazing seeing all scenes but showing it as mountains that even Alps could envy considering that part of Croatia is the flattest and mountain free was just absurd but all in all it was amazing scene. 2.5/4"
"soraswork","7","0","2","21 November 2017"," Good performances let down by the screenplay
","Murder on the Orient Express is the second most known mystery novel by the Agatha Christie, the best selling mystery novelist in of all time. And it's a pretty good book, with a very out there mystery which Poirot, in his usual manner, sums up in a seemingly impossible series of logical leaps right at the end as all the twists and turns are suddenly revealed.<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem with this movie. Oh, to go over the rest, well it's fine and dandy. Branagh brings a great, thoroughly entertaining Poirot to the screen. Really he's the reason I enjoyed it at all. The rest of the cast feels like they're giving a good effort as well, even if most of them don't have enough screen time, or lines, to be as effective as they might have been.<br/><br/>Heck I'll give an extra bonus to Daisy Ridley, who gives the best performance of all them next to Branagh himself, and that with far less screen time to do so. Other than being obviously too young for the part she's playing she's near perfect in the role. And while I'm praising the movie I might say I'd be tempted to vote it for best Cinematography in the Oscars. It's an absolutely gorgeous film at times.<br/><br/>But, well it's a mystery film. And that's getting back to the problem that lies at the heart of it, which is that writer Michael Green doesn't give the audience nearly enough credit in figuring out what the actual mystery is; nor does he give the actual mystery part near enough focus. Unlike the book we are given far, far too many real suspects, and far too many hints and coincidences to really be blown away by Poirot's revelations by the end. Instead of a dramatic, shocking twist ending that makes the likes of The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense feel like they broadcast and foreshadowed their endings to the high heavens we just get an ""Oh. OK I guess. That makes sense.""<br/><br/>And this preys upon the rest of the movie as well. It isn't an engaging mystery where the mystery itself is the star of the show, and we're honed in on trying to figure it out. Instead it plays more like a character piece with the amiable Poirot himself as the star, rather than the mystery where the focus should be. Which is a shame really. The writer does a very nice job otherwise of adapting a book that could be a stage play into something more filmic. All the characters are introduced well, taking Poirot's personalityless Watson clone/foil out entirely works out wonderfully. But a mystery without the mystery as the star really does fall short in a fundamental way."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5 stars) <br/><br/>GRADE: C+ <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: This film gets derailed in its confused storytelling, a less than stellar cast, and some misdirection...facial and otherwise.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Agatha Christie's classic murder mystery is remade for today's modern audience.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: I think it was...Kenneth Branagh...on the train...with his mustache...that killed the movie. The who, what. where, and how may be answered in this unnecessary remake of Murder on the Orient Express, but the ""why"" still nags at this moviegoer. Why dig up this buried gem when one could easily view the far superior 1974 murder mystery classic by Sidney Lumet and his all-star cast of screen legends (Finney, Bergman, Bacall, Connery, Redgrave, and such)? Can this new treatment with state-of-the-art CGI, a more expensive budget, and a cast of today's recognizable actors improve upon this tale of murder and deceit? <br/><br/>￼The answer is a resounding ""no"" in comparison. The specter of Mr. Lumet's masterful film haunts this earnest but standard remake. It's foolhardy filmmaking that does little to improve its literary source. Whereas the 1974 version streamlined a convoluted plot, focused on some fine directorial touches, brought an air of elegance in its elegant Art Deco decor, delivered some interesting well-written characters, and added a first class tier of legendary actors to its roster, this new, but far from improved, update muddles its complicated story, provides stagy direction, has an dark sedated period look, introduces some characters in need of more clarity and motive, and brings a second class group of celebrities to this remake (combined with a few star-worthy replacements). Overall, this 2017 tale has lost all of its sense of glamour, wit, and fun.<br/><br/>It seems that rebooting and re-imagining has taken the place of creativity these days. So with that said, my remainder of my review on this latest attempt to fill the pockets of the producers and filmmakers will try to concentrate on only this movie...a hard task, indeed.<br/><br/>￼For those newbies unaware of the plot: Aboard a high-class speeding train, is super sleuth, Hercule Poirot. It is there that our fussy Belgian hero meets a shady criminal who fears that he will be killed before disembarking and asks our fastidious detective to prevent his demise. Alas, the deadly deed does take place (no real spoiler here) and the list of passengers become his targeted suspects as he unravels the mystery. Clues are scattered through the narrative as, one by one, each traveler converses with Monsieur Poirot. Rest assure, the culprit (or culprits) will be found by the film's end.<br/><br/>The casting is paramount to make this mousetrap work. Mr. Branagh serves as director and lead actor and his dual contributions are a tad uneven. As a director, he layers the narrative with some skill but never involves his audience, choosing to look more at the panoramic scenery than concentrate on the characters. The screenplay by Michael Green doesn't help matters either. The film begins with a totally unrelated crime that establishes Poirot's quirky behavioral traits but adds little to the plot, except confusion.<br/><br/>￼However, Branagh the Actor captures the detective's dialect and his mannerisms well, but he is essentially miscast by his own physicality...and his odd choice of including that ridiculous fur- piece posing as a mustache to the Poirot character. Yes, it is a trademark of the sleuth, but, seen here, it is an absurd facial prop that interferes with the character and the story. He takes the term ""stiff upper lip"" far too literally. Always upstaged by the damn mustache, the actor fights for equal screen time and loses the battle. Plus the fact that the actor himself is rather tall and handsome upends Agatha Christie's unlikable but beloved toady character.<br/><br/>￼Some ""stars"" match their predecessors with style (Judi Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer), others acquit themselves rather nicely (Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom, Jr. ), a few are underused and underwritten (Willem Dafoe, Olivia Coleman, Derek Jacobi, Johnny Depp) but some haven't a clue on how to create a memorable character (Josh Gad, Penelope Cruz). In their defense, the writing may be suspect too.<br/><br/>￼Jim Clay's fine production design shows off the opulence without the elegance. Cinematography is first-rate and the period costumes are true to the period but hardly show- stopping. However, the CGI avalanche scene is so fake and jarringly bad that is literally stops the film cold. <br/><br/>No, this cinematic game of Clue remains a mystery. With all its fancy trappings, Murder on the Orient Express may look the part. But under closer examination, some less than stellar casting bits, a few excessively theatrical moments, and a meandering script make this whodunit more of a ""why-do-it"".<br/><br/>￼NOTE: Those unfamiliar with Dame Agatha's book or the previous aforementioned Lumet film may enjoy this movie more than those already acquainted with the story and its twisty ending. I was mildly disappointed with the end result."

",". . . for ""regime change"" in Washington, DC. Think about it. Half-Heartedly disguised as a ""Period Piece"" dabbling in a case similar to The Lindbergh Baby Kidnapping, why on Earth does it trash the original's popular ""justice is served format"" by allowing multiple killers to get off ""Scott Free"" from a Julius Caesar Ides-of-March mass-stabbing political assassination? You just have to ask yourself, which two Real Life people from the 1900s are mentioned here? Johnny Depp tells Kenneth Branagh that the only OTHER famous person he's met was when ""I once rode a bus with Ty Cobb in Detroit."" The remaining Real Life references are to Josef Stalin, one of current Red Commie KGB Boss Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin's ancestors as Russkie Strongmen. Therefore, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS's REAL focus is entirely on Putin's White House Sock-Puppet-in-Chief, Don Juan Rump, since it singles out Rump's current criminal lawyer--Ty Cobb (who happens to be some sort of descendant of the Honest Ty Cobb)--and Rump's boss, Stalin heir Putin. Therefore, the cast and crew of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS are telling us that our beleaguered Homeland, America, IS the Orient Express, Scar-faced Gangster Johnny Depp is playing Rump, and it's up to each and every one of us to come prepared to the table for our long overdue ""Night of the Long Knives!"""

","Is it just me or have trailers now fallen into the habit of selling movies as something they're not. I started noticing this trend sometime around last winter's Passengers (2016). The film was sold as a sweeping sci-fi space adventure when, what it ended up being was a weepy drama with sci-fi trimmings and the mentality of a 90's romantic comedy. Book of Henry (2017), Suburbicon (2017) heck even the very excellent Mother! (2017) all sold themselves as one thing then blindsided audiences by being something entirely different.<br/><br/>The trailer for Murder on the Orient Express and the accompanying movie definitely fall into this trap, though not in the way you'd expect. It is, a point of fact, a candidly old-fashioned whodunit with a showy lead performance by director/star Kenneth Branagh at its center; that much you know. Yet if you're not familiar with the Agatha Christie novel, the stunningly overrated 1974 film or the even more unbearable 2001 made-for-TV movie, you'll be somewhat surprised that the whodunit at the head of this story is very much beside the point. This isn't a murder mystery as the title suggests but rather a social investigation on whether pre-meditated murder can truly be justified.<br/><br/>The film begins at the tail end of one of detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) world famous criminal investigations. Tired and in need of rest, relaxation and Dickens, Poirot takes the advice of an old friend (Bateman), and hitches a ride on the Orient Express, a luxury coach that winds through the snow-covered Carpathian Mountains before chugging through some of Europe's most important cities. Finding a full train of interesting and potentially dangerous characters, Poirot's relaxation turns to suspicion when a known criminal with plenty of enemies, is discovered dead on board.<br/><br/>During Poirot's careful deconstruction of events and motives we get a sense of Hercule's intelligence, poise under pressure and innate sense of justice. ""To me the difference between right and wrong is as clear as black and white,"" says a tired Poirot right before hopping the train. Little does he know that his brief holiday from crime will have him plumbing through the depths of human sorrow, guilt and anger, ultimately shifting his antiquated worldview.<br/><br/>If you come into Orient Express with that in mind, you may end up having a pretty good time. Agatha Christie invented the popular Poirot for her many novels but the character is a creature of the stage. His mannerisms are big and his emotions are even bigger. Branagh knows this and imbues the super sleuth with a certain theatricality that works well in the cramped quarters of a gently rocking train. He has a stage and fills it with deeply felt emotional stakes. When the big third-act twist reveals itself, we actually feel for Poirot's internal struggle and hardly do we envy him when things start to fall apart.<br/><br/>Of course getting there, and feeling for Poirot much less the rest of our characters involves entirely too many qualifiers for Murder on the Orient Express to warrant a strong recommendation. If you have seen the 1974 Sidney Lumet film, this newer, flashier version feels like an unnecessary remake. It's prettier and quicker paced but like a clear night in a big city, it just feels less impressive and has far fewer stars than you'd like. If you've read the novel then the film's fidelity to the source material may warrant some brownie points. But again, if that's what you're looking for than the 1974 version straight up does it better.<br/><br/>If however, you're coming in fresh and you're jonesing for a good 'ol fashion mystery where you can play along at home thenI have some bad news for you. This movie (and let's face it, every other incarnation of the story), leaves the mystery to hang out just long enough for you to engage on an intellectual level then pulls the rug out from under you in the most unsatisfying of ways. I'm being coy because I don't want to ruin it for you but let's just say Orient Express has always felt like taking a final exam that you've been fretting over for weeks only to discover that everyone's getting an ""A"" regardless.<br/><br/>So yeah, if you want to get the most out of this movie, you need to have either read the book or seen one of the films. You have to be at least familiar with Kenneth Branagh's directorial efforts and realize that the intellectual exercise in this case is not finding out who the killer is but spotting the differences and similarities between the many versions of the same story. The characters are as always interesting and as I said, this one is prettier, but the greatest version possible out of the source material, this film is not."

","Travelling the globe solving case after case, famous detective Hercule Poirot needs a break. A three-day trip from Istanbul to Paris aboard the luxurious Orient Express is the perfect chance to relax until one of the passengers is viciously murdered. Adapted from Agatha Christie's 1934 novel, the source of no less than four adaptations through visual mediums already, director Kenneth Branagh (also starring as Poirot) attempts to reinvigorate this classic tale for modern audiences. He partly succeeds. Retaining the 1930s setting but instilling contemporary filmmaking techniques—long unbroken shots, CGI trickery, an ever-roaming camera—Branagh replaces the midday-mystery feel usually attached to Agatha Christie yarns with a sharp and shiny prestige. There's absolutely no doubt that this version looks stunning, every dollar of its reported $55m budget seemingly splashed out on screen, however this can't disguise the fact there are narrative hurdles aplenty. Although a decent whodunit that throws up a plethora of twists and turns, the outcome isn't completely satisfying (or unpredictable), whilst the abundance of ostensibly important characters results in screen time spread too thin for any of them to leave a lasting impression. The famed sleuth is, rightfully so, the stand out here, Branagh portraying the Belgian Poirot as a dapper, well-mannered Sherlock Holmes-type genius just on the right side of eccentric. Dame Judi Dench is also a hoot as the snooty Princess Dragomiroff. A plucky update to a classic thriller, Murder on the Orient Express is a pleasing time-waster."

"rgkarim","7","0","6","11 November 2017"," All Aboard For Another Mediocre Adaptation
","Mysteries, a genre that intrigues so many with complex tales, intertangled deception, and often drama to help build suspense before the big revelation. While many people try to combine mystery with other genres, there are those who choose to focus on mystery alone. One of these artists is Agatha Christie, a forefront writer who continues to tease our brains with crimes that dive into deeper levels. And with great literature, comes great grounds for Hollywood to make movies from it. This particular tale has gotten a remake this weekend, one with a star-studded cast to try to bring people into the movies in this modern telling. What's in store? Please read on to find out as we review Murder On The Orient Express. <br/><br/>LIKES: <br/><br/>Setting: Start off with a simple like, this film is a shining example of green screen visuals blending with real world shots. The snowy wilderness of the mountains is a dazzling spectacle of symbolism that mirrors the foreboding crime that hangs over the Orient Express. It's a breathtaking display of technology that keeps the darker spirit of the movie alive, and may leave you chilled at the menacing nature hanging in the air. But the highlight is the train and the recreation of those elegant cars and cabins the locomotive industry was famous for. This recreation takes you back in time and immerses you in the classical setting, while also designing a death trap to which our players partake in. <br/><br/>The Mystery: For a movie that focuses on the classic question of who done it, Murder on The Orient Express did a nice job keeping the mystery going. The screen adaptation drops enough hints to throw one off the path, all while keeping you engaged in deciphering the identity of the culprit. As our detective interviews all the characters, you will start getting an idea of how complex the whole case is, further shrouding the scene in a veil that tries to keep you from the answer. It works, keeping suspense going and the film moving, which isn't easy in mysteries these days. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh: Acting wise all the cast do their jobs very well, some better than others in terms of screen time, elegance, and of course capturing their accents down correctly. Yet of all the group it was Kenneth Branagh who I enjoyed watching the most. True, he is the main character and thus gets the most screen time, but his acting was very enjoyable to watch for nearly 2 hours. His French accent is not the best at times, but he gets the OCD detective role down pat, catching the nervous energy and single minded focus that comes with the disorder. His explanations of the crime are delivered in such a serious tone, confidence filling the voice as he presents his logic and convinces you of all the facts. Finally, his comedic delivery is also very well done, not too forced and well-integrated into the conversations, Branagh carries a lot of the movie on his sharply dressed shoulders. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Slow: We know mysteries have to go slow to build things up, but Orient's wheels really slog at times. Primarily when it comes to linking a few backstories together, the movie sort of derails into from the path at hand. Losing this momentum takes away from the suspense, and sort of gets a yawn if you don't pay close attention to the dialogue. And even when they resume chasing the mystery once more they drag things out in a grandiose display that does hold emotion, but steps far over the line for this reviewer. <br/><br/>Unbalanced Characters: A star studded cast again calls for time management and using your resources well. Orient took a nice shot, but they failed to really give the characters equal time on the screen. I don't know how the book is written, but it was obvious the casting favored certain actors over others. Certain characters really get the shaft in this installment, brought out of the shadows for mere seconds and a few answers, before dropping off the screen. This happened with at least four characters for me, brief introductions that were certainly important, but almost confusing at some points. Certainly, Christie did better in displaying her suspects in the book, but they didn't do it as well as I think they could. <br/><br/>Rushed development: It's a plus to have a mystery that moves, it is not so much a plus when your key development areas move like a blur. Murder on the Orient Express involves one having to listen to the dialogue extensively to piece things together, primarily in the alibis of the characters. For me, there were a lot of rapid dialogue exchanges that hastily were spilled out in an attempt to give our characters some background. This background information is incredibly important, so perhaps they should have shifted to a lower gear to clarify this information and establish that depth they were going for. Such a shame to have all these details smeared in a half-sloppy manner when there was such potential to be had. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Compared to the book and the older rendition of this movie, Murder on The Orient Express 2017 is not the shiniest noire in the box. Great visuals, a luring mystery, a phenomenal main character will carry the audience far in this film and provide the main source of entertainment in the film. The main problem is that the team didn't deliver on the potential that this story/cast had. It was unnecessarily slow at points, characters were lacking in a very character centric plot, and it was rushed in areas that was the sustenance. Therefore, the movie overall is mediocre, and better left for a free pass/RedBox in this reviewer's opinion. <br/><br/>My scores are: <br/><br/>Crime/Drama/Mystery: 7.0-7.5 Movie Overall: 6.0"

","I remember enjoying Sidney Lumet's original adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel. It felt long, but was thoroughly entertaining. The remake had me slightly intrigued. Mostly because it had a really good cast to boot. I'm not the biggest fan of Kenneth Branagh's directional efforts, though I quite liked the live action Cinderella remake. With this film, we have a rather dull and uninspiring effort that does little to warrant its creation. It looks nice but feels like a wasted effort.<br/><br/>The film follows ""the greatest detective in the world"" Hercule Poirot as he is stranded on a train with other passengers. One night a murder occurs as one of the passengers is stabbed to death. It is up to Poirot to find out who committed the crime, while realizing the passengers on the train may not be as random and innocent as they seem. Branagh both directs and takes the lead role of Poirot in the film.<br/><br/>That's kind of where the problem lies. Branagh as Poirot takes center stage, and its a little too centered. There is a real talented cast here, that is not much more than background characters with limited material. Judi Dench is in the film and is rarely involved with screen time. I think Branagh is good as Poirot but the film kind of plods along and doesn't garner enough interest or shock as it goes along. The film feels like it just states the plot without delivering it for the audience.<br/><br/>The film remains quite faithful to the novel and is closely similar to Lumet's adaptation. I wanted more liberties taken to provide for a worthy and innovative adaptation but I can understand why it isn't that way. The film does not make use of its potential, and is an inferior adaptation of the novel. The visuals and picture is prim and proper but the film derails along the way which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I grew up with Christie's books and David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. <br/><br/>The thing with ""who don it"" mysteries is that if you know the ending then your experience will differ from that who's seeing it for the first time. <br/><br/>Is this a decent adaptation of the book? Yes, they followed the plot and a lot of attention was paid to the little details to make it look like an actual train from the 1920's. <br/><br/>Up until the end the theater was full of murmurs ""who did it? who was it then?"" and even though I knew I was still interested in the movie till the end.<br/><br/>One thing that lowers this movie's score is Hercule Poirot himself. As a fan I know the character is a bit eccentric however here he was a full blown OCD with non-sense scenes <br/><br/>E.g. get the poor 6 year old to run half way across the city to get him eggs then insist on having them be equal in size and cooked for exactly 4 minutes then do it again because the eggs weren't just right... why? that just seemed cruel.<br/><br/>E.g. 2. have him stand on the roof of the train in a snowstorm ... just to show the scene, there was no reason for that scene at all. <br/><br/>The film gets better as you get past the ""character intro"" and onto the actual train however and Poirot is more himself then. Also I'm arab myself and I found the little bits of subtle humor in the first part actually cool and unexpected in an American movie."

","I've seen some reviews comparing it to the 1974 version. Having never seen that version as I was much too young when it came out in 1974 was probably a good thing.One thing that was very nice was the beautiful cinematography. I never had an interest in these type movies much but the actors in it drew me in. Kenneth Branaugh is rather amusing with the ridiculous moustache which in itself deserves an Oscar for the makeup artist who created it. His Poirot is amusing and delivers the best lines without missing a trick. Johnny Depp as a sleazy art dealer also has some good scenes. The rest of the cast though is disappointing , although it's not entirely their fault as Branaughs direction suffers from sleepwalking ,as if the actors are phoning it in. Judi Dench and her servant are wasted in their roles, Salma Hayek is just terrible , she does not belong in this movie. Daisy Ridley of the new Star Wars trilogy is also miscast here , while a decent actress, she is just uneven. And Michelle Pfeiffer who physically has not aged well does have a few moments towards the end of the movie but by then it's a bit too late. I kind of figured out who did it halfway through the movie so the ending twist was no surprise at all."

","Warning spoilers. We all know who did it. I expect great acting but the plot is so overdone and known I have no inclination to even watch it.<br/><br/>Probably a great view for younger people not familiar with the book and other movies that have been made of this story. If that is you, go watch it, I am sure you will enjoy, a great book and a great story!!"

","In 1934 a train (the Orient Express) is traveling from Istanbul. Aboard is an all-star cast including Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) who is trying to relax. However an avalanche leaves the train stranded for a few days. In that time a passenger is brutally murdered. Poirot reluctantly agrees to solve the murder.<br/><br/>Well-done remake of the 1970s original. It LOOKS great--wonderful production design and costumes. Also it's beautifully directed by Branagh--some shots of the Express moving through the snow took my breath away. Good acting by the cast too--especially Branagh (although his mustache is distracting) and Michelle Pfeiffer. Still it is slow at times. Also I knew the twist ending from the original so I always knew what was coming up. Still it WAS well-done and if you don't know the ending you might like it more than me. I give it a 7."
