"DICK STEEL","8","129","172","29 March 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Ice Age 2: The Meltdown
","Similar to the first Ice Age, the promotional material for the sequel was out in the theatres way in advance, and courtesy of the Scrat character too, up to its usual antics of getting to that elusive acorn. Here, Scrat opens the movie, and emulating the style of the first, he provides most of the laughs, also as an intermission from the actual scenes from the main cast.<br/><br/>Our gang of prehistoric animals are back - Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) and Diego the Sabre-tooth Tiger (Denis Leary). We learn that Sid has gone into the early childhood business, educating the young minds of pre-historic brats. However, I felt that this movie was somehow darker in tone than the original. While the original was one which dealt with hope, this one had its setting in extinction, disaster and death.<br/><br/>The valley which they live in is threatened by the melting ice, no thanks to global warming. So all the animals embark on a journey to salvation, to that rumored ark which will save them from the massive floods to come. Along the way, our trio meets up with another trio of characters, who were added to expand the cast, featuring 2 Possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), and another, but female, mammoth (Queen Latifah).<br/><br/>Needless to say, Manny's still anti-social, and Diego can't get along with those rascal possums who get on his nerves, and Sid's the ""philosopher"" ever providing the laughs. Various themes like romance (hey, we got 2 mammoths here), friendship, trust, and believing in oneself to overcome one's phobia get covered. Pretty wide scope, but they manage to fit in place nicely.<br/><br/>The villains in this sequel are pretty nasty, besides the looming natural disaster, we have two sea creatures with nasty teeth and attitude, as well as menacing vultures ever ready to pounce on the flesh of animals who have fallen.<br/><br/>But it's not all that bleak. Keep a lookout too for that mad sloth song-and-dance sequence, which has potential to become the next ear worm ala Madagascar's zany ""you-got-to-move-it"" song. The animation is as usual, top notch, and I just can't get enough of the photo-realistic ice and water landscape.<br/><br/>This is one piece of animation that doesn't rely too much on sight gags, of spoofing current affairs, but one filled with more witty dialogue and kept on an even keel with its interesting storyline. Though at times it might feel clichéd, somehow it excelled in its execution.<br/><br/>And that makes this sequel, as enjoyable as, if not better, than the original. Recommended stuff this week!"
"Becky_Boo","9","34","43","19 April 2006"," A lovely film with a great storyline.
","This is a lovely film. Great animation and a brilliant storyline for an animation film!<br/><br/>The characters are all lovable and there are a few extremely funny parts in it! Just little phrases and actions the characters do is hilarious!<br/><br/>Ice Age: The Meltdown follows the animals on their journey to find dry land when they discover that their lives are at risk if they stay put due to the ice melting.......there are some little adventures and discoveries along the way though!<br/><br/>If you have seen the first one you will like this and in case you are wondering......he is still trying to get his nut!<br/><br/>I think it is a must see for all ages, not just children."
"blubutterfly21","10","68","93","9 April 2006"," Laugh out loud funny!
","I wanted to take my older kids to the movies for some family time. We went and saw Ice Age Meltdown really for lack of something better to see. (Looks like a bad year for movies again- on the bright side, we'll save a couple hundred bucks.) I am pleased to say, I loved this movie. I laughed so much and found it very enjoyable. It was much better than the first one and I don't know if I've EVER said that about a movie. The characters are witty and entertaining and Scrat gets a lot more screen time in his plight for the great acorn. If you liked the first Ice Age then seeing the sequel is completely risk free. A great film for young and old alike. Enjoy! =)"
"zhixiong","9","43","57","6 April 2006"," Scrat is the Star
","Scrat brought us the most laughter for his extremely positive attitude towards getting an acorn. In a film, it is difficult to create a memorable character with no lines. After laughing at Scrat's funny and unsuccessful attempts, we need to reflect that life is a bumpy road and we should not give up easily.<br/><br/>There are several humorous one-liners, as well as cliché phrases. Some subtle; some blatantly obvious. We were probably smiling when one of the possums was doing the Robert Deniro's famous gesture in 'Meet the Fockers' (2004).<br/><br/>Suppose I am given a chance to delete a scene, I would probably pick the vultures' musical scene. The musical scene seems awkward and does not fit into the film nicely.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the voice actor of Scrat is Ice Age (2002) director, Chris Wedge. However, he did not direct the sequel, Ice Age 2.<br/><br/>Mao points: 9/10"
"mrw8","8","159","234","18 March 2006"," Nearly Flawless
","Highly enjoyable film. Nary a dull moment as Diego, Sid and Manny find their way through the meltdown. The peril found in the first Ice Age movie was not duplicated here. The danger wasn't as imminent due to the fact that the meltdown is partly a blessing, while the ice age itself was all bad. A subtle flaw but not something the creators could avoid unless they wanted to make a ""Mid-Ice Age"" movie. How the tribe survived multiple thousands of years is not addressed, but who cares? Maybe they were actually living on the ecuator in the first movie and the ice caps just reached them in the final years of the ice age. A decade later, the climate warms up and causes the mixed emotions found in Ice Age II. The central theme of friendship in spite of differences and the humor found in trying situations plays well. Overcominging fears in the face of danger is a prominent theme. Jokes fly fast and furious for all ages. And the proto-squirrel steals our hearts with his absolute devotion to caching acorns. A strong production for Twentieth Century Fox."
"jon2005","8","6","6","22 May 2006"," Ice Age: The Meltdown
","The sequel to 2002's Ice Age has managed to recapture the magic of the first film, whilst beating off most recent efforts into CGI films that didn't come from Pixar. This time around the three friends Manny, Sid, and Diego must join their newly formed herd to escape the valley they are living in, as the ice is beginning to melt, and threatens to flood the valley.<br/><br/>Like last time, there is no grand plot here (the first being based on another journey, this time to return a child to its family), and it merely serves to introduce new characters and create laugh-out-loud situations for the trio to overcome. Of the new characters, all are competent (Queen Latifah's Mammoth-Possum-wannabe is good) but never take the lime-light away from our original heroes, which is as it should be; although I did particularly like Will Arnett's Lone Gunslinger Vulture, a rather apocalyptic vulture. All the personalities are back, as is the bickering between them  slightly more playful than last time.<br/><br/>Some standout scenes include Sid's initiation into a tribe of fellow Sloth's, and the origins of whack-a-mole with the possums  all the episodes are loosely connected by a plot which is there to serve for convenience, but this doesn't matter as the film is inventive enough to look past structural failings and just enjoy it. It has increased the fear factor somewhat  the group have to evade two nasty looking sea creatures that have been thawed out by the melting ice, and these scenes, although thrilling, can be scary for younger viewers.<br/><br/>Ice Age: The Meltdown keeps its individual style of animation; at times crossing between its general cartoon-look and then throwing in some genuinely brilliant effects  the underwater shots in particular, and also the effect of the animal's fur after they leave the water are very nice. But it's through the cartoonish style that Ice Age: The Meltdown manages to keep its charm, and there is plenty to go around.<br/><br/>Finally, Scrat is back trying to get his acorns. Used in the first film as more of an advertising ploy, Scrat gets much more screen time in the sequel, as his quest to retrieve his precious acorn against insurmountable odds creates situations that get progressively more hilarious as the film goes on, and provides many of the films true laugh-out-loud moments. At 90 minutes the film is trim and so doesn't outstay its welcome, knowing when enough is enough to keep it all fresh. It's a wonderful sequel that all ages should enjoy.<br/><br/>Rated: 8/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"
"tnkRbllbabe","10","12","14","13 April 2006"," An Overall Cute Movie!
","Ice Age: The Meltdown did not catch my eye at first sight of it coming to theaters, seeing as I hadn't seen the first one yet. However, I flipped through my channels and found the first one ( Ice Age) to be on. I immediately turned it on and begin to watch. Overall I throughly enjoyed it. Even though I am not a little kid and /or cartoon-like movies are my favorite; I found myself to enjoy this movie very much.<br/><br/>A little skeptical at first knowing that sequels aren't near as good as the first one, but I went and saw it anyway. I loved every minute of it. It was cute from the very beginning to the very end ( I wont spoil it for the ones who haven't seen it yet. The animals kept my interest with their adventures they went on. Although I didn't laugh the whole time, that doesn't mean it wasn't funny. It has the perfect amount of laughs and chuckles to keep you going, but not too much to overdo you. Some people may say they enjoyed the first better, but I actually thought the second one was just as good, if not better. I highly recommend Ice Age:The Meltdown to fellow moviegoers. Perfect ten out of ten stars!!!"
"Lady_Targaryen","8","9","10","14 April 2006"," The Pack Is Back.
","I loved ICE AGE 2! I was very anxious to watch this movie, and I finally did it two days ago. There are so many funny moments in this movie, like when Sid starts singing'' if your species has a future clap your hands"", when Scrat is trying to take a gigantic nut and everything goes wrong and even when Manny is trying to say to Ellie that they are the only Mammoths alive, so they need to preserve their specie! LoL I didn't watch this movie in the original English language, so I was sad to loose Queen's Latifah voice as Ellie,as well as the great voices of Ray Romano,John Leguizamo and my favorite,Denis Leary. By the way, the ICE AGE of the first movie is not the one who killed all the animals. Many people were asking how the animals survive, and this is one of the explanations.<br/><br/>aka ""A Era do Gelo 2"" - Brazil"
"jluis1984","7","42","59","11 April 2006"," Very good for a sequel
","At first, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" looks like the inevitable sequel to the famous 20th Century Fox animated blockbuster, trying to cash in the success of the previous movie. Well, despite being exactly that, this new adventure of the prehistoric mammals manages to stay on its own legs and delivers nothing but great fun becoming a worthy sequel. That alone is an achievement in its own right.<br/><br/>After some years living in peace in a new pack, our old friends Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego the Sabertooth tiger (Dennis Leary) discover that the ice is melting and a flood will cover the valley they now call home. Soon they organize a migration, but the trip won't be easy, specially for Manny, who begins to believe that he is the last Mammoth on earth.<br/><br/>""The Meltdown"" continues with the style of its predecessor both in humor and animation, so those who fell in love with the original will love the sequel too. The difference however, is in the fact that now Manny is our main character. We get to know more about this character apparently anti-social and cynic, but who in the inside feels very lonely after the loss of his family. Sid and Diego make good sidekicks in this adventure and while their roles in the film are somewhat diminished, they still are very well-developed characters. Scrat, the nut-obsessed squirrel is back too in his constant quest for his lost nut, giving slapstick humor of the finest type in every scene he is in.<br/><br/>It is always hard for sequels to live up to the expectations, specially in family-oriented animation films, but director Carlos Saldanha and his team manage to make a funny movie that never gets boring or tiresome (something vital as it is a movie mainly oriented for kids).<br/><br/>While probably the story is not exactly original or complicated, writers Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow make up for it with good character development and funny one-liners that fit the movie tone very good. Two new characters, the young possums Crash (Sean William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) are a welcomed addition to the family, as well as Ellie (Queen Latifah), the lost mammoth.<br/><br/>Ellie, Manny and their relationship is a very important subplot in the movie, and one that was perfectly handled by the director and his crew. While Diego's subplot was also interesting and served as basis for very good jokes, it didn't had enough screen-time; a shame in my opinion, but overall the movie was very good.<br/><br/>To summarize, fans of the first ""Ice Age"" won't be disappointed by ""The Meltdown"", and sure the movie will give laughs to both kids and their parents. While still not as good as the first one, this sequel breaks the ""sequel's curse"" and is an entertaining film on its own right. 7/10"
"aharmas","9","55","80","1 April 2006"," Quite an enjoyable adventure
","There are several aspects of this film that I found to be very enjoyable: Its terrific animation, the delightful vocal performances of all the actors involved, and its irresistible imaginative charm. John Leguizamo shines as the heart of the movie, the sloth that inspires all of us to have a good time and gives us hope that there is still some imagination left in Hollywood. His creation and very talented vocal turn perfectly interacts with the other actors' styles. Romano's deadpan delivery this time has found the heart that it sorely missed last time, when it was a just boring attempt to leave his character with no personality. Romano has now found the essence of Manny and has some fun with it. He compliments Queen Latifah's lovely and goofy Ellie. Leary's Diego is not the showiest turn, but he also has some great moments.<br/><br/>In addition to the principals, the possums and the mini sloths are welcome arrivals, and there are some wonderful moments of nutty entertainment, as now computers can portray some truly wacky moments, such as the Berkeley-inspired moment in the sacrificial fire pit and the vulture ""food"" numbers.<br/><br/>This film is a throwback to what made classics such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and The Beast"" work: solid acting and a good writing base. It's a commendable and admirable effort."
"Movieguy_blogs_com","8","45","66","4 April 2006"," I did think the original 'Ice Age' was a better movie, but this one is pretty good.
","In 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' the gang is back. Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Denis Leary) find themselves in a post-ice age catastrophe. The ice is melting and they have to move the herd out of the valley before it becomes a lake. Fortunately, they do not have to worry about any carnivorous dinosaurs. They are all extinct, or are they? This was a cute film worthy of the original. The kids will really enjoy it. I thought the best part was that Scrat, the acorn-loving rodent, has a larger role to play in this movie. Queen Latifah is also really good as Ellie, the mammoth that thinks she is a possum.<br/><br/>I did think the original 'Ice Age' was a better movie, but this one is pretty good."
"moviefan1725-1","10","108","177","1 April 2006"," Better than the original!
","Ever since Hollywood fully adopted computer animated family films, there has been a great variance in quality. Some have been have great, and others aren't worth the film they are printed on. Pixar continues to set the bar with movies like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. A lot of people complain that no other movies of this genre are on par with Pixar. So what? Does that mean they are all bad movies? Not at all. If Finding Nemo is the gold standard, then Ice Age is the silver. The animation is beautiful, the characters are funny and engaging, the story is fast paced and moving, and most of all it deserves another follow up. The story centers around Manny the Mammoth, Syd the Sloth, and Diego the Sabretooth Tiger, making their way out of the great valley before the quickly thawing landscape floods the land. Along the way they meet two possums, and a female Mammoth named Ellie that thinks she is a possum. (Don't ask...you'll find out) They join several other species as they make their way to ""the boat"" that will carry them to safety when the great flood comes. They are also trying to stay ahead of two fierce sea monsters that have already been thawed from their icy prison. Also back is Scrat the Squirrel who continues in his hunt for his beloved acorn. Will our heroes reach their destination? Will Manny and Ellie find love? Will Scrat ever been reunited with his prize acorn? Will Diego conquer his fear of water? Will Syd ever find respect? Most importantly...will you and your family enjoy this movie? Of course you will! This is an excellent family film that mixes humor for both kids and adults. Some of the very young children my be a little frightened during the sea monster attacks, but it will by no means induce nightmares. The characters are still incredibly lovable, and the movie is very good at teaching the strength of family and togetherness. It's better than the first movie on all counts. My personal favorite scene has to do with Scrat vs. a school of hungry piranhas. When Scrat falls in the water, the piranhas snatch his acorn. Let's just say he does not take it well. This ranks high above other recent CG animated movies like Madagascar and Doogle. Personally I like the Ice Age films better than the two Shrek movies which I find HIGHLY overrated. Both my kids and I hope there will be an Ice Age 3. Is there any higher praise?"
"lostcheerio","6","9","11","24 April 2006"," It didn't melt me.
","The children liked it but they weren't riveted. That's the short of it. It wasn't a shocking disaster, but it was just a bit muddled. A little scattered. Fragmented. It failed to engage me.<br/><br/>But let's be positive. The writers wisely decided to vastly expand the role of Scrat the Squirrel in this version. Periodically we get to take a break from watching the mammoth, sloth, tiger, possums, and other mammoth walk very slowly along toward the vague ""other end"" of a vague ""valley"" to avoid a flood that is being caused by global warming. We get to step back from the grindingly uninspired mammoth love story and the other many subplots that go with the many characters. We get to watch a squirrel chase an acorn. And those sequences present some of the funniest bits in the film.<br/><br/>The rest of it is just kind of there. One problem is that there's really no reason for a sloth, a tiger, and a mammoth to be casting their lots together, except that they did in the first movie. That movie, I felt, had a storyline that involved actual characterization, growth, change, a real tension, etc. When the tiger almost fell off the cliff in Ice Age #1, I gasped. This time, I fidgeted. It just didn't seem real. And that's what I want from an animated movie about talking prehistoric animals -- REALNESS. No, but seriously, without some degree of actual jeopardy, of actual question of what will happen from scene to scene, without someone to root for and embrace -- it's just pointless.<br/><br/>The only character I was getting that for was the saber tooth squirrel. They could have saved a lot of money in celebrity voices.<br/><br/>Everyone had a subplot because they had to have something to do, so that was tidily arranged for them. But nobody's subplot had anything to do with the others'. And the global storyline about the flood was just a reason to walk... slowly. Slowly walk. And pester each other half-heartedly about how they were all going to die. Or not.<br/><br/>Like I said, the children didn't complain. I did laugh, many times, at the places I was supposed to. But it wasn't great."
"jlc7197","10","9","11","10 April 2006"," Best movie in a long time!
","The graphics even surpassed the original and the story was hilarious. Crash and Eddie are great new characters and the Skrat has been expanded to almost a Wiley Coyote role, less the ACME apparatus. He is wonderful. Queen Latifah is adorable and perfectly cast. I have grown to love the original characters Manny, Diego and Sid, who are kept faithful to their original characters by the writers. And the writing is pure genius! One liners and slapstick abound. The ending is too cute for words and must be seen anyway, not given away. I personally find this to be the best animation I have ever witnessed and a fine example of the best today's technology has to offer."
"Jay_Exiomo","6","55","88","29 March 2006"," Still cool but less solid the second time around
","Manny the woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Dennis Leary) the saber-toothed tiger embark on yet another journey in ""Ice Age: Meltdown, ""the sequel from the 2002 blockbuster by Blue Sky Studios and released by 20th Century Fox. This time, ice is melting and a great flood is threatening to drown all animals in the valley in three days, much to the delight of vultures who are keen on having a buffet with the bodies of those who will be unfortunate enough not to outlive it. The only way to survive is to get to an ""ark"" at the other end of the valley. Along the way, they meet Ellie (Queen Latifah), perhaps the only other mammoth left aside from Manny, but unfortunately, thinks of herself as a possum, with her ""brothers"" Crash and Eddie (Sean William Scott and Josh Peck... who's who, I don't know because I never got to track their names).<br/><br/>""Ice Age: Meltdown"" is, first and foremost, the inevitable sequel. And while it is still an enjoyable movie, it's very clearly more, or less (depending on how you would look at it), of the same. It still follows up from the first one, but all in all it feels that there wasn't enough material to hold a full-length movie that the character of Scrat has been given more screen time even if what he does trying to get his acorn doesn't advance the plot at all, albeit helping the film reach barely an hour and a half. While this movie still does manage to amuse from time to time, on the whole the plot feels more obligatory and jokes seem to be a little bit more blunt.<br/><br/>That's not to say ""Ice Age: Meltdown"" is a total waste because it does still have a few aces up its sleeve. Latifah brings a brilliant performance on her character Ellie, as are Scott and Peck on Ellie's two ""brothers."" And while much of the first two parts of the film lags, it builds up during the climax and from there never lets go. The animation looks quite excellent as well.<br/><br/>It still has enough wit and laughs to support it most of the time but it's really much more of a standard film than the first one, and the animation genre in general doesn't reach new levels with this. Still, it's one of the better sequels there is, and it's a cool way to start the summer (in this side of the world, that is)."
"SnoopyStyle","6","4","4","9 December 2013"," Fun for Kids
","The three friends find their valley is about to be flooded from all the surrounding ice melt. Manny (Ray Romano) is starting to wonder if he truly is the last mammoth, when he meets Ellie (Queen Latifah). Only she thinks she's a possum, with her possum brothers Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck). Manny along with Sid (John Leguizamo) and Diego (Denis Leary) must lead the group to safety at the other end of the valley.<br/><br/>It's a good sequel to this kids franchise. I like the group chemistry most of all. There is limited laughs for adults but little kids do love it. Sid continues to be my favorite. I bet he's a fan favorite for most. The group battles not only time, but also a prehistoric sea creature. It provides some good action. I would definitely recommend this for the kids, but less so for the adults."
"michael-colan","6","4","4","10 November 2012"," Fun but lacks the Heart of the first one
","After the very successful animated film Ice Age we get treated too a sequel. 4 years since the release of the first film and in that time frame you would expect that the filmmakers would come up with a good sequel. I will say that the film is creative and fun but the film is missing something that the first one had makes the sequel decent but not great.<br/><br/>In this film we have our three heroes returning for another adventure. When it seems like the entire world is melting, Manny, Diego, Sid all set out to find a ""boat"" at the other end of the valley when Manny begins to think that he might be the last Mammoth on Earth he finds another one with a very unusual problem.<br/><br/>The story I find in this one to be much more creative than the first one. Enough though to some existent it a ""Noah's Ark"" story but the first one was really a hybrid between Shrek and Monster's Inc but the film had enough charming characters and laughs to let us look away from that problem. So I give this film a lot more credit for trying to come up with something different than the rest. The film does get pretty creative in the environment that it is set in. There is a lot more personification in this film than the last one making the animals more human than the last one. I think this takes away from one of the aspects that made the original so charming and funny was the characters were pretty much just like the animals they were portraying and didn't involve too much human like behavior. In this film they have schools and pools and swimming and granted this is an animated kid's film but I think sticking to the first one's style of play would have been better.<br/><br/>The Humor in the film is also for the most part very good. Just like in the first one we get a little bit of everything. There is some smart humor that might blow over the heads of the young children however not that much. We get some great slapstick humor which will have the children and adults laughing and some dirty inside jokes that is kept very low key and very much implied but as quagmire once said in family guy (paraphrasing slightly), ""You know where this is going, it's all implied. The kids don't know but we do.""<br/><br/>However with that being said the humor just doesn't match the humor of the first one. Although this film is funny and does have some great laugh out loud moments it just doesn't have the same charm and comedic timing and trimmings that the first one had. This one lowers itself down to mostly potty and slapstick humor. It feels a bit lazy and the younger ones won't mind and it will entertain all but for most of us we were hoping for a bit more. That's not at all to say this movie isn't funny.<br/><br/>There is something else that is missing in this movie that the last one had. That little something is a very basic element of the human spirit. That basic element is the heart and soul of this movie. The first one we had Manny's dark past and Diego's change of heart and Sid's lovable, want everybody to be a family type character and all that wrapped into one big quest to big a lost child home. That was the heart and soul of that film and it succeeded because that emotional heart and center. Also all those themes and stories were all interconnected and played in and out throughout the film. In this we don't get much of that and this is the main reason why I think this film is not nearly as good as the first one. This one we get mostly a comedy with not much of anything else. In this we get a silly romance that doesn't hold much weight. Manny has insecurity issues with the possibility of being the last Mammoth. Diego has a fear of the water and Sid thinks he deserves more respect (and nearly kills himself in the process of trying getting some). All in all there isn't much here. That's not to say the film isn't entertaining because it certainly is and you will have fun watching it but don't expect any more of it.<br/><br/>The stars have returned from the original first film to the sequel and deliver some good voice work. Ray Romano returns as Manny and is funny as he always is in whatever he does. Denis Leary also returns as Diego and his role is dumbed down to a funny sidekick but Denis does great voice work. John Leguizamo is back as the funny; stupid but lovable Sid the Sloth and we get the same funny character we got last time and always provide us with a great laugh.<br/><br/>Scrat is back! The little dopey Wild Coyote of this generation. He has absolutely nothing to do with the main storyline and you know what? I could not care less he is a welcome distraction as his quest for the nuts continues and gets himself involved in more wacky situations.<br/><br/>A newcomer to the cast includes Queen Latifah as the Mammoth that is having an identity crisis and is funny but nothing special as Ellie. Josh Peck and Seann William Scott play a possum gang of brothers who loves causing trouble and is the best new addition to this film. Both brilliant with great chemistry and remain funny throughout.<br/><br/>The film with everything together is a very entertaining film and remains funny throughout however lacks the good heart that made the first so great and the humor is up to par with the original however it is a decent sequel.<br/><br/>Final Score <br/><br/>6/10"

","I was getting ready to trash ice age : the melt down. Since the first film was so self contained, there was no real need for a sequel (besides the need for more money ) and this review seemed like a perfect opportunity to chastise the greed of big film studios.<br/><br/>Well after watching the film i can report that they'll be no ranting here- Ice age 2 is a pleasantly entertaining and funny film with with some stunning character animation.Much like the original , ice age 2 meanders along a series of set pieces and visual gags and doesn't out stay its welcome. Fan favourite scrat the squirrel returns for more hilarious, futile attempts to get his elusive nut and there are some clever innuendos for grown ups.<br/><br/>However while its entertaining, it has the same problems of the original (a: its a bit too safe b: Its very predictable ) with the addition of some new ones- namely the new characters .Not only are the new characters not interesting but the possum brothers both reach a scrappy doo level of annoyance.<br/><br/>Ice age : the melt down is a cash in for sure, but its a funny and entertaining one ."

This movie has a little sexual material, but it plays out to where even my 10 yr. old brother didn't notice it, so I'm pretty sure it's safe for most kids! They will love the movie unless they didn't like the first one. Some kids might be just a little scared by the newly introduced characters, but should recover quickly. Be sure to listen for the voices of Josh Peck as Eddie and Jay Leno as Fast Tony!"

","OK...I usually avoid sequels....especially animated sequels. They tend to be derivative, almost plot less wastes of time.<br/><br/>I cringed when I heard they were making a sequel to Ice Age. After all, the first was so good, any sequels were bound to be bad, right? WRONG! Ice Age 2 is a fully recognized movie in and of itself. It makes references to the first movie, but doesn't depend on it for the plot to work. The jokes are original and genuinely funny.<br/><br/>OK...so the rational side of my brain is telling me that a mammoth couldn't hang by it's tail from a tree or stay under water that long, but the side that can quote all the old bugs bunny cartoons is telling me to stop being so dang literal about things and enjoy it.<br/><br/>This movie is what animation should be! Oh, and I'm STILL waiting for poor Scrat to get that acorn!!!"
"nycritic","8","6","7","3 April 2006"," The Quest for Safety and Acorns
","Scrat, the little squirrel, is the bookend of ICE AGE and ICE AGE 2: THE MELTDOWN which opened this past Friday in American theatres. His isolated storyline is the one thing that I enjoyed because it has the unpredictability of a hairpin plot and the visual craziness of a Rube Goldberg sequence and is right at the center of the real action.<br/><br/>This time lapse is one of the few complaints that I can have in this latest movie, but again, being a film aimed at children and young adults, no one is up for the count. No humans cross the path of the story. All ICE AGE is, is the story of just that: the warming of the Earth, the end of the idyllic valley where all these different animals co-exist in happy harmony, and the search for a boat that rests at the other end of the valley and will offer a place for them to weather the flood about to ensue. (It's an irony that Scrat is the one who first encounters the melting of the ice in his hilarious opening sequence.) Manny is still pining for his family and feels lonely despite his friends. This doesn't last long: soon he meets a female mammoth named Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah)... but there's a ""mild"" problem. She thinks she's a possum. Her two possum ""brothers"" don't deny it. Diego and Sid think she's not all there but encourage their acquaintance, while Manny wonders if this eccentric mammoth might be for him. In Sid's words, ""She's two tons of fun and you're no fun at all."" ICE AGE 2 makes its point to include the outsider who is really an insider in its plot. It's made the news dozens of times -- an animal of one breed adopting one of a totally different breed -- and here, Ellie eventually learns the reason she behaves like a possum in a very moving sequence not unlike Manny's in the first and I would like to see anyone who won't shed a tear watching her as a young mammoth finding her surrogate family and her own adopted identity. Even then, she's okay with that -- she is happy about herself. Manny, however, is not; he is a conformist who can't see that this bright thing stomping around the woods and being as carefree as you like it is more herself than he himself might be. No wonder he looks into his own reflection: there is the notion that when finding love, one looks into what reflects you. Ellie definitely complements him... but he cannot see it. Yet.<br/><br/>Global warming is now the omnipresent villain. A reality today, ICE AGE remains contemporary despite its setting and brings forth the moral of what may happen if the Earth's poles melt. Everywhere they go there are signs of warming: geysers explode from the inside of the Earth, water rises dramatically, the dam retaining the ocean of water just behind it is about to give way. Water, water, everywhere, and nasty fishes await their moment.<br/><br/>ICE AGE 2 is a good sequel. Visually it's beautiful and almost life-like and the great care of constructing the universe in which Manny and his friends live shows. One minor complaint is one which has them on their exodus, crossing what seems to be hills, only to then shift inexplicably to ice again, which to me seems to be only to add tension to these shark-like fishes who are looking for meat and to put Diego the saber-toothed tiger into his own worst fears. Then again, this is a animated movie and in following with traditions, the main characters have to travel through danger and be in danger before being in safety and in this it is effective.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed it (or let's say, the kid in me did), but any adults looking for an adult story should go elsewhere because despite the material, it's not here. A dance sequence was the high point (children in the theater cheered it and laughed at its surprising denouement), and the vulture's quest for raw meat, complete with a Broadway-esquire musical, is a riot. And of course, it ends appropriately with Scrat in acorn heaven, being pulled back to Earth, and incorporated into the main story."
"walker2000","10","65","116","4 April 2006"," Wow! A sequel that's better than the original!!
","My family and I absolutely LOVED this movie!! We thought it achieved the rare accomplishment of being better than its original. As my husband says, ""They stole from everyone."" Without spoiling the movie, let me just say there were bits from Broadway musicals, from other movies (some new, some classics), and from everything in between. The vultures' musical number is the one that has gotten stuck in my head. That's as far as I'll go with that one.<br/><br/>Ice Age 2 really racked up the talent. Numerous times we would lean over and whisper ""I know that voice! Who IS that?"" I was truly surprised to find out that one of them was Jay Leno.<br/><br/>Although the underlying message of both Ice Age movies is death, doom, and destruction, I thought overall it was a very light-hearted movie with lots of hope, love, and friendship. The photo-quality animation of the rushing water, Scrat's fur blowing in the breeze, and many other tiny details was no less than breathtakingly impressive.<br/><br/>While it may be just a bit much for the smallest of children, I whole-heartedly recommend this movie to everyone else, young and old alike. You don't have to have kids or be a kid to love this one, just enjoy laughing."

","I took my 8 year old daughter to see this, having seen the first film on on the television recently. I don't know which one of us enjoyed it more, it was definitely a case of the sequel exceeding the quality of the original. The characters were much better defined, Sid the Sloth was the films hero,in my eyes, he stole the show with some excellent one liners. The relationships between the three main characters was excellent & the effects were superb.

","The original ""Ice Age"" was a very good show - funny and clever. I therefore had high hopes for the sequel which turned out to be neither funny nor clever.<br/><br/>In the original, all the characters were believable within the bounds of cartoon reality. In this, one of the main characters, Ellie, is a one note joke that no one can take seriously. The voice performances are OK, given the dialog they had to work with. Queen Latifah's voice performance as Ellie almost overcomes the essential silliness of the character, but not quite. The other voice performances lack the spark of the original, as if the actors realized they were only doing it for the paycheck. The one exception is John Leguizamo who tackles the Sid character with the same manic gusto as the original. But it's simply not enough.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that the original made me laugh and care about the characters. The sequel made me smile intermittently, but mostly made me look at the clock waiting for it to end. A major disappointment..."
"Ronald_Mexico","7","7","9","5 May 2006"," Not a meltdown, but definitely a lukewarm sequel
","Having now seen the film three different times (don't ask), I finally feel at least knowledgeable enough to write an adequate review. The original ""Ice Age"" was a good, not great, movie and I figured that the sequel would be more of the same. And that's exactly what the sequel turned out to be: a few chuckles sprinkled here and there, a nice talent addition in Queen Latifah, and a plot interesting enough to follow without falling asleep in the process. But a highly memorable film, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" was not.<br/><br/>The plot: the Ice Age is ending, and the herd from the original film (Sid, Diego, and Manny) must move to higher ground or risk drowning when the great ice dam collapses. Subplots include the introduction of new characters (Latifah as Manny's female mammoth counterpart Ellie and two possums named Crash and Eddie), Manny's worry that his species is on the verge of extinction, Diego's internal struggle with his irrational fear of water, and Sid's discontent over not being respected by the rest of the herd.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are a mixed bag of successes and failures. John Leguizamo and Denis Leary were once again very strong as Sid and Diego, respectively; the lisping voice of Sid is distinctive and endearing, while Denis Leary's dry menace makes you want to laugh even when nothing funny has been said. Queen Latifah is also highly effective as Ellie and provides her share of laughs throughout the film. However, Ray Romano's voice 'talents' appear to consist solely of reprising the same annoying character he portrayed for nine years on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" (yes, if you were to close your eyes during scenes where Manny is speaking, you would almost swear that you were listening to a whining middle-aged man trying to combat his pushy, know-it-all wife. Try it for yourself and see). Romano's nasal voice combined with the surly nature of the mammoth end up creating a lead character that is fairly unappealing, which may not exactly be a coveted quality for a kids' movie.<br/><br/>And then there is the addition of Crash and Eddie, both of whom combine to make up what must surely be the greatest comedy duo since Scott Baio and Willie Ames. It's not that they're spectacularly annoying, or that they're bad enough that they detract from the film; it's just that they aren't very funny. Clearly their role is to provide belly laughs based on slapstick and over-the-top drama, but the writers give them next to nothing to work with in terms of material, and the result is a lot of tepid humor (""How are we going to re-populate the Earth? Everyone's either a dude or our sister!""...yawn), and a lot of blank stares from my little brother and the majority of kids in the audience.<br/><br/>Crash and Eddie notwithstanding, the film hits about as often as it misses with its attempts to create guffaws. Wildly successful were scenes involving Sid as the ""Fire God"", Queen Latifah's mammoth suffering from species identity confusion, and Diego's continuous bouts with Hydrophobia. Less successful were Jay Leno's scenes as Fast Tony and a musical number involving a chorus of vultures (""Food, Glorious Food""...please stop). Admittedly, the antics of Scrat drew raucous laughs from both kids and adults alike in the audience, although I have to believe that people finding this creature even remotely amusing are similarly likely to own a vast collection of Pauly Shore films and a shelf containing VHS recordings of every known episode of ""The Jeffersons"".<br/><br/>So all, in all...7 out of 10. Not bad, not even a waste of money or time, but your chances of remembering it even a few weeks from the time you view it are about on par with the likelihood that you'll accurately recall the contestant who won May 4th's Showcase Showdown on ""The Price is Right""...in an episode that ran in 1982."

","Man this movie seemed like it took such a long time to come out on DVD, it was driving me crazy. Unfortunately, I never got the opportunity to see this in the theaters, so I had to wait for the rental. Unfortunately, Hollywood Video was sold out so I had to buy the movie, but actually it was worth it, because this was such a fun movie. God bless the man who created that little squirrel who is chasing that nut, those scenes were just so cute and funny! <br/><br/>The gang is back, but this time, their place is melting due to the global warming, their home is being destroyed so badly that they and their herd are moving to a place with more ice.

Of course the journey is a hard one, but the team tries to stick together as much as possible and there is one crazy squirrel that is causing a few problems for the ice.<br/><br/>Ice Age: The Meltdown has great animation, a great cast, and just over all a fun story.

"Victor Field","6","5","6","4 May 2006"," Ironically considering it's about ice and water, it's not cold or particularly drippy. But remember, it's all about Scrat.
","You can tell how much I liked ""Ice Age"" by this little nugget; flying back from a holiday a couple of years back, I watched this (again) in a Portuguese dub and ""Daddy Day Care"" in English. The latter was by far the more painful experience.<br/><br/>The trouble is, the first film was so self-contained it's hard to see how they could have gotten a sequel out of it, and ""Ice Age: The Meltdown,"" though not really deserving to be dubbed ""Ice Age: The Letdown,"" is indeed a step down from the first one. The animation is, if anything, better this time around (and conclusive proof that it's a lot easier to animate water than it used to be); it's the story that's the problem... this time around there isn't much of one, and the story and characters were a major part of what made ""Ice Age"" work - Sid and Diego are sidelined here in favour of Manfred's worrying about his being the last mammoth on Earth (a feeling the first movie handled far more movingly in the cave drawings scene than in this entire flick), with Diego's fear of water seemingly thrown in when the writers remember they have to do something with him.<br/><br/>We won't talk about Sid being the Fire King. Or most of the songs.<br/><br/>The movie also fudges a bit with the thawed-out predators pursuing our heroes on their journey to escape the flood; even though they actually do kill one of the animals they never really emerge as much of a threat (compare them to Sharptooth in ""The Land Before Time,"" with which this shares the basic premise) - and when you think about it, not since ""Casper"" has a film aimed so much at younger viewers had such an obsession with death, what with one key scene involving a deceased mammoth and the threat of extinction looming over all their heads. And frankly, the most important major characters introduced - Ellie, The Mammoth Who Thought She Was A Possum (emphasised because it sounds like the kind of ""The Wonderful World Of Disney"" episodes I always used to hate as a boy - and as a man, come to think of it) and her genuine possum brothers - are all really, really irritating.<br/><br/>However, there's still a lot of entertainment here. Sid, Manny and especially Diego remain engaging, and the vulture voiced by Will ""Gob Bluth"" Arnett really deserved more time; John Powell's score is one of his better efforts (although I still prefer David Newman's work on the first film - pity he didn't return); and Scrat has considerably less difficulty stealing the movie than he has in hanging on to his nut (I shamelessly confess to being more gripped by his travails than by the main story). So, not quite up to the first film or ""Robots"" but still far superior to yer garden variety DreamWorks.<br/><br/>One thing though - like ""Robots,"" the UK release version of ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" has a tacked-on pop song from a British artist. While I didn't like how it turned out there, it's even worse here, with most of Powell's end credit score suite junked in favour of a chronically out-of-place ditty from the talentless ex-boyband oaf that is Lee Ryan - who also redubs a character in the movie - and said aural plague isn't even on the soundtrack album. (Thank goodness, or better yet thank Varese Sarabande.) Why they felt the need to do this, I do not understand. At least with ""Robots"" they got someone who wasn't crap..."
"diac228","6","5","6","23 April 2006"," Scrat takes this film and runs with it, the other characters in the film just get in the way
","Ice Age was proof that you do not have to be Pixar to come out with an awesome yet equally touching computer-animated film. Becoming a surprise hit a few years ago, it made Ray Romano a bigger star, and would also temporarily revive the careers of Denis Leary and John Leguizamo. Of course a sequel was in the works after its success, this is Hollywood we are talking about. Fortunately, the entire cast was back, including the squirrel that provided the most laughs in the original. The antics of the squirrel are among the best footage of animation since the Road Runner cartoonshe is just that funny to watch. Unfortunately though, Queen Latifah was going to have her moments in the sequel. The overrated actress just isn't that funny, sorry, and I did not picture her providing much laughs in the movie.<br/><br/>Ice Age: The Meltdown is one of those movies that feel more like two movies in one: one that is very, very funny, and the other that just isn't that great at all. Scrat the squirrel basically proved that he needs his own movie; he was the standout character in the film by far. Ice Age: The Meltdown also proves that once you add a few more characters, the chemistry between the main characters just suffers. In the original Ice Age, there were plenty of one-liners, witty remarks, and cheap shots aimed at each other, but in the sequel, it's all gone because we have another mammoth and a few possums. It just wasn't as interesting the second time around, nor was it as funny. Ice Age: The Meltdown is the standard sequel, more or less of the same but just not as equally fun.<br/><br/>The movie is about how the ice is melting and it will soon create a massive flood, leading to the possible deaths of thousands of animals. With this looming event happening, Manny, Sid, and Diego set out on a hunt to find a protection, or perhaps a ""boat"" to save them from the icy cold waters and the dangerous fishes that lurk within it. Along the way, they run into the possums and perhaps the only other living mammoth. The catch is, the female mammoth thinks she is a possum herself. The other part of the movie, the second part, is Scrat's constant efforts into getting that acorn he so adores.<br/><br/>Pretty much all the humor comes from Scrat, and nobody else. Sure the main characters do have their moments, but overall all the humor comes from the Looney Tunes-style moments of the squirrel and all he has to go through to get the acorn. Whether its him going all kung fu on fishes, or attempting an Olympic-like stunt, or climbing using his tongue, the furry critter does it all. He stands out like a hysterical sore thumb in the film. He needs his own movie; this is a fact. It would be the most successful animated film with no dialogue whatsoever (Hey, you won't have to pay millions to hire famous actors).<br/><br/>Madagascar, Ice Age, and especially Finding Nemo were three animated films that were totally run by the chemistry between the main characters, the way they cooperated and clashed with each other. This film was totally missing that. The mammoths just didn't seem like that great of a couple, Sid and Diego was missing that comical spark, Manny didn't have as many good one-liners, and the rest of the animals they run into just weren't as funny (The Dodos from the first one was a hoot). Crash, Eddie, and Ellie, the three new animals in the sequel, just made the movie drag a bit and rarely provided anything past a snicker from the audience.<br/><br/>The voice talent isn't to blame here as much as the writing. Romano, Leary, Leguizamo were great with what they had, while Seann William Scott, Queen Latifah, and Josh Peck weren't necessarily that greatanyone really could have done those roles. It seems like the writers did not have enough material the second time around but did the best they could to make the movie despite the lack of content. The jokes just aren't as fresh, and some of them come off as uncomfortably pathetic. The ending was awesome though, and once again, its because of Scrat.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Not as fresh, not as original, not as exciting, not as funny, and not as entertaining as the first one, but it still does indeed have its moments, and they all involve the one headline character in the teasers and in the poster. Hopefully, a third one is not going to happen, but with the money this one is currently making, the possibility is still indeed there. Chemistry is all gone, the laughs aren't there; this was the most disappointing animated film since Shrek 2. Then again, with Pixar headlining the way animated films should be, shouldn't we cut Blue Sky Studios a little bit of slack? After the excellent Ice Age, nah, the talent is obviously there, that or they are a one-hit wonder (after all, Robots wasn't that great either). Ice Age: The Meltdown: all we need is Scrat.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The animation is better, the humor is more intelligent and yet slapstick simultaneously! A mammoth believing they're a possum, and when you learn why - tears come to your eyes! How a sqrat can defend itself against a multitude of piranhas, using the fish themselves against each other! But if he's dying, leave him be, lol! Scrat, the main character to my mind, was both the problem and solution for the valley - he caused the valley to flood and also to drain in his immortal quest for the Perfect Acorn, and he nearly died for it too; not that he'd've minded!! Diego, an exiled sabre-tooth tiger, learns to overcome one of his greatest fears - is this supposed to explain why tigers nowadays like to swim? Denis Leary plays his character out well and sounds a bit like George Clooney still...<br/><br/>Manny finds love and a continuance of his lineage in the most unlikely place, as Ellie (another mammoth) appears to be the ""sister"" of two mad extreme-sporty yet hip-hoppy possum brothers!

"robertac-3","2","16","26","9 April 2006"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
","Ice Age 2 has got to rate as one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It has no plot, no believable story line, no particularly likable characters, no original ideas. True, it does have some great animation and effects (the fur on Scrat is magnificent), but then I do wonder about what appear to be painted 2D backgrounds, and the colouring, which at times is reminiscent of a 1950s kids' story book.<br/><br/>The premise for the whole movie is unbelievably flimsy: the 'Herd' decide that they need to get to higher ground because their valley is going to flood. Not even the kids in the movie house seemed to buy that one. In fact they only seemed to buy some of the opening scenes with Scrat - if their lack of laughter elsewhere was anything to go by.<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie features the 'Herd' moving through ice, then land, then ice, then land to apparently get to higher ground (the fact that they move over land that has to be higher than the area from which the flood is coming does not seem a concern to the movie makers). Add to this movement through spurious landscape the bad guys that are there for no other reason than for being bad guys (apparently the impending flood is too abstract a concept for three-year-olds), the appallingly placed 'musical interludes' ('Food Glorious Food' just had to take the cake on that one!)and Manny's love interest pretending to be a possum (the most desperate attempt to squeeze a laugh out of an audience that I have seen in a long time), and you have two hours of my life that I desperately want back! <br/><br/>When will Hollywood be brave enough to break the formula? The annoying and not really so cute comic side kicks are just that: annoying! The hero rushing in to save the kind-of-heroic-but-not-quite heroine is hackneyed and unbelievable! And the fart jokes (miles away from the snappy, witty energy of the first movie) that weren't even funny for the three-year-old demographic - please serve me up some other form of crap!"

Just go to a electronics store chain and see how often this DVD is played as a ""demo"" to show off new TV sets.<br/><br/>Story-wise, what is a bit different from the first movie - and this was fine with me - was more lines and scenes featuring the two funniest characters: Scat, the squirrel and Sid The Sloth. The squirrel has no lines but is hilarious, as he was in the first film. Scat is still trying to capture or hold that elusive acorn and every quick scene with him is clever.

While the new adventure doesn't have the same emotional impact as the first (less tear-jerky, I mean), it makes up for it with comedy. Scrat's attempts to hang on to his acorn are longer & even more hilarious. The Possums & their big ""sister"" are excellent new characters, providing their own share of the laughs. The romance plot is less dramatic than the baby's tale, sometimes slowing the action. However it's sweet & provides some fun dialogue. Sid is brilliant, his mini adventure a definite highlight. Diego's role is reduced, but still vital. He's especially funny with Sid. If you enjoy the Ice Age films, I also recommend The Land Before Time adventures.

","I have to admit, the first ""Ice Age"" wasn't very good in my book. In fact, I thought it was downright annoying. But in spite of that I thought ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" looked really funny and different, and because cartoon films are almost always amusing in some way. Which is why I saw it. This movie is so much better than the first; there were actually some hilarious scenes. And you'll know where they are as you bust your gut. <br/><br/>""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" takes place at the end of the Ice Age, hence the subtitle ""The Meltdown"". All the zany characters are back as they make for a boat to escape before a dam breaks letting loose an ocean of water. And yes, the squirrel rat is back and still trying to get his nut, which makes me frustrated at times, but is still funny. Poor nameless squirrel rat. <br/><br/>It amazes me how they can get such perfect voices for the characters. Especially John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth. One thing I wish they would've left out is two sea monsters that chase our heroes many times. It makes for some unnecessary peril when they could've been making jokes. The serious moments in the first ""Ice Age"" is one reason I didn't like it. They really cut back on peril in this one, but still not enough. Other than that, this cartoon is a knee slapper. Also, I think the move by Fox to call it ""The Meltdown"" instead of just ""Ice Age 2"" made it seem more of its own film than a stupid sequel. Same with calling it ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" instead of just ""X3"". And ""Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties"" instead of ""Garfield 2"", but don't even get me started on why they made a sequel to the poorly made first ""Garfield"". <br/><br/>""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is a great family film that will have even the hardest hearts managing a chuckle. I give it 8 out of 10. Rated PG for some mild language and innuendo."

","While not being anywhere on par with its predecessor, this sequel tries its best at being a separate entity from the original film, while still remaining true to its original roots.<br/><br/>Whereas the original was about 3 unconventional prehistoric animals teamed up to bring a little girl back to her family safely, this film is about those same animals fighting to survive during global warming, along with a few new characters. While the political agenda is almost blatant (global warming is bad!), the film still does not reek of being all about politics. The jokes are amusing in small doses, and some of the more adult fare does hit the mark pretty high, but a lot of the material included within the film is geared right at kids.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty good, albeit not as good as the original. Both do not pack anything but an entirely simple storyline, but here they added a lot of things going on in the background, from a fear of swimming, to a love story, to just random things Scrat is doing, that all of it ends up not flowing together in many sequences. The scenes are just kinda, there, and have zero substance to start, and only have a bit after it becomes more clearer why that scene is in it. The way-too-short run time affects this, in that all of it gets tied up in less than 90 minutes, and you just do not feel as satisfied as you could be with the final product. It's not a bad movie, but it's one that could have been better developed.<br/><br/>The original voice talent of Ramano, Leary and Leguizamo are back, and while Leary gets very little screen time, they all still have the chemistry that worked 4 years ago, and its enjoyable to see them redoing their roles again, and still being the same. The new talent, from Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as two wise-ass possums, to Jay Leno as a crazy panhandling turtle-thing, to Queen Latifah as a female mammoth, they all come off as pretty well-done. I'm getting a little sick of all the films Latifah has been in lately, but here's something where her obnoxious attitude and physical demeanor do not shine through into the role.<br/><br/>The CGI animation is clearly the standout of the film. While some scenes look hand-drawn (whether for effect, or just as crappy CGI), others are fantastic. Watching Manny in the water, and then seeing his soaked fur is a visual amazement for the eyes. And with all the trouble that Scrat (the trailer/poster boy of both films) gets into, it all turns into a visual feast. As said however, there are scenes that looked pretty horrible, and others that just did not seem quite as picture-esquire as the rest of the film. Another month or so in the animation department at Blue Sky probably could have fixed this.<br/><br/>A key problem I had was the fact that Scrat takes up about 15 minutes of the less than 90 minute movie, and most of his scenes are in the trailers. Like I understand that movies are given away in the trailers, but whole sequences? Isn't that just overdoing it a tiny bit? I realize the character's purpose and his design, but it just takes away even more from the final product.<br/><br/>Like so many sequels these days, Ice Age: The Meltdown is not perfect. While not being anywhere near as horribly half-baked as some recent sequels, this film does make a valiant attempt at being different and/or even better than the original film. It just does not to come to live to its fullest manageable potential by the end of the film.<br/><br/>But for a light laugh, I can't see why anyone wouldn't be able to enjoy it.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","When the valley where they live is threatened by the melt of the surrounding ice, the mammoth Manny, the sloth Sid and the saber-toothed tiger Diego advise the other animals to look for shelter outside the place. While escaping, the trio meets Ellie, a female mammoth that believes she is an opossum like her two mischievous brothers. Meanwhile, the squirrel Scrat tries to retrieve his walnut in the most unusual situations.<br/><br/>""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is a funny sequel of ""Ice Age"", with many hilarious situations. Again, the squirrel Scrat ""steals"" most of the scenes, recalling the MGM animated theatrical shorts cartoons of ""Tom & Jerry"" that I used to see in the matinées when I was a kid. The situation of Ellie, who is convinced that is an opossum, also made me laugh a lot.

","At least it wasn't bad to the point that I was angry I had paid money for it, and if anything, it means that I can now bash non-Pixar CG animated output without admitting that I haven't seen much of it. In fact, it was interesting to see what the formula for these megablockbusters is nowadays.<br/><br/>Of course there's celebrities, but some of them are so D-list that you wonder what the possible advantage of hiring them over actual voice actors really is. There's an attempt at wry humor, but it strikes one as ultimately revealing the failure of the writers to be as clever as they think they are. Sure there are some inspired bits, like the little critter chasing the acorn, but even that bit wears out by the end, and they tend to have no real connection to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The worst of it is, the animals here are just ugly! When I see something like this, I just think back to The Lion King and wonder how we managed to go so far backwards in terms of representing animated fauna. The plot is nonexistent; there's supposed to be some impending whatever, but mostly it's just a backdrop for some drawn-out, seen-it-all-before romance. It's really odd that this is what passes for entertainment, family or otherwise, nowadays."

","I love animation movies, so this one was still pretty OK. But I must say I don't really understand what everyone finds so great about this average sequel. I laughed a couple of times, those opossums are the most hilarious characters I've seen in a long time ( even better than the squirrel). <br/><br/>But main-characters Manni, Sid and especially Diego have lost sooo much of what they had in the first movie (Diego has become colorless and soft. He should be the protective part of the herd. And Sid used to be way funnier). They were more likely to bore me with what they did or said. The two dinosaur-meanies didn't have character either and were such a little threat, the makers could have left them out, for they couldn't have survived in the ice anyway. An alternative, non-good-vs-evil-plot with the melting ice as the main threat seems not enough. Many situations through the whole movie were not quite convincing and weren't nearly as exciting or funny as they were meant to be. All-in-all it felt like a rushed sequel for video or TV release just following a schedule that didn't left enough time to fill the holes between some really good parts. Those guys can do so much better, what happened??"
"tedg","Null","6","9","14 September 2008"," Two Paths
","Full feature animation has settled into two paths which will never again pass. One is the long form narrative which makes animated films no different than most other movies, real movies. The other is a collection of jokes. Now there are lots of non-animated movies that have adopted this strategy as well, but cartoon jokes have different rules. They are more extreme in situation and character, but they depend on an ordinariness and familiarity for their baseline.<br/><br/>Watching one of these hurts your soul, I am convinced, because it trains you to not actually notice the story, the ideas, the emotions. It hurts the whole world, because if we cannot see beyond the joke, the simple shot, we elect dummies. We marry for fun. We school to tests.<br/><br/>This should be boycotted. The entertainment value is so slight to be essentially naught. And the harm is significant.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

That is a huge improvement I'd say and I really liked their character designs. Probably strange but honest, I love the underlying ecological message most, which is the survival of the fittest.

It improved its weaknesses (better animation, characters looking more alive and emotional), kept its best parts (scrat running after all his acorns, great jokes between 3 mains) and added its own 'extras' (new characters, threatening situations, interesting sub-plots).<br/><br/>Ice Age 2 returns us to Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the sabre-tooth tiger who have now become firm friends. Their relationship's start to become strained when they discover that the ice is melting and begin a evacuation process, helping other animals get away. Although in the previous film Sid was portrayed as the weak character, the other two animals face their demons in a much more mature sequel. Diego is frightened of water and, more importantly, Manny believes he is the last of his species and is trying to come to terms with this. However, when Manny does discover a female mammoth (Queen Latifah) she thinks she is not a mammoth but a possum like her two younger 'brothers'. Although her ignorance can be incredibly annoying, it is used to good effect and becomes resolved fairly quickly. <br/><br/>Of course the brilliant Scrat the squirrel returns to find more acorns and once again fails to come out with any. He encounters piranhas and actually causes the original meltdown early on in the film. <br/><br/>Apart from the female mammal and her two possums, there are some fun new characters. We have Jay Leno's Fast Tony who tries to capitalise on the meltdown by selling survival equipment that obviously will never work and a 'lone ranger' vulture voiced by Arrested Development's Will Arnett who constantly reminds the group he will eat them if they don't escape the meltdown. There are also two ancient crocodile type characters that are constantly chasing the group and put them in fun and exciting action sequences and threatening situations.<br/><br/>Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is a near-complete sequel. It may be predictable throughout but not for its target audience. It ends on a heroic and bold note and what everyone wanted; Scrat having one more acorn adventure."

He's like the Steve Martin or Bill Murray of animated creatures, just watching him go about his everyday life is amusing to me.<br/><br/>They almost sleepwalk through this one and the introduction of the mammoth love interest signaled the death knell to the franchise, (putting kids in the third only hammered the nails in the coffin. See also Shrek 2 and 3) but it provides enough jokes along the way to cadge a few laughs, and I guess little kids might like the possums and their antics even if the adults tire quickly.<br/><br/>Ice Age 1 and 2 are basically road movies, the three animals must get from Point A at the start of the movie to Point B by the credits.

","Ice Age 2: The Meltdown: 5 out of 10: Global Warming comes to the Ice Age clan. Before you get any idea that this is An Inconvenient Cartoon keep in mind that global warming is presented as a fairly benevolent thing and by definition not man made (though with all the fart jokes I think Woolly Mammoth flatulence may be a contributing factor.) Political hot potatoes aside this is a very attractive and quite empty headed CGI cartoon.<br/><br/>The movie is drop dead gorgeous. The water effects alone are almost worth a view. The other highlight of Ice Age 2 is simply the finest English orphan vulture musical number ever put on film. Other than that the jokes seem kind of flat, the characters have no spark (Denis Leary's Saber Tooth tiger in particular seems neutered.), and there is some Noah's ark imagery that at best seems misplaced.<br/><br/>I'm sure the kids will love it and I have often felt the first Ice Age was under-appreciated compared to similar Pixar offerings. The sequel alas is a bunch of gags barely strung together with a go from point A to point B storyline occasionally interrupted by that scene stealing pre-historic squirrel, Scrat. Most of the gags are pleasant enough but, except for the ""vultural"" musical number, there is nothing inspired in the whole film."
"deathcoaster2003","10","2","2","8 May 2006"," Funny, Talented, Suspenseful
","Ice Age was a terrific movie against all odds. It not only covered all the basics, such as comedy and romance, but also little details such as several more scenes with Scrat than in the first Ice Age. I would say that the best part of Ice Age would be when Crash and Eddie were improvising lines that Ellie was telling them to say. Summarized, Ice Age 2 was about as good as the original, and that I've never seen a movie with so much comedy, love, and suspense piled into 91 minutes. It also had terrific lines at terrific times. I'd say that Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary did the best, although all of the other characters, such as Fast Tony and Crash and Eddie (Eddie played by Josh Peck, one of the best), did very well too. Cretaceous and Maelstrom were very well animated. In fact, all of the characters were well-animated. I think Ice Age: The Meltdown made a perfect blend of compassion, comedy, and surprising parts I have ever seen since ""Shrek"". I give total credit to Carlos Saldanha, the movie's director."

","SPOILERS- BIG TIME!!!<br/><br/>At first I wasn't all excited about seeing the film, but it definitely rocks. Ray as Manny sounds big time cute. How he struggles to talk to Ellie is even better. I really think Diego should have gotten a bigger role to play, but nevertheless, his villainous yet cute and friendly way of talking is admirable. Especially, in the end when he comments on how Sid is the gooey, sticky, stuff that holds them together...that was so cute. Sid is the usual sloth that tickles your funny bone all the way through. He's really good throughout the movie and keeps everyone interested. Ellie too is quite good. Her ""possum-days"" were very funny. The two possums are the best!!! They totally get you laughing your tonsils out. Scrat was very cute. Just watching his bushy tail makes you go all ""awwwwww!!""

","Ice is melting fast as our heroes (Manny, Sid and Diego) look to relocate and survive.

This sequel adds a few more characters and keeps everything interesting and fast-moving with quirky situations, high-paced action and unforgettable one-liners. Scrat (that lovable little guy who continues to go after that unobtainable acorn) dominates the action in an extended role as his adventures and misadventures coincide perfectly with the primary players. Still fewer things are cooler than this series. 5 stars out of 5."
"kooleshwar","9","2","2","26 April 2006"," Nearly flawless animated movie (PG) delivers its maximum potential.
","Starting with expectations I didn't really expect the world from this movie, just the same lovable characters (all the characters are back including some great new ones), a whole lot of PG rated jokes and maybe one or two really funny moments, peppered with a few emotional moments that are the staple of such films.<br/><br/>And this movie met every one of those expectations and in some cases even exceeded them.<br/><br/>Also this is ONE of the rare sequels that are as good if not better than the original and that in itself makes this movie extra special.<br/><br/>The animation of this movie is top notch and save for the fact that they make the fire and water too realistic in some scenes it had the perfect feel of a old fashioned cartoon film.<br/><br/>The acting is superb and besides the earlier characters this movie introduces 3 great characters namely a scamming armadillo (jay Leno at his best) and two over-smart possums. I didn't seem to care to much for Ellie the mammoth (queen latifah has become way to monotonous i knew it was her without even seeing the credits).<br/><br/>The background score of the film is great and certainly adds to beauty of this film.<br/><br/>The jokes are hilarious and extremely well thought of, with a liberal dose of jokes that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and a few select jokes that will seem funnier to adults. This is a great concept in modern films where some jokes are tailor made adults so they can find them much funnier.<br/><br/>Surprisingly this movie keeps you laughing throughout even though it doesn't have any scenes that will have you rolling out of your seats (thus lacks any scenes you can put your finger on a rarity in funny films).<br/><br/>The old fashioned concepts of love and brotherhood do make their expected appearances but they are short and sweet and fit brilliantly in the film. In fact they are explained mostly through humour and this makes this film a near perfect family entertainer(going with a girl is also not a bad idea as they seem to love such films).<br/><br/>A rare great sequel, a film that exceeds expectations and delivers to its maximum potential. This movie is an absolute must see."
"sol-","Null","2","2","19 April 2006"," My brief review of the film
","It is amazing how advanced animation has become. Not only are the animated sets in this film impressive, so are the facial expressions that the characters are able to have. The eyes of the animals tell a lot about them in the film, conveying their emotions in the same way that a human actor would in a live action film. So, the animation is superb in this sequel to 'Ice Age', however it unfortunately falls into the same trap of the first film - having a formulaic story and children's level jokes next to the visual delights. That said, it is generally funnier than the first film, but the story is noticeably thinner, and it is mostly worth watching only for the visual marvels and Scrat. The intercut sequences with Scrat are what works best in the film - he has the most interesting personality of all the characters. I would love to see a feature length film with just him in it."

","Run, the floods are coming! The earth is getting warmer, and everyone is having a good time in the pools that the melting ice is leaving, but they won't be having so much fun for the long. They live in a bowl, and the bowl is going to overflow with water when the sides of the bowl's burst.What can they do?Well this films about them trying to get to the top of the valley before the bowl fills up, hence the theme of the film.<br/><br/>A slightly boring film, i have to say, with jokes that have been made a million times before, such as, when the possum gets flung out of a tree singing 'I believe i can fly', and then crashes into a tree. Really cheesy, and soooo not funny.<br/><br/>This film has other sideline ongoing things while they are trying to get out of the valley, such as the sabre being afraid of water, and the wooly mammoth trying to find another wooly mammoth.<br/><br/>If you want my advice, buy this film if you think it would appeal to you.<br/><br/>Rating:6 stars."

If it weren't for those it would have been a complete waste of money. The female mammoth was absolutely crazy, she actually reminded me of my ex... maybe that is why I hated her so much. At times the things she would say would be so... I can't even describe it. I would recommend you seeing this, but only when you can rent it with other friends. Not only will it cost less for you all, but in the down parts you can entertain each other with a game of cards or by hitting each other. Don't spend more than 1 dollar to go see it."
"rockinradicalrooster","10","2","2","16 April 2006"," Simply wow! A must see! Animation classic!
","First off... Wow! What can I say! I was a huge fan of the first one, and hearing about a sequel i wasn't too sure, of course I wanted to see it, but I didn't quite know what I was expecting. I can now safely say though, that this is definitely one of my favourite films!<br/><br/>Why? Well I am a big fan of animation and comedy, and this film includes both. I thought Ice Age 1 was good with the high detail, good story line and high sense of humour, but Ice Age 2 is that and more! I always thought they should have included more about Scrat in the first one as he is quite a funny character, and I'm glad to say they did. I liked the way the film was set out by having a short part about Scrat's story every now and then. I will point out now however, if you haven't seen Ice Age 1 then it's a good idea to see that before this one; you will still find this film good and funny, but I think by seeing the first one you will understand the characters a lot easier. The story line is quite solid and flows nicely through out the film. The amount of comedy in the film is also constant, but is separated with the odd serious event which relates to the characters, especially between Manny and Ellie. I think this is good though, as if it were humour all the way through it might get boring, but by having a sense of serious story line incorporated into it helps to balance it out.<br/><br/>Overall though I absolutely loved this film! This was one of the only films I walked out of thinking 'I truly liked that and I definitely want it on DVD.' It fills all the boxes for me by having high quality animation and graphics, along with funny humour while still having a solid story line. This may seem like a kids film to a lot of people, but it is a family film, and you will be surprised how much comedy in the film older people will find funny. Overall though, it's an all round good film that I cannot fault!"

"rebeljenn","4","13","26","1 April 2006"," enjoyable and witty but poor story
","'Ice Age 2: The Meltdown' makes a good sequel, although no surprise that it is not as good as the original. The same characters are back, including the squirrel, and some new characters are introduced in the form of a comedic opposum duo and a naive wooly mammoth that thinks she is an opposum. The animals band together to escape from being drowned from the melting ice, and in this film, the enemies are less apparent: vultures waiting for them to die and two shark-like creatures that live in the water.<br/><br/>This film does have several hilarious moments and one-liners. However, the story is very weak. The film also goes quite slowly in some places but does not leave enough time for others. For example, after the small group of characters is first confronted with the under-water creature, they appear to be stuck in the lake of melted water without a way to get across because of the disturbances caused by the enemy. After this action, it cut directly to another scene. In general, there were a few areas that could have been cut or edited more because they moved quite slowly, and they did not add that much to the story. There was also a general good balance between the comedy and the story. The opposum duo could have been really annoying if they had done much more with them. That said, the characterization was done as well as it was in the first film.<br/><br/>The animation had improved from the first film. I was amazed that the fur looked like fur, and the fur actually looked wet. The underwater scenes looked believable as well as the water. The burst of water from the ice dam looked pretty good as well, and I am sure that it took a long time to get that to look right.<br/><br/>The lack of a good story brings this film down a bit, but the comedy makes up for it. It's still a film that children will enjoy, although it does not hold the same charm as the first film and is less memorable. I give it about an average score because it did make me laugh, it was enjoyable, and the animation was good, but it lacked a good story."

","Just in time for the end of the classes, ICE AGE 2: THE MELTDOWN starts out the summer season with such a sizzling meltdown of fun and laughter.<br/><br/>In this sequel of the highly successful and enjoyable animated comedy ""ICE AGE"", Manny the woolly mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger, along with Scrat the Rodent are back, continuing their adventurous life during the Earth's Ice Age. But this time, their little peace is alarmed when they found out that there is a big meltdown that is about to happen and that it may cause a catastrophic flood that can wipe them off the face of the Earth. In their journey to seek escape and survival, they meet Ellie, a female woolly mammoth who thinks she's a possum, along with her two ""brothers' Crash and Eddie, pesky little possums whose impish energy seems to energize the herd of characters in this movie.<br/><br/>A number of big shot celebrities lent their voices in this movie. Of course, Ray Romano as Manny, John Leguizamo as Sid, and Dennis Leary as Diego all returned to play their respective roles from the last movie. They are joined by Queen Latifah who voiced the character of Ellie, and Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as possums Crash and Eddie. In addition, comedian Will Arnett and late night talk show celebrity Jay Leno also lent their voices to supporting characters. The film is directed by Carlos Saldanha whose credits include animated features ""Robots"" and the first ""Ice Age"" movie.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see the theater packed with kids and families on a Wednesday evening screening. Then I realized that classes have already ended by this week and it sure is in synch with the opening of this family-friendly film. If one could feel the vibe of a wholesome crowd ready for some Ice Age fun on a Wednesday evening, I could imagine how much more on a weekend.<br/><br/>But to those whose funny bones are hard to reach, this sequel may not be as rib-tickling as the first one, but as much as Ice Age 2 may just be a clichéd-up chip off the old movie it sure is, at least, gives some satisfaction and a loud laugh off the film's target audience: the families. The theater where I watched this movie in would light up in the loud laughter of kids and parents alike. In addition, the storyline of the sequel seems inevitably important as a continuation of the first movie; just as the first movie tells of the coming of the Ice Age, the sequel tells its end, that is, when a meltdown occurs and the Earth is restored to its normal global climate. But as strict followers of science might argue that the actual Ice Age lasted for around more than a hundred years, what may be referred in the movie is what is known as an interglacial warming period.<br/><br/>As far as the character of the rodent Scrat would go, there's a whole lot of funnier antics, as this ""posterboy"" (or ""poster-rat"" as it may seem) of the Ice Age movie is still relentlessly pursuing that acorn that just always seems to slip off his grasp. The animation detail in this movie gets a step ahead with animated visuals like water, which is one thing that stands as a challenge to many animated projects. Many of the scenes that involve water and floods are spectacularly realistic to watch, as well as the fur in the woolly mammoths that also look amazingly realistic. The team of animators, along with Blue Sky Studios, the home of ""Ice Age,"" ""Robots,"" the Oscar-winning short ""Bunny,"" have done a great job with Ice Age 2. The music and sound effects were also buzzing with delightful energy. There is even a musical number with singing vultures that really knocked me out with laughter.<br/><br/>ICE AGE 2: THE MELTDOWN is enjoyable and hilarious. A real family treat just in time for the end of the school year and the opening of the summer vacation season. Definitely for kids of all ages."

","Conventional wisdom tells you to run from sequels... well, unless it is a sequel to an animated film like Toy Story. Conventional wisdom wins out with Ice Age 2. Now, before you think I am just not a fan of the franchise, let me say that I found the original Ice Age a very enjoyable film. This new one - not so much.<br/><br/>Dave said it best when he pointed out to me that the first one had two levels of humor - the 3rd grade stuff and the adult stuff. The silliness and hijinx of the characters was visually funny as well. In IA2 The Meltdown, all of the adult stuff is gone or comes much later in the movie. (I have to admit that I quit watching after about 20 minutes... I just couldn't bear it anymore.) The kiddy humor is intact, but it is not slapstick comedy or even good jokes, it is silly faces on creatures and quite possibly the worst writing I have seen in years. The writing team of Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow are the masterminds behind that classic of comedy - Black Knight (and thats the good stuff.) These guys suck too much to be called bad.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter how many high-profile, talented actors voice the words. When the words suck - the film sucks... and this one does."

","I don't get it. I really don't get it. The theater I went to was packed with about 600 20-somethings, all laughing their butts off with this bad-paced and pretty dull film.<br/><br/>Off course, it all starts with little Scrat, hunting his acorn as he did in the first flick. This time around, he gets plenty of screen time, and he more or less saves the film. I'll be the first to admit his various 3-minute long adventures throughout the movie completely ruin the pace of the film, but it were the only moments I could bring myself to laughter.<br/><br/>The rest of the film brings us Sid, Manny and Diego, who now are one big happy family. Once they notice the ice is starting to melt, they run for cover, an ark-shaped log, about 3 days away. During their road trip they meet Ellie, Crash and Eddie, find out that the tiger is afraid of water, have encounters with some vile sea-creatures, lots of mini-sloths, singing vultures, and more nonsense. The story has no direction whatsoever, yet happens to be predictable as hell, the jokes were terrible, the voicing awful, there was music during about 90% of the film, ... At the end I found myself bored, cranky, ready to make a scene, and wishing I had stayed at home.<br/><br/>Spare yourself the 1h30, rent the DVD in a few months, watch the Scrat parts, and fast forward trough the actual film. You'll laugh and be happy."

","I approached this movie with a hint of optimism. It had been a while since I had seen the first one, and anything with Ray Romano couldn't be all that bad, could it? Well, about 3 minutes into the film I found myself gnawing on my left hand to take away the pain.<br/><br/>I was so hopeful, like a small child on Christmas morning, but instead of receiving a cool toy, I got malaria. Now, I realize that this was intended to be a kid's movie, but not even the kids in the theater laughed at most of it. They tried desperately to appeal to the adults in the crowd (the ""wild ass"" bit being the prime example in my mind) and it just didn't work. I remember chuckling very quietly once, and that was when all the little Sids bowed down and copycatted him. That was mildly amusing.<br/><br/>The worst part of the entire movie was the girl mammoth's whole ""I'm a mammoth? What are you talking about?"" thing. If my mind hadn't already gone into shut-down mode to protect myself from the inanity of it all, I would've started restricting airflow to my brain to make the pain stop.<br/><br/>One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time."
"YaroMan","3","3","4","20 September 2007"," One one hand, entertaining... on the other hand...
","It should be obvious to most people who watch this movie that Chris Wedge didn't direct it. Unfortunately, the movie seems to suffer a tremendous loss in quality because of it. There were even portions to Ice Age 2 that seemed... well... absolutely pointless.<br/><br/>Ice Age: The Meltdown suffered from that same problem with story, but wound up making things worse. The pacing was too slow, and none of the characters, both old or new, seemed too concerned about the urgency of the end of their world (Rather, the world they had within that valley.) until the climax, and it seemed only to service the not-too-well-done love story between Manny and Ellie.<br/><br/>That brings me to the talent. I like Ray Romano. Some people I know dislike him for his voice, but I think the voice honestly plussed a mammoth character like Manny. In fact, the original cast from the first movie greatly agreed with me. They were nice to look at and knew how to actually do voice talent.<br/><br/>My beef was with the additions to the cast. Some things I like Queen Latifah in, but she doesn't fit at all in Ice Age: The Meltdown. What is worse is her method of performance, playing the species-confused mammoth, Ellie. Queen seems to really... overdo it, playing as if she's playing to an extremely young audience, which, in my experience, kills the interest even in the extremely young audience! The actors who played the possum twins Crash and Eddie weren't as bad, but they seemed to make the possums even more annoying than the scripted dialog ever made them before. And then Jay Leno, a talented comedian... who seemed to play an unlike salesman-schemer type of character. It just seemed... not-Leno to me.<br/><br/>That brings me to the next department: Characters and their development. Again, the old boys did me good. I wasn't disappointed, aside from them acting... so unlike they were in Ice Age 1. Manny is emotional and unhappy through most of the movie at the prospect of being the last mammoth, up until Ellie appears, then he turns into an over-done romantic comedy character not unlike what you would see in a dreaded Julia Roberts film. Diego was even more alarming. Instead of being the tough, direct, tough ""sentinel"" of the bizarre 'herd' we liked in the first movie, he turned into a teddy bear with a fear of water. Sid was Sid, though he did seem somewhat more intelligently developed than Ice Age 1, which is out of character for him. And I'm not so certain that Sid from the first movie would be so respect-driven.<br/><br/>The new characters get on my nerves, particularly the possums. They were not just annoying, they were so incredibly annoying that I wanted to skip past all the parts in which they had played, which was almost the entire movie. They accomplished little story-wise, aside from annoying the original characters and, to a more severe degree, the audience. Then there's Ellie. She wasn't as bad as her ""brothers"" but the idea of a mammoth thinking she is a possum is such an incredible stretch, since common sense combined with a good head on her shoulders would cause her to notice a few things:<br/><br/>1. She is much larger than her brothers. 2. She is much heavier than her brothers. 3. She looks nothing like her brothers. 4. She doesn't share the same anatomy as her brothers.<br/><br/>So, to me, the idea that Ellie would think she is a possum seems rather insulting to the intelligence of the audience, unless she is revealed to be mentally deficient in some manner, which doesn't even seem remotely apparent to me.<br/><br/>Scrat shines at his best. Long live Scrat. In fact, Scrat was the true hero of the movie, having actually saved the valley from totally annihilation at the climax. Though that wasn't his intention. That makes it even funnier to me.<br/><br/>The visual look is nice and stunning, though not to the Pixar extreme. But nobody has ever done CG movies comparable in quality to Pixar's own. But still, they accomplished major improvements to the first movie, though there were bits that still screamed out ""Computer Generated"" to anyone who is looking for it, especially one shot where a massive torrent of water begins flooding the valley. It looked to congealed and computer-driven to me.<br/><br/>There were too many sudden shifts in set. At one shot, they're suddenly walking on solid ground and the next thing the audience knows, they're dangling on a tenuous stack of rocks, trying not to die. It happens numerous times in the film, where things happen to terrain that are illogical at best.<br/><br/>Music is excellent. I like the song that the mini-sloth tribe chanted, though it was too short to allow me to get into it. The vultures musical number was good, but seemingly out of place. The rest of the music is pretty good. Not all the way up there with music that god me going like Finding Nemo or the Lion King, but most composers don't actually make the attempt at making emotional music with the melancholy. Sound is sound. Hard to mess it up if you are professionals.<br/><br/>The movie is saved from extinction by Scrat. And one wonders how much better this film would have been had Chris Wedge directed this one like he directed the original. A lot of the jokes, unless Scrat related, didn't amuse me, though there were a few jokes I enjoyed. There was also a few jokes and lines *massively* inappropriate for younger audience, and with a lack of story or interesting in-character characters, the movie won't be captivating adults, either."
"JWJanneck","4","3","4","17 May 2006"," I tried to like it, but failed.
","No, I did not like this one. I liked the first---it wasn't necessarily the best animated movie, both technically and otherwise, but it had likable characters, it had soul, and it had a rhythm. Its sequel still has the characters (although it adds some that I found difficult to care about), but the rest... It becomes rather preachy in a lot of places, and too many of the lines that were intended to be funny just bombed, sometimes due to bad timing, sometimes just because the humor is awkward and contrived. That hurt the rhythm of the movie, which kills a comedy.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the visual humor was up to the original. In fact, it had its best moments in the scenes with Scrat, the squirrel and its indefatigable chase for that elusive nut, which involved no dialog at all, but relied completely on the visuals, and the movement. That paradise scene is just absolutely hilarious, easy the funniest moment of the entire movie.<br/><br/>I seems as though Scrat occurs much more frequently in the Meltdown than in its predecessor---perhaps the makers realized that their strength was animated slapstick rather than story and dialog.<br/><br/>So, unfortunately, the sequel ends up being a number of very funny Scrat sequences interrupted by a mostly dull and occasionally outright annoying main storyline. I'd say that if you really liked the first, like I did, you will probably want to see The Meltdown nonetheless, just to have news from Manny, Sid, and Diego---and judging by the other comments here, there is a good chance you will like it.<br/><br/>It's just, I didn't."
"deanbivensnyc","5","3","4","1 May 2006"," Decent Kids Flick but adults beware...
","For a kids' flick, ""The Meltdown"" dabbles in death more than Marilyn Manson's diary. But when you're dealing with extinction, how can you not? Our adventure has our threesome trying to get to the other end of the valley where they live to avoid a big thaw that will have them looking like Leo DiCaprio in the waning moments of ""Titanic."" Along the way, each deals with their problems. Manny is afraid that he's the last mammoth alive, Sid is mad that no one respects him and Diego can't swim. In other words, it's kind of like the Tin Man, Lion and Scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz"" minus the flying monkeys and midgets sucking on lollipops.<br/><br/>Mixing fun show tunes, a wittier than expected script and a couple of compelling story lines, ""The Meltdown"" manages to build and impress throughout. Leguizamo's wispy voice work shows that creating compelling animated characters takes more than just placing a sitcom star in front of a Mic  yes, I'm looking at you, David Schwimmer. And Scrat, the ratty squirrel-like creature who just wants his nut, offers creative interludes that ring of Wyle E. Coyote.<br/><br/>Even sellout Queen Latifah, who voices a mammoth that thinks she's a opossum, manages not to ruin the flick  even though every time she speaks, you can't help but think it's a Pizza Hut commercial or a bad buddy movie. I probably would have been better staying home."

","Though not as classic or funny as the original Ice Age, Ice Age 2 is something you won't want to miss. Once again, we travel back in time to meet up with Manny, Diego, and Sid. As the title describes, the ice is melting and the whole valley is in danger of being flooded. All the creatures must migrate to a gigantic boat waiting on the other side of the valley to float them safely on the water.<br/><br/>The most popular character, Scrat, is back. The squirrel's muted attempts to retrieve his precious acorn from hilarious situations deserve some sort of award to the creativeness of the animators. The cute creature comes into frame every ten or twenty minutes, and the audience will laugh at his mere presence.<br/><br/>New characters include two possums and another female mammoth who has come under the impression that she herself is a possum. The two real possums work as a team to ensure mischief for the mismatched herd in Ice age 2. Sean William Scott and John Peck voice the two and manage to excellently portray the carelessness and silliness that will make you think back to the class clowns of your own middle school. Queen Latifah is Ellie, the mammoth-believed-too-be-possum, which our beloved Manny develops a crush on.<br/><br/>A few of the scenes are entertaining in that they look like Busby Berkly stepped in to direct them. The dancing and singing is intriguing rather than boring. Ice Age 2, thankfully, does not go the route of musical."

","I've also seen the first Ice age and wasn't expecting much at that time. I just went to the movies hoping to enjoy an animated movie that looked nice in the trailer. I was surprised to find very funny stuff, especially the Squirrel scenes. I left satisfied, with the sense that it was more than the usual Disney/pixar summer vacations Animation. In Ice Age 2 it was a completely different ballgame. I went there with high expectations; read stuff about it; and made sure I was in the theater at late hours to avoid the excess of restless children in the early sessions and made sure I watched the original English version. Well, it paid of! Even though the story is basic, there are certain movies where that just isn't the key point. The key point to this one is extremely funny goof situations, with the grandly expressive Squirrel making a starring appearance, but also the other (old/and new) characters becoming very strong in being funny and in keeping the rhythm of the movie. There were very, very funny situations throughout the film. Also, this film has something that I always find most important to animated movies, is not a ""Kid"" movie, it is perfectly directed to adult humor and taste, kinda like Shrek. On top of it all, the 3D effects are truly astonishing. If you want to laugh aloud, go watch Ice Age 2."

","At last, a comedy we can look back on and say...thats what our decade is all about! After the horrors such as 'Chicken Little' and 'Cheaper by the dozen' It seemed as if good kids movie's had been wiped forever. Well we were wrong! Ice age was a 'thawesome' movie. Ice Age 2 is even better. All the character, including some new ones, return for the sequel, where it seems the animals are getting on with their normal lives...that is until their wintery wonderland begins to melt...leading to the ultimate race against the clock! Can Manny, Syd, Ellie, Scrat and all our other Ice Age friends make it in time, or will they all perish in the melt-down? The storyline is actually pretty harrowing, however the non-stop humour and charisma of each of the characters makes this for an incredibly magical experience, for fans, kids and adults alike. We also see the return of Scrat, the half squirrel / half rat, who has a nack of getting into tight spaces on his perilous journey to chase that acorn! And of course, It wouldn't be ice age without Sid the sloth, who never fails to perform a good trick, making giddy kids jump up and down, and adults make a nice smile. And for once, this could actually be a part kid part adult movie, with a few 'adult' jokes causing a few smirks here and their. Whilst the kiddies may not get these jokes, there is enough colourful verses and phrases which will, indeed have them smiling.<br/><br/>To conclude, all i will say is, see this movie if you have kids. see it if you don't, because i can guarantee that you will enjoy it all the same. if you don't, then let me know. In the meantime, have fun, and get ready for the ICE AGE! (lol)"

","I found this movie to be dull, plain and simple. The characters were not interesting or engaging, the plot was lame, the danger to the characters was nonsensical. The movie creators seemed to want to make global warming extra-scary so they put in those 2 crocodile-like creatures, who appear now & then but don't really add up to much of a menace. I kept thinking there would be a twist on the plot to show that the saber-tooth tiger was the last of his species, instead of the woolly mammoth, but that never materialized either. I guess my problem with a movie like this is that I think of The Lion King as the gold standard. If The Lion King deserves a 10 (it does), this movie gets a 4. But having said all that, I have to also say that my 8-year old loved it, and I agree that the scrat sub-plot was entertaining. Without him, this movie certainly not be worth the price of admission."
"stargunner","3","5","9","7 April 2006"," Scrat easily upstages the prehistoric script of Ice Age 2
","The number one thing you will hear from people about this movie is, ""if it wasn't for that squirrel, it would have been a lot worse."" And they're absolutely right. Scrat is animated proof that dialog is not required to create entertainment. Yet somehow, Ice Age: The Meltdown forgets about it when its attention is diverted back to the main story, which is unappealing to begin with.<br/><br/>Like in Toy Story 2, new characters are introduced to the original pack of Manny, Sid and Diego, but they're one step away from total nut jobs and are generally not very likable characters. Supporting cast includes the other animals in the land, most of which are incredibly crude. This movie is chock-full of innuendo and incredibly distasteful dialog that no one from child to adult laughed at in the theater, and was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The reason why Scrat is everyone's favorite character, perhaps apart from the hilarious and innocent Sid, is because he never speaks, and the dialog in The Meltdown is abysmally poor. There where many parts where a bit of good animation to cue an emotion instead of shoddy dialog would have made this movie insurmountably more entertaining, enjoyable and a downright good film. Yet instead, lame jokes and corny dialog that has the audience's eyes rolling were furiously painted all over this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I would have enjoyed the story and new characters more if it wasn't for all of these circumstances. It seems as though a lot of absolutely stunning animation was put to waste due to B-movie humor and script writing. It's really ashame, because the animation team behind the Meltdown really know what they're doing. Unfortunately, the rest of the film really takes the backseat to the animation in The Meltdown.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone except very young children, or those who are simply interested in seeing some nice animation.<br/><br/>3/10"

The characters are strong, the dialogs are funny and to some extent sarcastic. A well written plot and a good story-line captivates the audience that wonders what could possibly follow... The interruptions of the plot (the sideline story about the ever greedy little squirrel) doesn't bother the viewer, it makes him relax, take a brake from the action, and have a good laugh.

It says something that both I and my son were bored by it. Halfway through, he started begging me to go home, so we left before it was over. The pace is too slow for a kids' film, and the story is too minimal for an adult to enjoy much. While the characters are pretty well done and the voice acting is good and appropriate, the characters aren't given a whole lot to do.

The movie was only about 90 minutes long, but every minute was excruciating.

"barnabyrudge","6","2","3","7 May 2006"," Enjoyable, near-identical sequel to Ice Age.
","The first Ice Age movie was pretty good - excellent animation, funny moments, slightly bland story - and it's virtually the same with this sequel. Many of the same actors return to provide the vocal work for their characters, with a few new voices this time around (like Queen Latifah as a VERY weird woolly mammoth). Just as in the first film, the voice acting is the thing that really makes the film entertaining, with John Leguizamo doing an especially good job as Sid the sloth. The animation is once again superb, but in all honesty the advances in technology over the past decade mean that ALL new animated movies look good (to praise the animators is almost as unnecessary as saying that cereals taste good with milk!) Once more, the storyline is the weak link in the overall scheme of things - it's just a very plain, straightforward tale of friendship and adventure, which passes the time servicably enough without ever reaching a level one might call outstanding.<br/><br/>Sid the sloth (voice of John Leguizamo), Manny the woolly mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) and Diego the sabre-tooth tiger (voice of Dennis Leary) are, at the start of the story, living in a walled valley. The weather has warmed up considerably since their first series of adventures, and the ice covering the world seems to be melting. The creatures living in the valley learn that the huge wall of ice next to their home will shortly melt and give way to a great sea of water that could quite possibly wash away them and their homeland. The only hope is for all the creatures to embark on a long trek to the other end of the valley, where a massive tree trunk shaped like an ark can be used to help them survive the imminent flood. During the journey, the creatures have numerous adventures including being pursued by shark-like predators. Manny also has to face up to the possibility that he may be the last of his species, for it has indeed been a long time since anyone saw another woolly mammoth.<br/><br/>Leguizamo makes all the best one-liners his own, in particular a brilliant moment where his character Sid utters: ""Gee tomorrow the flood's gonna come and we're all gonna die"".... then, having made this terrifying prophecy, falls to sleep a fraction of a second later! Sid also has a rib-tickingly funny scene where he is mistaken as a God, and gets his tribe of ""followers"" copying his every movement. The character Scrat is also back - you may remember him as the rodent perpetually trying to get hold of that elusive nut - and once more there are amusing slapstick gags involving his attempts to eat. The film, at 91 minutes, is of a very appropriate duration and doesn't outstay its welcome.<br/><br/>To summarise, if you liked Ice Age you'll like its sequel; if you didn't, you won't. They really are almost identical films in many aspects."

","Having survived the advancing ice in the first film, Manny, Sid and Diego face a new problem when a conman's warnings about an apocalyptic flood turn out to be true, as the ice walls around their valley are barely holding back a mass of water. Leading the animals to the other end of the valley in search of safety, Manny frets about being the last of his species, Sid worries about not being respected while Diego worries about his secret fear of water. On their way they meet Ellie  a large mammoth that offers Manny hope for the future  if only she didn't think that she was a possum like her ""brothers"" Crash and Eddie.<br/><br/>Although I thought Ice Age was an OK film I must admit that I assumed any sequel would be one of those ""no star voices"" affairs that go straight to video sale and wondered why they bothered to follow up such an unremarkable film. I still went to see it though but sadly I only found my fears confirmed by a film that is sporadically funny and lacks a good story to really engage. Like the first film, there aren't loads of film etc reference gags or really adult material so the pressure was really on the story to engage. Sadly it didn't and the main thread that involves the two mammoths was all a bit obvious and annoyingly sentimental. It doesn't help that the whole idea of Ellie being a possum and indeed her character, being irritating but even ignoring this the story is pretty obvious and slightly dull. The subplots are hardly there at all and, although Sid and Diego's parts are amusing, they contribute to the film feeling episodic and patchy. Scrat was the only reliable part of the film, producing the biggest laughs away from the plot, but he was relied on too much towards the end. It is a shame because the threat of the two fish monsters early on suggested that this would be a darker film with a real sense of urgency and peril  sadly this early promise was never delivered.<br/><br/>The voice cast are mostly solid enough but nobody has enough of a memorable or fun character to really lift the material. Romano is solid but he hasn't the depth to bring the script to life. Latifah has continued her quest to become the actress I would cross a busy road to avoid by turning in yet another obvious performance that grated on me from start to finish. OK so her material is weak but her delivery is poor and she had nothing of interest going on at all. Leguizamo is cut away from the main film but is still fun and gave a few laughs. Leary is so-so again, trading solely off his tough, dark voice but not having anything other than that to work with. Peck and Scott are both pretty weak and don't add much but smaller turns are generally amusing from Leno, Arnett and a few others. Director Saldanha seems unsure what he is trying to do and is a bit all over the place in terms of mood  being dark one moment and then far too light the next, producing long flat moments before suddenly producing an inspired musical moment with the vultures! Overall then a pretty disappointing film. It has just about enough in the asides to be amusing but the sum of its parts is sadly not much. Scrat is funny but the rest is far too hit and miss and the obvious main plot will find many bored - adults and kids alike. A so-so film that does enough to distract then, but in a genre where the standards have been consistently set high, Ice Age 2 just wasn't good enough to cut it for me."

","I give it a 5 because I was laughing so hard still but I thought that the story and plot were severely and extremely lacking. I didn't appreciate the double meaning swear word jokes with my 3 year old daughter. This one seemed a bit more...for mature audiences though kids will still like it for it's visual eye candy entertainment and occasional slap stick comedy. It seemed like we were seeing Scrats movie every five minutes. I also didn't think the villain characters were very dimensional. They looked evil and they were without anything said at all. Parts of the story were very predictable. But on the whole I rather enjoyed it. It had some very funny lines and parts to it that kept me going well through the movie."

","Seen the first only a few weeks before on the telly and I rushed at the chance to see the second - and it's a really good film! I saw some trailers for other films and there was one that had an ant with glasses on going 'Expecto Petronum' or something - funny.<br/><br/>As for the film, I don't think the plot is as strong as the last one, but the humour in this was increased with more of Scrat(hilarious), Ellie the mammoth, who thinks she's a possum(loved the voice-over done by Queen Latifah) and those two possums - Eddie and Crash - which are creations of comic genius! Kind of remind me of Timon and Pumbaa in a way, plus there was a lot of references to ""The Lion King"" and ""The Land Before Time"" in the film - or am I mistaken? This is actually my first ever CG animated film I've ever watched on the big screen(saw Toy Story on video) and a lot of time, when a character had a close up, it was like you could reach in and touch them! I longed to stroke Manny's fur. I do love when he says that his fur makes him look 'poofy' and not fat - great line.<br/><br/>I went to a 2:20 showing and there was a lot of little kids there, but thank God, I watched the film in peace and their comments amused me. A little boy kept saying: 'Mummy what's happening'? 'Mummy, did he die?' Mummy, what's that?', which I thought was very cute, aw. It didn't bother me too much anyway.<br/><br/>Scrat reminds me of those old Cayote and Roadrunner cartoons. He has the same running joke and it never gets old, kind of like Looney Tunes really.<br/><br/>The music in the credits(no, I didn't stay till the end, end) was catchy:)"

","This film is a good sequel, but it never quite reaches the cracking fun heights of its forebear. Our previous heroes are all there, along with a few new ones, but I didn't find myself bonding much to the new characters.<br/><br/>Scrat-the-Squirrel is as ever hilarious, but he's more obviously used as patched-in scenes to liven up the otherwise rather slow pace of the film. I felt that if you put all the Scrat sequences together you'd have an excellent short! Technically the graphics are very good, and it must have taken a deliberate effort to preserve the slightly dated style of the previous film. However, CPUs must have been humming to process every droplet as water splashes are clearly the big innovation for this movie.<br/><br/>Kids will love the film and burst out laughing at the slapstick humour, parents will sit through it painlessly enough, enjoying a few more subtle jokes, but overall Ice Age ""The Meltdown"" doesn't quite live up to the very high expectations of folk who've seen the first film."

They all go on an adventure together to escape the melting ice that is threatening to flood their homes. Along the way they face challenges, get to know each other and learn life lessons. In this fun and action-packed story there are some great themes such as overcoming fears, accepting each other's differences and building trust. Manny discovers he is not alone, and Ellie is confused about her identity. Diego plays the cool character while Sid is a comical personality, they all share experiences and form heart-warming friendships. In a sub-plot there is a squirrel who obsessively chases an acorn and gets himself into trouble in the funniest of ways. I would recommend watching this film that is suitable for all the family, thank you for reading."

","The original cast is back for another adventure. Although this film was good enough in its own right, it was unfortunately not as memorable as its predecessor.<br/><br/>The humor is not nearly as funny as the original, and more slapstick and cartoonish. There certainly is much to love about the film, but this installment is aimed at a younger demographic, with a very plain premise. The cute factor is gone, as well as the darker, deeper elements that made the first film so special and awesome. Some moments in the first film brought tears to my eyes, whereas this film never touched my senses in the same way.<br/><br/>The animation is still good and most of the characters are still lovable (especially Scrat!), but it didn't have the mature elements, deeming it purely a kid's movie. 'Ice Age 2' now also incorporates the age old boring subject they so love in films: love. The first film was about survival, action adventure and an instinctive call to do good. All of that and more is absent from this film. There are a lot more unnecessary characters here for the sake of comic relief, and most of these characters are more annoying than funny, like a Mammoth thinking she's actually a Possum!!"
"sterlinrivera-2000","8","1","1","7 May 2019"," A Worthy Sequel
","Ice Age: The Meltdown has some fun to it. It has great voice acting, a pretty good story, and this is when the animation of the Ice Age series gets really really good.<br/><br/>This one is where Manny, Sid, and Diego are back, and this time, an extreme heatwave is happening, which is causing all the ice to melt, thus going to be a flood due to them being in a valley that surrounded by big snow walls, which prevent them from escaping. However, there is a huge boat at the end of the enclosed valley can save them. So it's up to Manny, Sid, Diego, and all the other animals to make it to the boat and not drown. They also meet new characters, such as Ellie (Queen Latifah), a female mammoth that thinks she's a opossum because she has two opossum brothers, Crash (Sean William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck). Also, Scrat the clumsy squirrel is back and gets into more sticky situations involving his acorn.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty cool. Last time the three characters were trying to survive coldness, while this time they travel through a heatwave and survive the melting world they are in.<br/><br/>What I really like the most about this movie is the three main characters have their own conflict. Manny is fearing that he is the last mammoth alive, up until he finds Ellie. Sid is frustrated that he is not getting the respect he deserves, and hopes to find someone that can give him respect. Lastly, Diego has a terrible fear of the water and has to conquer that fear before it is too late.<br/><br/>Very good character development, great voice acting from the three main actors, as well as Latifah, Peck, and William Scott, a pretty good plot, and the best of all, the animation is a big improvement over the first movie's.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Ice Age: The Meltdown is an enjoyable sequel."
"eric262003","7","1","1","4 March 2019"," A Reflection ToThe Worries of Global Warming In Our Modern Era
","It seems that the only character who was able to maintain his character fresh while adding new dimensions was the sabre-toothed squirrel named Scrat (Chris Wedge). Sadly the other characters in ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" were placed in subplots and conflicts that was not up to par from the first installment. It's strange that after tens of thousands of years has past since the first installment of the series that most of the gang are still together, but I will suspend my disbelief being that it's an animated film or else I'll be scratching by head in puzzlement the whole way through.<br/><br/>In the opening scenes in this sequel, we find the acorn obsession Scrat who by way of default, is first to notice that the skies above and the landscape they inhabit looks very murky and that global change is only a motion away. Which makes sense as Scrat is wondering where's the oak tree was it that this elusive acorn fell from? As the squirrel is climbing an ice wall, the little critter almost plunges to his death, but is saved when his tongue gets stuck on the ice. As this is happening, the glacier starts melting as a stream of water comes pouring around it.<br/><br/>If your young ones weren't concerned about the effects of global warming, this film will surely make them more aware.Giant icebergs start falling into sea, water levels are at an all time high and the wildlife though the characters use their resourcefulness to prevent drowning, others are not so lucky. There's a saying within their confides that a hollow log is in the valley and if they can float on that log, they will make it to safety.<br/><br/>The characters from the previous film have managed to live together harmoniously though from a logical standpoint what do the carnivores do when it comes to their meals? Aside from the Scrat, we have the other mammals who have subplots, but they're not as focused as this global catastrophe that's going on right now. We have Manny the wholly mammoth (Ray Romano) who feels the like he's the last of his species until he meets Ellie (Queen Latifah) who might be able to help save their species if only Manny can convince her she's not a possum. She was adopted in a possum family and has two adopted brothers Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck). Then we have Diego the sabre-toothed tiger (Denis Leary) who's facing his fear of water and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) who gets crowned king of the sloths only thing is the sloths who crowned him want to throw him into a volcano. also in support are Fast Tony the Turtle (Jay Leno) and Lone Gunslinger the Vulture (Will Arnett).<br/><br/>Once we meet the characters and the ice shelf starts to melt, the adventures start to take off from there. The trek is long and dangerous as we see the thawing of two large carnivorous marine sea monsters that look they will evolve i into sharks. Plus there's a scene involving of an ice bridge that's on the brink of collapsing which was a nod to the bridge scene from ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>In the end, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", is nice to look at in terms of colours and details. The animals were interesting in terms of their interactions with each other and have provocative subplots (though not fully developed). The action runs at a quick pace. Though the kids might have a blast with this movie, the adults might enjoy it quite less. The first ""Ice Age"" movie shuffled the the characters like whirlwind, but in ""The Meltdown"", the characters were watered down quite a bit. Most of the film is about trying to co-exist in a world that's changing right in front of them. From a cartoon standpoint yes. And if global warming is to ensure they're adapting to warm weather and plenty more acorns for Scrat, then problem solved."

The animation is great, the action tantalizing, the storyline straight forward along with humorous lines. While not breaking much ground, this movie stands on its own for its entertainment value. The squirrel personally was too much over the top and in some ways a distraction. The use of musical interludes was quite interesting and different from other animated features that either focus on music or leave it out. The blended use of the music in this animated feature was smooth and discrete. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","Well, for starters, the title of the sequels at this point is pretty deceiving! But really, Ice Age 2 is a pretty decent follow up to the first film. Blue Sky studios definitely used the four year gap in between the two films to great achievement. And the same cast from the first film returns, unlike Disney sequels! The side story of Scrat is entertaining as well.<br/><br/>So, in this installment, the ice age is apparently ending. That brings a new problem to the warming panet, water and floods. The animals must migrate. It's a twist on the story of Noah's ark, a boat that the animals have only a few days to locate.<br/><br/>The cast seemed more comfortable in their roles, especially Ray Romano. Some of the jokes within the film are on the verge of adult though, such as when Manny tells the story of the little burrow. They use the term ""little ass"" in a sort of suggestive way. Just in case you have to explain that to your toddler!"

","The next part of the cute and comical series finds addition of more members in the herd family.

Sid is as always the glue of the herd but is not respected by others. He finds respect is a group of little Sloths who consider him as the fire Lord. He finally find respect but is sacrificed...huh...not killed....killing Sid is not that easy.
The encounters of Manny and the two Possum brothers (as protector of their sister) was interesting and amusing. The meltdown, an effect of the global warming was the deeper thought of the movie in relation to the current situation. 
Scrat is as always after the fruit. He plays an important part in the end when he saves the life of the herd by dividing the flooding water through cracking of the snow.

","The 2nd instalment in the Ice Age series does up the ante when it comes to Scrat's misadventures, introduces new characters into the lives of Manny, Sid & Diego without any friction, and adds more pre-historic animals into its list but it lacks the freshness of the original and is a slight deterioration in storytelling quality as well.<br/><br/>The story of Ice Age: The Meltdown continues the journey of Manny, Sid & Diego who embark on a new adventure after finding out that the ice age is nearing its end & with all the melting ice, a great flood is approaching. But on their way to a higher ground, they discover that Manny isn't really the only woolly mammoth left alive.<br/><br/>Directed by Carlos Saldanha, The Meltdown carries itself on the momentum provided by previous chapter and packs in enough moments of laughter to keep its audience amused for the most part. The arcs of recurring characters don't really evolve by a notable margin, the story itself follows a generic route & humour is a bit juvenile at times.<br/><br/>Scrat is still the best character in the movie and his endless pursuit of the prized acorn is a never- tiring concept that effortlessly provides the comic relief whenever needed. The voice cast of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo & Denis Leary is joined by Queen Latifah & Seann William Scott and all do a fine job at it & play their characters convincingly.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ice Age: The Meltdown applies the same formula that made its predecessor a refreshing delight yet ends up inferior in content and one reason for that is its inability to improve upon the shortcomings of the first film. However, despite not being as emotionally fulfilling as the original, it delivers on its promise of offering a fun-filled extravaganza."

They come across two mischievous opossums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), who are travelling with their 'sister' Ellie (Queen Latifah), a mammoth who believes that she is an opossum. Facing some hungry sea creatures, an army of mini-sloths who wants to sacrifice Sid (who they believe to be a fire God), and a temperamental volcano, the group must face physical perils, as well as their own company.<br/><br/>Following the mega-success of the first film, the first sequel (there are now four films all together) arrives with an increased budget and some much improved animation, and was naturally a huge success. It is a damning indictment of audience's thirst for originality, as The Meltdown is nothing more than a less-funny re-hash of the first film. The wafer- thin plot of the first is given a slight twist with the fact that they are escaping a massive world event, rather than returning a baby to some humans, but it is the same basic, threadbare story. Only this time, the ever-annoying Queen Latifah is on hand to give her trademark sass, and make me want to throw things at the screen.<br/><br/>That said, the film is as mindlessly entertaining as it predecessor, with Sid providing the majority of the laughs within the central plot, even though the focus seems to have moved to the less interesting Manny and his relationship with Ellie. But Scrat, the sabre-toothed squirrel that was highlight of the first film, is on hand again to provide some inspired animated physical comedy, as his endless quest to retrieve his acorn carries on, inadvertently getting caught up with the events around him.

","I just saw Ice Age The Meltdown yesterday on DVD, and to tell the truth, I really wasn't too impressed. The first Ice Age was a pure hilarious adventure with perfect humor and brilliant characters and plot. But when I heard they were making a sequel, I knew it couldn't be any good the first. Not wanting to waste my money on seeing it in theaters, I waited for the DVD and rented it from blockbuster. Anyway, I'm just glad I waited. It was exactly what I expected. The first film was fantastically funny. But the second was just stupidly silly. Sure, I will admit that there were some parts that made me laugh or smile (Scrat's still at the top of his game) but the general humor was just sort of dumb and childish (no offense to you youngsters). The whole thing seemed like just an excuse for the producers to make more money. It felt like drinking a can of generic brand root beer after downing a cold can of good 'ol A&W. Some of the new characters are a little corny (Fast Tony made me nearly vomit in my lap) and the dialogue was real cheesy. There are too many new concepts and too few hard core laughs. Nothing compared to the first. But hey, what can you expect? It's a sequel. Sequels are generally rather cheap and disappointing. People don't ever see them because they're good. They only ever see them because the original was so great. Frankly, I think it's a disgrace to the first Ice Age. In my mind, it's just another sequel."

I hope they will create part three. Unbelievable how PIXAR find the key for success with such movies when I think that 10 and more years ago Disney earned money with Bambi, the Jungle Book, Aladdin or Lion King and so.

I have a background in commercial art/computer graphics/animation, and I love full-length animated feature films because of the artistry, if not necessarily the story. The story here was a bit goofy in spots, but it was still delightful, holding me mostly rapt with the plot (even on the edge of my seat a few times), and completely swept away by the beauty of the way the artists rendered the smoke, steam, fire, water, and FUR! The animal fur (especially the anteater) was unbelievable! I love this movie! I'll probably go see it again and again, and I'm definitely adding it to my collection when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>A couple of things that bugged me - the whole sloth cult thing was pointless, and the singing vultures...that was just stupid.<br/><br/>All in all, though, I recommend it. Take the kids...they'll love it, and you'll appreciate the adult humor that shows up every now and then.<br/><br/>Enjoy"
"teo-sun","10","1","1","26 April 2006"," Fun, Fun, Fuuuun!!! :D
","This is truly one of the best computer graphic movie! It's funny, VERY funny! The gags here are even better than the ones in the first Shrek! All the characters are very well developed and in this second chapter, since we're all supposed to already know Diego, Manny and Sid, the movie tends to be more funny, focusing on the incredible situations of the incoming meltdown, and the great escape from the tsunami. We'll find again the prehistoric squirrel Scrat, that is now the copy of the famous Wile E. Coyote! You'll laugh your jaw off here, 'cause if the Coyote was funny trying to catch the Road Runner, Scrat is even more funny trying to grab his food!!! And he's going to be a real hero in this second episode...!! In conclusion this is a great movie, not only for children. Good time, good laughs! What else? :)"
"mrunnion","10","1","1","26 April 2006"," Excellent Must see Family Comedy of the year
","I didn't expect the second one to be funnier than the first. It was a breath of fresh air, new comedy lines, excellent actors that fit the scripts perfectly and made magic in this sequel. This movie takes you on twists and turns and makes you laugh from start to finish. Yes there is drama too, but it takes you through and teaches a couple of life's lessons along the way. Our trio is back and adding new members to their unusual herd. This movie is definitely a must see and one that we intend to add to our collection. It will be one of those movies that can make you laugh every time and you never get tired of hearing about it. I felt this was better and funnier than the first movie which is such a rare feat. Ice Age 2 has definitely captured our hearts and will always be thumbs up in my book."
"tomcat91468","9","1","1","25 April 2006"," Better than the first!
","We went to see Ice Age this weekend with a variety of family members ranging in age from 60 down to 7. As a family, we enjoyed the first Ice Age, and now, the second one we find even better. It held our interest throughout. There's something for every age group from the little ones all the way up to Grandma and Grandpa. The colors are very interesting and the animation is superb. Every hair on every back has a graceful nuance. The characters from the first rendition are all back. The most welcome cast member is the tenacious squirrel who has an integral part in the movie this time. Watch for the musical number ala Broadway sung by the vultures. All together a family movie."
"copperboom","7","1","1","24 April 2006"," Surprise
","I wasn't too excited when I found out we were going to see Ice Age 2 for my niece's birthday but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I saw the first Ice Age a while back and wasn't very impressed with it. I really can't even remember much of it. But luckily, you don't need to see the first one to understand and follow the second one.<br/><br/>The plot is basically that the ice is melting and the animals all have to get across the land to a boat that will save them from certain doom by flood. Meanwhile Manny is dealing with being the only mammoth left (excluding Ellie, the mammoth who thinks she's a possum), Diego is avoiding his fear of water and Sid is feeling like his ""tribe"" doesn't need him. There's a lot of humor that adults as well as kids could enjoy and the movie flows nicely. I have kind of a short attention span and I can't recall becoming bored during this movie. I particularly enjoyed the scene with mini sloths when they imitated Sid. I just found it entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall I'd say this movie is really good for kids, and pretty good for those who are kids at heart. I enjoyed it."
"andy_charnley23","10","1","1","22 April 2006"," Absolutely loved it
","I just went to see Ice Age 2 today and my god it is one of the best films I have seen this year it worked on all levels you felt for the characters even though you knew they wern't real! The story was great, the animation was spectacular and the characters old and new made the movie what it is, amazing. It is a film for everyone it has jokes for older and younger viewers, I can't stress enough how good this film is its better if you see the first one just to get to know the characters and story how they got there etc but I loved it from start to finish brilliant! I suggest you go out and see it a.s.a.p before it stops being shown at the cinemas and you have to wait for it to come out on DVD although its worth the wait I wouldn't want to wait for such a heart warming family film."
"davidhicks-1","8","1","1","22 April 2006"," This is Fantastic!
","Any fans of the first Ice Age film will not be disappointed. In fact this film is better than the original. It is hilarious from start to finish. The film includes the main 3 characters from the first movie, these being Sid, Manny and Diego, and we get some new great characters who are funny, including Ellie and her 'brother' possums. All of the characters in this film are funny, my favourite being Sid. The film is basically about the threat of the animals being in danger over the ice meltdown. So they have to find away to survive the meltdown. The other focus in the film is on Manny, as he believes to be the last of his species. Another great feature about this film is that one of the funniest characters in the first Ice Age, Scrat, gets given a bigger role and we see him more often in this film. Ice Age 2 is a great film which I would definitely recommend. It is fantastic!"
"swiss09","10","1","1","22 April 2006"," I am still laughing
","If you need the movie that will make laugh for weeks this is the one.I'm not saying that the movie is perfect, but it is great fun for anyone who understand ""their"" sense of humor! ""Acting"" was almost like in 1st part but we now have Q.Latifah,Josh Peck,S.W.Scott & Jay Leno(?!?!) Jokes are not good,jokes were excellent!For example take Sid: His finally becoming something but no thats Sid he gotta ruin everything!When I see that sloths face I get laugh attack!And the part when Scrat ""spins"" the ice...(see it for yourself you'll die of laughing) There are just few mistakes in the film:When Diego says something like That is like a MINE field!For his info they are in post ICE AGE! When you look it overall it is a GREAT movie!"
"Sparrowmaniac","8","1","1","21 April 2006"," The race for survival
","Meltdown turned out to be quite the way it should have. The director made it look very similar to the original Ice Age. Last time they had to battle the cold blizzards to get a human baby to safety. THis time around they are saving their own behinds. The ice is melting and they have to get out of the bowl shaped valley in order to survive.<br/><br/>In the mean time Manfred(a.k.a Manny) is reminded by Sid that he is the last remaining mammoth. But to his disbelief he finds out another mammoth, a female, who thinks that she is a possum. Somehow this misguided ""possom"" realizes her true identity, and tehy risk everything to get out of the valley. Again like last time, we have the annoying yet hilarious nut seeking creature, and like last time around, the movie ends just wen our little friend has finally got his claim on his prized possession, he is rudely taken away.<br/><br/>Its a gala of a movie, a total screamer and will keep your sides aching long after the movie... a well deserved 8/10..."

","I have young children between the ages of five and nine. They got bored with it halfway through and my four year old was scared of the monster -crocodiles.It was a little intimidating. The animation though was very nice. The squirrel trying to get the nut was a little to wild e coyote for me though. I was relieved when it was over. I thought it was too long in some parts.My older child thought it was lame and wanted to leave halfway through but we stuck it out to the end. There were some cute scenes though but overall, I would not buy the DVD. It was the type of animated film that will be gathering dust in some child's movie collection."

Ice age 2 is a well done sequel."
"EmperorNortonII","8","1","1","16 April 2006"," Pre-History Marches On
","The popular characters of ""Ice Age,"" Sid, Manny, Diego and Scrat, are back in the sequel ""Ice Age: The Meltdown."" In this installment, the Ice Age is coming to an end as the great glaciers melt. But Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) isn't as worried about flooding as he is about becoming extinct. That's when he meets female mammoth Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah). The movie displays the breathtaking visuals of the original ""Ice Age."" The story is not quite as good, though. Some things were corny, like the scene with the vultures' musical number that spoofs ""Oliver!"" But the comic antics of Scrat always satisfy. The sequel to ""Ice Age"" does not quite match the original, but it's still worth watching."
"nobbytatoes","7","1","1","13 April 2006"," an entertaining watch, one of the better sequeals
","The ice age is nearing its end. Global warming is heating everything up, melting the ice that has kept the rising water back. As our three companions; Manny, Sid and Deigo realise the valley is about to become the new sea floor, they set across the land to find higher ground. Though the rising water isn't their only problem, Manny believes he's the last mammoth alive. After Sid and Deigo encounter two possums; Crash and Eddie, they soon find another mammoth, Ellie; only problem is she thinks she's a possum too.<br/><br/>The first Ice Age was a welcome change in computer animation, with Pixar ruling over the area. Ice Age: The Meltdown, follows same suit, not really changing the formula around, only with the human characters taken out. This sequel doesn't really pull out many punches with the laughs, it plods along at a steady pace, yet keeps the jokes at a constant pace, so it doesn't fall flat; even if the jokes aren't ultimately that funny.<br/><br/>Still the funniest of all is Scrat, still on a never-ending quest for his unattainable acorn. Scrat is much like the Wyle Coyote to his acorn Road Runner. No matter how hard he tries, it never ends happy. In this respect it becomes a redundant situation; yet it's such a farce and still the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>Reprising the roles, Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary are still perfect. Adding to the voice talent, Queen Latifah as the confused mammoth/possum Ellie, Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as the energetic possums Crash and Eddie. Will Arnett is great as the Lone Vulture stalking the animals and Jay Leno as the con-turtle Fast Tony.<br/><br/>Just shy of the first Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown is one of the better sequels, not trying to make everything bigger and better, just an entertaining watch."
"skyryderz-1","10","1","1","13 April 2006"," Ekthelent
","This movie lived up to the standard created by the original Ice Age, and kept the humour coming.<br/><br/>The old characters, and of course the new ones interacted well and the clips of Scrat chasing his acorn were inserted just at the right times. I liked the way that new characters are introduced to the viewer, some of the extra characters were almost as funny as the regulars. The storyline and the animation are fantastic, and some of the scenes had me wobbling in my seat, especially the vultures singing Food Glorious Food, and the sloths Fire king sequence.<br/><br/>I couldn't guess many of the outcomes of the situations, and so I found myself guessing time and again what would happen. I suggest that you don't read any of the hype, or see any of the trailers, just go along to your local cinema and watch it, just don't forget your chuckle muscles, though, you'll need them"
"rkeaney","6","5","12","1 April 2006"," Good but not great
","OK after reading brilliant reviews and watching the hilarious trailers i thought that i was in for a treat in ways i was but this movie is in sad fact another of those sequels that don't live up to their originals, e.g.(Oceans 12& Shanghai Knights, although not nearly as bad as those). Don't get me wrong this movie has moments of brilliance but i felt that the jokes were too far between it just didn't have the great storyline as the first although the plot is great.Sid was hilarious,Scrat still as funny as ever as he's still on his quest to get that bloody nut,Diego still good, the tough guy with a heart of gold that we grew to love in the original and Manny who i din't mind in this movie but was better in the first.We meet three new faces a female mammoth and two mischievous possums.<br/><br/>We start off pretty much where the original ended Manny(Ray Romano),Diego(Denis Leary) and Sid(John Legizamo) live happily in the valley when all of a sudden they realize that the ice is melting and when it does their bowl shape valley will fill up with water frighteningly fast, they begin to flee the valley in search for a boat that is at the end of the valley.Amidst all this Manny has come to realize that he is the only mammoth in the valley and that maybe his species are getting extinct.When all of a sudden Manny and the others stumble into a duo of mischievous possums who lead them to another mammoth(Queen Latifah). Manny is delighted until he realizes that this particular mammoth thinks its a possum.<br/><br/>The animation has improved greatly from the original.This is filled with laughs.Wise words from the delightful Sid and slapstick humour from Scrat this is a funny movie.You maybe disappointed if you expect this to live up to sequels such as Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2.Nevertheless i recommend that you see it and form your own opinion.<br/><br/>I give this movie 6/10 as i was quite disappointed with too many characters that you don't get to learn enough about to form a complete opinion."
"rjslick","7","4","9","1 April 2006"," Get some writers, Blue Sky
","I'd give it a 10 for animation<br/><br/>an 8 for characterization<br/><br/>a 9 for voice acting<br/><br/>but about a 3 (as in pages) for story.<br/><br/>There simply is no story. The first one had a fairly minimal ""road movie"" plot with our three couldn't-be-more-different heroes threatening to split apart at any given time. This one has the impending danger of a flood causing our now-thoroughly-friends guys out on another journey to a ""boat."" Some of the scenes (musical & dance numbers) are flat out hilarious, but they need to find a way to get us from one to another. Kids won't notice the lack of plot as much as adults of course, but I'd bet they won't be watching this one as much on DVD as they do the 1st. It just doesn't hold the attention as well.<br/><br/>Still, it's a lot more watchable than the Wild, which is our other big budget CGI cartoon of the month."
"elscorcho10101","4","3","6","14 April 2006"," I'm Reviewing This As A Film, Not A ""Kid's Movie""
","I'm sure that the majority of people who are voting on here and who viewed the film are either young children or the parents of young children. I'm not here to criticize you or to act like this movie was anything more than it was supposed to be: a sequel to a kid's movie.<br/><br/>With that said, the film is far inferior (as expected with sequels, especially of this nature) to the original. The original was a cool concept (honest to God no pun intended) with a great cast of characters and a very tight, easy to follow plot for children. Not that kids need a plot really. This film had more characters than could possibly fit in such a simple film and to be honest many of them were annoying. Really annoying.<br/><br/>As expected, the acorn-hungry rat (his name escapes me) makes a return. This time, thankfully, he gets more screen time and many times becomes the comic relief in between sleep-inducing doses of the substanceless plot.<br/><br/>Reread the first paragraph again if needed.<br/><br/>One thing that startled me about this film was the somewhat out of place grim moments (in as close as a scary movie moment as a film like this can have, a turtlesque creature is devoured while going for an innocent swim) and the low brow sex humor between Manny and Ellie. There isn't really a purpose in trying to tie in adult themes to this sort of movie. The adults are going anyway because kids don't go to movies by themselves. Is there really a point in having two talking mammoths get into a debate about sex? Are you serious? So to sum up: obviously an uninspired attempt to mooch more cash off of the profits of the original Ice Age. As long as 3d talking animals are making money, there will continue to be more films that include them.<br/><br/>Go if you have kids or if you LOVED the original. Otherwise, just download the parts with the acorn and the rat."
"TheMovieMark","5","3","6","7 April 2006"," Sure, it looks pretty, but where's the ""wow"" factor?
","Ice Age: The Meltdown is a perfect example of the kind of movie I hate to review. No matter what I say, it's going to make approximately $1 billion on opening weekend, so what's the point? Plus, a lot of my readers are guys who are only interested in movies where at least 42 people get shot or Adam Sandler talks in a funny voice and makes sounds that have no grammatical basis. The day they go to see Ice Age: The Meltdown is the day Rob Schneider gets nominated for an Oscar, which would most likely also be the day I vow to stop watching movies completely.<br/><br/>So writing this review is nothing more than an exercise in futility. If you enjoyed the original then you'll go see this follow-up no matter how harsh I am. If you hated the original then even my softest, most poetic words would be hard-pressed to convince you this was worth your time or money. So you know what? Go with your gut on this one; I really don't care either way.<br/><br/>I never saw Ice Age so I can't compare the two. All I know is that this installment, while cute and pleasant enough, has no real ""wow"" factor. Sure, it looks nice and is fairly harmless, but it tries just a little too hard to cater to the smallest of children while leaving most adults a little alienated. The problem is that the writers at Pixar have mastered the fine art of being clever enough to appeal equally to both children and adults (think Toy Story and The Incredibles). Everybody else (yes, this means you, Ice Age) is just a distant contender with a flair for pretty graphics rather than sharp storytelling.<br/><br/>I heard somebody on the radio refer to Ice Age 2 as ""better than Toy Story."" As Teaspoon Hunter might say, ""Cow pies."" Not even close. You can sell that some place else, Sam Cain, because Emma ain't buyin' it (sorry, a little Young Riders (buy the DVD!) reference for you).<br/><br/>Now if I had been hired to work on the movie then I would've titled it Ice Age: The Final Countdown. At the end of the movie CGI versions of the members of Europe would have shown up and all the prehistoric animals would have jammed to their undeserved hit The Final Countdown. That would've been some sweet action, and you know it. Just picture CGI versions of the bandmates' bad 80s hairdos. Talk about a missed opportunity."
"Electricbassguy","6","6","17","1 April 2006"," Mildly Disappointed
","Ice Age 2 wasn't bad, but I guess I expected more out of it. I tend to enjoy almost any CGI film, and Toy Story 2 is probably one of my favorite films ever.<br/><br/>However, I've never seen the first Ice Age which may have impacted my opinion on its successor. The characters were unfamiliar to me, except for Scrat the squirrel which I have seen for almost half a year now through constant advertising.<br/><br/>Scratt was easily the best part of the film, his little chase of the acorns worked quite well and meshed in well with the plot near the end.<br/><br/>But the rest of the cast wasn't quite as enjoyable, although I liked Sid and could personally relate to how he never got any respect from his friends and companions.<br/><br/>Diego was funny and sarcastic, though I felt he didn't get enough screen time. The mammoths were trying too hard to be sweet and did not work out very well. Part of this has to do with the unavoidable fact that Queen Latifah is loud and annoying in human form or animal form. I've never understood the appeal of her ""attitude"" and never will.<br/><br/>The plot itself was rather thin. Basically, the animals had to make it to some alleged boat before the whole island flooded due to global warming.<br/><br/>I just thought the movie wasn't funny enough, but at least it acknowledges climate change."

"rogerdob","3","7","23","31 March 2006"," A real lightweight
","There's really nothing much to this film. Very little story, very little excitement, very little humor. It's not a horrible film but it's just not that great. This time, because the ice is melting, the animals have to worry about a flood killing them and they have to find a safe place---that's the whole story. On the way to the safe place the animals experience various bouts with danger. There is also a subplot about Manny (Ray Ramano) thinking he might be the last of his species left.<br/><br/>One of the really big problems I had with this film was the celebrity voices used. When Manny speaks, it is REALLY hard to disassociate him from the Ray Romano character on Everyone Loves Raymond. And the same thing applies to Queen Latifah's voice---she's QUEEN LATIFAH!"
"Scandinavian-Viking","3","2","4","21 May 2006"," It's funny but what did it ad to the first one?
","A rerun on the first one would just be as inspiring. My son was so disappointed, he has seen the first movie 10 times or more. Maybe his expectations where to high. At least he learned that number two on a theme rarely has anything to add to the first one, it's only to make someone rich without to much effort.It's a shame that it's notorious in the business to try to make a success twice or thrice on the same theme. Do you think that it added enough money to get the rich guys to make a third one? I'm afraid so. We parents have seen so many samples of this through the years. The Jungle book.....Leathel weapon..... Was this film really a contribution to the art or ?"
"Miguel_Melo","6","2","4","18 April 2006"," Not nearly as much fun as the first one
","As much as I was surprised by how little most people like the original ""Ice Age"" I must say I am even more impressed with how much praise this second instalment is getting. While it is not a bad film in any sense, and the rendering quality has clearly improved, the whole thing just seems too uninspired, painting-by-numbers stuff: A lot of the time I feel I was just going through the motions, while the three main characters went from A to B with nothing much going on. On the original Ice Age there was a fair bit of tension between them: Diego seemed not to be trustworthy as he had a hidden and dangerous agenda, Sid was reluctantly tolerated by the other two while Manny's sorrow could only be understood towards the end. Now in The Meltdown, they seem to all be happy with each other and therefore there's no spark there. Help to liven up the proceedings could come from outside characters, but sadly, the baby from the first film is immensely more charismatic and endearing than Ellie and her two ""brothers"" put together. Also our heroes' nemesis' are, due their own nature and without giving anything away, very limited in character so you never feel threatened by them. Scrat again provides a few good laughs but since it is a one trick pony, seems to have run its course now. And sadly, there is no Dodo-like scene on this one to make me laugh so hard as to cry like the last one. OK film, but don't expect too much"
"Charlievamp2","10","2","4","13 April 2006"," Superb Sequel
","After watching both Ice Age's back to back I found it difficult to decide which one was the best movie. Unlike most sequels, this one rocked and in no way disappointed its audience. The new characters added a breath of fresh air into the plot and ensured that EVERYONE in the cinema fell into fits of giggles. (baring in mind that in a cinema full of people there were only 2 children under the age of 15!) This movie was almost certainly more humorous than its predecessor, partly due to scrat being given a more prominent role. It's impossible to get tired of the little mite's antics, the entire storyline is full of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Watch out for the ending- you'll be in for a shock!!! This film is fantastic, a must see for anyone who enjoyed the first instalment."
"ftbru","8","2","4","9 April 2006"," Good Movie, but...
","I thought this was a very good movie that I enjoyed with my 4 year old, but... The only problem I had with it was the language and innuendos. Yes, the PG rating warned of that, however it is a cartoon and maybe we need to let the movie producers know that we don't have to have foul language and sexual innuendos to make a movie good. I was luckily able to change the subject when the topic of ""breeding"" came up. If you don't mind your young children repeating the foul language, and if you are ready to talk about sex with them, take your little ones. If you aren't ready for these things, take your older kids. (The theater I was in was full of the 5 and under age group) Otherwise, the actors did a fantastic job, the plot was good, and the animation was great."
"jpkwolf","8","2","4","6 April 2006"," Good sequel
","I was a fan of the first Ice Age movie so I was looking forward to the sequel. I'm glad to say the sequel doesn't disappoint. The cast of the first movie return, some new friends are found that are good additions to the group. In the sequel more room is given to the antics of Scrat who the audience loves. The movies main plot is that the Ice Age is over and Sid, Manny and Diego must leave where they live as the ice is melting and causing a huge flood. Maybe not as funny and heart warming as the first movie but it comes very close and Scrat is truly on fire in this one. As a whole I really enjoyed the movie and want to see it again. I also loved the drawings during the end credits."
"nolarobert","10","2","4","2 April 2006"," Why do critics hate Ice Age so much?
","There are many critics' reviews I have read about Ice Age: The meltdown that were highly critical and dismissive of this movie. As an adult (38) who saw this film on its opening weekend, all I can say in response is hogwash. This was a highly enjoyable story with likable characters in a visually stimulating animated film.<br/><br/>Obviously Mannie Mammoth gets more focus in this film with the usual ongoing comic commentary provided by his sidekick Sid the Sloth. The real victim in this sequel is any important story points or action for Diego except for his one major fear. I did find that part of the story lacking but this lull was easily made up for by the rest of the plot. I plan to go see this movie again at the theater and then I'll add the DVD release to my collection to be a companion to the first Ice Age DVD set. This is a great film for children of all ages (8-80).<br/><br/>Knowing how well Scrat was received by fans of the first Ice Age, Scrat gets even more acorn action in this sequel. I began to feel bad for the poor Saber-tooth Squirrel but you have to admit he is a shining example of perseverance. His voyage to the great beyond for his eternal reward and resulting interference by Sid was absolutely fantastic and hysterically funny. I went out today and bought my Scrat ""Goin Nutz Scrat"" Interactive Electronic toy. He now has an honored place in my bedroom next to my model of the Starship Enterprise. Who knows when Scrat may want to join Starfleet to find the Planet of Eternal Nuts in the Acorn Nebulae."

If the team want to make it better,they really should delete the plot at the beginning of the movie which a bunch of cubs of prehistoric animals are playing and the foolish sloth are talking something silly.

"dilipbts","10","0","0","29 April 2020"," Ice age: the meltdown
","Highly enjoyable film. Nary a dull moment as Diego, Sid and Manny find their way through the meltdown. The peril found in the first Ice Age movie was not duplicated here. The danger wasn't as imminent due to the fact that the meltdown is partly a blessing, while the ice age itself was all bad. A subtle flaw but not something the creators could avoid unless they wanted to make a ""Mid-Ice Age"" movie. How the tribe survived multiple thousands of years is not addressed, but who cares? Maybe they were actually living on the ecuator in the first movie and the ice caps just reached them in the final years of the ice age. A decade later, the climate warms up and causes the mixed emotions found in Ice Age II. The central theme of friendship in spite of differences and the humor found in trying situations plays well. Overcominging fears in the face of danger is a prominent theme. Jokes fly fast and furious for all ages. And the proto-squirrel steals our hearts with his absolute devotion to caching acorns. A strong production for Twentieth Century Fox."

"johnnyboyz","5","0","0","11 December 2011"," Speaking of Ice Ages, this is often glacial; what was quite charming has evolved into a bit of a carefree slog in which we cannot get involved.
","A thaw is the chief threat to the lead characters in Ice Age: The Meltdown, the unfunny sequel to an original film from four years earlier which transported furry, anthropomorphic animated creatures of a bygone century back to a time when ice and snow blanketed the world and the issue of evolution seemingly didn't exist. Where there is a literal thaw within that of the film, there is a parallel one of exterior nature seeing the whole idea of these somewhat likable little characters and their adventures coming to wear rather thin – the film striking us as an exercise in looking to feed off recent glories by churning out sequels and sit on a soap box in the process. The error of the film's ways is in its removing of everything that made 2002's Ice Age fun; primarily, its character dynamics and its hybridising of an era set thousands and thousands of years ago with the modern-day. Here and now, there is very little wit to ""Meltdown""; a film about characters making this huge trek across snowy wildernesses as this impending item of doom and destruction threatens them, and yet rarely feeling like anybody is actually going anywhere at all. Toss in a really meekly handled global warming message, designed to attune the kids to such an issue, but coming off as heavy handled; some annoying supporting characters and the fact that all of Ice Age's own ingenuity and charm has been stripped away from this project, and you have a fairly lacklustre computer animation which goes on for too long without engaging.<br/><br/>The film begins with its characters in a pleasant enough place: a neat little Utopia built upon the icy plains of whatever stretch of land this is further-still tucked away in a makeshift corner which sports all you need to generally be able to relax in life. Located therein is Sid the sloth, voiced again by that of John Leguizamo whom, as it was in the first, provides Sid with the lispy and goofy verbal tones required to have us easily take to him. He runs what can only be described as a summer camp; a place for the tots of this world to come and play and swim and listen to stories told by that of the supervisors. Also there are Diego (Leary) and Manfred (Romano); Diego being the sabre-tooth tiger whose plight in the first it was which made him change from being the cold-hearted predator killer and into, well, someone whom still eats meat, we assume, but never his good friends the sloth or the mammoth. Manfred is that mammoth, and after some brief beginnings which feign as if to set up a different movie entirely more broadly linked to Sid's inability to communicate with the opposite sex; failure to establish order as the governing force of his workplace and the still-lacklustre levels of respect he has from his peers, we veer off and away down a route encompassing Manfred and his problems.<br/><br/>But that comes a little later. First, there is a vulture and the ultimatum he offers to those located within this little zone. Principally, they all have three days to pack up and ship out, for that large cliff face-come-glacier behind them acting as a shield to anything and everything beyond it is beginning to melt out of a collective warming. The vulture warns them because he doesn't like wet food; their trek across the planet to find somewhere safer and away from the soon-to-be incoming wave of has-been ice block a journey he and his buddies hope will see them perish. Premise in mind, and a rounded deadline of three days one would assume that crafty vulture has specifically waited to unload unto them, the animals take the plunge and head off; thus kicking into gear one of the more sporadic and less involving animated pieces from recent years.<br/><br/>Granted, there is something funny about a descendant from a squirrel named Scrat constantly chasing a nut – the likes of which rely on the physicality of the situation and the character's own flexibility. We are aware he cannot ever obtain the nut and the fact he often falls flat on his face in trying to retrieve it is second to how he goes about doing it. The pleasure one derives, although really ought not, from these skits leaves the rest of the film as unenjoyable as it is; a series of interludes relying on escapes from precarious situations and situational comedic content involving characters voiced by the likes of Queen Latifah (anybody who calls themselves ""Queen"" Latifah is practically asking to be ignored) to see it home. Examples of the magisterial levels of wit buried within Gerry Swallow and Peter Gaulke's screenplay arrive in the form of a whole pack of vultures doing an Oliver Twist number as well as a routine involving eccentric, pint-sized would-be desert island tribal creatures doing dances and such evoking the Eric Darnell movie from barely a year previously, in Madagascar.<br/><br/>The film becomes Manfred's, and an internal/existential crisis through which he journeys to do with whether there is much point to carrying on if he is the sole mammoth left. Of course it turns out he isn't, but for time-limit's sake, it'll take some time to convince this newfound mammoth that they are what Manfred tells them they are – cue some rather risqué, and often out of place, gags about first dates and how far down the line heterosexual relationships need to be before whatever. The first Ice Age was a difficult film to dislike, ""The Meltdown"" is a very easy film to not take to at all; hollow praise aside that is ""does"" whatever ""job"" it needs to in order to quench entertainment driven thirsts of families encompassing that of young children, this first Ice Age sequel is just disappointing."

"TheUnknown837-1","7","0","0","17 November 2009"," ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is aimed more for children, but it does have appeal for older audience members and in its own way, it's just as enjoyable as the first film
","In the further adventures of Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the tiger, the ice age is over and upcoming is, as the title says, ""the meltdown."" The plot: global warming is causing all the ice in the valley where Manny, Sid, Diego, and a great many others are residing. The rising water levels is causing an ice dam to weaken and threaten the animals with a flash flood. While travelling to the other end of the valley where a mysterious ark is supposed to be waiting for them, Manny and his chums run into a female mammoth (voice by Queen Latifah) who has been raised by possums and has thus grown up under the idea that she's a possum herself. And while they travel in hopes of escaping the flood, we follow the further and more interesting adventures of Scrat the squirrel and his strive to rescue his acorn.<br/><br/>As with the first film, Scrat is the most interesting thing in the movie. And this time around, the audience wants a little more of Scrat and a little less of the main characters. Every moment with Scrat is a little gem that never fails to raise an uproar of laughter. But nevertheless, when we do follow the main characters and the new ones, we are kept generally interested because things keep moving along. The romantic interest between Manny and Ellie the species-confused mammoth is worked to the point where we want it to, without it becoming too sappy or time-consuming, but playing its part as well. The two daredevil possums voiced by Josh Peck and Seann William Scott are a great addition to the cast, including their fantastic opening where they outwit Diego and Sid, leaving Diego to say ""If anybody asksthere were fifty of them!"" There's also a great new supporting character, a vulture with the manner of an Old West gunslinger who glides over the characters as they travel for the ark that could save their lives. There is only one question I have concerning the plot: Diego, even though he's left his pack, what exactly does he eat now that he'd been accepted into the herd? Go vegetarian? Good a guess as any, I suppose.<br/><br/>Now if there is one thing that I do miss from the first ""Ice Age"", it's that wonderful heart-warming feeling that literally brought tears to my eyes in the first film. This time around, the movie's more or less about jokes than moving moments. It's focused a little more for the younger generation, but is not too kiddy to make it unappealing to older viewers. In its own way, it's just as enjoyable as the first film and a lot more so the third."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","15 November 2009"," An unsurprisingly inferior sequel, but overall, another good quality CGI effort
","Blue Sky Studios, a computer animation studio, made their feature-length debut with the hit movie, ""Ice Age"", in 2002. Four years later, and one year after the studio had brought us their follow-up, ""Robots"", they released the first ""Ice Age"" sequel, entitled ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"". I remember hearing of this sequel probably around the time it came into theatres, and was aware of the existence of its predecessor by then, but had never seen it. Now there's a third ""Ice Age"" film out, but I've finally just seen the first two for the first time this month. The original is very good, and I wasn't expecting this first sequel to quite match it, which it doesn't, but I've seen worse sequels. At least this one wasn't inferior enough to really disappoint me.<br/><br/>Manny, Sid, and Diego now live together in a valley, where many other animals also live. However, they soon discover that the ice around them is rapidly melting, threatening to flood the valley! The animals that live here are told by a vulture that there is a boat on the other end of the valley, so they set out on a journey across to make it to this boat before it's too late. The mammoth, sloth, and saber-toothed tiger set out together as Manny wonders if he is the only remaining member of his species. He soon learns that he is not, when he meets female mammoth named Ellie along the way, but for some reason, she thinks she is a possum! She and her two rowdy ""brothers,"" Crash and Eddie (who really are possums), join the trio on their quest for survival, adding to the unlikely herd. Conflict amongst the six of them ensues as they make their way across together, and danger increases as more water comes through the glaciers! <br/><br/>There are more flaws here than there are in the original. The new members in the herd (Ellie, Crash, and Eddie), don't do the film as many favours as the original three do. Ellie thinking she's a possum gets a little too silly at times (though it may sometimes be mildly amusing), and Crash and Eddie's antics generally aren't that funny. However, the original characters haven't lost anything from the first ""Ice Age"" movie, and that includes Sid, who is still goofy and funny, like he was from the start. The arguments Manny and Ellie have can also be comic highlights. Scrat, the ""saber-toothed squirrel,"" is back in this sequel, once again having constant trouble with his acorn, bringing more physical humour to the film. The jokes may not be as consistent in quality as the ones in the original, but there are still a good number of really funny ones. Not only is this film often funny, it gets exciting, especially during the great climax, and it sometimes gets rather poignant with Manny and Ellie's relationship.<br/><br/>This sequel pretty much has everything the original has – stunning animation, humorous characters and conflict, poignancy, suspenseful action, and some good voice acting (once again with Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary as the three stars). Not much makes it inferior, other than the three new characters, and just maybe a BIT more lagging. Other than that, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is another entertaining CGI family film, just like its predecessor, despite the occasional mild swearing and sexual innuendos, which are the reasons for the PG rating (not the same reason for the PG rating of the original), like many other modern-day family movies. I can't join those who say this sequel is a great film and better than its predecessor, but if you like the original, you could also find a lot to like here, so I would say it's worth a look."

","My Take: More elaborate than the original, and even better. <br/><br/>ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN is one of those rare instances that a sequel is better than the original, for being something sequels are usually criticized for: being bigger. THE MELTDOWN gives us exactly what sequels promise: more characters, bigger spectacle, add just plain more goodies that its predecessor. But the result is actually successful. While the more adult-oriented comedy might turn off its adult audiences, THE MELTDOWN has more characters, superior animation and even a slightly better story than the first (I did say slightly!). After discovering that the ice caps covering their peaceful valley is starting to thaw, the herd of animals must make their way across the valley to a wooden ""ark"" that would save them from the flooding water. On the other hand, Manny (voiced by Ray Romano), Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) and Diego (voiced by Denis Leary) meets the meek Ellie (voiced by Queen Latifah), a female Mammoth who thinks she's a possum (striped rodent-like critters, likes to do Fear Factor-esquire stunts).<br/><br/>But what really steals the show is the interludes featuring the one and only Scrat, perhaps the real star in the original film, who is given much more to do here. Like midget version of Wile E. Coyote, little Scrat gets into more mischief, more trouble than he already had in the first film. Other than trying to bury his precious acorn, he either a.) tries to steal it back from a school of needle-teethed piranha or b.) snatch it from a persistent Condor chick. As a matter of fact, these little interludes save us from the feeble parts of the story. The Mammoth love-story is way too childish for a Mammoth that's voiced by Ray Romano or Queen Latifah (or in this case both). Some of the humor doesn't quite tickle your funny bone if your beyond, perhaps, the age of 10. But ICE AGE: THE MELTDOWN, despite its shortcomings, is a surprisingly elaborate and more entertaining film than the first. And, once again, watch out for that Scrat! <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

"arc_a2007","5","0","0","6 September 2008"," Doesn't compare to the original
","I was really disappointed by this sequel. First thing's first, Scrat has a lot more screen time here. That wouldn't be so bad if his scenes weren't so clichéd. The trouble he keeps getting into is predictable, as are his reactions. Really, furry animals doing kung fu stopped being funny a dozen movies ago. Also, in the first movie his scenes were integrated into the main plot. Here, there just tacked on between scenes. Now, on to the main portion of this steamy crap sandwich.<br/><br/>I knew that adding characters for a sequel was inevitable, but I guess no one told these guys when to stop. There are crapwads of new characters here, many of them just ugly to look at (especially those turtle-like things, eccch). They tried to make the kids cute but they just come off as horribly disfigured warts that look like they've been tied up in a sack and beaten with an ugly stick. What's even worse though is the flat character design inherent in all of the characters... Well, except for the possum brothers. They're more convincing in character design and personality. But then again, they're supporting roles. The new lead role goes to a female mammoth who's convinced she's a possum. I don't know what they were smoking to come up with that idea, but it just doesn't work. <br/><br/>As for the plot, it can be summed up in one abbreviation: WTF?! It was a good idea to take cues from the first movie and get Manny hooked up with a girl, but there's little time to develop their relationship. What really sucks though, is that the turning point in this conflict (they hate each other in the beginning) comes out of nowhere with no explanation. But that's still not as detestable as the volcano scene, which is basically one big dumb joke with a predictable punchline. It comes out of nowhere, goes on for a few minutes and then heads back to the main plot like nothing ever happened. The jokes here have taken a decidedly adult turn as well. Someone must've really thought the ""wipe your... face"" joke from Shrek was clever, because they've got that kind of humor in droves here. The first time this happens it's quite funny, but it fails to hit the mark again.<br/><br/>Overall though, Ice Age: the Meltdown should be seen only by huge fans of the first, and only for completeness. With a better, more focused plot it could've been much more enjoyable."

","I just read badidosh's post and i thought it was pretty accurate for the most part, except for one thing- he mentions that ice age 2 features more and more scenes of Scrat because the plot itself is too weak and short, and that his futile chase of the acorn is irrelevant to the plot. Well, let's not forget that near the end, when the valley's about to flood, right after Manny frees Ellie the whole gang sits atop a quickly sinking rock, then Sid goes ""we're gonna die!"", meanwhile scrat climbs up a huge glacier with his acorn, he punches enough holes into the glacier so that it splits in two, letting all the water out of the valley, which is what saved Manny and the gang from drowning. So I'd say the whole Scrat-and-the-acorn deal is very much relevant, because it turns out that the annoying little racoon actually saves everyone in the end, he ends up being the hero. without his elusive acorn, of course. Also, his in-between scenes serve as well-timed intermissions from the rest of the characters."

It's just a hair above above average and the ideal audience is young children.<br/><br/>This movie is about a group of animals (essentially those from the first movie) journeying towards a reputed ""boat"" from a coming meltdown - one that will drown them with a flood of water.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie was the animation and scenery. It was spectacular - the backgrounds, water, creatures in the water and the ways the white and blue colors were intermixed for ice and water were very well done.<br/><br/>One the minus side were a host of things. First, making Queen Latifah the voice of a female mammoth didn't work well (at least for me) - I felt I'd rather go extinct if I were the last male mammoth on earth.<br/><br/>The endearing squirrel and acorn return, but the scenes this time are excruciatingly long and ridiculous - probably fun for children though.<br/><br/>The story / journey itself was just not that interesting this time around; it really felt plodding and slow. Finally, the Biblical references were hugely obvious and made me wonder for a moment if this was I was watching something religion-inspired. I don't think so - but it gave me pause.<br/><br/>I think this is a great movie for young children. The higher in age you go, the less you'll like it - but I think most will still find something to like."

You have to see him/it to believe it! :o) <br/><br/>But they also knew, that they had to bring new characters in the mix here or else they would have bored (= repeat the first part) some/many people!

","""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is a pleasant, if somewhat lackadaisical, follow-up to the animated hit, ""Ice Age,"" from 2002. In a plot vaguely reminiscent of ""Dinosaurs,"" a group of prehistoric animals flees to higher ground when a melting glacier caused by global warming threatens to flood the valley in which they live. The returning characters include Manfred, the woolly mammoth; Diego, the saber-tooth tiger; and Sid, the wisecracking sloth. New to the cast is Ellie, a female mammoth who has somehow come to think that she is, in reality, a possum, and who provides a romantic interest for the generally stoic Manfred. Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo and Queen Latifah provide the voices for these characters.<br/><br/>Oddly, despite the extreme urgency of the situation, the animals spend more of their time just moseying along - falling in love and discussing the issues of the day - than squaring off against the various dangers that confront them. Still, there are enough straightforward action scenes to keep the young ones captivated and enough double entendres and ""in"" joke pop culture references to keep the older folk entertained as well. As with most sequels, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" lacks the freshness of the original, but the animation has a clean, uncluttered look that fits well with the starkness of the setting. The one bona fide musical sequence is an amusing ode to the glories of feasting on prey, done to the tune ""Food, Glorious Food"" from ""Oliver!"" As animated movies go, ""The Meltdown"" is nothing to write home about, but it makes for passable viewing even if you aren't exactly its target audience."

","A highly enjoyable film. Very similar to the Ice Age. The main character - Manny the Mammoth, Syd the Sloth, and Diego the Sabretooth Tiger making their out of the great valley before the flood is come. On the way that they were escaping, lot of funny things happened. There are new elements that the Ice Age hasn't. Love, Manny met Ellie, a female Mammoth. They finally fall in love at the end of the film. Also, many new characters were created in this film. They were all very funny and make me laugh until the movie end. The sound effects are so good and the graphics are not bad too, but still room for improvement. Looking forward for the Ice Age 3."

"general-melchett","8","0","0","16 February 2007"," A fun sequel and one of 2006's better animated films.
","Ice Age 2 was less than universally acclaimed, but it's done bloody well for itself otherwise - grossing over $600 million at the box office. The animation is better than in the first Ice Age - with lusher textures and richer colours. Manny the mammoth is back with his smaller friends - and so is Scrat with that damned acorn. The plot is cheap and cheerful, the humour is as you'd expect - laugh out loud in parts, mildly amusing in parts and also bad in parts, and there are some life-risking escapades to give the animated film the dark and epic side it requires in parts. These are easily resolved as you'd expect, but there are three reasons why this film is something enjoyable rather than something we've heard and seen a thousand times before: <br/><br/>1. Ellie the mammoth. She is one of the film's new main characters and brings along another bunch of small pests to follow along with Manny and his crew. The fact she thinks she's a possum isn't that funny and we know from the start that a love interest between her and Manny will develop, but things are helped when we learn more about where Ellie came from. Who can honestly say they weren't touched when they saw the little mammoth freezing in the snow? This also helps to explain why she thinks she's a possum and how she met her friends. To be honest, a flashback isn't the most original way to reveal character, but this film is an animation, and that's exactly nothing different either. And as long as we can give a damn about the characters, I'm easy.<br/><br/>2. Scrat the squirrel. Kids always enjoy watching him try to rescue his beloved acorn whilst getting into a number of humorous (yet unrealistic) escapades. It's also nice to see how his scenes happen completely separately from the actual plot itself and shows a bit of inner child within the filmmakers. He's just there for the sake of it, really, but he's interesting. And even though he gets a bit annoying and predictable after a while, the kids like him anyway and we all come to associate him with Ice Age in the end.<br/><br/>3. The conclusion. It's nice to see some imagination and thoughtfulness was put into this. Manny having to make difficult choices was captured very well, and though it really is just sentimental mush, at least we've come to care a bit more about these characters on their journey. And the ending with Scrat was funny and imaginative as well - even if it wasn't exactly genius, it kept me amused, and the two stories of Scrat and the main characters actually did intertwine at the very end. And a good conclusion is what every film needs. Ice Age 2 had one. And it also opens the door for a third film. I hope there'll be one. After all, all franchises work best in trilogies. Haven't we learnt that over the past ten years...<br/><br/>Ice Age 2 deserves to be called a success - it is often very funny and turns an originally dull and derived plot into a film that will satisfy most nippers, even if not as many adults. There is little for the older generation and no meat on its actual subject matter - global warming - but this is a kid's film, and the kids loved it. And that's all that matters. 8/10"
"stevemgreen","7","0","0","9 February 2007"," Thinly disguised Bible story
","I enjoyed this film. It is funny, and the CGI is so good you stop looking at it almost immediately and just see the characters and their world.<br/><br/>Several major plot devices are straight from the Bible. The ""great flood"". The exodus out of the valley. The ""boat"" - can anyone say ""Noah's Ark""? All the animals in pairs. The Scrat character cleaving the ice in two to drain the valley. ""Moses"" anybody? Scrat is also seen floating in a basket much like the story of Baby Moses. The golden gates amongst the clouds in ""Acorn Heaven"". Even though the heavenly acorn in the clouds did look very Monty Pythonesque.<br/><br/>The music is also used to reinforce these biblical moments. The ones that stand out are when ""Noah's Ark"" is launched, when Scrat ""parts the ice"" and when Scrat is in ""Acorn Heaven"". All these scenes are accompanied by angelic choral singing no doubt designed to impart a sense of awe and reverence. You can almost see Charlton Heston (Moses) in the Ten Commandments, standing with outstretched arms parting the Red Sea during the ice-parting scene.<br/><br/>And what was that bizarre sideline story of Sid being sacrificed to the fire god about? Anti-pagan religious brainwashing perhaps? Thou shalt not worship false idols.<br/><br/>I was surprised that one of the minor characters actually died. But this fits well with Scrat's ""near-death"" experience later on. Being largely aimed at a younger audience, the not-so-subtle subtext is that when you die you go to heaven, and there will be acorns. Heaven is a lot better than being down here if we can judge by Scrat's reaction to being revived by Sid. Scrat spent his whole life in a quest for acorns, and in the end only found them in death. Scrat is really the main character since he underpins this central message."

","""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Carlos Saldanha <br/><br/>Starring: Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Queen Latifah, Will Arnett, Chris Wedge, & Jay Leno <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG"" (for some mild language and innuendo) <br/><br/>In 2002, an animated film premiered to pleasant reviews and an even nicer box-office. It told the story of a saber-toothed tiger, a mammoth, and a sloth who find a lost infant and try to return him to his tribe. This movie was called ""Ice Age"" (titled according to the fact that the movie was set during the Ice Age). It is one of my favorite of my favorite animated movies of the past decade and was a genius blend of kid-friendly humor and parent-oriented humor (Notice: I said ""parent"", not ""adult""). It was the type of movie that families could sit don and enjoy together without kids being bored or parents feeling guilty. I knew that it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made and I was awaiting a second installment with eager anticipation. That sequel is ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" and I simply could not wait to see it. But the question I am here to answer is: did ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" live up to the good name of its predecessoror did this movie follow the typical ""The Sequel Is Never As Good As The Original"" formula? <br/><br/>Manny (voiced by Romano), Diego (voiced by Leary), and Sid (voiced by Leguizamo) are back! They have all settled comfortably into their new, uneventful lives and everything is going very well for them. However, the Ice Age is coming to a close and the ice everywhere is starting to melt--an event that will spell certain doom for the valley in which they now reside. The friends must band together once again to escape the valley and make their way to a ""boat"" on the complete opposite side that will carry them to safety. On their way, they encounter many friends and foes, including the very friendly mammoth, Ellie (voiced by Latifah), who thinks that she is a possum, and her actual possum ""brothers"", Crash (voiced by Scott) and Eddie (voiced by Peck). But, there biggest enemy is not the coming wave of waterbut two vicious water creatures that will do anything to make our characters a new meal. All the time, the squirrel, Scrat (voiced by Wedge) tries to ineffectually regain his beloved acorn.<br/><br/>""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" was greeted with a lukewarm reception by critics. The majority of critics enjoyed it, but there were many that simply ignored it, banning it ""just another lame sequel"". How could this be? Could this be? Could this much-awaited sequel not be worth all of the anticipation? I, never being one to rely much on critics in general, still was looking forward to get the chance to see this. And I am glad that I did not listen to the critics who to skip this. ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is exactly what I expected when I thought of a sequel to ""Ice Age"". It doesn't surpass the original, but it doesn't fall below the original either. It is on the same level. ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is a worthy sequel, engaging and utterly delightful for all ages. This is a must-see for all fans of the original. If only all sequels could be this good.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", there were a few problems. First and foremost, I did not like the fact that the movie ignored the ending of the original. You know the ending that featured Scrat frozen solid on a tropical island thousands of years later only to thaw and again begin searching for his acorn. ""The Meltdown"" just disregarded that scene altogether. I think it would have been very interesting to have the final scene in this movie somehow lead into that film--you know, seeing Scrat get frozen, etc. On top of that, I thought that some of the more sexually-oriented innuendos were a little too much. They could have been toned down just a tad. But, I still had a blast with ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"". It isn't the best animated movie of the year, but it definitely falls into my top five. If you haven't seen it yet, whether you are a fan of the original or not, then I suggest you check it out as soon as possible, especially if you have a family. This is a family movie that should not be missed.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" met my expectation and is a very nice family movie.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)"

","I can't think of an animation that I've seen that I thought was down right terrible. ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is not going to be the first in that category, but it ranks low amongst animations. The story was very lackluster and didn't provide for much excitement at all. They were journeying from one part of the valley to another to avoid a flood, big deal!! I'd say the most excitement they encountered until the end was the ordeal with the carnivorous fish. The flood at the end provided some brief exciting drama and then it was over rather quickly. And that darned squirrel was annoying. Seeing that squirrel chase down that acorn reminded me why I never liked Roadrunner cartoons.<br/><br/>Besides that, I didn't care much for the voice of Anthony Romano. Romano is so dry and boring (maybe that is what they were going for). Queen Latifah as a voice was fine, it was just the character that was absurd. John Leguizamo as a voice was fine, except that as much as he was supposed to be the comic relief... he was not.<br/><br/>In the end it was an animation, it was somewhat humorous, and my daughter liked it, so I can't be too hard on it."

","This time around the three we grew to love in ""Ice Age"" come back just like the warm weather. New adventures and personal challenges await these three as they deal with the coming meltdown.<br/><br/>All the same creativity is present in this story, but I found the story to be a bit thin. The squirrel (Scrat) makes many appearances which may have been used as filler. But since this character is such a charm to watch as he seeks his true love - the acorn - it is hardly a distraction but stands out as its own story line.<br/><br/>Along the way new characters are introduced, including a female. In my opinion this usually ruins the original intent of the first movie. Fortunately this did not happen - although the strength of the first one is diminished by the introduction of a romantic theme. However, it is still in line with keeping this second story true and honest to its original heart-felt content. I was very happy to see no ""pc"" correctness was imposed for social or economic reasons but instead just a plain old good piece of movie entertainment - similar to the first one.<br/><br/>So apart from the thinness of the principle story (brought about by the requirement of a romantic theme) I gave this a 7 out of 10 (Not as good as the first one but still entertaining. If you could watch only one, then I recommend watching the first one over and over again.)<br/><br/>-LD<br/><br/>______________________________________________<br/><br/>my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/"

Apart from a terrific final few scenes, the film is often poor and focuses upon the character's personal issues rather than the bigger scale. There is no question about the animation which is simply sensational but in this current time where animations are being made every week the effects are easily forgotten by the unmoving unfunny plot.<br/><br/>There are many scenes which create enjoyment, especially through the acorn obsessed Scrat and the final conclusion to the film is engaging.<br/><br/>Ice Age 1.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this sequel fails to live up to the brilliance of the humorous slick first. With Ice Age 1 audiences always felt a familiarity and attachment to the narrative and the characters where as its sequel tries to hard to gain attachment by having more serious issues revolving around them e.g. Manny's depression at being the last of a species.<br/><br/>The jokes from the first were amazing from all characters. However apart from Scrat (who also loses a bit of himself here) every joke is plain, predictable and does not conform sufficiently to the story.<br/><br/>i recommend the first ice age and to leave this one alone"

","Being a very interested fan of the first ""Ice Age"" film, I wasn't entirely expecting a sequel, but when I had heard it was coming to the movies, I had high hopes that were met well by this movie. The plot is easily recognized if you happen to be a science buff (I am and thus got a kick out of this film) then you will recognize the things shown. As the ice age is coming to its close very gradually, the animals of the era (there were some more kinds of animals added to this film) are enjoying themselves as they slide down the naturally occurring water slides and pools, but three animals, Manny, Sid, and Diego notice that the ice is melting and thanks to some help persuading, manage to get the masses of antediluvian beasties marching on towards safety. As they are on their way, Manny meets another mammoth, though this one has some confusion as to what creature she truly is. She and her adoptive opossum brothers join out heroes in their quest to escape the great deluge, and hit some big issues within on another along the way. But what of the silly little Scrat? Well, he is shown to have his own little conflicts in this film, which make for fine half-time shows betwixt the other animals' antics. While this film did not quite have the charm nor the lovably unorthodox humor of the last film, its plot and characters remedy this in a pinch and make this film worth a look, if not worth owning."

Especially the mammoth with the identity crisis was really funny as well as those two little what-evers, who she thought to be her brothers.<br/><br/>This movie is really something else. I think that to get the best out of it you should see it in a movie theater. Or if you have a great TV and home theater, why not at home then.

","Even before Ice Age grossed a gabillion habillion dollars, it was inevitable that there would be a sequel, because duh, the Ice Age eventually spurned a new age, which I will call the Not Ice Age. Otherwise we'd all be frozen and speaking Inuit. But I digress.<br/><br/>Last time, the sudden appearance of a human infant brought an unlikely crew together: a woolly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a sloth. This time, Manny, Diego, and Sid have a new mission - get the holy heck out of the way before the giant ice damn breaks and floods everything and drowns all of those who cannot swim, which would be just about everyone. On top of that, Manny (Ray Romano) is fearful that he's the very last of his kind. And on top of THAT, Diego (Denis Leary) must face his fears. Only everyone knows tigers have no fears, so I'm sure he has nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>At first, the boys are sure that nothing's melting, there's nothing to see here, please move along, and they tell a gathered crowd to ignore the mad ravings of Fast Tony (Jay Leno!), who's full of doom and gloom and anything else that'll make him some money. (Although what use these animals would have for money is not explained.) But then, at the top of the dammed hill thingy, they notice that the water seems a bit higher and the ice seems a bit less... present. Whoops! Guess everything really is melting after all. So they change their minds (and everyone else's) and head AWAY from the impending doom. Where to, you ask? Well, according to the vultures, there's a boat way over yonder, and if everyone can get over there before the damn bursts, then they'll be able to ride the deluge out.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Manny's his usual morose self. Glum, even. He mopes about, wondering if he truly is the last of his kind when BOOM something lands on him from a tree branch. It's another mammoth! Only she thinks she's am opossum. It's a long story (well, about 80 minutes long), but basically Elly was raised by opossums Crash and Eddie and thinks she's one of them, despite the painfully obvious fact that she's about nine tons larger and can't hide as well. But hey, she's not quibbling.<br/><br/>So here's Manny, the very picture of awkwardness, Mister Insensitivity his own darn self, and he has to convince Ellie, Miss I'm Not a Mammoth (Queen Latifah) not only that she is indeed a mammoth but that at some point she should totally fall for him so they can repopulate the species. Hey, whatever line works for you, Manfred ol' bean. And Diego and Sid have to put up with the overly energetic antics of the 'possom brothers (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck, the latter from Nickelodeon's Drake and Josh), basically being pains in the butt. Oh, but don't worry, they'll always stick up for their ""sister."" The movie is mostly enjoyable. It's lacking a little bit of the charm and heart of the original, but since this is a movie aimed at an audience a tad younger than me, it's all good. I sort of found the opossums to be annoying, not clever, and even Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) got on my nerves from time to time. Ironically, although Manny seemed out of place in the first one, he looked much more at home here. Maybe Romano just needed a movie to grow into the role. But the one who sold me wholeheartedly was Leary, who steals about every scene he's in, bringing real life and a sardonic edge to his character."

","The sequel to 2002's Ice Age has managed to recapture the magic of the first film, whilst beating off most recent efforts into CGI films that didn't come from Pixar. This time around the three friends Manny, Sid, and Diego must join their newly formed herd to escape the valley they are living in, as the ice is beginning to melt, and threatens to flood the valley.<br/><br/>Like last time, there is no grand plot here (the first being based on another journey, this time to return a child to its family), and it merely serves to introduce new characters and create laugh-out-loud situations for the trio to overcome. Of the new characters, all are competent (Queen Latifah's Mammoth-Possum-wannabe is good) but never take the lime-light away from our original heroes, which is as it should be; although I did particularly like Will Arnett's Lone Gunslinger Vulture, a rather apocalyptic vulture. All the personalities are back, as is the bickering between them  slightly more playful than last time.<br/><br/>Some standout scenes include Sid's initiation into a tribe of fellow Sloth's, and the origins of whack-a-mole with the possums  all the episodes are loosely connected by a plot which is there to serve for convenience, but this doesn't matter as the film is inventive enough to look past structural failings and just enjoy it. It has increased the fear factor somewhat  the group have to evade two nasty looking sea creatures that have been thawed out by the melting ice, and these scenes, although thrilling, can be scary for younger viewers.<br/><br/>Ice Age: The Meltdown keeps its individual style of animation; at times crossing between its general cartoon-look and then throwing in some genuinely brilliant effects  the underwater shots in particular, and also the effect of the animal's fur after they leave the water are very nice. But it's through the cartoonish style that Ice Age: The Meltdown manages to keep its charm, and there is plenty to go around."

Upon reconciling that the dawn of an ice age apocalypse is rising faster than anyone fore-casted,Manny (Ray Romano) confirms that for once the usually mendacious statements of Fast Tony (Jay Leno) are true (on the apocalypse at least). Then begins the gradual exodus of all the animals to a specific ark, which the vulture (Will Arnett) divulges is a gargantuan hollow tree bark on the top of a dead arboreal structure. The daunting tasks each protagonist faces results in endless humor.

"manicman84","7","0","0","11 August 2006"," much more intense and laughable than its predecessor
","""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" clearly surpasses its predecessor. The follow-up is much more intense and laughable. This flick seemingly does not really differ from other sequels. It offers more characters, more action, more not always intelligent humor and more scenes with Scrat (funny squirrel which only occurred three times in the first part). However, in contrast to other sequels this film benefits from this 'more' factor as it becomes a movie practically for everybody (its predecessor was mainly meant for children). In this respect it's more similar to ""Shrek"" than to the first part. Nevertheless, I'm not convinced as to the plot which is simply limited to one long trek and very typical message about the great power of friendship. In this case the emphasis is rightly placed on the hilarious characters, their adventures during the trip and at least good ideas to embroider the whole story. For instance, a female mammoth who thinks she is an opossum. Every main character practically has his/her own five minutes in the show.

","Ice Age came out in 2002 giving me no real inspiration to go check it out. Of course I finally did and found it to be well voiced and scripted. So, when Ice Age 2: The Meltdown debuted, I had a bit more interest in seeing it, even though the idea of sequels usually doesn't hold much clout in my eyes. To my surprise the film kept most of what worked from the original. The performances from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary are all humorous and heartfelt. The addition of Queen Latifah as a lifeline for the continuation of mammoth-kind despite thinking she is a possumwas a good touch as she has the voice and attitude that is just right for a family animated film. Her character drives the story along and works well with the returning animals, one of which is the pesky, unable to catch a break, squirrel Scrat. The filmmakers saw that Scrat's mini scenes sprinkled throughout the first film were fan favorites and have brought him back for more. His small vignettes are a perfect parallel to our main plot and payoff with some of the best laughs. They weren't the biggest laughs, however, as those came from the great Will ""Job Bluth"" Arnett as our friendly vulture. His sardonic speech is wonderful and his play on theme park/supermarket loud speakers is brilliant comedy.<br/><br/>The heart remains from the first as well as the clean animation. However, overall the film doesn't quite match its predecessor as it falls into some lulls and the trap of a bit too much melodrama and sentimentality. Without the duplicity of a character like Diego in the first, the sense of danger is turned down. Whereas he could have turned on them in the herd while they were being chased, having the chase by itself in the sequel can't compete. Also, it would have been nice to have at least mentioned the human child they saved. As Manny says at the end of the original, ""We'll never forget you;"" it appears as though they have. In the end though, Ice Age 2 is still well worth a look."

","'Ice Age: the Meltdown' is a sequel for an animated hit from a couple of years ago, named of course 'Ice Age'. the first IA was energetic comedy full of slapstick comedy about how three very different animals, mammoth Manny (Ray Ramano), saber-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) formed a friendship.<br/><br/>CGI animation has come forward a bit from the first film, not that it looks any bit less good than this new one, but the style still is the same. Drama and comedy mixed with a healthy, or unhealthy really depends on how you look at it, dose of slapstick.<br/><br/>This time the ice age is about to end and before the flood is gonna hit the valley our friends are in they need to evacuate and fast. On their way out Manny meets another mammoth, Ellie (Queen Latifah), and realises that he ain't the only one left of his species.<br/><br/>The biggest problem about IA:tM is that it works better as a bunch of separate jokes than as a feature film. You get laughs out of the jokes and get thrilled with the clever action scenes but when it all comes together the basic plot of the film is pretty non-existing. But that doesn't effect in the entertainment value of the movie.<br/><br/>'Ice Age: the Meltdown' is a good sequel for a good movie. After the the end credits all that's is left to say is, that I really wouldn't mind more of this."

","This movie was a major letdown after the first installment of Ice Age. The first movie had a compelling plot and the menacing tigers made for good enemies. It also had its funny points. This installment just intersperses squirrel-acorn segments with one dumb gag after another. The supposedly scary sea creatures only make an occasional appearance and in the first installment you got the feeling that the tiger could pounce at any moment. In this installment the tiger has become a cuddly kitten and Sid the Sloth is just not funny enough to carry the movie. <br/><br/>The possums are not as annoying as Chicken Little's Runt of the Litter character but they sure try to be. The only really funny bit is hearing Ray Romano tell the she-mammoth that she has a YOOOOOGE! butt, which works because you can just imagine him looking at Queen Latifah and saying, ""no really, it's ENORMOUS!"" Ray must have agreed to do this movie just so he could say those lines to her and live to tell about it."

","""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" is the sequel to the computer animated classic which melted many of our hearts with its creativity and pleasantry. The sequel did have its stellar flashes, but it does not heat up fast enough for me to surpass its superb predecessor. Manny the Mammoth, Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger, and Sid the Sloth are back as our prehistoric protagonists. This time the Ice Age is over and starting to melt so they must reunite and coldly warn everyone the hot news. The crew is enlarged by the addition of Ellie the Mammoth (who thinks she is a possum) and her petite pussies, I mean possies (forgot this is a kid flick) Crash and Eddie. Sid still adequately delivers his comical delusions of grandeur and Diego is still the ""light saber"" which lights up the screen because of his cool presence. However, it was Manny who I was disappointed with. He was not the principal mammoth who we respected in the first saga. It was a huge disappointment. Another cold downfall of the film is that it lacks a primary antagonist which we love to hate. The scene stealer of ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" as its forerunner is no other than Scrat the Squirrel. The Stray Scrat rocks the house with his hilarious mishaps! ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" has been a big box office hit and definitely does not have to worry about frozen assets. The film is worthy of its financial prize because children will love it. I just wish Director Carlos Santana , I mean Saldhana, would have shown more his ""evil ways"" by incorporating a magnetic villain and would of made Manny the Mammoth a bit more extinct. Nevertheless, I do slightly recommend you all to see ""Ice Ice Baby"" to go. *** Average"

","I liked the background scenery best in this movie than any other I've seen, including Polar Express. Very bright and positive feel to it for viewers. Personally, I enjoyed the first Ice Age movie. But I realize that I am not the intended audience for this movie. Note the previews are all for kids. Which was nice to see in a way, that they have some G-rated choices coming up.<br/><br/>This is a great movie for it's intended audience of grade 7 or less. Yet it's not intolerable to sit through it as an adult. Some bozo behind me commented after every children's movie preview. Negatively. Loudly. ""Lame. Stupid. Idiotic."" I turned around. Everyone turned to stare at him. It was a miserable man of about 60, sitting with people approx ages: 40, 30, 10, 12 and 8. His companions all told him to: SHHHH! He slunk down in his chair and began enjoying Ice Age. Some people need to be reminded. Some movies aren't made for them, but that doesn't mean you have to ruin it for kids. This is a great movie choice for caregivers to let children see. It is definitely a true G-rated movie. They really enjoyed it in the theatre, lots of giggles.<br/><br/>Characters: Manny, Sid and Diego are back. ""Ellie,"" is introduced and provides some amusing ... stuff. I'd love to quote her about the species of mammoths, but I won't spoil anything. Scrat is an even funnier 'distraction' than the first Ice Age movie. Scrat reminds me of Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner.<br/><br/>SPOILER: This movie leaves the door open for another sequel."

","I was a huge fan of the original Ice Age. God knows i went out and bought it like almost automatically when it came out... But when i heard there was going to be a sequel, a groan rose (though never escaped) in my throat. I knew it would be hard capturing the essence of the first, and I was right. For some reason, this film...lacked...especially when you see the end. I was thinking at the end...'So why did i watch that?' That's not the thing i really had a problem with. It was some of the moments like the pygmy shrews. They had no need to exist, lent nothing to the film. They didn't even make any influence in the slightest. Also was the part where Manny is talking to Ellie about her being an attractive mammoth. That part, as seen in the commercial was melted into a talk about her 'big butt'. I think this may have tried to hard to be funny, but people laughed, especially the intended audience of about 10 years old. All in all, however, Ice Age 2 was a good movie. It was a little flawed, but its enjoyable still, no matter what age you are. The voice acting is seamless, character design is top notch and the computer animation is some of the best seen. If you want to see a movie, you can do much worse than Ice Age 2"

","Just saw it just commenting it.<br/><br/>Ice Age 2 starts in the same premise as the original. The Squirrel is that Apocalypse Angel, armored with a deadly nut. The meltdown happens both in the movie and in the theater, as the jokes are not as hilarious and original as the ones on the first movie, the ""love"" affair between Manfred and Ellie is funny and believable enough to satisfy adult viewers.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is not better than the first one, as it's low and rush design is a card on favor of this, soon, franchise. You wont find better water textures or amazing creature designs. Just the classic characters we saw and that we all know. A positive point: There is no humans, so the connexion with the old cartoons is completely lost, and this is more based on a screwball comedy.<br/><br/>Negative point to finish: It doesn't reach the heart as much as the original did.

","Computer-graphic illustration has pretty much taken over all animation feature films since ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Antz"" arrived on the scene in 1996-97. Other movies such as ""Shrek,"" ""A Shark's Tale,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""Monster's Inc.,"" ""Robots,"" ""Toy Story II,"" ""Valiant,"" ""Chicken Little"" and countless others have used this technology ad nauseam.<br/><br/>The only recent exceptions being the intricately-drawn works of Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away,"" ""Howl's Moving Castle""); the stop-action efforts of Tim Burton (""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""The Corpse Bride"") and the silly claymation magic of Steve Box and Nick Park (""Wallace & Gromit"").<br/><br/>Otherwise, CGI, like the huge mammals of the newest 20th Century-Fox feature, ""Ice Age 2: The Meltdown,"" seems to rule the known universe. That's why it's as important as ever to have a deep, funny, coherent storyline to go with such technology. sadly, this one does not.<br/><br/>Picking up from where the surprise 2002 hit left off, three misfits, Manny the Mammoth (a giant elephant-like mastodon voiced by Ray Romano), Diego, the smylodon (saber-tooth tiger, Denis Leary) and a goofy three-toed sloth, Sid (John Leguizamo), are wandering through the late Pleistocene epoch.<br/><br/>After saving a little baby and returning it to its parents in the first film, this time the duo discovers (thanks to a wise-talking charlatan, Fast Tony, a funny Jay Leno) that a giant glacial dam is rapidly melting, threatening to flood the valley the animals residing therein.<br/><br/>All of this is supposed to take place within three days, so the early mammal inhabitants, including the cave lions, the wholly rhinos, and the other bizarre animal creations - sort of based on what they might have actually looked like - have to leave in a big hurry. They are also tracked by huge dinosaur fish-like creatures as the waters rise.<br/><br/>While this slow migration of creatures is moving towards the end of the valley, a group of evil vultures are waiting for the expected fatalities (giving comical traffic reports and singing ""Food, Glorious Food"" from ""Oliver!""). And, as in the last ""Ice Age"" movie, Scrap the saber-tooth squirrel, is still trying to grab that elusive acorn while being foiled at every turn.<br/><br/>During the trek, the intrepid trio meets two obnoxious possums, Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) and an idiot mammoth, Ellie (the vastly overexposed Queen Latifah), who thinks she's a possum.<br/><br/>These introductory scenes with the new group are especially irritating, as Crash and Eddie rate right up there with Jerry the Mouse and Bart Simpson in the annoyance factor. Plus, Manny, fearing that Ellie and he are the last of their species, makes an awkward and ill-conceived attempt at a pick up line, causing more conflict (as well as a few embarrassed parents trying to explain things to their kids).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sid is taken captive by a group of sycophant sloths who worship him as a ""fire god,"" and Diego is battling his fear of the water - which is flooding and rising all over the place.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the glacial barrier finally gives way, sending tons of water cascading towards the helpless animals, causing Manny, Diego and Sid to perform acts of derring-do to to save the herds.<br/><br/>And while the animation, with its sharp white backgrounds, lush green post-Ice Age thaw scenes and beautiful azure water segments are amazingly realistic and lifelike, the story leaves a bit to be desired. I do recommend this picture, especially for the little ones, but some adults may not feel the same charm or affection they had for the original."

","ICE AGE 2 is a dull and plodding sequel to a film that itself had its share of dull moments. A trio of prehistoric creatures tries to get their fellow animals to hightail it out of the valley they live in when it becomes clear the ice is melting and a huge flood is imminent. That's about it for plot. The rest is all schtick, although it may keep the very young ones amused. The middle section is a long and boring stretch about the migration. Scrat the bug-eyed rat-squirrel helps keep the film afloat, as he did the first one, and Sid the bear-sloth has a very funny but too-brief encounter with a tribe of musically-minded mini-sloths. Diego the sabretooth tiger is strictly a bit player in this one, and a little bit of Ray Romano's Manny the Mammoth goes a long way. The 3-D animation itself is terrific, but frankly 1988's 2-D THE LAND BEFORE TIME tells the same story in far more entertaining fashion, and Littlefoot the brontosaurus and his pals put the characters in ICE AGE 2 to shame."

However, My son is 5 and did not need to be exposed to one certain word that was mentioned in the movie, clear as day, and was stated clearly for the adult audience. The 2 possums called Manny a PERVERT. That was not proper for the ages in the audience that were in the theater with me. My son then turned to me and of course repeated the word and wanted to know what it meant. I realize the movie was rated PG, I still believe that the movie is geared to the younger age audience and did not need to hear that kind of language. I understand they are trying to entertain adults as well as children, but does it need to be at the expense of the our children. I was disappointed in the end.

","The prehistoric animals are again on a journey, this time escaping from a flood (the solution is borrowed right from the Bible). Their journey is not without dangers as predators watch them go. Each of the main heroes of the previous installment have a character arc of their own: the mammoth Mannny is still lonely and wants to find a female mammoth which is not easy in a race destined to extinct), Sid finds small relatives, and Diego has to overcome his fear from water. While the story is a bit sketchy just as the first one, there is much less seriousness and drama (mostly thanks to leaving humans entirely out). The effect is lighter and easier to accept by the kids: there are more animals (better animation - see their hair), more colors. Probably it's also the kids who will be the happiest to find a song in the movie (it's like the revue musical numbers from the Golden Age of Hollywood). The action sequences are really thrilling - maybe a bit too intense for the smaller ones (the monsters are really scary; they could be involved in Jurassic park movies). At the same time I think there were more childish jokes than in the first one and none of the scenes were as funny as the one with the dodos in the first one. But poor scrat's misadventures with its acorn are again incredibly funny in a merry melodies style and this time they are also better serving the main story.

Personally, I didn't however I can have no complaints with the new characters as they blend well with the more experienced ones and the chemistry between them is fabulous. <br/><br/>Scrat the squirrel/rat returns and is another thing which is easily commendable; it lifts the pressure off the now quartet with its own speechless but quirky performances throughout in its quest to gather the nut it craves!<br/><br/>'The Meltdown' is superior to its predecessor on many levels however, it lacks the originality of the original as well as its powerful emotional strength."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","1","2","16 July 2006"," Should have been kept straightforward and moral-free.
","I don't know if I should feel guilty or not for admitting this, but Ice Age is possibly the funniest film I have ever seen. Let me clarify: I don't just mean funny-in-a-cute-and-nicely-animated kind of way, but actually hysterical and hilarious enough to rival any live-action comedy.<br/><br/>What made Ice Age such a brilliant film was its lack of Disney morals and cheesy family clichés. It had no morals to preach, no statements to make and no lessons to teach. It was just a simple, straightforward adventure with huge doses of well-placed comedy. Clearly, the filmmakers at Blue Sky Studios did not realize this was the root of the success of the first film, because in Ice Age 2: The Meltdown morals and romantic troubles are suddenly there to complicate things. I found this endlessly disappointing.<br/><br/>The main plot is still a simple one; as the trio and the rest of the animals are enjoying the increasingly hot climate of the Ice Age, they are warned by some kooky prophet-like turtle that all the sun is causing the ice caps above their valley to melt. Realising their entire habitat is about to flood, Sid, Diego and Manny set out to reach other side of the valley where a boat awaits to take the animals away from the great flood. This is where the storyline should have ended because it's entertaining enough for an animated feature. But no, instead sub-plots are introduced in the form of new MAIN characters that they encounter on their journey.<br/><br/>This is none other than Queen Latifah. Her character as the female mammoth who doesn't know she is a mammoth was atrocious. I despise the need for introducing a character like this when you already had a perfectly dynamic trio. Yes, she had some good lines and the relationship she had with the other characters occasionally provided for comedy but generally, she was pretty much as annoying as Jar-Jar Binks. She brought nothing to this film other than complex love troubles. She was the fifth wheel.<br/><br/>Picking up on the enormous positive response from Scrat in the last film, this little prehistoric rodent is given much more screen time than before. This is essentially the best part of Ice Age 2 and the animations on his gags are some of the best and funniest I have ever seen. Scrat's life still revolves around finding and keeping that one nut and this is great. Nothing has changed and everything still works. Scrat's whole storyline actually works better in The Meltdown than it did in the first film because it is so straightforward and therefore easy to improve with the simplest of new funny scenarios.<br/><br/>Yes, Ice Age: The Meltdown is still a funny film but loses a lot of its blatant humour to make room for a new storyline, that of Manny and his new female mammoth. It does not work as well as the first one because it isn't as simplistic. 6/10"

","What they got right in the first movie, they messed up in this second one.<br/><br/>In the first movie, the story was thin but it was a good backdrop for the characters who had a real chemistry going. The humor came out of a strange, almost-New York-ish mix, of cynicism and warmth. Characters making fun of each other but genuinely getting to look each other as the plot developed. In this installment, the story's still thin but the humor's pretty much gone. They really could have spent more time figuring out the jokes and using each of the characters better.<br/><br/>The first one is worth collecting on DVD. This one, ain't worth it."

I saw it, I loved it and I purchased DVD for my collection.<br/><br/>As soon as I heard ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" was coming I said I gotta see it. But this time I's wrong.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie was just an attempt to make more money based on the success of the first. Trhoughout the movie everything seemed, well, familiar... Almost identical to scenes in the first movie. Similar scenes, same characters, same jokes.<br/><br/>It is not a bad animation; but it is not anything like the first one -so don't compare them."

","I saw this on Easter Sunday and was a little tired believe it or not. This movie was good but it seemed like all the characters did was walk for about 10 minutes and then listen to a rumble of ice melting. This repeated at least 6 times. Of course, that goofy chipmunk was a nice addition. I wish he would have given up on the stupid acorn though. There are many foods that are much better than acorns. The best part was the fire king part. I mean, those imitations of the FIRE KING were very cute. The fish were not THAT scary and in fact, the scariest part was trying to figure out how much Ray Romano was paid for this role! All in all, decent movie. I liked Toy Story better though. OK, time to go back to 24. Oh, nice cameo voice by David Lee Roth in this movie."

Also, I think they needed to flesh-out some characters (Sid, especially) and sophisticate the script.<br/><br/>The animation is very good and has a unique style to it. The Scratt sequences made me enjoyed the most - has that old looney toons humor and feel. I think Scratt deserves a TV show of animation shorts.<br/><br/>All in all, a good rental for the whole family, but I wish Blue Sky would try to top themselves in the next one and not go on the safe side of toon town.<br/><br/>6/10"

","In this unnecessary sequel, Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the Sabre-toothed Tiger must go on another journey to avoid becoming fish food when the world starts to melt. Along the way, Manny stumbles across another of his species (which he had previously thought were extinct) called Ellie. However, being raised in a possum family, she thinks she is one of those creatures and so is in the habit of sleeping upside down on trees hanging by her tail and playing dead at a moment's notice. Can she be convinced of her own heritage and her responsibility in continuing the mammoth line? Meanwhile, Scrat continues his never ending quest for that elusive nut, Sid gets kidnapped by some fire-worshipping beasties who think he is their god and Diego.. well, doesn't really do a whole lot of anything. Oh, wait he learns to swim. Yay!<br/><br/>There was a lot of laughter echoing around the cinema during Ice Age 2. Shame hardly any of it was coming from the over 10 crowd. If you took Scrat's scenes out, you'd be left with a whole lot of nothing. A few passable action sequences, a lot of groan-worthy jokes and some failed attempts at pathos take up the bulk of the film, and it's only when the crazy squirrel comes on that the movie really comes to life. Sadly, his time on screen is strictly limited, so for the most part you'll be rolling your eyes at yet another fart gag or wee-wee joke.<br/><br/>This film did not need to be made, and only exists because the (superior) original took in so much at the box office and on DVD. It's difficult to imagine a company like Pixar releasing a follow-up to one of their animated hits just to make money and if they do, they actually put some effort into it. Look no further than the critical success of Toy Story 2 for an example. Blue Sky Studios on the other hand has no such scruples, and so Ice Age 2 is a rush job from start to finish.. and it shows. I say: Wait for video, then stick it on for the kids while you get on with the chores. There you go, the perfect babysitter! 5/10"
"agentmori","8","1","2","4 April 2006"," A New Way of Watching Ice
","If there's one thing I could say about Ice Age: The Meltdown (April 1, 2006 G4 Cinema 6 8:20 pm), it is this: I like it way better than the first one. In fact, I didn't like the first installment. But I really like the sequel. I thought the jokes in the first Ice Age were half-baked and the creators basically followed suit the formula huge successes such as Finding Nemo and Shrek did. Cutesy characters, witty remarks, sidekicks, and so much more.<br/><br/>Well, the sequel is still using the same formula. In fact, the sloth-god thing with the group chanting is already so overused. However, it worked for me and everyone else in the cinema. The same thing with the 2 opossums and their various hip-hop hand gestures similar to Robert Deniro's I-am-watching-you move.<br/><br/>A nice thing I noticed about the movie as well is its message about global warming. Sure, you've heard tons about the topic before and thus, as a favor, I won't talk about it further. But nevertheless, Ice Age 2 helped young minds and kids-at-heart alike realize the horror of global warming (sorry) altogether.<br/><br/>And there's the fact that the movie is kinda violent. Like hello, kids are watching and yet 2 characters died. No, they didn't just die. One was eaten by monsters and the other was steamed to death. But nobody blinked. Well, at least nobody at MTRCB blinked. Maybe it is because of the animation or the fact that it was essential to the plot. Nevertheless, violence is still violence and I was quite disturbed by those fatalities. Hmmm. I like it.<br/><br/>http://kingdelrosario.wordpress.com/"
"Shanus","7","1","2","4 April 2006"," A winning formula that has been shaken and stirred...
","The first Ice Age hit the DVD charts with a bang after a lukewarm cinematic reception and a truly original animated classic it has become. Adults appreciated the charm and wit of the characters as well as young kids and a very emotional happy ever after ending finished the title well.<br/><br/>Now consider Ice Age: The Meltdown. The recipe is as follows; Take the four superb stars (including Scrat) from the first instalment, mix them with some new quirky yet unwelcome and annoying characters, destroy any remnants of a plot, add some far too infrequent hilarious scenes and push it at the box office as a blockbuster animation. Result - a misfiring splutter of a movie saved from obscurity by it's similarity with the first movie. I scored it a 7 as there are a couple of very funny moments and i really do like the formula.<br/><br/>Tis a shame... Shame on the creators for not doing much much better, especially with the ridiculously poor plot. Ice Age 3 has to be better."
"skluczkiewicz","9","1","2","3 April 2006"," Hysterical
","I saw Ice Age: The Meltdown with my wife and daughters ages four and six and we all enjoyed this movie. There are a lot of funny lines, funny scenes and of course there's Scrat. There were a lot of scenes where the whole theater was just cracking up. This is a fantastic movie to take the family to. There are a few scary scenes as my four year old wanted to sit with me for them but over all she enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>One other thing I have to say is the animation seemed far superior to the original and some other movies. Both Manny and Ellie moved and looked real. Both my wife and I wanted to reach out and touch what looked like real fur. It was totally amazing the quality of the animation of the animals.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes movies that make you laugh."
"FilmGrain","6","1","2","2 April 2006"," Good Movie, but lacks direction
","I am not outside the general consensus when I say that it was good, but not as good as the first. The movie succeeds well in its wonderful graphics, and lifelike animation. It is also, undeniably, a very funny movie and reaches out well to kids. However, the movie's downfall is in its plot and character development. In typical sequel fashion, the movie jumps right into the events of the movie with little build up or explanation. This is great if you just watched the original Ice Age in the last couple of months, but for those of us who haven't seen it since it came out a couple years ago, it feels awkward and forced. As I mentioned earlier, the filmmakers make the same mistake with character development. We are assumed to know the preexisting brotherhood and love-hate relationships between the main characters of the previous film. This is OK if your making the next James Bond film because we already know him so well, but this is only the second Ice Age film. It is within the realm of possibility that some people who watch will not have seen the original. The film needs to be able to stand alone. You may get the feeling that because I am writing so critically that I didn't enjoy the movie; however, I can assure that it is a wonderful movie and well worth seeing in a theatre. Overall it succeeds as a children's' film and is exceedingly entertaining."

","The world is going to end...or rather the ice is melting and the dam of ice that is holding back all of the water from flooding the valley our heroes live in is on the verge of collapse. The only hope for survival is to get to the far end of the valley where ""a boat is waiting"". So everyone begins the long trek to the far side. Along the way funny things happen.<br/><br/>Major disappointment from the Ice Age gang. The voice cast is fine. The animation is fine. The problem is that there really is no plot. Its basically a series of barely connected set pieces on the road to the far end of the valley. The pieces are all okay, with some being quite good, the problem is that there isn't enough to tie them together, the romance between Ray Romano and Queen Latifah is not a thread, its shading on the walk where ever. Worse the location takes on different appearances depending on what the joke of the moment needs. Its ice, its forest, there's water, its dry, there's an ice wall there's no wall in sight. You have no sense of where anyone is or whats going on. I know its a minor thing but I kept wondering where'd the water go/ come from?, there is no internal consistency. It looks as if the film makers had all of these bits they wanted to tie together and instead of working out a real plot just put them in a stew pot.(worse, they actually make you sick to death of the acorn lusting Scrat).<br/><br/>While not bad I don't think its worth 10 bucks in the theater.

","Ice Age is one of my favourite animations, so I was excited about a sequel. To ease the wait I collected nearly all the available merchandise (sadly lacking for the Original release)and pre-read the movie. I enjoyed the new story, although I realised that it could not match the emotion of their first mission. Instead it was to be a romantic comedy, reminiscent of The Land Before Time series. (Another fave.)If you've seen all the LBT sequels like I have, they share similar scenes & themes & are fully character driven. The ever unfortunate Scrat is back in even funnier, extended sequences. He's definitely the star of the picture, but the Possums, Sid & several minor characters also provide plenty of laughs. The romance between the mammoths slows the plot on occasion, but is sweet. Diego's bestscenes are with Sid. The animation is still impressive & the voice cast is top notch. The books contain scenes that are not in the final movie. (Probably turn up on the DVD.) Ultimately this is a good sequel, but the Original is still best. Listen out for occasional references."

"paul2001sw-1","3","1","4","19 August 2006"," Lazy slapstick
","If you've seen the first part of 'Ice Age' you already know what to expect from the sequel: silly, annoying animals; electronic animation that combines beautiful rendering of the central characters with a cartoony background; not much in the way of a plot; and a slightly nonsensical, life-affirming message. This movie got a lot of criticism which is strange only because its predecessor was more liked; to my mind, both are relatively second rate if compared to the best of the genre. What I really dislike is the lazy way the story blows its own potential: there's an underlying poignancy in the tale (which is set against the backdrop of the extinction of the mammoths), and yet the bizarre conclusion (that the mammoths are alive and well after all) not only makes no sense (even the youngest child knows there are no mammoths any more) but also makes the whole basis on which we have been invited to interact with the film seem fraudulent. Compared to the way that films like 'Toy Story' and 'Madagascar' actually engage with the reality of life and death (while still managing to be very funny), it seems like a poor showing, and proof that computer graphics alone are not enough to make a good film."
"after-hour_dvd_collector","4","1","4","12 April 2006"," Slightly disappointed...
","Is it just me, or had this movie ""Part 2"" written all over it? The story was content-free, and any kind of tension there was didn't come from the characters interacting (which was the fun part of the original Ice Age), but from the outside threats, and THOSE had ""obvious"" not written, but spray painted all over them. And, even worse, whatever happened was just so very predictable. That was the worst letdown compared to Part 1 - oh wait, i'm forgetting the musical interludes. After Pt. 1, i had hoped for a sing-along free animation feature, and right when you least expect it, when there's at least a bit of tension, BAM! Singing, dancing, musical fun... gah.<br/><br/>On the whole, it felt like a not-very-good collage of fun parts, action parts, ""haven't we seen something similar in part 1"" action parts, some overlong and pointless musical interludes, the inevitable comic relief parts... (most of the time thrown in where it caused the most nerve- grating effect...)<br/><br/>Design: 10 - Content: 3. At least that was the combined verdict of our monthly cinema group."

","Most sequels bank on the success of the original film and tend to fall flat. This is not the case of Ice Age 2 - the Meltdown. This highly anticipated sequel finds the ""herd"" in a new traveling adventure racing against time and impending disaster. Some of the familiar creatures reappear in this movie along with some new ones. Whereas some people already remarked on the major ones, there are also several small part newcomers. My kids were enamored be Diego's Bird Girl who appears early in the movie. This character is the distinctive voice of 9-year-old actress Reyna Shaskan, newly listed in this database. The humor in the film is for all ages. There were adult jokes where you could hear the grown-ups' belly laughs echoing throughout the theater audience. The writing was topnotch. The animation superb. Note the ability of the animators to deal with hair and fire which are 2 of the most difficult items to animate well. Scrat is his usually entertaining self, continuing the major subplot and providing continuity to the entire story. The stars reprise their roles extraordinarily well. This is a must see film for all ages."

Also, the animation is fine-tuned enough for you to see the facial expressions of the animals and everything.<br/><br/>Scrat is as funny as before, but now he has more screen time, and he goes through all sorts of adventures looking for his dear acorn. I also liked the possums a lot! I think the movie is, overall, better than the first one - it is very, very funny. They even put in two 'musical' numbers! There are only three 'action' scenes in the movie, but that is enough because they are spaced out perfectly.<br/><br/>The only problem i had with it is that it is for more of a preteen-teen audience. I took my 5 year old brother to see it, and i know that he didn't understand some of the jokes or references.<br/><br/>You might think that in the slew of animal movies in recent years (especially those coming out later this year), that Ice Age 2 is just another critter tale, and a sequel at that.

Now, some years have passed since the adventure that joined them all; Now, all the survivors of Ice Age live in a Valley (Ancient animals in a great valley.

During their travel to the other side of the Great Valley (Ah. Now I remember), they met two possums, and a mammoth that think is a possum (Crash, Eddie and Ellie, respectively).<br/><br/>While traveling, the Sub-Zero heroes are trying to resolve the problems that three more members (plus the three original ones, letting out Scrat) for the strangest Herd can cause.<br/><br/>A male mammoth trying to convince an almost crazy, but innocent female mammoth that she's not a possum, and the inevitable falling in love after that.<br/><br/>A pair of crazy- and real- Possums annoying Diego and Sid and replacing the last one as the Comical Roles in the herd. <br/><br/>A Saber-Tooth tiger trying to defeat his secret fear to the water with Sid's help.<br/><br/>And the short but fun apparitions of the coolest character of them all, the Saber-Toothed Squirrel Scrat (Squeak Attack again), that, by himself, manages to make this film a MUST-SEE this year.<br/><br/>What else can you ask for?<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/><br/>Manny. <br/><br/>The Big one in the Herd, Manny loosed his family before the beginning of ICE AGE, but during the movie, found that his two friends were almost a family-as crazy as it sounds- for him. Now, In ICE AGE 2, Manny faces the comments and the reality that he is the last mammoth of the world- or is he?-<br/><br/>Then, during their travel to salvation, The herd found a Female Mammoth that think is a possum, and her two ""brothers"" (real possums); Now, with the support of the ancient Freud of the Herd- Sid-, he try to convince her of the truth, while fall in love unconsciously.<br/><br/>Diego. <br/><br/>The Once ""Double Agent"", in ICE AGE, is now- In ICE AGE 2- a real member of the Herd. But he still having secrets that neither Sid or Manny know about. He is afraid of water. Diego could have a leading role in ICE AGE 2, as we know too few about him in ICE AGE-, but the writers and director decided to keep him as a supporting role, so the story of he defeating his fear to water to save his best friend Sid- I don't know what exactly, but I find something weird in there-, is not central in this Movie Story; Maybe if they decide to make an ICE AGE 3 movie, he will have the central role.<br/><br/>Sid. <br/><br/>In ICE AGE, the ""Smooth Operator""; Now, in the sequel, the Freud Doctor of the Herd. Sid have loosed his Comical Role almost at 100%, and now is, together with his best friend Diego- Just a Supporting role.<br/><br/>He is the one that, with his psychological advice, helps Diego to end with his fear to water, and that convince Manny, telling him that Ellie is the girl for him.<br/><br/>Crash and Eddie.<br/><br/>The new comical roles in the pack, this pair of possums enjoy to annoy Diego and Sid, and defend their sister Ellie. They say that possums are cowards, but they pass their life in an extreme way that defies their own theory.<br/><br/>Ellie <br/><br/>A female mammoth that thinks with all her heart that she's a possum; But why does she feel attracted by Manny, the Mammoth?<br/><br/>Scrat<br/><br/>Last, but not least, the ""Squeak Attack"", and honoris causa member of the herd, the Saber-toothed squirrel Scrat comes back in his cool role. Now, in ICE AGE 2, his actions will be more important for the movie story. Scrat and his obsession for chasing acorns are back, to relieve the tension in the movie, and to help to save the day. Definitely, he still being the coolest character of them all, and the one that makes for himself the movie worth to see<br/><br/>OVERALL<br/><br/>8 of 10 for ICE AGE 2. Cool characters, Good story... But there were some little details. The cold start, until they find Elly, Eddie and Crash. (Fortunatelly, they find 'em soon in the movie), the fact of Diego- Second coolest character of ICE AGE 1, after Scrat- being support role, and the PG13 subliminal suggestion about his ""best friends"" relationship with Sid, make me discount two points, to let them with an 8<br/><br/>But, without looking at that details, ICE AGE movie is worth to see- Hey, No computer animated comedy movie have scored 8 in my rank since Shrek 2-, and I recommend it seriously.<br/><br/>Lykan-of-the-Wolves."

Once the film came out, we enjoyed every second of it, laughing out loud at all the hilarious moments, including Scrat (the saber-tooth squirrel)'s mishaps with his beloved acorn. He's even more nuts than he was in the first film (pun intended)! In this sequel, we are introduced to three new characters, Ellie the Shemoth (played by Queen Latifah of ""Living Single"" and ""Living Out Loud"" fame), a female mammoth who is deluded and thinks she's a possum (much like how throughout much of the 1st Toy Story, Buzz thought he was an actual space ranger, not a toy, until he realizes later on that he IS a toy), who is Manny's love interest as Manny was having stress about the fact the he may be the last of his kind, and Ellie's two possum brothers, Crash (played by Seann William Scott, of ""American Pie"" fame) and Eddie (played by Josh Peck of Nickelodeon fame).<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first Ice Age, you'll love The Meltdown!! With it's mind-blowing animation and over-the top humor, you and your entire family will laugh out loud until you can't LOL no more!"

","The first movie was great, introduced fairly unique characters and made the plot interesting.<br/><br/>The second movie deals more with finding mates for the characters and trying to learn how sacrificing one's time for another works.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like, but was part of the plot in the first place, was the melting and the idea of global warming. True or fiction, I don't care. But I just don't like the idea of a political message being put into a fun entertaining movie.<br/><br/>But other than that, it wasn't the best but it wasn't horrible either.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"
"The_Film_Cricket","2","0","1","27 March 2011"," Meltdown has potential but wow does it talk too much.
","Ice Age: The Meltdown is really two movies and, like the predators that loom throughout, both movies are vying for supremacy. The first involves the prehistoric caravan from the original in a fast-paced adventure story as they try to stay one step ahead of a nasty plague of global warming. The second wallows in long treks of dialogue about extinction, misunderstandings, reproduction, phobias, what-makes-a-family and at least one head-scratcher of an identity crisis. I enjoyed the first but for the second, I kept longing for my Fast-Forward button.<br/><br/>As you will recall, the characters from the earlier film Manfred the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the Saber-toothed Tiger formed a small herd. They are no less friendly this time though some personality flaws start to emerge including Sid who contracts Dangerfield's Disease and complains that he don't get no respect; Diego has an apparent fear of water; Meanwhile, Manny fears that he's the last of his kind. You don't have to be Kreskin to figure out that all of these issues are dealt with in the third act.<br/><br/>But the larger problem begins with the information that the ice glaciers are melting and they will soon find themselves a mile underwater if they don't find a legendary hollow log that will sail them to safety. That sets them on a long trek where they deal with their problems and Manny finds a pretty girl-mammoth named Elly (voice of Queen Lahtifah) who could help him repopulate the species if she wasn't under the delusion that she's a possum (It sounds lame but, trust me, it sets the stage for at least three brilliant sight-gags).<br/><br/>Manny and Elly are sweet together and I enjoyed a lot of their chemistry. But their scenes together run a bit long and there is talk after talk after talk after talk and where the movie should be bouncy it just kind of politely rolls. The dialogue leaves the visuals (which are breathtaking) left to be glanced mostly over their shoulders.<br/><br/>Apart from all of these problems is, of course, the reason we came to see the movie in the first place: Scrat the hapless squirrel who continues his endless quest to hold on to apparently the only acorn left on earth. He gets involved in three brilliant set-pieces, one involving piranha, one involving a run-in with a baby bird and a third that I can't reveal but let's just say it's strikes a perfect a note and closes the movie. Scrat is what holds the movie for me, just like the original Ice Age he's a hundred times more interesting than anything else in the film.<br/><br/>Scrat helps to break up those long passages of dialogue and so do two production numbers that I didn't expect. One involves a masterpiece of comic genius involving some ever-watchful buzzards who perform perhaps the creepiest version of ""Food, Glorious Food"" that I've ever seen (somewhere Busby Berkley is either smiling or crying). The other involves a tribe of sloths who are so fascinated by Sid's ability to make fire that they pronounce him their fire god. They go into a fun chanting number that - darn it - had my toes tapping. The problem is that these great scenes are a very small part of the movie, broken up by long passages in which the characters talk and talk and talk.<br/><br/>I wish the movie had found that kind of bouncy note of fun all the way instead of pausing for character flaws. As I said, this is two movies, one that moves and one stops for a long chat. I'm not averse to conversation but in the case of an animated comedy less might have been more.<br/><br/>**1/2 (of four)"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","0","2","29 March 2010"," Decent and colourful sequel, with some hit and miss moments
","I personally really enjoyed the first Ice Age, it was well animated and funny. While a notch below the first, this is still a colourful and lively sequel, that was better than I thought it would be. The animation is excellent, there is clear evidence that a lot of time went into making the characters detailed and the backgrounds pretty. The visual with Queen Latifah's character Ellie, who believes she's a possum, hanging upside down with her ""brothers"" was a treat. Also pretty good was the soundtrack, bright and sunny and I think memorable as well and the sound particularly the rumbling of the falling/cracking ice. The voice acting from John Leguizamo, Ray Romano, Queen Latifah and Dennis Leary is top notch. Out of the characters, Scrat I think is the scene-stealer, the scene with the huge acorn in the heavenly beyond with Khatchaturian's Spartacus was hilarious. The scene with pint-size animals planning to sacrifice Sid to the fire god is funny as well. However, for a 90 minute or so movie, the plot is disappointingly thin and in terms of action there are parts where not so much happens. While there are some nice bits of dialogue such as ""Do not leave your children unattended. Unattended children will be eaten"", but overall there are parts where the dialogue is lacking in wit and irreverence. And while Scrat has some priceless moments, other parts of the film are hit and miss, the parts with Ellie thinking she was a possum did get a tad too silly at times. Overall though, this is not at all bad, actually quite enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Three unlikely friends, ""Sid the Land Sloth"" (voiced by John Leguizamo), ""Manford 'Manny' the Wolly Mamoth"" (voiced by Ray Ramono) and ""Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger"" (voiced by Dennis Leary) have discovered that the ice damn keeping the area they and other species live dry is melting.

There are a lot of things that kids will like, but the adults will find pretty boring.<br/><br/>A lot of times, this movie seems to drag and drag. I found myself looking more at my computer than paying attention as to what was going on on my television.<br/><br/>When it comes to humor, I can't say that it's a great comedy movie. In fact, the jokes either produced nothing or a mild chuckle. There was a pretty good laugh near the end of the movie, and some pretty good laughs with ""Scrat the Saber-tooth Squirrel"" (voiced by Chris Wedge). I just wasn't real amused with the movie's humor.<br/><br/>Another thing I was not impressed with was the music. I can barely remember two tunes, but none of the lyrics, except a little bit that was sung by one of the characters after the scene, because he found it catchy.<br/><br/>One thing I was pretty impressed with was the animation. Although the creatures were cartoonish looking, which was by design, they were well done. The detailing is not that great though, you only see any sense of movement of muscles with the mammoths. But, because this movie is target to kids, the didn't bring out the details that other movies have had.<br/><br/>I also think that the story itself was only fair -- maximum. There are numerous times where the movie begins to move at a slow snail's pace. During these scenes, like I said earlier, I found myself paying attention more to my computer. Kids really don't care about a story except for one that can keep their attention. I honestly can't give you an age limit on an audience for this movie. But, if you are in your tweens or above, I would say skip this movie."

","The first movie is one I saw many times when I was younger, it was almost inevitable that a sequel would follow, as it was a big box office success, this is the first sequel in what would become a franchise, directed by Carlos Saldanha (Robots, Rio, Ferdinand). Basically, Manfred aka ""Manny"" (Ray Romano) the woolly mammoth, Sid (John Leguizamo) the sloth, and Diego (Denis Leary) the sabre-toothed tiger are living alongside many other creatures in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a dam holding a massive body of water that could flood the valley. The intimidating Lone Gunslinger Vulture (Will Arnett) warns them that they have up to three days until the dam breaks and they are drowned. But they have a chance to survive boarding a boat at the other end of the valley. Manny already fears that he may be the last mammoth left, after his family were killed by Neanderthals. During the evacuation, a glacier containing two sea reptiles breaks off, releasing the creatures into the water. When Manny is briefly separated from them, Diego and Sid encounter two mischievous opossums named Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck). Manny meanwhile is surprised when he encounters Ellie (Queen Latifah), a female woolly mammoth, but she believes she is an opossum, the adoptive sister of Crash and Eddie. Sid invites her to tag along with the group to escape the flood, and she brings Crash and Eddie. Meanwhile, back at the valley, Scrat (Chris Wedge) the sabre-toothed squirrel is trying to reclaim his treasured acorn, which he keeps losing when it slips to the top of an iceberg and into a vulture's nest. After a dangerous encounter with the sea creatures while crossing a pond, Diego shows a fear of water. They discover an area which Ellie recalls as the place where she was adopted. She finally realises she is a mammoth from a memory flash, and how she was separated from her family, and found by a family of opossums. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests they should be together to ""save their species"". Ellie and Manny reconcile when they must co-operate to save the group when the ground cracks under their feet. Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini sloths who believe Sid to be a god. Sid lights a fire for them and believes that he has finally found respect. But they plan to sacrifice him by throwing him into a volcano; Sid narrowly escapes. The next morning, Sid tells the others his experience, but they are unconvinced. After being harassed by vultures, who sing about wanting to eat them, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers. Manny insists on going forward, Sid and Diego follow, but they are separated from Ellie and her brothers when they argue about which way is safest. When the flood comes, Ellie is trapped in a cave due to falling rocks, but Manny saves her from drowning. While Diego overcomes his fear of water to save Sid, Crash and Eddie from drowning. The sea creatures arrive, but Manny defeats them using his quick thinking, they are defeated and killed by a rock falling on them. The other animals are at the mercy of the water currents. Meanwhile, Scrat climbs up the glacier and sticks the acorn at the top of the ice. This forms a crack in the glacier, which widens into a fissure, diverting the flood and saving the animals in the valley. From the other side of this glacier, a herd of mammoths show up, proving mammoths aren't extinct. But Manny and Ellie decide to remain together, taking Sid, Diego and the opossum brothers along. Sid encounters the mini sloths again, they invite him to be their leader, but Diego convinces him to stay with their ""herd"". Scrat has a near-death experience, after drowning, falling from the glacier, and enters a heaven full of acorns. But before he can touch the biggest acorn, he is thrust back, and wakes up, having been resuscitated by Sid, who he proceeds to viciously attack. Also starring Jay Leno as Fast Tony. The voices of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary remain suited for their characters who banter well together, like before it is not the most exciting film, it has fun and amusing moments that will entertain kids and adults, it is just another alright family animated comedy adventure. Worth watching!"

","The humor in this wasn't as good as the first movie. It's all cheap laughs for the kids, which is what a lot of youth movies are like now (unfortunately). Too many scenes are too ridiculous (ie Rocks jutting into the air under their feet as they barely balance and hang on and conveniently escaping prehistoric predators that have an underwater speed fight with a mammoth, what?). And, as one person pointed out, there are a lot of flaws in the storyline, like the mammoths marching out of the same crack that a flood's worth of water just went into. If the writers took another 15 minutes to think it over, they may have come up with something better.<br/><br/>On the good side, the characters bring their same personalities into this film, with the addition of some new ones.<br/><br/>I suppose if you liked Herby: Fully Loaded (another dud for anyone over 12) you might like this movie.

","I've just seen Ice Age 2. What can I say? It's funny at times and certainly can get the smile out of you. But the story largely doesn't work. The basic plot is very simple: the fear of global warming looms large and the animals plan an exodus. However, the story has absolutely nothing other than that. The so-called subplots are tiringly heaped on top of the main body of the story and often have nothing to do with the basic plot itself. So the film is like a loose collection of tales held weakly by a bunch of characters. Also, the pronounced biblical references makes the story on the whole rather unoriginal. This contrasts badly against Ice Age 1 which bubbles with creativity.<br/><br/>It's true that Ice Age 2 has interesting moments and sometimes clever dialogues.

","First of all, let me say that if it were not for the excellent animation, I would have rated this bomb a lot lower.<br/><br/>Before Ice Age: the Meltdown finally made its way to the screen, I had to sit through a slew of current and upcoming animated comedies that, taken together with Ice Age 2, confirm the death of this genre as we know it.<br/><br/>Seriously, the scriptwriters lack any semblance of storytelling, not to mention what tasteful jokes are supposed to be like. Instead, they appeal to the lowest common denominator and basest form of humor such as constant references and exhibitions of bodily functions and childish acts like sticking straws up one's nose.<br/><br/>In short, if you liked Ice Age One, do yourself a favor and watch it again so that you will never have to subject yourself to Ice Age Too (The ""Too"" is to indicate that this movie has too many characters who make too many useless comments and redundant jokes).<br/><br/>I am going to tell you that this movie has two of the most annoying characters since Jar Jar Biggs of Star Wars fame. Not only are they incessantly annoying, the movie cannot seem to let a minute go by without having them express some sort of supposedly street kool lingo like ""Homey,"" and such, and hand actions like high fives.<br/><br/>These rodents are neither hip, cool, tight, phat, or anything remotely resembling a bunch of boys from the 'hood. I will say that there is regrettably one death in the movie, but even more regrettably is that is was not one of these miscreants.<br/><br/>Now, about the movie itself. The major laudable difference -- worth noting --between the original and this sequel is the animation. Thanks to advances in computer graphics, all of the characters are now fully rounded and exquisitely detailed versus the first film where angular shapes dominated the painted landscape.<br/><br/>Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Dennis Leary) reprise their roles as the members of a ""herd"" that formed in the first film out of necessity. Once again, John and Dennis put their own unique spin to the characters voices. Unfortunately, Ray Romano once again sounds (and acts) exactly as he does on ""Ray."" Back again is Scrat, the indefatigable squirrel-like creature constantly battling the elements while trying desperately to hold onto his most prized possession, the acorn from the first film. Thank goodness for Scrat because without him this film would be hard pressed to produce a legitimate funny moment. However, as is the case throughout the film, Scrat's situations are exaggerated to the extreme. In fact, every element of this film is so over the top, and consequently unbelievable even for a 'toon, that it grates on one's nerve. I will give an example after I introduce the newest member and misfit to this ragtag herd.<br/><br/>The new character is ""Ellie"" a female mammoth who thinks she is a possum thanks to the two annoying characters mentioned above, who also are possums. Queen Latifa, who plays the voice of ""Ellie,"" shows yet another talented side of her. As it turns out, Ellie has what I consider the best gag of the film when Manny tries to convince her that mammoths may become extinct if they do not help to further the species.<br/><br/>However, pairing the two of them together does not work at all because the viewer cannot escape seeing Ray Romano when Manny speaks and trying to imagine a love interest between Romano and Latifa is virtually impossible.<br/><br/>Of course, they do hook up in the end after one improbable sequence after another in what amounts to the cartoon that would not die. you know what I mean when a film just cannot seem to find a simple way to end, and just goes on and on and on until the writers run out of ideas.<br/><br/>Well before the writers ran out of lines and gags, I could not wait to run out of the theatre and get a breath of fresh air. Ice Age: The Meltdown is as stale as it gets.<br/><br/>If you are under the age of five, then you will love it. For everyone else, I recommend staying at home for awhile until Shrek returns."

","ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN <br/><br/>In this depressing time where there is literally not a single film in theatres that I am passionate about seeing, there is little option aside from a decent popcorn flick like ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN. It is not usually the kind of film that would draw me out to the theatres, however... considering my other options last night this was the best choice. As I expected, ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN was a genuinely entertaining, though shallow, diversion with some great animation on display. I'm not an avid fan of the original ICE AGE... though I did find it entertaining and charming. THE MELTDOWN inspires the same response from me.<br/><br/>What both this film and the original did so well was create a series of truly exciting action sequences that are framed by a lightweight comedic tone. Both films succeed at making the situations these animals find themselves in genuinely exciting. Whether it be a wild ride down melting ice, a perilous balancing act on a large stack of rocks, or on a breaking ice pond filled with giant vicious fish... all these sequences are truly exciting.<br/><br/>In addition, the writers and directors of THE MELTDOWN really know how to utilize everything possible for comedy. The comedic style is very scattered... whether it be the dry wit of Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) or the ridiculous visual of Possum's acting like ""homeboys"". I certainly would never praise THE MELTDOWN's comedy for being one cohesive style, or for being particularly intelligent... but nonetheless it musters quite a few genuine laughs.<br/><br/>My main complaint however, is that the film had two segments that were a complete waste of time. One sequence involved a musical number performed by the looming hawks, which offered no story development and was one of the least funny moments in the film... simply tacking 5 minutes onto the film's running time. The other sequence involved an overly familiar sacrifice scenario with Sid the Sloth. I can't help but imagine the writers were forced to cram this in so John Leguizamo (the voice of Sid) would feel like his character was given a story arc and some focus... b/c it served no purpose to the film. A film as lightweight and trivial as ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN shouldn't have any useless sequences making it run longer then necessary, and that's exactly what these two scenes were.<br/><br/>Overall, THE MELTDOWN makes for an entertaining night at the theater. (It's especially amazing how one dumb, ugly squirrel chasing an acorn never gets old). It's everything revolutionary film-making isn't... but it also has a lot of what popcorn blockbuster films for children should have, mixed in with enough jokes to keep the adults happy.<br/><br/>...

","A welcome return for Manny, Sam and Diego in this quality sequel. The plot maybe wafer thin but that doesn't matter when a film is this entertaining.<br/><br/>Still struggling with his beloved acorn is Scrat. Thankfully the director realised that he is by far and away the best creature in this film, pure comedy gold. Sandanha treats us to generous helpings of his trails and tribulations and in doing so surely give us some of the best comic moments that film will see this year.<br/><br/>Although flawed this film has more than its fair share of laugh out loud moments, good fun for young and old but I still stand by my belief that this film is wasted on kids!!!<br/><br/>http://seetocher.blogspot.com/"
"EvLauster","5","0","2","7 April 2006"," ""Ice, Ice"" Baby, held together with slap stick humor and annoying dialogue with somewhat of a rural dark atmosphere for a kids movie
","**1/2 Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Seann William Scott, Queen Latifah, Josh Peck, Jay Leno and Chris Wedge. Directed by Carlos Saldanha. A sequel to the 2002 original ""Ice Age"" only this time the three so-called friends Manny (Romano), Diego (Leary) and Sid (Leguizamo) are trying to make it out of the valley before the glacier melts. Of course cutting in and out with plot hole filler Scrat (Wedge), who is the star of the show, just looking for an acorn. While the trio are walking they run into a dang of opossums (Scott and Peck, the most annoying characters in the whole movie) and Ellie (Latifah, surprisingly descent) who thinks she too is a possum. ""Ice Age"" gets in the chuckles with annoying dialogue and quick one liners, while some of the material seems a little too dark for the audience it is meant for. My final rating 7/10"
"rlnutt","7","0","2","3 April 2006"," Parts are cute... not bad altogether!
","I watched the original after it came out on DVD and I partially snoozed through it even then. I wasn't expecting to completely 'love' this movie, or, totally hate it either... I was right on my assumption! <br/><br/>Some lines were really funny and the premise was pretty good too, but it dragged a bit and with the silly squirrel bouncing through giving everyone a slapstick laugh every now and then, it helped the movie move on down the road. I remember thinking at one time of what the squirrel character was doing in the movie... you find out at the end, but it had no purpose other than a brief interlude of silliness whilst the producers were trying to tell a potential love story forming between the two mammoths.<br/><br/>Don't spend full price on the movie, go to the matinée, or, better yet, just wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>Overall, cute but now great!"
"puscascristina","10","0","2","3 April 2006"," great, super, excellent !
","i totally enjoyed Ice Age: The Meltdown! The squirrel is again very funny and finally manages to do something right for mankind. But he also wants to get the ""forbidden fruit"" and gets kicked out of heaven. Pity! Mandy falls in love with Emily...an opossum, or at least that's what she believes she is. Finally she remembers her youth and starts falling for Mandy.<br/><br/>I expected a lot from the movie and got exactly what i expected. since I've enjoyed the first movie as well I couldn't wait to laugh some more. and I did! Emily is the funniest and the cutest. she is the total ""blonde girl"", little silly but how cute! you couldn't but love her! and Mandy is so naive when tried to convince his buddies he is not in love.<br/><br/>a little drama , a little love and a lot of fun!"
"dhermatz","7","0","1","2 April 2006"," Ice Age 2
","This movie wasn't as good as the first one. I was kind of let down by this one. I had a lot of expectations of it. It was still a really cute and adorable movie for the kids which is why i gave it a 7. But with the first one as an adult i loved it. I didn't get the same vibe as i did with this one.<br/><br/>I don't think they added enough danger to the story-line. In the first one you were on the edge of your seat wondering if they were going to defeat the other tigers. But there was no real on the seat moments. I didn't like how they tried to tie a love story into it. Its a kids movie, kids these days are learning about these things earlier and earlier. I always see movies with love stories. I didn't want to see one with Ice Age 2.<br/><br/>As always the characters were funny and fun to watch. <br/><br/>But still a great movie to take the kids to. They will enjoy it."
"stuartpiles","6","0","2","2 April 2006"," It is fun, but not as much as the first
","I liked Ice Age 2, The Meltdown..It moved faster than I thought it would, and I enjoyed seeing the main characters again. The love interest was interesting, but not what it could have been. I am not sure how it could have been made better.<br/><br/>Certainly this film was good, very good. To me, it had only one purpose, and that was to make me laugh, and it did. I really wasn't anticipating a great film , but there could have been more laughs. As sequels go, well it wasn't as good as the first, but we all know, that almost none are. It was great to see Scrat again (Wiley Coyote) and many of the gags were excellent. Sid was really a star here, and I enjoyed the mix of spectacular special effects along with the gags of the motley crew searching for a way out of their current situation. One particular song with the vultures, was especially fun. I enjoyed this movie very much, and it came through. That is all one can expect these days. As they say, it worked, and as we know, many don't."
"lanelm","8","0","1","2 April 2006"," Better than the first!
","I went to see this film with my nieces, not even hoping for a laugh. However, I did not count on the little gem of a pack rat, I and my wife at one stage were in tears with laughter, I thought at one stage I was going to have an anuerysm ( probably spelt wrong ) the pack rat stole the show.... I could not breath, and for just these few moments I could forgive a poor storyline and lack of direction. The animation is excellent, I remember re-counting to my wife, 'have you seen the wet fur!'. The film is well worth seeing, yes its a cliché, but its a feel good film and well worth a visit, its not deep, its not groundbreaking but it is good wholesome entertainment!"
"etsm92","7","0","1","2 April 2006"," Better than I expected
","Ice Age: The Meltdown/2006/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Queen Latifah Josh Peck Seann William Scott<br/><br/>Hmmmm I'm still trying to think if three stars would cut it. I mean, I liked it but yet there were also some scenes for tiny, tiny really young kids who were extremely annoying to listen to in the theaters. But overall the movie was impressive. The color, the music and a few scenes that fit with the music that reminded me a bit of ""The Lord of the Rings"", the characters especially Sid (John Leguizamo). He's amusing. Then there's Manny and Diego (Ray Romano and Denis Leary) who seem to amuse themselves making fun of Sid just like in the original. Then there are the three NEW main characters, Ellie, Eddie, and Crash (Queen Latifah, Josh Peck, and Seann William Scott). The two guys were REAL possums and Ellie thinking she's a possum but she's really a MAMMOTH. Manny gets furious when she can't get that through her. So what's the story this time? Well in the original the mission is to head south because of all the ice. Now it's heading in a different direction to get away from all the water. All caused by that idiot Scrat (squeaks by Chris Wedge) and his stupid acorn. Even though it's funny to watch him sniff around and twitch to find his acorn, it's also painful. He looks for it and then falls down and hits his head hard or anything else that causes pain. You feel sorry for him when he can't find or have it especially at the end. You'll see So everyone knows this so-called ""meltdown"" is going to happen not just from the wannabe news reporter named Fast Tony (Jay Leno) but because they believed it after hearing a few hawks say it. The hawks are excited for everyone to die in the meltdown so they can find some meat to eat (""Food Glorious Food""). So the movie continues with amusement here and there also with a little romance involving Manny mainly and Ellie who is not too fond of the way Manny speaks to her about them needing to reproduce but actually is flattered when he compliments her gigantic butt saying he is so sweet. And he saying, ""Yeah, that's the biggest darn butt I've ever seen!"" Please if I ever said that to a girl anywhere I probably would have been slapped or worse I would rather have kept it secret. Sure if girls were so crazy about it and got complimented about it more than they didn't I would have let it out if I saw an extremely large woman on the street. ""Hey, your butt's looking enormous today! Eat some more, why dontcha! Have a great day now!"" Cartoons and their weird embarrassing humor, what can I say? I would have to say the original Ice Age and this one are both the same in rating like some originals and sequels are. But in the original Ice Age at least I had the advantage of not hearing a bunch of kids going 'HAAAAAAAAA!!!!' while I just smiled. Movie directed by Carlos Saldanha."
"The_Invader","8","0","1","2 April 2006"," I Actually liked it!
","The ice is melting, its going to flood. The dam is going to break. All the animals head over toward a large ship at the end of this icy valley.<br/><br/>This is pretty much the plot of the movie, but in between were some awesome and laugh-out loud funny scenes in it. It brings back all the good voice actors with some great new voices like Queen Latifah.(I think it fits her perfectly) But its the little vermin, Crash and Eddie; who steal the show. There are minor flaws, like some continuity, but you can't notice them unless you're only there to spot them. And some time the settings seem a little unlikely. All in all I completely loved this film, and I was laughing like crazy throughout. If you have kids, bring them, because they are going to love the hilarity of the entire thing.<br/><br/>8/10 Watch this movie."
"cherer_500","9","0","1","2 April 2006"," this isn't melting at all
","Wow!!!!!!! i must say i had a very good time watching this movie. Everything seemed to fit perfectly, even the ""love story"" between Many and the female mammoth. I think Diego should be a more relevant character in this story, but anyway, this movie was better than the original ICE AGE.!!! and this is quite impressive, considering the sequels that Hollywood makes. Sid made me laugh a lot and the other characters as well. Its a familiar movie, but the adults will have a great time too. the little Squirrel (Scrat?) was very funny.I hoped to see the little boy of the first movie (like an adult , of course) but It seemed it was irrelevant to the public. Well, anyway, it was a Very good movie!!"
"liross4","9","0","2","2 April 2006"," A Movie for the Whole Family
","Ice Age is an enchanting movie that will delight children and adults alike. With wonderful values of family and loyalty to friends, the message in this movie can be appreciated on many levels. But the highlights of Ice Age are the beautiful animation, particularly the fur that looks so real you could touch it. And the Scrat is absolutely charming in his never-ending quest to obtain as many acorns as he can, regardless of the danger or consequences. When his eyes narrow down to slits in anger at a stolen acorn, you really want to cheer for him to get that acorn back! The children's favorite will be the possum twins, with their devilish antics. But true to the values of loyalty to family in this movies, the twins rally to save Ellie when it really counted. Take the kids and grandkids to see this one."
"SwitchBL8","9","0","2","2 April 2006"," Excellent sequel
","Excellent sequel to the original Ice Age. Scrat's appearance is superb, even better than in the original. His devotion to collecting nuts was used by the creators to the max. He sure made me laugh a lot. The trio Manny, Sid and Diego are once again inseparable. They became the ""herd"" that they talked about in the first movie.<br/><br/>The mixture of the story and the theatrical/musical-like interludes make this movie very entertaining. This mixture makes the movie enjoyable for everybody and for all ages. It reminds me of the old Disney movies, where colorful and art-like interludes where always part of the movie. The movie contains a lot of humor, it contains danger, of course love, fear.<br/><br/>What the creators could have done a little better, is to change the look of the characters a bit. After all, some time has passed between the original and this movie.<br/><br/>Sound effects are very good. I can hardly wait for the DVD-version. Hopefully they release it in DTS, and not in DD first and later in DTS (the Special Edition) like they did with Ice Age 1.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
