"roland-scialom","10","81","88","9 November 2009"," Grandeur and noblesse, when death is seen as a prolongation of life
","The human dimension of this film touched me. Some of these things touched me to tears. I list a few of them.<br/><br/>1. The job of the professionals who prepares the dead for their last contact with the family (wake) and their passage to eternity (cremation). In the film, the characters who perform this job, teach the spectator a true ritual of respect and affection with the dead. ""Respect and affection with the dead"": feelings that the modern life tries to banish from its practices. In the modern world, the dead are inconvenient and dispatched quickly in funerals where the majority of those who are present, entertain themselves with parallel talks, instead of focusing on the reason why they are there.<br/><br/>2. The nobility and grandeur of this job that, in the film, is not associated with any religion, and is directly associated with dealing with human beings. This nobility and grandeur reflects also on to the dead, in the sense that it reminds us that the dead deserve our respect and affection, because a new stage of our relationship with them is starting.<br/><br/>3.The way Daigo grows, as he learns this job, and overcomes (i)the social stigma that society imposes upon the contact with the dead and, also, the people who have contact with the dead, as well as (ii) his personal repulsion with repulsive material aspects of death (odors, rot, etc.)<br/><br/>4. The way Daigo grows, as he incorporates the nobility and grandeur of the job he was forced to do because of the circumstances (he was jobless because the orchestra where he played cello was dismissed). And, when his wife discovers in what consists his job, and tries to force him to quit, he has grown so much that he chooses to keep the job instead to yield to his wife menaces.<br/><br/>5. The way Daigo grows and which leads him back to play the cello and celebrate life more than ever, playing outdoors and playing at home as he used to do when he was a boy.<br/><br/>6. The way Daigo wife grows when she has the opportunity to look close to the job of her husband, and begins to admire him and love him more. Wife who have the opportunity to convince Daigo to take care of his dead father, when Daigo runs away when he gets aware of his father death. Wife, who, when the opportunity showed up, says with pride to the individuals of the funeral, that were almost doing a dirty job with the deceased Daigo father, ""my husband will take care of him, he is a professional""<br/><br/>7. The way Daigo grows when he encounter again the love for his father and forgive him for having abandoned the family, while he prepares his old man for the burial.<br/><br/>8. How death can be seen as part of life process, when it causes some people to become aware of how much love they missed, and how much they have been loved without being aware of it.<br/><br/>All this happens because Daigo goes back to his hometown, a small town. That is, the return to his origins helps to renew the ties with the traditions and helps the character to put himself together again.<br/><br/>I'm omitting many precious details that appear throughout the film. These details must be seen personally, because the film was made with great sensitivity and expertise, and deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>Roland."
"Gordon-11","Null","19","19","20 March 2010"," A very powerful film
","This film is about an unemployed man taking up a job as a person who prepares body before putting into the coffin.<br/><br/>""Departures"" is a beautiful film. It is about the last journey before a person is reduced to ashes, yet it never feels gloomy. In fact, it shows that all humans die one day, and it is how we view it and how those left behind cope with death that matters. Kobayashi treats the bodies with such enormous respect and dignity, which touches me a lot. ""Departures"" is a film to feel. It makes you think and feel about such a taboo topic which is not normally discussed. I commend the filmmakers for making ""Departures"". It's a must see."
"swang8688","10","41","44","24 February 2011"," Beautiful Movie- I disagree with reviews
","I have read many reviews on this movie and have been surprised by what I saw. I saw many reviews with comments such as this didn't deserve its Oscar win and that this movie was far from a masterpiece because it was too sentimental and exaggerated.One person proposed showing less scenes of him with the cello, speeding up the movie, and cutting out scenes with long stares. I disagree and believe that this movie is beautiful the way it is. This movie is not overbrimming with sentimentality; it has a good amount for such an emotional film. The scenes with the cello and the birds represent the passion and emotions he feel. We don't call Shakespeare's long poems sentimental so why do we call this work of Japanese art that? The more I heard the music I felt like the more I understood the movie. Western movies sometimes disregard time in movies allowing action to follow action. This movie was simply about the meaning of living knowing that we would die. The long, drawn out silences were necessary to convey emotions. If you have studied many Asian cultures, you know that they convey emotions not through words but through silence. The silences give us time to ponder and think about the questions raised, something we are often not given in bang bang action American films.As a musician, I feel like this whole movie is like song filled with much raw emotion."
"ethSin","10","106","120","19 March 2009"," The odd job
","""Okuribito"", literally ""The person who sees off"", is about a supposedly untalented cellist's new job. After returning to hometown as a failure in the music world, he applies for a job with vague description. It turns out to be a job posting for ""encoffiner"", a person who performs rites and rituals before placing the body into the coffin. A 'tainted' job in the eyes of the society, but he eventually develops pride and purpose in this profession.<br/><br/>The movie started with subtle humor that had me chuckling for first hour, but I was slowly drawn into the story. It turned out to be a very touching and deep film.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was superb. Motoki Tomohiro's performance was especially amazing, hilarious at times, and played the serious and professional scenes very convincingly. I also really liked his narration, which really sets the mood and tone of the following scenes. Yamazaki Tsutomu was also excellent as the protagonist's cool mentor. The film had incredibly nice flow and very well-directed. Music in this movie played a huge role, expressing the protagonist's feelings and harmonized with every scene. It was simply beautiful.<br/><br/>This movie gave me a glimpse of the profession of ""encoffiner"", as a very respectable job, as it requires absolute accuracy, professionalism, and the respect for the dead even though it is looked down by the society. It is the encoffiner who sees off a person's last journey after dressing them up. This movie successfully depicts the pride in one's job, and questions the meaning of death."
"Metin_7","9","103","121","13 April 2009"," One of my all-time favorite movies
","It had been years ago since a movie moved me so much that it had brought tears to my eyes, but I couldn't keep my eyes dry while experiencing Okuribito. The story, acting, music and photography are all very impressive.<br/><br/>I guess everyone can in some way relate to the emotions that are conveyed in Okuribito. In my humble opinion this movie is a classic in the likes of Akira Kurosawa's and Yasujiro Ozu's best work: subtle, elegant, serene, soulful, touching and timelessly beautiful. This kind of cinematic storytelling stands high above the usual formula-driven, soulless, commercial Hollywood crap."
"DICK STEEL","10","146","175","3 March 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Departures
","By now almost everyone would have heard of this Japanese film Okuribito (Departures), given its win in the recent Academy Awards, clinching the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, beating the likes of crowd favourite Waltzing With Bashir, and the Palme D'or winner The Class. And now after watching it, it's no surprise really, because if I were to go tongue in cheek, it's the novelty factor, given that the Academy would never have conceived upon the notion that a film coming from Asia and filled with death, corpses and coffins, would be anything but a horror film. Seriously though, Departures have Awards written all over it, with fine acting complementing a strong story to tell.<br/><br/>I suppose the equivalent of a ""casketer"" in local context, would be the embalmer. And it's without a doubt a profession most misunderstood, and shunned because of our innate fear of death. We choose to avoid death where it had gone, and being an embalmer would unlikely be on any kid's wish list of professions. Despite the stereotypical negative connotations, it is a profession that is quite dignified, because the professional is entrusted with the responsibility of helping the loved ones of the deceased cope with the passing on, and to help ease the pain in bringing some colour before the final journey to either the burial ground, or crematorium.<br/><br/>Departures demystifies this profession in the Japanese context. And like all things Japanese, the process comes with an elaborate ritual of preparation, cleansing and presentation, all done with great precision, skillful grace and utmost respect for both the deceased, and the family members. The profession depicted here in the film, is one of the highest order, where we see exactly how the casketers go about their job, and the separation of duties with the undertaker.<br/><br/>Masahiro Motoki (last seen in The Longest Night in Shanghai) stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi, a cellist in an orchestra who dreams of going places around the world with his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) in tow. Unfortunately for him, his orchestra folds and he is forced to sell his expensive white elephant since he doubts he could make his passion into a successful career. Dejected, he convinces his wife to retreat back into the small town he came from, living in the house his late mother had left behind, in order to start a new life. Little did he know when responding to a job classifieds that a typo had given him the impression he would be in a career that involves travel. The boss of the shop Ikuei Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) hires him on instinct, and as the saying goes, the rest is history.<br/><br/>For the curious, the film is an excellent medium to showcase the profession and to do so in good light. We come to learn the craft behind the job, and the necessity of it all, be it dealing with grieving family members, or taking care of bodies that are bound for autopsies. Departures paints through Daigo's experience, the varying spectrum of emotions that one as a service provider would have to face, as we journey with him from novice level. All's not doom and gloom of course, as director Yujiro Takita paced the film with well meaning humour  again never slapstick or disrespectful  throughout the narrative.<br/><br/>The story by Kundo Koyama also excellently portrayed Daigo's relationships with his wife and with his mentor, where the former was like a rubber band waiting to snap because of Daigo's deliberate attempts to not tell his lovely wife what he's up to for a career in order to shield her from the taboo. With the latter from whom he picks up the tools of the trade from, there's a surrogate father figure which he never had while growing up, resulting in some pent up hatred toward his dad who walked out on the family when he was young.<br/><br/>It's an extremely moving piece of drama that doesn't get bogged down by melodrama, and I thoroughly enjoyed its themes of reconciliation, forgiveness and best of all, being a professional and serving with pride. It's a fantastically crafted film with an excellent cast all round, and shatters all taboos that come with the profession of a ""casketer"". I know it's cliché to say this, but Departures will be a strong contender when I compile my list of top films for the year. It's been some time already where I'm equally entertained and moved by a film, and without a doubt, do not let this depart from our local cinemas before you get a chance to watch it on the big screen. Highly recommended!"
"CountZero313","8","78","91","18 February 2009"," the rituals that sustain us
","Almost three decades since starring in Juzo Itami's classic The Funeral, Tsutomu Yamazaki once more shines in a tale woven around the rituals, traditions and theatre involved in Japanese death rites. The irreverence that makes Itami's classic such a delight is present here. Daigo's first day on the job playing a stiff in a DVD for the funeral business comes back to haunt him in hilarious fashion later on. However, there is also reverence, the film respectfully pointing out that the people who do this necessary but thankless task do not deserve the disdain and revulsion that their profession often attracts.<br/><br/>Daigo loses his job as a cellist, returns to his inaka roots and stumbles into a job as an undertaker. Too ashamed to tell his wife, he slowly warms to his apprenticeship under the masterful tutelage of Sasaki. As he goes about his business, the inevitable traumas of a childhood long forgotten bubble to the surface as he goes about re-acquainting himself with the town. The conduit for the negative feelings towards his profession is Daigo's wife Mika, who takes punitive steps on discovering his new employment.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Kundo Koyama has to take credit for a script that moves along briskly, juxtaposing black farce with raw tenderness, all done seamlessly, and acutely observed. Lipstick on a corpse produces gales of laughter, and you are reminded that sometimes the best fun is had at funerals. Daigo moves towards a form of reconciliation and redemption through the promptings of those around him, and the comfort of his cello.<br/><br/>It would be all too easy for material like this to lurch into sappy sentimentality, but the film tugs at the heartstrings without overtly manipulating its audience. Motoki has to take some plaudits for this for a performance that amuses at times but hints at deep inner turmoil at others. Hirosue is less consistent, at times indulging in the head-bobbing, giggly, saccharine sweet girlishness that is the forte of the Japanese TV drama actress. She has one line in the climactic scene of such stunning obviousness I am surprised it stayed in, but for the most part she redeems herself in the tense interactions with Motoki over their differing views on his new career. Overall, she convinces as the supportive but put-upon wife.<br/><br/>From Kurosawa's Ikiru through The Funeral and now Okuribito, Japanese cinema has a rich vein of movies that exploit the rituals of death. How those rituals comfort us, enchant us, and see us through to a place where the pain still exists but might come to an end, is laid bare in Okuribito. It is an absorbing, moving tale, full of laughter and tears, that celebrates the intricate details of a Japanese rites of passage while laying bare their universal function. Best seen in the cinema, to get the full effect of the luscious orchestral score."
"Chris Knipp","9","23","25","6 July 2009"," The power of ritual in life and death
","Masahiro Motoki is a good comic mime, a useful talent for depicting a Japanese in distress. He plays Daigo Kobayashi, a young cello player who faces the end of his chosen career when the Tokyo symphony orchestra he is part of is dissolved by its owner. He doesn't think he has the talent to get into another orchestra so he sells his expensive cello (which he's still paying for) and moves back to his town in the country. His wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) assents to this with brave smiles. There's a house there for them that his mother left him.<br/><br/>And then comes the job. Daigo answers an ad that's promising. ""Departures,"" it says. He assumes something in travel. Easy hours, good pay. The boss hires him immediately and gives him a wad of bills. Only trouble: the work is ""encoffination,"" or putting dead people into caskets for cremation. (""Departures"" was a misprint for ""Departed."") This is where Motoki gets to make funny faces as he struggles with surprise, discomfort, and out and out nausea. The first corpse his boss Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) takes him along to work on is an elderly lady who was dead two weeks before she was found, and it's summertime. After this ordeal he can't face dinner without retching. He hides from his wife what he is doing. But the pay is good and the boss is a decent man and he needs work so he stays on.<br/><br/>In professional lingo Moviefone calls this movie ""a feel-good dramady about death."" Younger people, already sick of the Academy's easy Oscar choices, mocked its members for giving the Best Foreign prize this year to 'Departures' over the edgy Israeli animation about war trauma, 'Waltz with Bashir.' Yes, 'Departures' is softer; but it has depths and its subject is universal. I'd listen to the octogenarian wisdom of the veteran New York critic Andrew Sarris, who calls this ""the most moving film I have ever seen commemorating the bonds between the living and the dead."" <br/><br/>It's also a lesson in the beauty of Japanese tradition that expresses those bonds. Not so long ago, as Sasaki explains to Daigo, Japanese families prepared their own departed. Now the funeral agents and the casket preparers (Sasaki is the latter) have moved in. But the process still retains traditional honesty and grace. In a process both elegantly respectful and forthright, the body is prepared in front of the assembled family mourners by the funeral professionals. (Sasaki turns out to be a very good one.) In a series of graceful gestures. the body is wiped and cleaned, undressed, turned, and re-clothed, the face caressed, the hands smoothed and placed together just so, all with the deftness of motion that is the Japanese genius, and always discretely shielding the flesh of the deceased from the view of the watchers. Then, well wrapped, the body is gently laid in the casket. The mourners may come forward and say their goodbyes before the box is closed. Shortly thereafter it is taken to a crematorium. Daigo quickly masters the respectful drama of this process, particularly the way the face and hands are manipulated and the clothing is moved, and comes to appreciate the profound emotional meaning it has for the mourners. It's both a leave-taking of the person and an acknowledgment that the deceased is really already gone. Of course immensely complex feelings are involved. Daigo settles into the work. Nonetheless he continues to hide from Mika what he's doing.<br/><br/>When she finds out, she goes home to her mother, promising to return only when Daigo quits the job. But the way he enjoys playing his small but tuneful childhood cello again now shows he accepts his new circumstances and is not unhappy. Daigo's roots in the town are symbolized by the old bath house where he goes to cleanse himself after the dressing of the decomposing old lady on his first days's work. It is run by another old lady, Tsuyako (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), the mother of his former best friend. When she suddenly drops dead and Mika returns for the encoffination ceremony, she realizes the beauty and importance of the ritual Daigo performs for Tsuyako's family. Daigo's father ran a café in their house and went off with a young waitress when he was a boy, abandoning him and his mother. He hates his father and doesn't want to know anything about him. But when by chance -- or more accurately screenwriter Kundo Koyama's obvious arrangement -- he learns about his father's death, Mika pushes him to go and do the ceremony himself, with her at his side, and this time the ritual is a profound personal healing process for Daigo himself, whose tears pour down as he performs it. When a few months pass and winter comes Mika comes back to live with Diago after she discovers she's pregnant, even though she still wants him to quit the job. The film underlines how humble and traditional roles are essential to a society, even as it looks down on them, by showing the dignity of the encoffination process; of the man who handles the cremations; of old Tsuyako running the comfortable old bath house that her son wanted to close and turn into more profitable real estate.<br/><br/>This film is a tribute to the magic and comfort of human ritual. Hence the encoffination process is shown repeatedly, even behind the end credits. It's what the film is about: everything else is footnotes to this ceremony. Sometimes the mourners make it tumultuous, embarrassing, or comic. But it retains the beauty of a culture that knows the value of theater. Takita's movie is more than the sum of its sometimes sentimental or obvious parts. In the beauty of its most humdrum moments, with its focus on everyday family necessities (it celebrates food too), 'Departures' is not at all remote from the quintessentially Japanese quotidian grandeur celebrated in the film masterpieces of Yasajiro Ozu."
"ikhanh","10","74","93","1 September 2008"," Okuribito ""departures""
","easily the best movie i have seen in a long while. i just saw this movie during the 2008 Montreal world film festival. it is about a cellist(Daigo)who loses his job and must move back to his hometown. once back there he reconnects with his past, and comes to terms with his life, love and dreams.<br/><br/>desperate to find a job, he answers an ad listed under departures, which turns out to be misspelled. it was supposed to say the departed, the job pertains to dressing, washing, and putting makeup on the deceased before the funeral.<br/><br/>it is a job that most people look down upon because you earn money when someone dies. At first Daigo, does not like his job but little by little he comes to a new understanding of it. the process of prepping the corpse is shown in detail within the context of the story, and little by little we too as an audience get sucked in. it is an incredible ceremony to witness. the undertaker handles the corpse with the utmost reverence and care, every touch of the deceased is done with care and always with perfect precision. we realized as we watch that the deceased are shown the the utmost and ultimate respect before they leave us for good. it is a beautiful and solemn act that will make you cry.<br/><br/>there are many other subplots that all tie up at the end bringing everything full circle. watching this movie one does not feel like we are preached to yet it is powerfully effective in making us realize how every moment is precious and we should not take things for granted. so ironic, a new comprehension on life while communing with death...<br/><br/>this movie will not likely be shown in north America, but if you have the chance to see it i do recommend it strongly"
"khatake","10","113","151","25 August 2008"," Marvellous!!! One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!
","Probably the best movie I've ever seen. I have seen it at the 32nd Montreal World Film Festival and I hope it'll be well awarded! Even though the plot line is the ""death"", it's done with such kindness, softness and emotion (every little thing in the Japanese culture is made like a piece of art) and being able to make us feel so much emotions concerning the subject was really enjoyable. It's really a must see, the music is so captivating in every moment of grief. I had to hold my tears 5 times at least. I was also glad to see Tsutomu Yamazaki, I hadn't saw him since Tampopo... that was years ago (there are not a lot of Japanese movies to see in french theaters.)"
"ironhorse_iv","8","7","7","7 January 2016"," Before you departed from this earth, go see this movie! It's very interesting and remarkable.
","It's very surprising to see a movie about the taboo practice of encoffinment, become so university praise by critics. You would think, this movie would, fall under the radar of American & Japanese society, because of the dark subject matter; however, this movie became one of the highest-grossing domestic Japanese films of that year. It was even, a bigger hit international abroad; winning many awards from critics like the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2009. However, for me, I saw it as a one-time watch. A good movie worth checking out, but not worth revisiting, time after time, again. Loosely based on 'Coffinman', a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, and originally titled ""Okuribito"" means ""the sending away""; Departures follows the story of a young man, Kobayashi Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nōkanshi—a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his family and friends, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he must try to earn their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Can Kobayashi Daigo achieve that or will he be disconnect from his family & friends for the rest of his life? Watch the movie to find out, if you want to! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie by director Takita Yojiro was very informative to how Japanese culture prepare their dead for the afterlife. This is pretty much, the main appeal of the film for me. To see, what steps, it takes for them to prepare their dead is very interesting; and I'm not known for having a morbid curiosity for such things. You really do learn, a lot about Japanese culture, by watching this. However, besides those, the movie doesn't have much, going for itself. Yes, the classical cello music by composer Joe Hisaishi was indeed beautiful to hear and some of the film is very well-shot, but as a main stream appeal; it doesn't really have some. It's morbid curiosity at its best. I really don't know, if American audiences would revisited this film, time after time, again like me. After all, the film moves in a somewhat slow, heavy-handed, and predictable pace. In my opinion, the conventional simple story is a little too-stretch out. The result of this, cause the movie to falls into a pit full of pointless filler scenes in the second act. Even, the third act, break up is very clichés. You can see it, coming from a mile away. However, most of the changes from the novel, in the climax for the film, was well-written and perform. I love the ending with the message stone. It was somewhat redeeming and heart-warming. As much, as it's sounding like, I didn't like the movie, I honestly did love it. The actors in the film are all, well-played. One thing, I'm pretty glad, the movie has, is English subtitles then English dubbing, because I would hate to see the movie suffer from bad lip sync. The subtitles really help a lot, because some of these rituals can seem somewhat confusing. After all, there are not many people that eat live squids, go to bath houses and drink Japanese tea in rituals ceremony, here in the States. It was nice to try to understand, such practices. I also kinda glad, the movie had some lighten moments. A good example is when Kobayashi and his boss, Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) are cleaning a body that they thought was a woman, but they find out, it's a man. However, one thing, worth noticing, about Japanese humor is how that joke and many after that, doesn't have that much of a punch-line, because the film tries too hard to be respectful. I think, this film would work, better, if they allow more leeway in how they were able to portray the dead. Maybe there was a little too much calming, hypnotic grace with this PG-13 film. It mask people's fears, too much that humor and drama can't really shine through. I think this is why, the movie kinda suffers, when it comes to rewatch value. Maybe, it could had work better, as an R-Rated film, but that's just a maybe. Anyways; Overall: Departures is alright movie. Somewhat overpraise, but still a great film worth checking out. After all, it's nice to see films like this, reverse prejudice against a once taboo subject."
"hige-1","10","76","103","20 September 2008"," Best Japanese film in 2008!
","Beautiful and touching movie about life and death. My favorite movies dealing with the same issue are Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" and ""Red Beard"". Also, Juzo Itami's comedy ""Funeral"" is pretty good one. Same as these master's works, Director Takita successfully put good comedy elements in this serious film. The idea ""Death is a gate for another world"" may be based on Buddhism belief, but I am sure you can relate yourself to this story with your own experience of losing somebody important. Masahiro Motoki was at his best for the leading role. He once played similar role in ""Sumo Do, Sumo Don't"" by Director Masayuki Suo (Shall We Dansu?) in terms of being put in awkward situation, involved seriously and end up finding the virtue in it. Music score is by Joe Hisaishi. Great as always. He has done great jobs on films for Takeshi Kitano and Hayao Miyazaki. I am sure this will be the best Japanese movie in 2008. 10/10"

","Many things can be told about this movie;How it remarkably handle the ""Dead"" issue, Meaning of life, family relations etc... But What I've mostly grasped from the movie is (I also witnessed that during my 6 months of stay in Japan) that the way the Japanese people do their job. Absolutely devoted, in perfect patience and discipline. No matter What they are doing and What the salary is... They could be a Waitress,a Garbage man or as in the movie; an encoffiner. They just concentrate and do their job. So if you got bored from your job, I simply recommend you watch this movie and compare yourself with the Guy in the Lead role.And think again."

When they are informed that his absent father has died alone in a fishing village, Daigo resolves his innermost issues with him.<br/><br/>The winner of Best Foreign Language Film of 2009 ""Okuribito"" is a touching movie with a beautiful and full of sentiments story about life and death. The idea of death as a gateway to the afterlife has been explored in many movies; but in ""Okuribito"" it is disclosed in an artistic and beautifully sad way, through a dramatic and respectful but never corny relationship with the families of the diseased person. This wonderful movie was awarded with thirty-one (31) wins and three (3) nominations to several film festivals, and is supported by an original screenplay based on the rich Japanese culture that brings the most different and antagonistic feelings to the viewer; magnificent direction and performances of the lead and support cast; fantastic cinematography, lighting and art direction; and a stunning and stylish music score. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Partida"" (""The Departure"")"
"shi612","10","37","48","8 March 2009"," Wonderful movie. I was moved.
","Wonderful movie. I was moved. The subject of the movie is a profession called 'Nokanshi', which is to cleanse, dress and make up a corpse before it is placed in a coffin. Centered in this profession, the story is strong and understandable. All side stories are effectively woven. This movie taught me that death is not a simple end of life, but it could even trigger reconciliation of those who hate someone.<br/><br/>Everyone dislikes a job to touch corpses. Therefore the classified advertisement is vague and the job interview is precarious, and the protagonist is fooled to join this business. In the classified ad, it said 'Tabi no otetsudai (Assisting travels)', but the boss said it is a typo and he corrected it to 'Tabidachi no otetsudai (Assisting departures)'. Then the protagonist faces miserable debut scene with rotten corpse left 2 weeks after death. But there are many humorous scenes in the first half, audiences get drawn into the story. Then he experiences some impressive episodes of nokanshi's work, and his father who abandoned him is mentioned.<br/><br/>Normally I don't cry at movies. But in this movie tears filled my eyes at several scenes, though it is never a so-called tearjerker film.<br/><br/>As for acting performances, Motoki Masahiro's acting is marvelous as well as his performance as a nokanshi. Yamazaki Tsutomu is the best casting too. However, for the wife of the protagonist, I think Hirosue Ryoko is too pretty and girlish and her acting is shallow."
"EUyeshima","8","10","11","13 March 2010"," Lyrical Film About Finding Passion in an Unlikely Profession
","Without irony, there is a funereal grace to this 2009 dramedy, so much so that one can sometimes hear the distinct echoes of film master Yasujiro Ozu (""Tokyo Story"") in director Yojiro Takita's subtle yet stately look at the business of preparing deceased bodies for their caskets. Ozu's influence can be felt most in the quietude of tone that reveals the inevitability of death with both grim humor and spiritual awakening. The film's lyricism rests on the mournful cello accompaniment of the protagonist, Daigo Kobayashi, a young cellist who finds himself jobless after his Tokyo-based orchestra is disbanded. Out of economic necessity, he and his sunny, supportive wife Mika move back to his late mother's house up north in Yamagata.<br/><br/>As outlined in Kundo Koyama's somewhat methodical screenplay, the story focuses on the challenge Daigo faces in finding one's place in life, no matter how dubious it may seem to others. Daigo, bereft of his passion, answers a job ad involving ""departures"", which leads him to believe the company is a travel agency. However, he quickly realizes the two-person operation is actually about preparing bodies for burial, ritually cleansing and cloaking them while the mourners watch. Initially aghast, he is convinced by the taciturn owner Mr. Sasaki that he is ideal for the role of assistant and offers him the job. He has to fight his own prejudices as well as others about the supposed unseemliness of his profession, including Mika, who finds out her husband's new profession and pronounces him unclean. Daigo, however, realizes he has found his passion in the pre-burial ceremony, and Sasaki teaches him the ropes in a way that recalls Juzo Itami's beloved 1985 comedy, ""Tampopo"".<br/><br/>Former boy-band singer Masahiro Motoki is genuinely affecting as Daigo, while Ryoko Hirosue brings a surprising layer of complexity to the perennially sunny Mika. The deadpan Tsutomu Yamazaki makes Sasaki the film's key gravitational element with a minimum of effort, while Kimiko Yo shows an offbeat quality as his office manager Yuriko. The cinematography by Takeshi Hamada is top-notch with some memorable images offered along the way (like Daigo playing his cello on a hilltop), and Joe Hisaishi's (""Kikujiro"") music score allows dramatic sweep without getting too epic. On the downside, the film runs too long at 130 minutes, and there are moments when the comedy is played too broadly and the sentiment laid on too thick. Still, the movie shows Japanese cinema still exudes a unique identity, and there is global vitality still in that country's film industry. A brief interview with Takita is the major bonus on the 2010 DVD."
"Jay_Exiomo","9","25","33","12 July 2009"," Death is not the end
","Fixating itself on the pretext of death as a strong stigma to the Japanese rather than on the necrophiliac titillation possessed by those outside this particular societal circle, ""Departures"" approaches this issue with credible poignancy made more relevant when seen as a mitigation by director Yojiro Takita and screenwriter Kundo Koyama to a prevailing Eastern taboo. Although slightly undercut by an ultimately predictable script, Japan's Oscar-winning entry for this year's foreign-language film category is thoughtfully expressive, portraying a morbidly incriminating profession with dignified grace.<br/><br/>Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) is a cellist for a symphony orchestra which disbands after a performance for failing to gather audiences. Having no job, he and his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) move to his hometown in his deceased mother's house where, upon answering a help-wanted ad he mistakes for a travel agency, he ends up as ""encoffiner""-in-training, helping his boss Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) perform a set of ceremonial rites for the dead before cremation. Aware of the social demonizing of such job, he lies to his wife about it until she learns of it anyway and pleads that he finds a ""normal job,"" an appeal he finds tough when he increasingly develops a meticulous fondness for his work.<br/><br/>Takita's charming and ultimately touching apologetic on mortality charts the disorderliness arising from an individual's social circle while he pursues his sense of purpose, with the titular itinerary suggesting more than the moribund ritual the film's protagonist is subjected to. Thus, it also becomes a plaintive meditation on Daigo's spiritual and moral development as he attends to the various abandonment issues that haunt him (a father who ran off when he was young and a wife that stigmatizes him for his newly found ""filthy"" career). Ultimately, ""Departures"" is as much a story of atonement as it is about dealing with mortality; that in order to fully embrace one's existence, it is necessary to cope with death -- both literally and figuratively -- while nurturing the bonds that exist among those who still live."
"Eternality","10","10","12","17 July 2010"," Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us.
","The surprise winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of 2008, Departures snatched home the golden man from favorites like Laurent Cantet's The Class, and Ari Folman's Waltz With Bashir. Directed by Yojiro Takita, the Japanese drama is in every way a deserving winner of the Oscar.<br/><br/>And I hope that with this win, more will realize that Japanese cinema is not all populist crap; it can be culturally rich and deeply intense too. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is the second Oscar win (in this century) for a Japanese film since Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001).<br/><br/>Departures tells a story of a young married man, Daigo, who loses his job as a cellist in an orchestra which is seeing dwindling audiences. He then chances upon a job advertisement and lands himself (unwillingly) as an assistant to an old, experienced professional who plies his trade in the coffin business.<br/><br/>While Daigo is understandably immensely uncomfortable with his work initially, the job grows on him as he consistently brings in the dough. He does ritual cleansing, dressing, and make-up for the dead during the funeral before they are put to rest in the coffin, or in short, encoffinment. Because of the nature of the job, Daigo's marriage falls apart and he feels unaccepted by society.<br/><br/>But that is just the surface of the story. Departures dwells into something more intrinsic to our hearts -loss, death, guilt, regret, family, and love - emotions and themes that are omnipresent in our lives, but are often difficult to convey in film.<br/><br/>Takita's picture reveals these with careful direction, honest acting, and a surreal music accompaniment (by the legendary Joe Hisaishi) to the film's many heart-wrenching moments. The characters are so well-realized that they take a life of their own; it is as if we know their entire life story, their painful past, and their hopes for the future.<br/><br/>Not only does Departures tug at our heartstrings, it is also an eye-opening observation of a job most will shun without hesitation. Is it a loser's job? Is it an unclean job? What the director does well is to convince viewers that it is neither. Through sprinkles of effective humor, Takita manages to bring a light-hearted warmness to the film, though this is ultimately overwhelmed by the sheer melancholia of it all.<br/><br/>Departures is a touching ode to those who have left us. It is also one of the best films to grace the screen in recent years. It is a powerful tearjerker and a reminder that embracing death can be a very beautiful thing too. Highly recommended! <br/><br/>SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","Views into cultures that visitors cannot experience are fascinating. Quickly reading the description of the film from the DVD jacket - I thought it was going to about the cello player and his family. Wow - was I wrong. However, the film is an accurate view into the stoic, unemotional Japanese persona. This was a hard film to watch. The marriage of the main character, young, attractive, healthy - is unconnected. They barely touch. They talk in generalities about unimportant things and never about what each is feeling. As the main character begins his journey into a new line of work - after being laid off from the symphony - we see how the Japanese face funerals without shedding a tear, silent. The 'coffiners' are more human, treat the deceased with more love, tenderness than we ever see the live people show each other. This somehow gives the mourners permission to allow themselves to show their sadness, their tears. This is not an action movie - don't watch it if you are sleepy or want to vege out and be entertained. This movies will take attention and your thoughts will wander to your own or loved ones mortality/death. It does not have any scenes of violence or grossness - CSI shows way more of the dead bodies. It is not a 'happy' movie - it will generate conversations."

","I watched this movie on a Japanese Airlines flight from Tokyo to London having previously sat through James McAvoy and Angelina Jollie in the appalling and callous Wanted.<br/><br/>Nothing in Departures could be more different. <br/><br/>Here you see where the real pain of death lies: in those who are left behind. That every life come to an end is someone's brother, sister, mother, son, father, wife, lover or friend. And this is what is explored in the film through the story of Dagio, a cellist who, with his wife, returns to the family house he'd been left by his mother nine years before. <br/><br/>Needing a job, he becomes the assistant to a man who washes, dresses and applies make-up to corpses in a ceremony that each family witnesses. And on one level it's about the deepening relationship between Dagio and this man - a growing father to Dagio - whose real father left when Dagio was six and whose face he can no longer see in his dreams. But this mentor/father-figure, a man of maybe seventy, is also moving towards his own death, and in one beautiful moment, we see him asleep on a sofa and Dagio tenderly tucking him in with a blanket; in the same way they both tuck the ceremonial sheet under the corpses they wash and dress.<br/><br/>It is also a movie about forgiveness and understanding: a father finally breaks down, weeps and accepts in death his cross-dressing son; and Dagio's own wife begins, when she actually sees what he does, to appreciate the value of the 'unclean' and strange job he has got himself.<br/><br/>Even Dagio's relationship with his mother is examined. He was not there for her funeral, because 'he was abroad' at the time; we assume, touring with the orchestra which has recently been disbanded. And he begins to play music again, with a new understanding, and to remember himself as a boy playing the the little cello that his mother and father bought for him. <br/><br/>Because finally the film is about art. About the cello. About transcending life's pain and turmoil. I was often reminded, while watching the movie, of the Korean film 'Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring'. About cycles of struggle, failures, disappointments, beginnings and deaths. Hugely recommended."
"dromasca","8","5","6","8 August 2009"," caring for the death, caring for the living
","The Japanese entry that received the Oscar for the best foreign movie deals with a theme that is not unique in the Japanese cinema - the death as a continuation of life, the caring and respect one owes to the dead which helps the living to continue with their own lives. It does it in a manner that is both emotional and serene, and the result is a film that will touch a cord for almost everybody who watches it.<br/><br/>The hero is a musician, and this fact plays a role in the film, as it gives a pretext for wonderful music to be inserted and create the appropriate atmosphere or counterpoint in certain moments. He has to quit his profession when the orchestra he was playing in is disbanded and returns to his home city together with his beautiful and seemingly almost smiling wife. By accident - he is misreading a newspaper add - he is hired by an agency that cares for the bodies of the dead before cremation, a work so low class that he cannot even tell his wife about it. It's well paid however and he takes it, and then he is confronted with the reality of the 'departures' - his employer is an artist in the profession of making the final moments of quitting this world honorable for the dead, but especially kind and memorable for the remaining family. And we will all become convinced by the end of the film that this is how it should be.<br/><br/>The film certainly belongs to the category of melodrama, but then it is good quality one. Most cinema viewers are not ashamed of dropping a tear when something moves them in the movie and appreciate directors, actors and story writers who are capable to induce such emotions. It tells also a lot to the non-Japanese viewers about conflicts between tradition and new pace of life, and about family relations and the role of the wife in the modern Japanese family. I am not familiar enough with the social and cultural details of Japan to make a judgment to what extent they are authentic, but they are clearly articulated and in a delicate manner. The film is maybe 10 or 20 minutes longer than it should be, but there are no long intervals when it becomes boring, so its length is supportable. It is wonderfully acted and viewers will probably remember for a long while the principal hero played by Masahiro Motoki, the older dead caretaker played by Tsutomu Yamazaki, and the wife Mika, played by the wonderful Ryoko Hirosue. Cinematography is simple and aesthetic, although the scenes of the hero playing music in the nature seem artificial and the filming of the mountain in the background is too many times repeated and apparently unjustified. Over all it is a good and moving film. Maybe it was not the best foreign film of the year, but it was quite a simple and obvious choice for the jury of the Academy."
"gradyharp","10","6","8","28 February 2010"," Departures/Arrivals: 'The gift of last memories'
","DEPARTURES (aka OKURIBITO) is an experience film, one of those graceful creations of cinema that finds the balance between comedy and drama, sensitive and sentimental, and is embellished by a wondrous musical score and glowing cinematography. Running time is in excess of two hours, but likely most viewers would elect to rewind and watch it again, so touching and vital is this story. <br/><br/>Daigo Kobayashi (the enormously gifted Masahiro Motoki) was raised by his mother when his father for some reason left his family when Daigo was only six years old: his last memory of his father is a quiet scene by the ocean when the child and the father exchange found rocks. Daigo was encouraged by his parents to learn to play the cello so that he could amount to something special as a man. Things happen: Daigo goes off to study cello, his mother dies and he doesn't attend the funeral, he marries Mike (Ryoko Hirosue), and spends all their money on a prime cello to gain admission to the major orchestra in the city. The orchestra plays to near empty houses and is finally disbanded. Daigo is without an income, sells his prize cello, and with Mika's blessing, returns to his hometown to live in the home of his childhood. He answers an ad for work, an ad that uses the word 'Departures' making Daigo think this is a travel agency. When Daigo 'interviews' with the owner (Tsutomu Yamazaki) he discovers that the job in one called 'encoffinment' (a Japanese ceremonial procedure of preparing, dressing & praying for the corpse before putting them in the coffin). At first repulsed by the job, Daigo gradually discovers the importance of paying final respects to the dead and preparing them for the life ahead, and his experiences with the new found beauty of encoffinment ties in with memories of his family, recalls his estrangement from his father, and reunites him with old dear friends who run a bath house, etc. Mika is spared the truth about her husband's new job, and when she discovers the truth, Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position. <br/><br/>Many experiences follow as Daigo encoffins all manner of people: there are some ugly scenes and some very humorous scenes depicting the variety of 'calls' Daigo gets. How the story winds down is not necessarily difficult to discern, but the manner in which the film ends is a work of great simplicity and beauty. Daigo's dealing with departures allows him to find his own arrivals. <br/><br/>Writer Kundo Takita and director Yôjirô Takita well deserve all the awards lavished on this perfect little film. But much of the success of this story about another way to view death is the astonishingly multifaceted performance by Masahiro Motoki, a beautiful man and an equally beautiful actor. This is a film to watch repeatedly and definitely one to add to the personal library of DVDs. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

"MartinHafer","9","5","7","1 January 2012"," An oddly beautiful film about death....
","I doubt that ""Departures"" would appeal to a mass audience. That's because while it is a beautiful and artistic film, it's also about death--a topic most folks are very hesitant to think about...let alone go to a theater to see. But, I strongly advise you to stick with the film--it's well worth seeing and I can see why this film received the 2009 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.<br/><br/>Daigo is a nice man. But, the orchestra in which he plays has been disbanded and he needs a job. He answers an ad in the newspaper for a job he THINKS has to do with a travel agency--not realizing that the job entails doing funeral rituals. Now this part of the film requires a bit of explaining, as such jobs are completely unknown in the USA. Instead of the mortician just picking up a dead body for burial (or cremation in most cases, as that is the Shinto tradition), there are people whose job it is to ritually prepare the corpse in front of the family--a strange way to handle a wake by Western standards. Now I am NOT being critical of this service--in the film, it had an odd sort of beauty and artistry about it. It's just very different from how death is handled in this and western countries. To understand exactly what I mean and what this process is, the film shows several such preparations by Daigo and his very likable boss. What happens next? See it for yourself.<br/><br/>Now HOW can this turn into a good film? Well, the movie found a way to balance all this--with respect for the dead, not making the film too graphic and maintaining a healthy respect for the characters. And, the final thing is the most important--as you really like and respect the characters. And, the film is chock full of wonderful supporting characters. Overall, it's a very sweet and gentle film--one you really have to make yourself watch. After all, death is just a natural part of life--and the film handles the topic wonderfully."
"griffolyon12","10","5","7","30 September 2009"," Beautiful and Emotional
","Death might just be the most sensitive subject to handle in the world of cinema. It's always riddled with emotion. If mishandled it can be disastrous, but if handled with a daft hand, the end result can be beautiful.<br/><br/>The Japanese film, Departures, is a film about death, atonement, and an appreciation of certain things that others find dishonorable. The film follows Daigo, a cellist for the Tokyo Philharmonic. When the orchestra is disbanded, Daigo and his wife move back to his hometown, where Daigo gets a job working as an encoffiner (people who prepare dead bodies for funerals). In Japan being an encoffiner is seen as a dishonorable profession, and Diago must come to grips with his change in fortune while also learning about the beauty of death.<br/><br/>Departures is an intriguing film, beautiful and highly emotional. To say that this is a moving film would not be doing it enough justice. The film is a fascinating piece of art. Director, Yojiro Takita directs the film much like Daigo plays the cello, with passion and intensity, often utilizing swelling crescendos and moments of silence to create genuine emotion. It is never manipulative, but simply beautiful.<br/><br/>The film is full of brilliant performances, in particular Masahiro Motoki as Daigo. Motoki delivers a performance that draws the viewer into the film. He takes you directly into the emotional state of the character, and he is a large part of the film's success. Of course it doesn't hurt when a film looks this beautiful and wondrous to behold. The cinematography is stunning. The film captures the beauty of the Japanese mountain ranges with so much clarity. To cap it all off, the musical score from legendary composer Joe Hisaishi is magnificent. Hisaishi's music always amazes me, but with Departures he has taken another step forward in his career.<br/><br/>The real treat of this film is that it laces all of the drama and tragedy with humor and heart. It's a recipe that just leaves you as the audience feeling uplifted rather than depressed. It's a film where if any tears flow, they will not be tears of sadness, but rather tears of hope.<br/><br/>After seeing this film I can definitely see how it deserved all of the accolades bestowed upon it (including the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar at the Academy Awards this past year). The film is brilliant. It is tough to find, but if you manage to find it online or playing somewhere near you, I strongly recommend seeing it and being moved by the power of this film.<br/><br/>I give this film a beautiful 10 out of 10!"
"socialmedia-437-956449","8","2","2","2 August 2012"," The Sacred and the Profane
","There are few films that delve into the Japanese art of beautifying the dead. Nonetheless, Yōjirō Takita's 2008 film ""Departures (Okuribito)"", which took home the best Foreign Language prize at the 2009 Academy Awards, does exactly that.<br/><br/>The film is loosely adapted from Aoki' Simmon's 2002 autobiography, ""Coffinman: the Journal of a Buddhist Mortician"". Hero Diago (played by former boy band heartthrob Masahiro Motoki) is a down-on-his- luck Tokyo cellist who loses his job when his orchestra disbands.<br/><br/>He returns to his remote hometown with his meek, adoring wife Mika (Riyoki Hurosue) and takes residence in his late mother's house in an effort to reinvent himself. He discovers a newspaper advertisement for what he thinks is a travel agency helping out with ""departures"", only to learn that the position is for a firm that specializes in departures of a very different kind. A departure from which no traveler returns: death. This fosters his initiation into the subtle art of ""encoffinment"". The story that follows is a moving portrait of living with death as our protagonist must overcome his revulsion at his new line of work, while confronting some personal demons.<br/><br/>The ensemble is appropriately dramatic. Particularly notable is the leading man as well as his mentor Mr. Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) who hires him and Yuriko Uemura (Kimiko Yo), a fellow employee at the funeral agency.<br/><br/>""Departures"" follows in the path of other distinguished Japanese cinema such as Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" and Juzo's ""The Funeral"". But while ""Ikuru"" and ""The Funeral"", focus more on the repercussions of death, ""Departures"" centers on the ceremony, the rituals of encoffinment and the passing into the afterlife. The film looks at abandonment, both in life and death as a cruel certainty. The film's greatest asset is its shimmering and poignant cinematography. A wind-tossed cherry blossom tree in such a film is inevitable, coming to life in spring to remind the Japanese that life is renewed after winter, only to die quickly after. In appreciating that transience, the Japanese seek to define themselves.<br/><br/>By framing the harshness of death with the gentle treatment of the dead at the hands of Diago, the audience sees how the caring preparation of the body allows it to be softly ushered towards the final stop. This juxtaposition simultaneously confronts the taboo role of a figure who continually faces death, but creates an art form; one which is imbued with kindness and beauty.<br/><br/>Aided by the use of classical music that decorates the soundtrack, Takita juxtaposes the sacred and the profane in a soft, pretty film lined with enough perversity to arrest the viewer. The film's alignment of the sublime and ridiculous is sparing, but enriches the tale.<br/><br/>In 2009, this film beat out the critically acclaimed, ""Waltz with Bashir"" and ""The Class"", to win the Best Foreign Film prize at the Oscars. Beneath its pretty, emotional façade lie many layers that touch on the grizzly yet entirely normal nature of mortality. It's all there if you scratch beneath the surface."
"meeza","8","2","2","31 January 2010"," Do not depart from Departures
","I recollect at the Academy Awards last year when Japanese Director Yojiro Takita departed from his seat to accept the Best Foreign Language Picture Oscar. Many, yours truly included, were shocked that the frontrunner ""Waltz With Bashir"" was upset by this small independent Japanese flick. I guess that was the last waltz for Bashir, and the Academy was turning Japanese, I think they were turning Japanese, I really think so. After experiencing ""Departures"", I am glad the Academy veered that way. ""Departures"" is a moving, endearing, and even semi-comical film about a young Japanese cellist named Daigo Kobayashi who gets unemployed from his orchestra gig. Therefore, he moves to his Japanese hometown with his wife where he takes a job in a funeral home preparing the dead for their departures. At first, he thinks that the job is travel oriented. But upon arrival to his departures job interview, he realizes that he has to be ""prettying up the dead"" on a daily basis. However, ""Departures"" does not depart from the humanistic narrative themes on Daigo still dealing with the hurt on being deserted by his father as a child, and his resiliency to support his newlywed wife Ikue. Director Takita and Screenwriter Kundo Kayama resurrect what could have a lifeless Japanese story with poignant affirming themes on: life appreciation, spirituality of a departure, and misconceptions of the field of funeral services. Takita does incorporate profound symbolist themes on the film's narrative with the cello, food, and stones. Japanese movie star Masahiro Motoki was mas de un hero with his engaging performance as Daigo. Motoki carried the film quite brilliantly. But I cannot depart from this film review by also stating that I do take a bow on the supporting acting ensemble of ""Departures"", most notably: Tsutomu Yamakazi's performance as Daigo's funeral boss Ikuei Sasaki was of commanding variety, and Ryoko Hirosue work as Daigo's wife Ikue was more than Okaey. Takeshi Hamada's phenomenal scenic cinematography was also an asset to the film which I did not want my eyes to depart from. So arrive to a ""Departures"" viewing as soon as you can. **** Good"

","Very nice film - good tear jerker as it takes audience on emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>Motoki gives believable performance and is quite convincing as a cellist. Although the scenes with him playing the cello in wildflowers with ice capped mountains in the background look so much like a Visa advertisement it was a bit too chocolate box. Also the end scene where he is crying over his father could have been a good 10 minutes shorter as the audience is so exhausted by then that there isn't enough energy to sustain them through that overly long emotional scene.<br/><br/>Hirosue's performance is as calming as hearing fingernails screeching down a blackboard for an hour. The horrible fake laughter and false cheer, accompanied by the girlish behaviour are really irritating. She ruined what should have been a dignified role as the long suffering ever respectable Japanese wife. If the film could be shot again without Hirosue I am sure the audience would feel a lot more empathy for the character and the movie would have a greater dimension.<br/><br/>It is charming to see the quite elaborate manners of the Japanese so nicely displayed, and it is this theme about showing respect for both the living and the dead which makes this a quintessentially Jpanaese movie.<br/><br/>Recommended!"

Yes it has a core of beauty, and the potential for being a superb, emotionally devastating film. But it isn't. It's a waste of its material. The one positive element was the ceremony, which at certain moments in the film was protected by a tone of solemnity from the lavish, exaggerated, coarse emotional manipulation on a level with the sappiest soap opera.

But then came scenes such as the ""face appearing in the rock,"" or the cello playing scene which made me squirm in my seat. They were in my opinion almost gruesome in this context.

","A Cello Player in a Tokyo orchestra loses his job after the Orchestra is disbanded. Together with his kind, gorgeous wife, they move to his hometown of YAMAGATA and start a new life in his late mother's house. He then chances to find a job in a company preparing dead people for cremation. The stigma of having a job in which he must touch dead people, soon gives way to people's respect for a profession that is as important and beautiful as life itself. The Japanese title of the movie - おくりびと (OKURIBITO) - literally means SENDING PEOPLE OFF and that's what the movie is about; But this beautifully written and exceptionally acted movie - which is ""perfect"" like anything else out of Japan - is an intense, philosophical contemplation on Life and ultimately rebirth through Death - which I have only seen in Abbas Kiarostami's ""THE TASTE OF CHERRY"" - and how people even in a traditional society like Japan sometimes fail to understand that we have been born to help each other make this world a better place and to love and forgive each other and respect our elders no matter how many mistakes they make; But this lesson is eloquently and modestly taught and learned. The heartbreaking denouement, where Daigo prepares his father's body for cremation and the cremation of the lady owner of the village Bathhouse are just two highlights in this gem of a movie which demands multiple viewings and deep reflection. The direction, screenplay, acting and cinematography are top-notch and the scenes with Fujisan in the background are strikingly shot and edited. Forgiveness is one of the greatest blessings ever granted to human beings and it's heartrendingly pictured in this deserved Oscar winner. Don't miss this one."
"johnnyboyz","7","3","5","10 June 2011"," Far from a Departure in form from in a recent canon of decent Japanese films, this film's exploring of a man in a niche career makes for impressive viewing.
","For a film so wholly indebted to death and the deceased, beginning with its title that alludes to such things and carrying on in the nature of what it is the lead eventually comes to do, it is quite remarkable just how celebratory of living Yôjirô Takita's Departures really is; a piece using these means and specific content more inclined towards those whom have passed as items for breathing life into a person's existence. Departures will eventually tell the story of a Japanese man seemingly approaching his middle age, as well as the apparent crisis on its way as a result of getting there, whom comes to find something totally out of the ordinary, and in a totally unexpected manner, which goes on to shift thinking's and attitudes for both himself and those around him, in what is a quite often fabulously played drama displaying a good eye for black comedy and rich character study.<br/><br/>Told in flashback, something I began as thinking was quite needless but brings certain resonances that creep up on you, the film documents a certain Daigo (Motoki); a Japanese man, of whom we sense is on the cusp of something big in his life, what with his partner; passions and skills he has in certain fields, but cannot quite pin down what. He is initially a cellist and a good cellist, but a redundant cellist after the principal of his orchestra announces, following a playing to a near empty auditorium we barely notice out of the fact the principal's pained expression dominates the screen, that the disbanding of the group is imminent. The following few sequences do very little to incline us into siding with Daigo; he slumps down at home in his charming Tokyo apartment and ponders, with his sizable instrument, just what it is he's going to do. His wife is the prim; softly spoken and rather sweet Mika (Hirosue), and she brings octopus back for dinner and tells him to cheer up 'cause he's still got her and her job brings in money and this nice apartment is still here and we all get to have exquisite seafood for dinner.<br/><br/>Decisions are made and the pair of them move to Daigo's hometown of childhood a fair distance away, in the more remoter regions of Japan; once there, the gunning for a job whose interview and house of operations is barely distinguishable from any other place of business, bar a couple of rather large caskets propped up against the side of the wall, plays out into the coming into contact with something thoroughly out of the ordinary. This new job is what appears to be a cross contamination between that of an undertaker and a maid; a job without, I don't think, a name in the English language – a job whose role it is to undergo a ritualistic process of smartly preparing a dead body, in-front of their family and loved ones, before placing them in their coffins for later funerals: it is a job that few desire and even fewer, it seems, look upon with anything more than mere scorn.<br/><br/>Early on, we feel this job exists merely to serve a purpose; that being, to pay the debts owed for the cost of his cello, a sum that, once eviscerated, will be able to see Daigo leave his post and start afresh with something else. This isn't necessarily the way, the film going on to document Daigo's exposure to such a career and his gradual coming to enjoy what it is he does in a refreshing fashion. When we first come to observe him in his new work surroundings, his employer Sasaki (Yamazaki) and the company's secretary appear odd or strange, even eccentric and whose socialism we don't wish to share. As expected, Daigo finds himself in the deep end early on, acting as an extra in a 'how-to' DVD giving way to his first call out with Sasaki seeing them deal with a body, whom has remained undiscovered for a fair while, acting as the inception into this chosen career. Daigo heads in, combating the sight of a dead body experienced for the first time as well as the terrible smell creating a putrid and somewhat unpleasant first exposure to things – all of it done and dealt with in a messy and comedic although significant manner.<br/><br/>Running parallel to the audience's own response to the material, in that at the beginning the majority of us feel alienated; perturbed and perhaps a little grossed out, Daigo's coming to enjoy what it is the film is about stands side by side to that of Mika's discovery; staunch rejection and then consequent realisation that the nature of the man's work is actually both rather brave; invigorating to watch and quietly fascinating without necessarily being morbidly so. Daigo's boss and his co-workers appear to become more normalised without ever actually changing their general characteristics, in what is a gleefully subtle addition to proceedings as mindsets change and frameworks play out.<br/><br/>Overlying everything is the fact that Daigo is a man whose prior exposure to death and the nature of grief has been largely negative thus far in his life; if not negative, then largely hollow, in that he missed his father's funeral on account of being oh, so very young and unable to attend for whatever reason, whereas the passing of his grandparents when he was still equally as young came and went without all those wondrous instances that time with grandparents can so often bring whilst a child. The error of Daigo's ways is in the dismissing of such things, the eventual job he acquires seeing him come to work with the deceased and, more important in this sense, those grieving before the understanding of the nature, or procession, of remembering one's dead that imbues this process is played out – the likes of which, with everything else, make for really involving viewing."
"Jackpollins","10","3","5","13 August 2009"," Definitely deserved the Oscar
","Departures, as you know, is the drama that surprisingly won the Oscar for best foreign picture. Me, having no idea what it was, went to see it since I was interested in it after it won the Oscar. I am happy to inform you that even with some of the other great foreign films from 2008, Departures definitely deserved the Oscar more than any of these other films. I'm not saying these other films are bad, I'm saying they're nothing compared to Departures. Masahiro Motoki is excellent as Daigo Kobayashi, an ex-violinist, who accidentally works at a funeral home. The film has a great mix of humor and heart. Daigo is a man we feel for, having to deal with death everyday, it must be hard, and there are some very funny moments, such as when the runner of the funeral home knows Daigo is inexperienced, but hires him anyway. I didn't go into the theater with very high expectations. Sure, it won the Oscar, but I never heard of it, but the film was excellent, poignant with great storytelling. If this didn't win the Oscar, and I saw it, it would of been ever more of a surprise than this winning the Oscar at the time."
"howard.schumann","9","3","5","21 June 2009"," Offers compassion and respect
","If subtlety and nuance are what you are looking for in a film, Yojiro Takita's Departures may not be your cup of tea. If, however, you are willing to overlook the film's overly broad strokes and focus on its quiet dignity and the inner strength of its characters, it may strike a responsive chord. Winner of the 2008 Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film, Departures is a film about the ritual of ""encoffinment,"" the preparation of corpses before their cremation. While it teeters between serious drama and outright farce and often seemingly can't make up its mind what genre it belongs in, it is a film of understated elegance that will leave audiences in a mood of contentment.<br/><br/>In the opening sequence, a cello player in a Tokyo orchestra is shocked when the orchestra's owner announces after a poorly attended concert that the group has been disbanded. The cellist, Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki), has been playing the cello since childhood and knows no other profession. To compound his distress, he owes over $100,000 U.S. which he borrowed to purchase his cello, a purchase he now reveals to his wife Mika (Ryoko Hisosue) for the first time. With little choice, he sells the cello and moves back with Mika to his hometown in Northern Japan to the house left to him by his deceased mother, a house that has many memories for Daigo, still embittered by his father's abandonment of the family when he was only six years old.<br/><br/>Combing the want ads, Daigo answers an ad for a job in ""departures"" that does not require any experience. Thinking he is applying for work in a travel agency, he soon finds out that he will be an assistant to Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki), a master ""nokanshi"" who tells him that he works with the ""departed"" -washing, dressing, and placing the deceased into a coffin in the presence of bereaved friends and family. In a segment of physical comedy, Daigo must strip down to a pair of adult diapers to participate as the corpse in a training video. After that, he is initiated in the difficult task of casketing the body of an old woman who has been dead for more than two weeks, a most unpleasant task.<br/><br/>Gradually, Daigo learns the profession, utilizing the creative, artistic skills he learned as a cellist. Though ""encoffinment"" is an ancient ritual, apparently there is a stigma attached to working with the dead, and Daigo is rejected by a childhood friend Yamashita (Tetta Sugimoto), and then by Mika who discovers the training tape and packs her bag to return to Tokyo, telling her husband that she will return when he has a ""normal"" job. Starting to play the cello again after he discovers the first cello his father gave him as a child, Daigo is shown with his cello playing in the countryside surrounding his home and also plays ""Ave Maria"" for Sasaki and his secretary (Komiko Yo) at Christmas time.<br/><br/>Now performing ceremonies on his own, Daigo must deal with his own feelings of sadness when confronted with the death of people close to him. Departures has its share of clichés but touches the heart and has a calming effect. At first put off by the work he is asked to do, Daigo learns to appreciate the value of ritual and how comforting it can be to the loved ones of the deceased and he personally comes alive when seeing how his work touches others. Competing with summer blockbusters filled with bombast and brutality, it is good to see a film that offers compassion and respect for the dignity and worth of all people."
"Ismedada","6","11","29","6 June 2009"," Bit disappointing
","Japanese movies always make me curious. A different continent, a different storyline. I was hoping for a very introvert tragic movie with slow pending movie shots. But..... The story did develop fast. I did not get acquainted enough with the main characters. Some moves/interaction/dialog's/motives I classify as unnatural, especially from the main characters wife. Immediately after the beginning there was some comedy in it. People in the cinema were even laughing and it didn't stop. For me comedy and tragedy do not work. At the end Some over the top Hollywood like feelings do their work as a tearjerker. Finally it all fits together. Must be the reason for the Oscar. Everybody happy minus some dead people. For me this is one of the movies I do not remember after a year. Nothing new. Bit disappointing."
"Hitchcoc","9","2","3","11 October 2010"," Heartfelt
","This is one of those films that just grows on you. It starts out as a study of a young Japanese family that is facing an uncertain future with optimism. When the young man answers an ad in the employment section of the local newspaper and sees the word Departures, he assumes the job to be with a travel agency. What he ends up doing is preparing the recently departed for a ceremonial cleansing in front of the families. Apparently, even though a significant part of the burial (actually cremation) process, these people are frowned upon by their peers. Even the resilient wife of the young man finds what he does repulsive and leaves him for a time. As with all great movies, this is about redemption and characterization and it allows us to follow the career of one who expresses great love and respect for the dead. I was stunned at the overall tenderness of this film."
"jageldbart","Null","1","1","28 September 2017"," Amazing Film
","[***SPOILERS***]<br/><br/>Departures is an amazing film from Japan which tells the story of Daigo, a cello player in an orchestra in Tokyo who moves back to his hometown when the orchestra closes down and becomes a casketing preparation agent (CK Agent is the term in Japan). Overall, I completely loved the film all the way through because it ties almost everything together and really is just a touching movie. However, at some parts the movie did drag along (during the casketing preparations), but it proved to show the intricacy and care taken for this career. It also shows Daigo's eventual passion and thoroughness for how he goes about this choice of career. However, throughout the movie I felt a sadness for Daigo because he was shamed by his old childhood friend, other people spoken of, and eventually his wife because of the job that he took on as a career to make money at first, but then started to enjoy. All in all, I think this movie was incredibly stellar, and would definitely recommend it to a friend (and actually already have)."
"pjfarley","8","1","1","27 September 2017"," Review
","Although the start of the film is a bit slow paced for my taste, I really love the comedic aspects that were incorporated into this film. When I realized what the movie was about, I originally thought that it was going to be a very slow movie about a very serious topic. I was wrong, I loved how the director found some way to add comedy into such a serious topic such as funerals. One of my favorite scenes was when Daigo was forced to wear a diaper and act as the corpse that the man was performing the ceremony on. His facial expressions where quite amusing and really lightened the mood of what could have been a very sad topic."
"philipposathina","10","1","1","15 December 2015"," Among the ten best movies i have ever seen...
","... and i have seen an uncountable number of them! Actually it had been a long time before such a piece of Art film came on my screen. Right then, out of the sudden, i heard the announcement on our national TV stations that they were going to play ""departures"", a film which was the Oscar winner for best non English speaking film of that year! The fact that it was Japanese and the synopsis of its script was nothing i was really enthusiastic about, and i would have probably missed it if i didn't read the reviews which were all very strongly recommending it. So, finally i found myself, that Sunday evening watching ""departures"", and a miracle happened! the -at the beginning macabre- script, became gradually more and more touching, then sad and finally heartbreaking, humanistic and tender so much, that it finally got me totally upside down out of emotion. Till that moment I had never come across anything like this! How could it be possible that something which could - at first sight- be considered ""macabre"" end up so heartbreaking? Only a real highly humanistic masterpiece could ever make it possible. And everything in this film is just a masterpiece of its own: Direction, photograph, script, acting and last but not least, its heavenly music which just frees your soul and lose your eyes to shed freely your tears! This music...Oh! there is something magic about it i tell you! That kind of music God allows from time to time to reach the earth as a present from heaven and probably as a reward for something good the humans may have done. In my case,Mr Hisaishi,the composer, through his divine music for this divine film, made me a Cello fan, and I do need to thank him for giving me this amazing feeling! If you haven't seen ""Departures"" yet, please try to do it soon as possible. It will fill your heart and your spirit with the finest kindness you have ever experienced coming out of a movie screen. It may make you feel emotionally shocked but it will also make you a better person for sure!"

","This is a very sad movie. Most of the movie involves a Japanese ceremony called coffining, publicly preparing the dead for burial. The lead actor Masahiro Motoki is handsome and boyish, and plays his role with comic ham exaggeration. It is not much about cellos.<br/><br/>This is the first time I had any appreciation how ceremonies elegantly performed can help people over the trying humps in life.<br/><br/>Part of the sadness comes from Daigo and his wife giving up grand dreams and settling for more ordinary ones.<br/><br/>Part of it comes simply from realising everyone is gradually getting older and will inevitably die."
"cmanule","10","1","1","1 October 2011"," Excellent film!!
","I saw this movie two weeks ago, I'm completely impressed about the movie that was playing in my screen. Poor Daigo at the beginning, it must be hard to feel when you're so excited 'cause you're playing in a great orchestra and then, everything's over. His wife Mika is a very happy woman in my opinion, the charisma of each character is very particular, Daigo of course had some troubles to get used to his new job, but he had the skills to do it, the respect Daigo had when he prepared the bodies, the art he was doing there, man!, that was amazing. Some sad moments are seen in this movie, because it's hard to understand when somebody loved dies, this movie displays some reactions of different kind of people, some of them angry, some of them sad, but very particular, I Love the way this is displayed. Of course this movie hasn't sadness all the time, it has its laughing moments, the music is so beautiful too, the ""Ave Maria"" song is played when Daigo had dinner with his boss, that part is awesome, the scene changes when he's playing the cello in a beautiful landscape. I absolutely recommend this movie, it's something different, that's why I give it a 10 of excellent."
"yris2002","8","1","1","5 May 2011"," A very delicate and serene reflection upon life and death
","Although not being myself a lover of Japanese movies, I decided to see ""Departures"", mainly because the recently released ""Poetry"", which I liked so much, was in a way associated with it. The two pictures are in my opinion distant as far as content, but similar for the mood pervading them, which is indeed part of oriental culture and which allows the viewer to approach the most strong and disturbing topics in a very serene way. Here the theme is death, in particular the special rite performed on corpses in front of relatives, before letting the dead leave, for good: it's a delicate, and very respectful sequence of simple but significant gestures which sanction the final reconciliation of this world with the next, a kind of reconciliation between arrival and departure. The movie manages, very simply, and using no virtuosity to reflect upon the theme of death, avoiding all macabre or morbid particulars, keeping a solid balance between drama and grotesque humor, but never abandoning its serious intention, and it makes the viewer reflect avoiding any anguish or uneasiness. Inevitably and significantly focus shifts continuously from death to life, particularly to the meaningfulness of life, no matter how socially successful you are, to the real founding human values of life. As a whole, a sweet, delicate, and in a way comforting picture, where the slowness of typical of oriental movies does not bore, but leaves space to deep and serene reflection. Very good performances by the two male characters, we can perceive the evolution and growing maturity of Daigo and appreciate the more quiet but reassuring presence of Sasaki. I would have never believed that a movie centred on death could have left me with such a feeling of serenity and peace."

The movie has an underline calming effect that does not bore you but relaxes you. It shows death as a normal state of affair, something that we should all be aware of, something that we should not be afraid of, something we should not be ashamed of. It does glorify nor does it diminishes its importance it just shows it as is. it is not looking into unusual bazaar cases, this is not a movie about Darwin awards, this is reality as is."
"derekbourgeois","6","4","9","21 December 2012"," A film that started well but lost itself towards the end
","The film started well, but I felt it was ultimately unsatisfactory probably because the quality of cello playing as portrayed by the main star was too good for us to believe that he couldn't get a job as a cellist either as a performer or a teacher. It would have worked better if the cello playing was clearly that of a talented amateur, especially when he apparently played a child's cello as if it was a Stradivarius. That for me rendered the main story rather unbelievable, and I wondered why they had juxtaposed the cello playing with the job of undertaker. I also felt that once you had witnessed one Japanese funeral, the rest became predictable and ultimately boring, detracting from the main point of the film."
"zetes","6","7","21","7 February 2010"," Mediocre
","Last year's Best Foreign Film winner at the Academy Awards. It's exactly the kind of film they like: sweet, simple and uninspired. Seriously, Japan can do so much better than this. Masahiro Motoki (great in Tsukamoto's Gemini and Miike's The Bird People in China) stars as an out-of-work cellist who takes a job at a funeral home. Those who prepare the dead in Japan have historically been met with great prejudices. People just don't trust people in Japan who touch the dead and make their living off of misery. So Motoki fights prejudice, even loses his wife (the adorable Ryoko Hirosue) for a while. Eventually, he discovers that the service he is providing is valuable and helps people. The film isn't bad, really. It's just nothing special and occasionally schmaltzy. The only thing I really liked was Jo Hisaishi's musical score. There's one piece during a montage that's especially killer."
"anderslatif","1","18","70","4 August 2009"," A snob review. bread and water.
","As I found out that this movie had been selected, among plenty of great Japanese movies, to win an academy award two things happened. 1. I couldn't stop watching this movie through what Americans may have felt. 2. A feeling of injustice build up since this movie had unreasonably been forwarded among so many great movies. I can even name-drop TV-series that are better. <br/><br/>A lot of people on here seems to know very little about Japan or Japanese movies (which is fine, that's not the problem). But how can the masses who have little cultural/cinematic experience set the norm? I've never been such a snob before but the reactions to the movie are so off-target. Questions on here as - Who is the Japanese Spielberg? - are an insult to Japanese movies as well as all American movies. I think most people on here like the movie because it is Japanese and they explain all the flaws with the same reasoning, because it is Japanese. Look at the job interview. It is trying to be funny but isn't. If it is trying to be realistic it is far from it. The adjective we have left, if not realistic or funny, is artificial. But I have to applaud how open-minded people have received the movie, people have really tried to understand the Japenese culture. But my review is rather a written notice on unjust because of the exaggeration: the voting, the words. It hurts to know that great movies are ignored. <br/><br/>The plot is very weak. He could find another job, so why does he act so disgusted by it. The plot is actually: a man not telling his wife what job he has. If he just told her, there wouldn't be a plot and that would be much better. Another one was the non-existing problem that in the movie it was considered a terrible job to do, catering the dead. This movie didn't need conflicts but there were many banal conflicts which were projected and an hour and a half long drag. <br/><br/>I wouldn't call the acting very bad but there were some catastrophically terrible reactions in there. When he finds out that the band has disbanded. Or what about the shaving accident. The whole sentō conversation scene was ridiculing people. Nobody thought that him taking the clothes off his wife was a very unusual reaction on his part and even stranger counter-reaction from Mika?<br/><br/>People are praising the music score. There is nothing special or good about it. There are greater compositions but people aren't even used to classical music in movies, which tells us what kind of audience likes this movie. Most movies have a better score. <br/><br/>The wife, as always in Japan with children and females, was laughing and energetic even at the worst places. It is sad that women and children are degraded to this manner and luckily it isn't as much the case in Japan as it is in Japanese movies. <br/><br/>Cinematography is very plain. I don't want to go into this, but this is like watching a Hollywood movie taking place Japan. <br/><br/>This movie is like bread and water, a delicious meal, especially for the hungry. But knowing that there are all kinds of flavors out there ruins the movie. All in all a very plain movie. <br/><br/>Post Scriptum: In the end my review will be voted as not useful which proves that mindless indulgence is in favor to listening to a person's commentary and try to explore and expand. People just want to see 10/10 reviews, they don't care about substance. <br/><br/>Other nominees for the award were to better movies: Entre les murs and waltz with Bashir. Both those movies are a lot stronger than Departures. It's a shame that when the academy finally caught a Japanese movie they caught the wrong one and too late. <br/><br/>It makes me happy to know that Yôjirô Takita other productions (as expected nothing worth notice) include: molester train man and serial rape-murderer."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","24 March 2009"," The obvious question
","Unless I'm mistaken about the statistics I looked up, ""Departure"" is the first Japanese film ever to win the Best Foreign Language Film in Oscar. ""Rashomon"" received the award in 1951 under a different format, where there were no other nominees. The current format of having 5 nominees started only in 1956 (""La Strada"" from Italy won that year).<br/><br/>Right to the point, the film opens with scene of ""casketing"" showing the protagonist Diago Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki), under the supervision of his mentor Ikuei Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki), at his professional service of preparing the body of a deceased for the coffin. Through this, and many subsequent similar scenes, the audience gradually comes to appreciate the noble nature of this profession. From this scene, which is picked up again at about three-quarters into the film, we see a flashback cut to a performance of Beethoven's Ninth right at the beginning of Odes to Joy, with Diago as a cellist in the orchestra. As the story unfolds, we see how he loses his job when the orchestra folds from financial difficulties, how his devoted, loving wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) accompanies him to the countryside (his birthplace) to start a new life, and how he inadvertently gets into this unusual profession.<br/><br/>If not initially, the audience will soon be moved by the utmost tenderness and gentle love in preparing the bodies for the coffin. It is not just skill and art; it is also a ritual of honour and respect (it is performed in the presence of the gathered family). One man who is furious at Ikuei and Diago for being late runs to catch up with them as they leave at the end of the job and, with tears in his eyes, thanks them for making his departed wife look more beautiful that she had ever been.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is not only a misunderstood, but also a despised, profession. Friends avoid Diago. Even Mika, who is the most wonderful wife that any man could ever hope for, stands firm on this issue, leaving him until he gives up his job. He holds steadfastly onto his professional integrity. Finally they get a chance to see him at work, preparing the body of someone they all know and love. This is a most touching scene when they come to understand, accept and respect him and his noble profession.<br/><br/>While the main theme in itself is engaging enough, this film is rich with other stories that are close to our heart. And while Motoki and Hirosue are simply marvelous, there is a support cast that is equally wonderful. Most mesmerizing is Yamakaz playing the master who teaches Diago not only technique and art, but also life. All the minor character are memorable in their own way.<br/><br/>This film is shot with meticulous care on details. Consider the scene when Diago tells Mika that he has lost his job as a cellist. Naturally she tries to comfort him. Then she turned to go into the kitchen to prepare supper. In those two or three steps with her back towards the audience, we see her taking a barely discernible little skip step, as if to tell herself to cheer up. Regardless of whether it is Hirosue or the director, it show how much tender loving care has been put into making every shot. Similarly for the music. There is a scene when Diago plays a languid cello solo at home, reminiscing his childhood days. The scene ends in breathtakingly beautiful shots of the countryside, with a seamless transformation of the on-screen cello solo into background music, concluding is a beautiful string of notes from an accompanying piano.<br/><br/>""Departure"", among other things, examines the subject of death. ""Les invasions barbares"" (2003), another Oscar Best Foreign Language Film winner, heartbreakingly depicts the frustration, agonies and helplessness of death. ""Departure"", however, approaches this somber subject with a positive and encouraging look. It is not ""farewell forever"", but ""till we meet again"".<br/><br/>This brings me to my summary line, ""the obvious question"", something the audience would be reflecting on when they emerge from the cinema. If so much love and tenderness goes into preparing the body of the dead, should the living not deserve the same thing?"

","Obviously this film is not the worst film ever. Camera work, actors, setting, even concept were all great. I could award it 5 stars out of 10 just to be fair. But in the days after watching it, the essential lie of the plot has been bugging me more and more, and I've started to outright detest it. <br/><br/>All of the good elements of this film can be found in the book ""All Creatures Great and Small"" by James Herriot. The down-on-his-luck virtuoso who goes to the countryside, visits many different kinds of families, and has to work for a forgetful and self-contradictory old man who in the end teaches him a lot about life. It's all there, so neglect this movie if you can and give that a read instead.<br/><br/>I know, what about the death part? Isn't that the real beauty of the movie? How death becomes an important moment of parting?<br/><br/>No... it looks beautiful, but that's the lie of the film. Consider that this guy's job is literally putting lipstick on a corpse. Yes, that sounds unpoetic and insulting to the film, but that's not an exaggeration. That's literally what he does.<br/><br/>All the bodies in this film appear to have keeled over and expired without injury. Real life corpses are not always so lucky. The suffering of death cannot always be whitewashed over like this. The traditional Buddhist meditation on death is on the destruction of the body, the disgusting things that happen when bodies decay. This film is doing something evil. It tells us to purchase a pound of make up and await the perfect funeral, when we can cry out our unresolved conflicts. Funerals are not meant to be perfect. Death in real life is not as convenient as it is to the plot of this film.<br/><br/>The ancients had death all around them, from untreated disease or violence. It is we of the 21st century who have no understanding of what it means for a life to have an end. The film gives a little taste of that during funeral scenes, but in such a warped way. It dresses up and masks the end so we can imagine that all our bodies can be cleaned up and exhibited with such dignity. The friends and relatives of the character, who exhibit distress over his choice of work, are correctly showing the cultural reaction of a traditional society that understands that a dead body is something apart from society. The film has no patience or sympathy for this reaction. It is portrayed as stupid, ignorant bigotry.<br/><br/>The reverse is true. We are the ones who are stupid and ignorant for inventing the false image of death portrayed in this film. The lie of the camera is so embedded into the fabric of this movie that I cannot justify giving it a good review."

As we discover during the film, our protagonist has his own appreciation of what this new position means, and little by little, we learn, pretty much like he does, that there is more to the job than we originally understood.<br/><br/>Luckily for him, he finds some supportive and well developed characters along the way who show him how to restructure his life again, among them is his lovely and charming wife who is probably one of the nicest characters ever on a film. There are the mother and father figures, who give him some long forgotten knowledge, and he learns much as he assists the families of the people he works on.<br/><br/>In the end, after a pretty strong cathartic conclusion, there is most likely not a single dry eye in the house; yet one doesn't feel manipulated in any way, but grateful we were able to accompany him during his reevaluation of what life and love are. ""Departures"" deserves every accolade, recognition, award, and praise it receives because it explores our humanity, asking us to revisit what makes us what we are, and ways in which we can become much better than what we are."

"politic1983","8","0","0","11 July 2018"," Departures vs. After Life
","To paraphrase Nobu-san, our guide around the Okunoin cemetery at Koya-san: ""In Japan, when we are born, we have Shinto rituals. When we die, we have Buddhist rituals. My mum got married in a church: New Caledonia."" <br/><br/>Buddhism in Japan is often associated with death. When one dies, the ceremonies that take place will often be Buddhist, but as Donald Richie explores, these could be as much for functional purpose as religious belief. But, obviously of course, no one knows what actually happens when you die. Or do we? It depends whether one is thinking about it from the perspective of the body or the soul. <br/><br/>Yojiro Takita's Oscar-winning 2008 ""Departures"" see cellist Daigo's (popular hair model Masahiro Motoki) orchestra disband in Tokyo, leaving him doubtful of his talent and so his future. On a whim, he convinces his wife - with little coercion - into moving back to his small hometown in Yamagata, moving into the cafe his mother left him. <br/><br/>Needing work, he responds to an ad with few details, but nice pay packets, and is immediately hired. It soon turns out that his job will be as an ""encoffinfer"", performing the Japanese noukan ritual of preparing the body before it is placed into the coffin (and then burnt, of course). Not an easy job, he struggles to cope at first and soon feels society's evil eyes once his new job is learnt: perceived as a dirty man for his handling of dead bodies. <br/><br/>As the film progresses, so does his skill, winning over his doubters, including his wife, and finding what would appear to be a true calling: sending the bodies of the recently deceased on their final journey, coming to terms with some of the opportunities missed in life. <br/><br/>Ten years earlier, Kore-eda Hirokazu released his second feature film: 1998's ""After Life"" (or perhaps its more appropriate Japanese title ""Wandafuru Raifu""). Here, there after life probably isn't quite what you expected. Upon dying, you enter a somewhat New England-esque academic building, taking a ticket as if a doctor's waiting room. <br/><br/>On this ""Monday morning"", you are assigned a counsellor who will pose you the situation: You have a week to choose the one memory of your life which you will take with you for eternity. This memory is recreated by a somewhat haphazard film crew, starring your good self, and the film is then shown to you in a cinema. Once viewed, you disappear for eternity, locked in that memory. <br/><br/>Somewhat fanciful, the counsellors are all people that were either unable, or refused, to make the choice, and thus stay in a purgatory of administration and archiving, forever reliving Monday morning. A series of interviews are conducted with the various recently deceased, with now long-experienced - but still youthful in look - Takashi (Arata) given the task of counselling the man who married his fiancée after he died. Opening up some old wounds, Takashi spends the week contemplating his own favourite memories and finally makes his choice.<br/><br/>The outlooks of the two films are quite different in their thoughts on death. ""After Life"" plays little on the sadness of having died. Those that enter are quite chipper, one must say, on learning that they've just kicked the bucket. As the Japanese title suggests, it's very much about celebrating the most precious, and wonderful, memories that we have of our lives. This could perhaps be down to Kore-eda's combination of actors and real-life ordinary folk discussing their favourite memories. Using his documentary skills, this is as much an exploration of memory than a mourning of death. <br/><br/>""Departures"", however, is very much aware of the sadness of death. Very reminiscent of Shunji Iwai's ""Love Letter"" in numerous ways, there are moments of sentimentality, tugging at the heartstrings, as well as plucking on the cello strings. Tears and emotion run throughout; the sadness of the families a key theme. A shot of a young child's body being prepared for their coffin accompanied by their smiling photo, hitting home the sadness in the simplest of ways. Though family tears and timely music perhaps dominate, going for more conventional crowd-(dis)pleasing. <br/><br/>This is absent from ""After Life"", laying people's memories out before them to celebrate and chew on; more philosophical than sentimental. If death hurts those left behind, ""After Life"" is the memories of life for the deceased; whereas ""Departures"" is the final memory for the mourners. <br/><br/>If we're looking at religion in Japanese death, however, ""After Life"" perhaps lacks any religion. Death is a bureaucratic process than a passing over. As seen in other films, such as Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice"", death is likened to the administrative Hell on Earth of waiting rooms, form-filling and box-ticking. <br/><br/>It's also a strange film in that it's very much of its time, serving as a time capsule, with the provision of lo-fi VHS cassette tapes for ""clients"" to view moments from their lives to help them in their choice. Surely the after life's administrative team can come up with a less archaic system! The recreations also seem to be more ""human"" and of the ""real world"", made to a seemingly small budget and limited time frame, far from Hollywood glitz and glam that many of the dead may have wished to achieve in the film of their life. A theme running throughout Kore-eda's body of work, this is perhaps as much a comment on the modern nature of memory and how we try to recreate it in permanent form rather than live in the moment of emotion. A comment as relevant now as ever. <br/><br/>""Departures"" features the religious ceremony of the noukan, placing the body in ritual dress, with accompanying make-up. But with even this dying out with the elderly, it perhaps reflects Richie's doubts as to the true religious nature of these ""performances"". Making the dead look their best is perhaps purely for aesthetic purposes, giving mourners one last perfect memory. <br/><br/>Daigo's skill is very much in-line with Japanese aesthetics: The almost perfect folding with due care and attention of the deceased clothes, creating an intimate one-on-one with the body. ""After Life"", with its counsellors getting deep into their clients personal lives and directing them towards their perfect choice: Ones who struggle are probed to search deeper; those who go obvious, are challenged to look more inwards, creating an intimate one-on-one with the soul. <br/><br/>Mono no aware, the Japanese sense of the fleeting nature of beauty and the impermanence of all things is alive in both films. Daigo's hard work and skill is - for want of a better word - in vain; the bodies made beautiful, only to be burnt at cremation soon after. ""After Life"" forces the choice of the single moment that defines a whole existence (and they only give you a week!). The last memory for the living versus the eternal memory for the dead; and perhaps a more Japanese sense of religion than any organised belief system.<br/><br/>politic1983.blogspot.co.uk"

","The opening vignette of Departures, much like how a dapper Jack Black gaily demonstrates the final cosmetic procedures before casketing in Richard Linklater's Bernie, reveals how the end of one's life can sometimes result in unexpectedly light moments. Faced with the uncertainty of what comes after death in an age of increasing agnosticism, families turn to humour as a way of shielding themselves from the heartbreak of a life now longer living with them. And what of those who service the departed, who are often caught in the midst of this torrent of emotional outpour? For Daigo Kobayashi, a recently dumped cellist, there is no easy answer. Faced with the uncomfortable discovery that the beautiful woman he is preparing was previously a man, he tries to be discreet, asking for the family's preference in a whisper. The ceremony itself is supposed to shroud the departed's bare skin from those in mourning. The camera even lowers itself to knee height, Ozu-style, as they enter the home and bow in solemn respect. But the parents return the whisper with a loud, tactless query, and the serenity is visibly shattered. Not that the victim cares. And it is only later that we learn that the moment serves as a realisation for the parent's love of their child, man or woman. <br/><br/>In other encoffining jobs, Daigo is the odd man out as the ritual airs out old grievances and suppressed anger. Masahiro Motoki has the right face for the role; youthful, earnest, often bewildered, and when his dignified routine is interrupted by domestic quarrels, his eyes widen and his mouth is agape with quiet shock. What is the correct emotional response for a worker in these situations? He is paid to operate and witness the most vulnerable of moments, as generations break down and sob for their departed, and all he can do is provide a little solace through wood, cloth and petal. A bowing of the head seems sufficient, he initially believes.<br/><br/>He works for Sasaki, played by Tsutomu Yamazaki. Some may recognise him as the cowboy hat wearing, John Wayne-esque nomad from the ramen western Tampopo, a gruff realist who sizes Daigo up with one look and offers him the job immediately (perhaps out of necessity rather than potential), but later scolds him like a child when he cannot bear the odour of a two week-old corpse. While Sasaki's demeanour is almost entirely austere, having taken on the lonely burden of this role, Daigo is practically hysterical, scurrying from public bus to private bathhouse to scrub physical filth and social taboo from the pores of his skin. There is a comedic 'skit' of sorts where he acts as a model corpse for Sasaki to demonstrate his craft upon, and shrieks when a razor pricks his cheek. The scene makes little logical sense; why would such a sparsely populated profession need a training DVD? But it does reveal Daigo to be the child he is, at least initially, not yet properly equipped with the maturity and life experience to handle the affairs of farewelling the dead. <br/><br/>Music is presented as a significant motif; Daigo's expensive cello is sold in the beginning to escape debt and return to simple, rural living, but as he finds meaning in his new work (and cash), he is reunited with his childhood instrument. Gradually we discover it to be the heart of Daigo's conflicted nostalgia for the shack that once fronted as his mother's coffee shop. A sly shot from Takita circles the older Daigo engrossed in his art, before moving behind a pillar and smoothly transitioning to a younger boy rehearsing laboriously before his parents. Joe Hisaishi centres his score around the instrument, and in a pivotal musical montage, Daigo cradles the cello with the same finesse and grace that he now applies to the departed. <br/><br/>His final catharsis lies in the act of encoffining his own estranged father, his work becoming deeply personal. The film's story is peppered with references to this childhood trauma, obscuring the father's face with the blurry haze of selective memory and choice shot compositions. To show the body and visage in clear focus is already monumental, and to witness Daigo caressing and preparing his father's body for a simple wooden coffin is more than enough. There is a lifetime of unspoken words in those gestures. Takita tacks on a cheesy, slow-motion revelation of a 'feeling stone' that he transfers onto the next generation, and explicit flashbacks, but it isn't necessary. The son is shaving the father. The cycle is complete."

","Virtually all the Japanese films I've watched have dealt with Samurais or the elderly coping with old age, so it was in a way refreshing to see a film dealing with an offbeat topic like this. I say refreshing in a guarded manner because the main topic in the story involves death, with a recently made jobless man inquiring into a position that involves the preparation of corpses for burial. Sounds a lot like an undertaker, but in Japan, this is an intermediate step, and one which the uninformed viewer like myself will undoubtedly see as somewhat odd, though the way the story progresses, it's a ritual that offers dignity and reassurance to the grieving family of the departed. <br/><br/>The other idea that puzzled me somewhat was the reaction certain people had to Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) accepting the 'casketing' position. One of his long time friends suggested that he find a more suitable job, while his wife Mika (Ryôko Hirosue) was even more adamant. She was willing to leave her husband until he came to his senses about a choice of employment. The way the film proceeds, the negative reactions are gradually superseded by an understanding that the transition from life to death requires a thoughtful and dignified preparation for the afterlife. Daigo also undergoes a personal transformation when the close of the story challenges him to reconcile his feelings over a father who abandoned him and his mother when he was still a child. <br/><br/>Based on my comments, one might think the movie would be rather morose in tone, but there are some humorous moments. One such occurs when we observe Daigo preparing a corpse for burial and discovering the victim is of dubious sexual identity. What struck me as odd was the film that was put together by Daigo's employer Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) demonstrating the proper technique for handling a corpse. I had to wonder what the purpose of that project would be. It looked like it might have been intended as a training film for prospective NK (casketing) agents, but why would it have been needed? Until Daigo joined Sasaki's firm, the only other employee was the secretary."

","This film was definitely a favorite of mine. It is about a man named daigo who loses his job and must return to his hometown. Once he returns to his hometown he is confronted by his past and must reconnect with his past. He is desperate for a job and decides to search for anything that will pay well. He calls an ad listed as departures, which turned out to be misspelled. It was suppose to say the departed, as the job requires one to handle dead bodies through bathing, washing, and clothing. It is a job considered beneath others and filthy because you earn your money through the death of others. At first Daigo, does not like his job by little by little he comes to a new understanding it. The process of preparing the corpse is shown in detail within the context of the story. The film eventually captures the audience through the beautiful display of sending off the dead. It is displayed as a ceremony including only close family members and the occasional close friend. The undertaker cares for the dead with utmost precision in shaving and clothing of the dead in front of the audience. This film is very powerful in instilling in the viewer that we should take each precious moment as if it were out last. While watching this film I also noticed marvelous acting by the cast, but the wife of the protagonist seemed a bit misplaced and shallow. Overall, the film is sincere in its nature and captures the beauty connected with the sending off of the dead. This film could also be seen as comedic through the acting of the boss of the departure service who seems to make the best of any situation."

","The film Departures by Yojiro Takita introduced me a job I have never noticed: mortuary. As the characters in the film mentioned, having a work to do with dead people's body is a shame. However, I would think this kind of job is unusual, but not a shame, because every job should be respected. The main character, Daigo was first working in a band to play cello. When the band was dismissed, Daigo and his wife Mika moved back to his mother's old house, because it is too hard for them to afford the living expense in Tokyo. In the old town, Daigo found this job, and starting to work as a mortuary. All of his neighbors and Mika did not agree with him doing the job, but after seeing him doing the job, they realized this job should also be respected. I really enjoyed watching this movie because this is not just showing a plain story, but having many social and family issues like transgender and no parenting children. The burial custom in Japan shows that it is not an American film because there is no such custom that cleaning the body in front of its' family and friend."

Tsutomu Yamazaki's portrayal of a Boss who teaches the protagonist is the most fabulous quality of the movie. Actor actually work the role around and inside. Masahiro Motoki and Ryōko Hirosue are very convincing although camera sometime focused on Ryōko more then it needed. Her character as a devoted wife is well however it is not explored much.

"Comptable","9","0","0","19 July 2015"," An exquisite film
","An American client, knowledgeable about Eastern ways, highly recommended Departures to me. It was nominated for an academy award for best foreign film, he told me. I read about the plot on IMDb, saw that it was about a Japanese man named Daigo who prepares dead people for funerals, and was immediately turned off by the idea seeing it. I told this to the client, and he said ""The East doesn't think of death that way. No preconceptions allowed! It is not a death movie, it is a life movie"".<br/><br/>Having been gently but firmly rebuked, I returned to IMDb and read several positive reviews of the film. This time my impression was much different. I came to view this film with respect. It no longer appeared to be simply a ""morbid"" film, but a thoughtfully-made one, and representative of Japanese filmmakers' reputation for sensitive storytelling. With renewed interest in seeing the film, I told my client that I'd see it when I have time. I started watching it three weeks later.<br/><br/>Not only did I watch it, but I managed to persuade my wife to watch it with me. Initially, she was repulsed by the sight of dead people being prepared for burial or cremation, and refused to continue watching the film. However, she overcame her disgust when I starting watching the film myself from where we had left off, a week later, and when she heard the beautiful music of the film's soundtrack. We saw the rest of the film together, and we both liked it. <br/><br/>My wife was charmed by the sight of Daigo playing the cello, especially when he played on the hilltop. He was an orchestra of one. <br/><br/>Daigo had a job playing the cello in an orchestra, but was forced to give that up when the orchestra was disbanded. He answered a help wanted ad, thinking he was applying for a job as a travel agent. Instead, he was hired to be a ritual mortician, a job which he at first detested and which made him sick. The pay was very good, though.<br/><br/>The artistry of this film must be seen to be believed. Here are a few examples: there's a scene in which Daigo applies lipstick to the lips of a deceased wife and mother during the ""en-coffining"" ceremony: her husband and daughter express their heartfelt thanks to him after the ceremony for making their beloved wife and mother, respectively, appear more beautiful even in death. Another example: an old man prepares to cremate a deceased bathhouse owner, an important member of the community, while explaining his role as a gatekeeper to the next world to Daigo's former orchestral comrade. The comrade had reproached Daigo in front of the comrade's wife and child for doing such undignified work, and can now see the value of Daigo's work. The final scene is the final example and the ultimate climax. It was in that last scene that I most saw the resemblance to one of the best Ozu films a Dutch reviewer on IMDb mentioned in his review, even though I haven't seen an Ozu film. The scene is poignant; it is beyond astonishing, it is beyond extraordinary. It is magical.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, the music is as moving as it is beautiful. It serves to reinforce the film's message that en-coffining is an honorable profession, one that helps the loved ones of those left behind find solace, even joy, despite the loss of their dearly departed family members and friends. <br/><br/>The acting is superb in the film. I could feel the sincerity of the characters as I watched them go about their lives. Daigo, Mika, and Sasaki, especially, conveyed genuine feeling with their expressions and actions. As the actor who plays Daigo, Masahiro Motoki, had an enormous interest in the subject of the film – in fact he wrote a book on the relationship between life and death – this added considerably to the credibility of the film and his role in it.<br/><br/>What is most significant to me about this film is the way it shows how one's choice of profession affects one's life in important ways. This film is about death, but it's even more about life and the effect that death has upon the lives of those who make it a profession, as well as those they care about. Moreover, there is beauty, even in death.<br/><br/>Japanese culture is depicted in a realistic way. As an example, when my stepdaughter, who spent time in Japan, came to visit us, I told her about Departures, and she told us about the bathhouses in Japan. The bathhouse in Departures matched her description. The Japanese values of respect for one's elders, tradition and nature are much in evidence in this movie. The film accurately portrays the stigma involving death in Japan: that death in Japanese culture is thought to be a source of impurity and that those who work closely with the deceased, such as morticians, are considered unclean. It is this stigma which Daigo strives to overcome in his new career. <br/><br/>I urge you to see Departures. Although it doesn't explore the religious side of the Japanese funeral ritual, it is nevertheless an artistic and reasonably authentic portrayal of its place in Japanese society. It's very likely that you will enjoy Departures, or at least some aspect of it, and that you'll find much meaning in it. The care with which this film was made will be become apparent to you as you watch it. It is truly an antidote for the crassness of the modern Hollywood film tradition, with its puffery and special effects mania. It is an antidote, for that matter, for the materialistic culture that we cling to so desperately in the United States."

","""Departures"" is a drama movie in which we watch a man who is a devoted cellist in an orchestra that has just been dissolved and now he is unemployed. After some time he decides to return to his hometown where he finds a new job which is really different than the previous one. His new job is to prepare the deceased bodies for burial and entry into the next life.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it was a different kind of movies than these that I used to watch so it was a new experience for me. That was something that I found really interesting. Another thing that I liked in this movie was the beautiful interpretation of Masahiro Motoki who played as Daigo Kobayashi and he was simply outstanding on it. Another interpretation that I liked was Tsutomu Yamazaki's who played as Ikuei Sasaki.<br/><br/>Lastly I want to say that ""Departures"" is a really different movie than the movies that you are used to watch and this is something that makes this movie so special and unique. This movie will teach you the true meaning of life and how important and short is."

","""Okuribito"" is a recent Academy award winner in the foreign language film category. It was a bit of an underdog against the Israeli entry, but finally took home the prize. Also, it was the huge winner (10 awards) at the Japanese film awards that year, won pretty much all categories, except Best Actress, where the actress who plays the wife was ""only"" nominated. And I can see why it received so high praise. It's a very deep film about the perception of a profession in a society entirely different from the one we live in. The central character, a professional cello player, loses his job and starts working at a company where he prepares recently deceased people for their last journey. Fittingly to his initial profession, this movie includes lots of beautiful classical music.<br/><br/>There also are many interesting references in here, for example the fact that his wife gets pregnant and new life is created while he (at his profession) says farewell to old life. But it's not really only about the central character. We also witness a change in his wife's mind. Initially, she seems to despise him because of his new profession, even possibly leave him, but when she sees with how much dignity he is occupied she knows that he found the right job finally. Her quote near the end that her husband works in this field and she is no longer embarrassed seals the deal.<br/><br/>In terms of the dead, there is everybody involved: mothers, sons, daughters and finally even the main character's father. So he has to act as a professional worker first before he mourns like a son. Actually, I expected his mentor to die near the end in a metaphorical attempt to display how he was his ""real"" father figure, especially with his colleague's comment about how he is getting older while she watched him sleeping, but I was wrong here. There's really nothing wrong with this film and I have to look deep to find something close to what I disliked. I thought the stainless vs rough stone metaphors did not work as much as I hoped they would, but they weren't bad either. It is very interesting to see how his new profession is perceived by general public in Japan. He even gets humiliated by one of the mourning families. (The different families with their own struggles and reactions and quirks were all very fascinating to watch.) I personally find it difficult to understand why, but I guess the explanation is a mix of tradition and mentality really hard to grasp if you are not living there are very familiar with the culture.<br/><br/>It is a fairly slow movie. For its entirety of over 2 hours we basically only watch him during his job (some strangely funny scenes involved too, all very subtle) and during his (struggling) family life. Nothing big really ever happens, but that would not have fit the film's mood and tone anyway. Interestingly enough, the lead actor in this film is already over 40, but seems a lot younger, maybe also due to his inexperience with his new task. The German word ""Ausklang"" is included in the title and if you understand this language you will see why it is the perfect choice both summarizing his old and new careers. Great film. highly recommended."

","A subtle, evocative story about a former cellist who takes on a new job arranging the bodies of the dead for cremation, DEPARTURES is a truly exceptional film. There haven't been many films made about 'death', per se - apart from endless horror flicks of course - but this one tackles the subject in a mature and moving way, quickly establishing itself as a favourite of mine.<br/><br/>The excellent Masahiro Motoki grounds the film with his captivating turn as a man who takes up a new career despite his inhibitions and soon finds himself in many unfamiliar situations. Some of the material is played for black comedy, but the story gradually becomes more involved and it builds up to a truly tragic and breathtaking climax, while all the while remaining subtle and slow-paced. No mean feat, that.<br/><br/>Yojiro Takita's expert direction and a cast giving plenty of assured performances help to make this a unique and compelling film and one that's guaranteed to make anyone who sees it shed a tear, particularly if they've experienced the death of a loved one.

","I'm not a fan of foreign films and especially not Asian ones (speaking as a westerner). Recently I watched several Indian films which were enjoyable but they felt American and also unrefined.<br/><br/>This movie was different, it wasn't non-Western really, but it certainly wasn't non-Japanese. I felt like I was meaningfully connected with a culture I knew very little about and I was very honored to have seen this film.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of an emotionally stunted young man who is a cellist and suddenly finds that he is unemployed and must give up his love of music and quite despite himself finds something else he loves, sending the recently deceased on their way to the afterlife. But like the love of music, this is something many people cannot understand or tolerate in the young man. In many ways, his young wife doesn't understand him either and we are left to wonder if she ever will.<br/><br/>Yet this is not really an art film, not one of those films where everything is left unresolved, but it isn't all neatly tied up either. It's a deeply satisfying and encouraging film.<br/><br/>It reinforced something I have noticed about Asians in other contexts that there is a depth of beauty and emotion in Asian culture that as a westerner, I'm often tempted to dismiss or ignore because I can't easily understand it. Asians are ""weird"" to many Americans - but one has to ask why America should be the norm to the world? This movie was deeply encouraging, dealing with timely issues of fatherhood and marriage, and also subtly, the destruction of fatherhood in the world (which many of the newer Indian films are dealing with in another way).<br/><br/>Asians seem to have very deep connections to their families and traditions that are falling apart as the world becomes more ""global"" - but those undercurrents are still strong and offer hope to a world that is weary with competition, cynicism and disconnection from family, from our traditions, from others and from ourselves."

","The story is a great tale to tell. It uses nicely the length it takes to tell a detailed and complete story with many sub plots, which all of them completes full circle at the movie's end. The main story is told well using the midway point as its starting point. The neat trick about this movie is that it has more than a few significant characters, who has even clearer significance near the movie's ending, yet this movie is able to keep just Daigo as the sole focus of the story. The story gets more and more heart-warming and touching as it nears its end. I particularly like how the movie turns the people around Daigo from hating his job into embracing it and even being proud with it. And the ultimate finale is a great personal turning point for Daigo himself. The acting in general is a good overall work. Motoki Masahiro played Daigo well, encompassing enough expressions t cover his emotions, although a bit lacking at the most demanding moments. Hirosue Ryuko also did well as Mika, keeping consistency on his expressions that suits Mika's cheerful basic nature. Yamazaki Tsutomu leaves a good impression as the boss who often look emotionless."

","I can't get the musical score of ""Departures"" out of my mind, and it is a good thing. The music is not exactly low-key and not so obvious. But it drives my heartbeat to the point of sorrow and joy all at once. Something only Japanese films can do. This little story of a young man found himself through the preparation of funeral services for others is most wonderful. While westerners tend to prolong the acceptance of a death, mostly by pretending that the deceased remain with them, the Japanese and most Buddhist orientals recognize a death right away, almost to the point of emphasizing. Death in Japan is thus a true death. With a true death, and no room for any denial, a person can truly go back in time and feel the total feeling. The young man never felt anything for his long-lost father until the moment of recognizing his death, and the love the old man had for him, which was never lost. This is not at all a complex movie. A simple story line and a few simple characters. No pretension. Such simplicity makes it memorable. Anyone who desires the meaning of life and living should learn something from the death in this film. Please watch it and perhaps reserve some more time in the future for second, or more, viewings. I learn a great deal doing that."

The only problem is that the movie became predictable after one hour, after he picks the job. Also it is a bit unrealistic for a musician who just lost his job, to stay with a funeral job and not look for a music job.

","Truly speaking, I felt bizarre after watching DEPARTURES (OKURIBITO), not because I didn't like it while winning the almost most credible award; the Academy award, but because I really liked it. For me, the movie to some extent is mediocre; mediocre actors especially Ryôko Hirosue (the wife) and a predictable plot. Yes it's simple, yet predictable in many places. This contradictory feeling may come out of its witty execution dealing with an intense issue (death and probably life) that could have been handled through an overly dramatic way, but what really fascinating is being crafted in such light heartedly way. The first part has its reasonable share of humor but not slapstick comedy, then it deepens gradually to have its moving and emotional scenes supported by such a great sentimental score. Cinematography is also great and has its impact on delivering the scenes. What seems to be great fun is discovering more about the Japanese culture and traditions in a more rural but honest way, rather than the usual image of modern Japan, the matter that is reflected even in using a classical orchestral score. At last, a resonant line saying ""What I believed to be my dream, was probably not my real dream"" makes one think and may it be a turning point in someone's life as it was for Daigo."

","Departures (2008) is a fascinating mix of existential angst and Taoism. It is a celebration of life and death, of nature and civilization, of the complexity of beauty and the basic elements into which we all decompose.<br/><br/>Daigo Kobayashi (played wonderfully by Masahiro Motoki) is a Grade B cellist in an orchestra that fails. His life, his dreams are crushed, along with his finances since he had gone deeply into debt to buy a ""professional grade"" cello. Not sure how to organize his life, he returns to his home town. Looking for work, he stumbles into a job as a professional who prepares bodies for cremation. Like the work done by the Untouchables of India, this is a profession abhorred by all who knew him as a child and an aspiring musician. Yet, he finds a new love of life, an appreciation for the beauty of the world about him. He also realizes that the ceremonial aspect of his work allows those who ""remain behind"" to resolve unspoken conflicts (afterall, this is Japan) between themselves and between themselves and the deceased. In rare cases, he even helps assuage the loss and bring happiness to those who knew the departed and can share their joy-filled memories with each other.<br/><br/>It is a charming movie, full of reverence for life and a commentary on how much we take each other and the world for granted, until it is too late.<br/><br/>Daigo's wife (played by Mika Kobayashi) ultimately affirms his profession. Although she says little, her facial expressions shout volumes. One is easily reminded of her role as the rebellious teenager Yumi Yoshimido in Wasabi (2001), with Jean Reno, another great movie that celebrates love and life, though a la John Wayne and Dirty Harry. Although Yumi was a much more talkative role, as Mika Koayashi the same face provides excellent and moving dialog, all the more interesting for its silence.<br/><br/>Tsutou Yamazaki plays Ikeui Sasaki, Daigo's mentor, who sees instantly in the musician the sweetness and emotion needed to bring beauty and feeling the job of Nokanshi, the funeral professional who engages in a highly stylized ceremony before the family and friends of the deceased as the body is prepared. Ikeui performs his Nokanshi role with a beauty that is inspiring.<br/><br/>The movie is long at 130 minutes, but never boring. If you have lost someone close to you, if you have stood on a mountain and smelled the aroma of trees and flowers and watched the clouds dance across the sky, if you have marveled that we are all literally star stuff, you will find this quiet mediation on life and the joy of living worth every moment of your time. Then go tell your children, your spouse, your significant other and your friends, how much you love and appreciate them. Then throw a party for no reason at all to celebrate the blessing of being a sentient being on the third planet circling an ordinary star in the outer third of a galaxy not really unusual or difference from millions of other galaxies in the universe. For, in the end, about 4-5 billion years hence, we and all that is of our planet will be cremated, just like the departed of the movie."

","Departures is a film that really messed with my emotions. I went from laughing out loud to being close to tears before an emotional but satisfying ending. It is not surprising that the film won so many awards upon its release and continues to be held in such high regard.<br/><br/>One of the first things that struck me about the film is how beautiful the highly ritualised preparation ceremony is. The body is expertly washed and dressed while at all times remaining covered in a dignifying way. The way in which the body is expertly moved is almost like a dance and the ritual is carried out with mathematical precision. Despite being a very solemn affair, the film's opening scene is also very funny. Taking place two months into the plot, Daigo is seen preparing the body of a young lady for cremation. While cleaning the body with cloths he stops with a jump and surprised expression on his face. Quietly shuffling over towards his boss, Daigo explains that she ""has a thing"". Confused, the old man takes over before discovering the young lady's ""thing"" himself and carefully asking one of the relatives if he would like the deceased to be made up as a man or a woman. This opening scene sets the tone of the rest of the film by being both sad and darkly funny.<br/><br/>The humour comes to a stop though around two thirds in when an event that although could be seen a mile off, is still upsetting takes place. Having battled for respect from those who know him, this is when Daigo gets the chance to show what his job really means for people and is one of the most moving scenes in the film, only beaten by the finale. A thread throughout the film is that of Daigo's relationship with his father, or rather lack of. He left when Daigo was very young and this caused a great chasm in his life. I had a feeling that someone in the story was going to turn out to be the father but was proved wrong. A central theme to the film is the family. Daigo's family is made up by himself and his wife but this is shattered when she is unable to come to terms with his job. Instead, his family becomes those he works with, his boss and the secretary. Another family is that of the bath house lady with whom Daigo becomes friendly. All of these families end up clashing either internally or externally, often with upsetting results. Something that is sometimes difficult to understand for a western viewer is the Japanese taboo of death and the funeral business. Although I didn't know this was the case before the film, it is made obvious throughout.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of the film is the score. Much of the music is cello lead orchestral music and sounds beautiful. The score was composed by renowned Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi and lead actor Masahiro Motoki also learned to play the cello for the role. My only problem with the score is that the central piece of music, played over and over again bore a striking resemblance to the music over the Visit Scotland advert that has been playing in the UK for about five or six years.<br/><br/>Departures is a beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and fascinating film with over fifteen major awards to its name. The acting is terrific and it looks stunning. I highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in Japanese cinema.<br/><br/>www.attheback.blogspot.com"

","One of the greatest films to come out of Japan, in their splendid tradition. Fully deserving the Oscar and the other awards. The story is a heavy one, in any culture. Death is not something we approach in detail, or want to get involved with. Yet it is rarely construed as an inseparable part of life, indispensable and best regarded as a continuation of our existence on a different level. It is our monolithical egoism to relegate death to a place we don't want to think of, to consider it bad luck (while it is a certainty) and to disparage those who are involved with it professionally. To such point we abhor it that whole operating systems of our civilization are created -religions- to deal creatively with the issue of death and reposition it as something exciting and wholly palatable. Masahiro Motoki is good in his ingénue role as a novice encoffiner, though sometimes inconsistent (his facial expressions are perhaps sporadically too loud given the topic). He deserves full credit as the originator of the story, as mentioned by director Takita in the DVD extras. Ryôko Hirosue is very credible as a young Japanese wife torn between obedience to the husband and powerful public opinion superstitionally opposed to all things ""bad luck"" of which death is the apex. Tsutomu Yamazaki (Kagemusha, Tampopo) is definitely the best performer, controlled, precise, airtight to the role. The film itself is carefully spinning, the story is developed patiently-yet never affords boredom-and the final superb. The visuals-especially the cremation fire transposed in the swans' takeoff- are achievements and the cello soundtrack fits perfectly the topic. All in all, great watching and a memorable experience.

","When the orchestra cellist Daigo Kobayashi is in is disbanded he moves back to his home town of Sakata to live in the house he inherited off his late mother. Needed a job he sees a rather cryptic advertisement in the paper offering a job dealing with 'departures' he assumes it must be something to do with travel but it was a misprint; he will be dealing with the departed! He hasn't even seen a dead body before but gets the job; he will be the assistant to a man who performs the ritual preparation of the dead body. Unlike in the west where the body is prepared behind closed doors this preparation that involves cleaning and dressing the deceased is done in front of the family. He feels unable to tell his wife that he is working with the dead and when she finds out she has difficulty handling it and returns to Tokyo hoping he will resign. He realises that he is doing an important job though and continues. I won't spoil the rest of the film but will say that by the end I was smiling and crying at the same time.<br/><br/>I recorded this film when it was on television and finally got around to watching it; given the subject matter I though I'd have to be in the right mood to watch it. I was surprised just how much I enjoyed it; the rituals may have been alien to me but it was handled in a way that both taught me something new about Japanese culture and provided a very moving story. Daigo and his boss Ikuei Sasaki show the utmost respect for the deceased and their relatives unlike one pair of undertakers we see later in the film. Masahiro Motoki and Tsutomu Yamazaki did great jobs bringing real humanity to the roles of Daigo and Ikuei, Ryôko Hirosue also put in a fine performance as Daigo's wife Mika. Don't be put off by the subject matter; give this film a go if you want something gentle but genuinely moving."
"dhaufrect-1","10","0","0","10 February 2012"," ""Departures"" is literally a departure from the ordinary film.
","Yojiro Takita has created a masterpiece of cultural and musical cinema that literally overwhelms the audience with humor, emotion, sensitivity and great talent. The story surrounds a Cellist in the symphony in Tokyo. He is Daigo Kobayashi, played so perfectly by Masahiro Motoki. His wife, Mika Kobayashi, played by Ryoko Hirosue, is equally as artful in her role as an adoring spouse willing to grow and learn in their marriage. After the symphony owner closes the organization, the couple moves to Daigo's original home town village where he is desperate for a job (now in debt for his beautiful cello). The very most outstanding role is that of Ikuei Sasaki, played so well by Tsutomu Yamazaki. He is the ""Okuribito"" or one who prepares the body for cremation. His believable and sensitive portrayal of this unusual job is remarkable. There are of course musical interludes with the cello as well as the symphony that powerfully supplement the already dynamic cinematic experience. It is not a film for those who are unable to appreciate the sadness of the death experience, however, I highly recommend this film and its honest approach to a delicate subject that is handled with dignity for one of life's most common experiences. It is now available on DVD and a 2008 film not to be missed."

","It's a film of a young man's vocation that consists in spreading peace of mind and soul through the execution of an exquisite ritual. At the same time it is the story of a marriage before the birth of the first child and a young wife's discovery what an interesting husband she has found. Also, it shows the constructive effect of a good father figure on an otherwise lost soul. The film has many moving, sometimes explosive scenes and is, in the end, I do not know a better word, ""meaningful"" in a mysterious way that cannot be described. I addresses and calms our fear of dying. The whole story is build around five mysterious ceremonies that contain and express what it means to be a human being."

","This is a real gem. I haven't seen a movie like this for quite a while - and I've seen quite a few lately. Actually I must say I haven't seen a movie like this for way too long. This movie took a hold of me right from the start, and didn't lose its grip for a second. Although I'm trying, evidently, it is hard to describe exactly how beautiful this movie really is. I guess everyone should find it out for themselves. Suffice it to say that it is movies like this that make watching movies worthwhile. <br/><br/>On of the many messages in this movie I was able to distill is that everything happens for a reason. Whether or not the latter is actually true will probably always remain a mystery. It is, however, something I believe in. And it is for this, that I suddenly see, why this movie moves me."

","It's not enough to explain the storyline or plot of this movie - watching it is something else. From the very beginning you see that although the film has a very morbid title and theme, that this movie is about much more than preparing the dead. <br/><br/>Unlike most Japanese dramas this story shows the real, believable emotion involved in the lives of so many people. However, there's also a lot of very subtle but humorous comedy.<br/><br/>It will get you close to tears - whether you often cry in movies or not(like me) - and again not just from the deaths. There's family tension, abandonment, pressure of social normality and love. This film is a gateway into real Japanese emotion - something that is very rare in the Japanese world.<br/><br/>You will not forget this movie. It is the best I have seen."

","I believe this movie won the Oscar for best foreign film, and it is easy to see why. The main character is Daigo, a young man who grew up playing the cello, and finally has a job with an orchestra. But it is quickly dissolved and Diago decides that he really isn't good enough to pursue a well-paying professional career. So he and his young wife move back to the smaller community he was raised in.<br/><br/>He needs a job, and finds an advertisement for ""departures"", which he interprets as some sort of travel booking service. He interviews and ""Boss"" offers him a job, on the spot. We find out later it was because Boss had a hunch about Daigo.<br/><br/>But the ad was incorrect, Boss says it is for ""the departed"", a job to prepare dead bodies for the coffin. We see, in Japanese culture, this involves a process that is performed in the home, with friends and family looking on. It involves ceremonial washing of the body, all in an elaborate choreography to keep the body itself from being exposed.<br/><br/>Daigo gets off to a rough start, he isn't sure he wants to deal with bodies, and the stench at one home, where the person had been dead for a few days, really gets to him. Besides, he didn't even admit to his wife, Mika, what he actually did. <br/><br/>But Diago is a natural, once he gets over the initial hurdles. He has a natural empathy for family members and a reverence for the dead. Friends and then his wife try to get him to quit, but Daigo sees his profession as something good, as it contributes to the happiness of survivors. Eventually, when a close friend dies, and Daigo performs the ceremony, everyone realizes this too and Diago's profession is finally appreciated for what it is.<br/><br/>Masahiro Motoki as Daigo Kobayashi <br/><br/>Tsutomu Yamazaki as The Boss <br/><br/>Ryôko Hirosue as Mika Kobayashi"
"petesherratt","9","0","0","1 April 2011"," Death And Intimacy
","Death is only a vague looming fear for most of us but for Daibo Kobayashi it becomes an everyday fact of life after he replies to a newspaper advertisement for staff in ""Departures"". His education is often hilarious if sometimes grotesque as he learns from his boss how to prepare a corpse for cremation, a job in days gone by done by the family of the bereaved, but these days performed by contracted professionals in the family home and in front of them and their guests with great ceremony and dignity. The job is not highly regarded, however, and he is seen as rather ghoulish by others (including his own wife!) but this only reflects their anxiety of saying a final farewell, movingly brought home when he is repeatedly given heartfelt thanks on leaving after having completed the job, and the relief of his clients becomes apparent. In a full 2 hours that never becomes dull his personal life, his artistic life and his professional life are kept in a dynamic and entertaining tension before the preparation of the corpse of his estranged father becomes a synthesis of all three in the last act of intimacy possible between father and son."

","No matter how many awards the movie had won or no matter how many movie fans had graded five stars, how could ever a story about guys who make livings by placing corpse in coffins entertain or even touch my heart? Impossible!!<br/><br/>A couple of weeks later, I went to a movie theater to see Oshii Mamoru's animation film; I had beautifully forgotten about this one. I was surprised to see a crowd of people, mainly housewives and old folks, making lines on weekdays, toward the ticket office #3 with a sign in front that read ""Departures"". Impossible!<br/><br/>I changed my mind and joined that line in order to see their disappointment. Frankly speaking, I was very exhausted. Um... very exhausted from two-hour laughter, running nose and excitement! Gee, how could ever...no, never mind. <br/><br/>Actually I kept having 'deja vu' while watching and then I found myself stepping into my childhood memory which had been sealed in deep mind, recalling someone who had departed with regret and sorry just like one of the characters in this film.<br/><br/>At the end roll, I could hardly believe my eyes to learn that the film was shot in his hometown, where I hadn't visited for years. Was ""Departures"" a stone letter from him? I wondered. Impossible?"
"fablesofthereconstru-1","5","6","20","30 June 2009"," Rock music
","Daigo Kobayashi(Masahiro Motoki) paid eighteen million dollars for his cello before he realized there were ""limits to (his) talents."" Now that the orchestra is being dissolved, the musician quits the professional music world, and leaves Tokyo with his wife Mika(Ryoko Hirosue), but not before selling the cello to a dealer. The manner in which Daigo gives up his vocation so easily, makes it easy to agree with the unemployed cellist's assessment that being a musician ""wasn't his dream after all."" Daigo retreats to the small town he originated from without bothering to make the most basic fundamental overtures towards other philharmonics. As it turns out, the exorbitanly-priced instrument was probably an act of overcompensation, a ploy to conceal his cello envy from colleagues, and from himself. It's not that Daigo lacks talent(symphony orchestras don't hire hacks), but he lacks that deep-seated reverence for the music, and for the composer who laid down the notes on parchment: in other words, for the dead(a good musician performs a resurrection of the past when he sits down to play). ""Okuribito"" is about a man who goes through the motions before he learns the true meaning of ""performance"".<br/><br/>Understanding that his new job doesn't involve the execution of any travel agent duties, Daigo accepts this career change, casketing, skeptically, with mostly predictable results, as ""Okuribito"" finds the inherent(but obvious) comedy and drama in handling dead people. Is there vomiting? Check. Is there crying? Check. With Sasaki(Tsutomu Yamazaki) as his mentor, Daigo learns how to touch people, as he comes into their lives at the apex of heartbreak. Like baroque paramedics, family and friends gather around the two men as they transfer the body into its coffin, steeped in Buddhist ritualism. People with differing religious backgrounds have to concede that the mournful spectacle is dignified, compassionate, and genuinely moving. While the casketing student learns the ropes of his new trade, he rediscovers the cello, his first cello, that the young boy would play for his mother(now deceased), and father(who he hadn't seen for thirty years). The cello of his childhood isn't grand like the highly calibrated instrument he sold off, but it plays true, still. And through the course of Daigo's casketing mentorship and ensuing autonomy, he learns to play music with reverence once more. Like Fred Flintstone who used the ballet to improve his bowling, Daigo's attention to detail as a casketer has infused the fatherless man with a musician's intensity for making the notes of dead white men indelible against time.<br/><br/>At first, ""Okuribito"" seems bent towards black comedy, especially in the opening scene, played for laughs, as Daigo makes the discovery of a male appendage as he smooths the presumed girl's body with ceremonial clothing. Things get even more farcial in a scene where Daigo poses as a corpse for an instructional video. Later in the film, there's a payoff to this taping, in which the wife discovers her husband's profession at its most graphic, when Daigo's employer applies a cloth deep in his anus. (The wife's disapproval of her husband's occupation might be a commentary on the changing mores of contemporary Japanese.) Mildly amusing at best, ""Okuribito"" jars the audience with a melodramatic presentation of its protagonist's baggage(daddy issues), a slide into bathos already set in motion after some minor characters(the woman who runs a bath house, and one of her customers) take center stage in a prolonged funeral scene that's too earnest for its own good. As the body combusts into flames at the crematorium, so does ""Okuribito"", and it gets even more maudlin.<br/><br/>Out of touch with his father since early childhood, Daigo travels to a fisherman's co-op to preside over the old man's casketing. Eyes, blinking back tears, art and ceremonial function coalesce into one, as Daigo discovers one of the rocks they had exchanged on a beach, clutched in his father's leathery hand made stiff by rigor mortis, during a flashback propagated by the nostalgic-heavy sounds emanating from his first cello. Like something out of Phil Alden Robinson's ""Field of Dreams"", Daigo plays his father's favorite instrument to bring him back, albeit in memory. They don't have a baseball to throw around, but both father and son have matching rocks as a way of reconciling the past."

"mohit_sinsniwal","6","1","2","1 June 2019"," Great Movie to watch
","The human dimension of this film touched me. Some of these things touched me to tears. I list a few of them.<br/><br/>1. The job of the professionals who prepares the dead for their last contact with the family (wake) and their passage to eternity (cremation). In the film, the characters who perform this job, teach the spectator a true ritual of respect and affection with the dead. ""Respect and affection with the dead"": feelings that the modern life tries to banish from its practices. In the modern world, the dead are inconvenient and dispatched quickly in funerals where the majority of those who are present, entertain themselves with parallel talks, instead of focusing on the reason why they are there.<br/><br/>2. The nobility and grandeur of this job that, in the film, is not associated with any religion, and is directly associated with dealing with human beings. This nobility and grandeur reflects also on to the dead, in the sense that it reminds us that the dead deserve our respect and affection, because a new stage of our relationship with them is starting.<br/><br/>3.The way Daigo grows, as he learns this job, and overcomes (i)the social stigma that society imposes upon the contact with the dead and, also, the people who have contact with the dead, as well as (ii) his personal repulsion with repulsive material aspects of death (odors, rot, etc.)<br/><br/>4. The way Daigo grows, as he incorporates the nobility and grandeur of the job he was forced to do because of the circumstances (he was jobless because the orchestra where he played cello was dismissed). And, when his wife discovers in what consists his job, and tries to force him to quit, he has grown so much that he chooses to keep the job instead to yield to his wife menaces.<br/><br/>5. The way Daigo grows and which leads him back to play the cello and celebrate life more than ever, playing outdoors and playing at home as he used to do when he was a boy.<br/><br/>6. The way Daigo wife grows when she has the opportunity to look close to the job of her husband, and begins to admire him and love him more. Wife who have the opportunity to convince Daigo to take care of his dead father, when Daigo runs away when he gets aware of his father death. Wife, who, when the opportunity showed up, says with pride to the individuals of the funeral, that were almost doing a dirty job with the deceased Daigo father, ""my husband will take care of him, he is a professional""<br/><br/>7. The way Daigo grows when he encounter again the love for his father and forgive him for having abandoned the family, while he prepares his old man for the burial.<br/><br/>8. How death can be seen as part of life process, when it causes some people to become aware of how much love they missed, and how much they have been loved without being aware of it.<br/><br/>All this happens because Daigo goes back to his hometown, a small town. That is, the return to his origins helps to renew the ties with the traditions and helps the character to put himself together again.<br/><br/>I'm omitting many precious details that appear throughout the film. These details must be seen personally, because the film was made with great sensitivity and expertise, and deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>Roland."
"lischneider","8","1","2","12 February 2017"," Departures
","The film, ""Departures,"" filmed and directed by Yojiro Takita, was a very well put together film, in my opinion. One of the main themes was somewhat creepy. This theme was funeral services in Japan. However, the film also focused on other things like family and the circle of life, which were both heartwarming to watch. Although the services were exotic and different as to how we celebrate and grieve for the dead in the United States, it was very interesting and gave the viewers a very cool global perspective. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys learning about different cultures, especially cultures in Asia, including Japanese culture. This movie also had some comical parts, so the film was not just depressing and interesting, but also funny at some points."
"logatherum","8","1","2","3 February 2017"," Pretty good film
","I really liked this film, despite some confusing elements and details. I liked it because I have never seen anything like this. It was on a taboo subject; death and funerals. It was really amazing to me to see the different traditions when a loved one dies in Japan, taking into account religion compared to the US. In some ways, I wish that we embraced deaths little more, and were not as uncomfortable with people dying as we are. I found that in Japan, the family is more touchy with the body, which makes more sense to me than how we are (which is hesitant) because we once loved these people! This movie makes me remember that death is just a part of life, and is okay. Like the main character, Daigo, said ""What's wrong with it!? Death is just a part of life! You will die, and so will I!"" I liked this part of the film because it's when his wife found out that he was an NK Agent and she was disgusted. I liked how Daigo stood up for himself and insisted that it's really not that weird, since death is so common and they are people we love. Personally, I do not frown upon morticians, death ceremony leaders, etc., because I think that it's a brave thing to do, and to frown upon this is a bit rude to the deceased. In my opinion, just because a loved one is dead doesn't mean that we should become hesitant around them during funeral ceremonies. The parts that were a bit confusing about this movie were the parts with the salmon and octopus. I thought it was a little confusing at the beginning when they were prepping the body and it came out that the person that had died was transgender. I only found this confusing because I don't think it was relevant to the movie, and since this was the very first scene, I thought maybe it would tie together in the end, but it didn't. Other than these parts, I thought the story line was really interesting and I loved the ending."

He answers an ad entitled 'Departures' thinking it's a travel agency only to discover that it's supposed to be 'Departed'. It's a funeral home, and he tries to hide it from his wife.<br/><br/>It's a charming funny little Japanese movie. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. The Japanese funeral ceremony is very fascinating, and it's a great look at a different culture. These are nice lovely characters. I find them very human. The comedy is very light. The drama is very touching. It is a little slow at over 2 hours, but the slow pace does fit the subject matter. It's very reminiscent of 'Six Feet Under' without some of the edgier and darker family drama. The social disdain for the work is very eye opening."

","Fortunately for me, this film had won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. If not, I may not have even known about this masterpiece of modern Japanese cinema. I have seen two of the other nominees, ""The Class"" and ""Waltz with Bashir"" both of whom are excellent as well. But ""Departures"" definitely deserves the honor of winning.<br/><br/>Kobayashi Daigo is a young cellist who just lost his job as the his orchestra in Tokyo was disbanded. He decides to leave city life behind and bring his wife back to his hometown. There he answers a want ad which he thought was for a travel agency. But it turns out, the ""journeys"" handled by this firm is of the eternal kind. Despite his initial aversion to the job, Daigo learns to love and be very good with the Japanese rite of ""encoffining"", or preparing the dead body for the casket.<br/><br/>With this rather moribund premise, the director Yojiro Takita was able to weave a most interesting and touching film experience to enthrall us all. It is both funny and sad. It is both entertaining and informative. It is a movie that proudly exhibits the uniquely Japanese rites of enconffining (nokanshi). Yet it is also universal in its celebration of the spirit of reconciliation between family members.<br/><br/>The cinematography is masterful, managing to be both majestic and intimate in the appropriate scenes. The music soundtrack, especially the cello playing, is excellent and evocative. The lead actor (Masahiro Motoki) is very effective in showing the maturation of Daigo in his craft and in his life. Daigo and his wife Mika make quite a (excuse the word) ""cute"" couple (looking like a typical young Asian telenovela love team), who also mature in their relationship. The climactic scenes of Daigo and his father are heart-wrenching yet uplifting, and handled with utmost love and respect. This is most definitely a most beautiful and sublime movie, not to be missed."

The plot is simple, a cellist for a large orchestra suddenly finds himself with out a gig. Moving home with his wife he applies for a job that has short hours and big pay unaware that its for a firm that prepares the dead for ""departure"". Needing the money and liking the people he meets he takes the job, but doesn't tell his wife. The film is what happens as he tries to find his place in this new world.

","Departures has to be one of the best movies I've seen this year! The story was great, the content was wonderful and it was a very cute movie to a degree. I thought it was a great look into the Japanese culture and it was awesome to see what the Japanese people feel about these ""Undertakers"". I honestly thought that the movie had a lot of very cute moments and I thought it was well balanced with a lot of serious moments as well. There was also a lot of great symbolism in the movie as well, like Daigo throwing the octopus back out to the ocean and it dying and when he was watching the river and the salmon were swimming up stream and the one died. I'll let you decipher that for your own. But I also think that its a good thing to watch the movie over again to make sure you get some of the smaller details, like at first, I didn't understand a lot of the finer details until I heard my friends talking about it, like Daigo's father had how he had the stone he gave him when he was a little boy and how he started to gain more and more respect for his father, even after not seeing him for 30 years. Though the movie , in my opinion, lacked a story line of what happened between when the father left and when we first meet Daigo. I would have liked to know a little more about the main character but it is what it is. I do believe though that this was a very good movie and I would recommend this to anyone willing to watch a great foreign movie. 10/10 would watch again."
"Deusvolt","7","1","3","19 March 2013"," A special niche in the funeral professions
","This film revealed to me what I consider to be a very special niche in the funeral professions. I've long known of embalmers, funeral cosmetologists, hearsemen and funeral masters of ceremonies. But this is the first time, I have encountered ""encoffiners"" who perform the ritual of enconffinment.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the precision and grace of the encoffiners portrayed in the film. They way the cleaned the bodies, their putting on and removal of blankets, shrouds and clothes without exposing any part of the deceased bodies other than their faces, hands and feet showed deep respect. Why do they take such trouble when the body is destined for cremation anyway? Why all the washing, dressing, shaving and make-up? Obviously, they believe in an after life for, after all, they kept using the phrase ""sending off"" in reference to what they do.<br/><br/>Their measured and reverent movements evoked in me memories of a Tridentine mass performed by a truly devout priest.<br/><br/>I realize that there are those who find this film boring, weird or allegedly inappropriately acted. As someone who worked closely with Japanese and traveled extensively in Japan, I hope to enlighten them on some aspects of Japanese culture through my anecdotes.<br/><br/>On a visit to the ancient city of Kyoto, my boss proudly announced that he was taking me to a ""cha-no-yu,"" a tea ceremony. I wondered what the big deal was because at the time I would rather be attending a Chinese lauriat or even better, go to a karaoke bar in Tokyo's Ginza. Nevertheless, I was deeply moved by the ceremony. First, I was struck by the respect shown to me by the lady who performed the ceremony who practically kowtowed to me. Her actions in the preparation, serving and drinking of the tea reminded me of the mass, the transubstantiation of the wine into the blood of the Savior and communion.<br/><br/>In two dinner visits to the houses of a Japanese executive and of a newsman, I found their hospitality rather formal but very satisfying as well. In both visits a female sat beside me to serve me. In the first instance, she was the matron of the house. In the second, it was a daughter. They way they presented and served food was almost ritualistic. In both cases, the ladies peeled oranges for me and the delightful surprise was not the taste of the oranges but they way they peeled them so that the peelings when laid on the table looked like flowers.<br/><br/>One night in Kumamoto while I was sleeping, I was awakened by the lady of the house who told me that it was snowing and invited me to come out and watch with her. She led me to the living room where there was a large glass picture window. As we sat on our haunches on the floor and watched the snow cover the lawn and the trees, I realized that she considered that a treat and to me, it was."

","2008's Academy Award Winner for Best Foreign Language Film didn't exactly come out of nowhere, but it was certainly the underdog in a race against Israel's Waltz With Bashir and France's Entre Les Murs. All three are worth seeing, but what makes Departures especially interesting is Director Yojiro Takita's filmography. <br/><br/>Considering the last Japanese AA Winner was Akira Kurosawa (for a Russian-made film), Takita is in elite company, especially for a filmmaker who cut his teeth making Pinku films. Pinku (Pinku Eiga) is essentially softcore pornography, but like most things in Japanese Cinema, it's nothing like its American counterpart. <br/><br/>Personally, I'm not a fan of Porn...but I am a fan of Pinku. The differences are myriad, but the fact a Pinku director would go on to helm a film as thought provoking, touching and poignant as Departures, comes as no surprise (even if it does suffer from unimpressive cinematography and a few corny moments). As much of a long shot as Departures was to win, the odds of an American porn Director making such a profound ascension to cinema's pantheon may be too staggering to even compute. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/"

","A meditation on death that's startlingly different from a plethora of similar films on the subject. Daigo, a cellist in an orchestra, loses his job after its dissimilation. Fate forces him to move back to his hometown and eventually take a job as a mortician. As Daigo grows to respect the noble work that so many shun, he is forced to confront the past in the form of his father, who abandoned him as a child, and the growing disdain of his wife on the job he has taken up. Everything about this film is masterfully done. From the taut script, which allows the camera to convey much of the dialogue, to the remarkable understated performances by the cast, and Joe Hiasishi's silently swelling scoreevery element falls into place perfectly. The subject matter is handled with the utmost care, careful to be tasteful and not too serious or light. Even so, Departures managed to make me smile, think, and cry at relative intervals. At its core, it's a film with a universal message, that says: Mistakes, human differences, and even death should be embraced rather than scowled upon. Because really, aren't we all hurtling towards the same ultimate destiny? Memories are easily altered or forgottenit's the moments that are precious, in every lifetime, from this one to the next."
"qhassani","Null","1","3","22 May 2009"," Departures: a death theme movie brimming with joie de vivre
","Death is as chilling and bloodcurdling a subject as it is inexorable. It becomes much creepier and spookier when it is a movie subject matter as cineastes mostly take sanctuary in the diverting world of cinema especially at a time the global economic downturn and the rambling despondency thereof is the talk of the town. Voilà! There comes Yōjirō Takita from Japan who turns the tables on all movie maharishies with his counterintuitive Departures.<br/><br/>Departures tells the story of an upwardly mobile cellist who, with his band disbanded, answers an ad for someone to help with departures. Much to his chagrin and consternation, Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) lands a job in the encoffinning service instead of a travel agency. For want of a better job and as his deadpan employer Shōei Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) offers him cash galore, he reluctantly accepts to ply his trade in cadavers. As embarrassing and outlandish as it is, he hushes up the whole affair from his doting wife. All initial ineptitude and ick factors asides, he warms to the profession as he cottons on to the fact that even with anal cotton-stuffing he can bring about a change in the way survivors treat this holy profession. The way he sends off the deceased to the afterlife (where the Japanese title Okuribito comes from) with special makeup and ethereal beauty is a solace to those left behind. It is the death of his own father against whom he holds a deep-rooted grudge for abandoning his family for another woman which radiates his already fresh life with more charm and pulchritude. For fear of spoilers, I can not go any further with the plot.<br/><br/>Highly oxymoronically, Departures is as morbid and deadly as it is vivacious and animated. With the chocolate-box countryside, gorgeous rivers, life inspiring bonsais and mellifluous music, this great helmer Mr. Takita embalms the taboo theme with sweetness, delectation and joviality that reminds the viewer of the fact that there is far more to death than meets the eye. Mr. Motoki's riveting and understated performance is the frosting on the cake. The only bone I can ever pick with the movie is its sometimes high reliance on contrived symbolism as in the case of a fish swimming to birth place only to wind up dead and a live octopus which reminded me of a scene in another Asian masterpiece ""Old Boy"".<br/><br/>Like most of other Japanese directors, Mr. Takita tried his hand with pink films. His resume starts from the ridiculous to the sublime. As death is the most egalitarian of all things, so he has nothing to be ashamed of."

In this ruinous process, and with the complicity of obtuse moviegoers who desire precisely not to see the unfamiliar, cinema can no longer exist in the way it has always reinvent itself – film after film. Cinematography was the sincere desire of reproducing the movement of the world, of men and women's language, of life. There was no cinema without love and it never had the power of parading soldiers or academic scientists or television people of today; Yôjirô Takita's ""Departures"" lacks any vital issues that could damage revenues and harm the film's commercial prospects, no payoff for you, you are bought – if of any interest ""Okuribito"" is an apt metaphor for human-to-citizen-to-consumer-to-consumed."

The movie depicts a young married man who lost his job as a cello player in an orchestra, but he needs to find a job soon. An NK departure agent isn't a glamorous job, in fact it's a job that nobody really wants. First off the main character, Diago doesn't look like the right person for the job, but that kinda is the point. To me it just doesn't look right and I think it would be better if Diagonal was a little older. My second problem with the film is the fact that it was so slow.

","I really enjoyed watched the film Departures. This was my favorite film that we have watched this year. This film is about a man named Daigo who quit his passion of playing the cello. Daigo and his wife move back to his hometown in Northern Japan to look for a new living. Daigo finds an ad for a job in which he thinks is a travel agency. Once Daigo was hired, he found out he was actually working as a mortuary. He learns the rituals used in preparing the dead for their final rest. I enjoyed watching this film because it was extremely easy for me to follow, unlike other films I have watched. It is very easy to tell that this film is not American because there is barely any fighting or rivalries. I did not like the beginning of this film because the start of it was a very slow pace. The more I watched this film, the better it got. My favorite part of this film is how the main character, Daigo quits his one and only passion to find a new one. I was expecting that Daigo would have different life because he quits what he loves the most. I like how the director displayed Daigo's character to be bold and willing try new things even if he fails."

I would rate this film a 4.5 out of 5. Although, this film is quite different compared to American films. For example it is very slow in comparison, so if you are looking for an action packed movie this is not the one for you. However, this is a very entertaining film and a must watch.

","Departures is an okay movie about a former orchestra cellist who has to move back home, to the countryside, with his wife. Diago, the husband and main character, finds a job as a traditional mortician. However dealing with the dead is considered a shameful job. Though being a mortician is shameful in a lot of cultures. I thought the way Diago prepares a body for a funeral was interesting; however, I would not want to do it myself. On another note, I did not care too much for the wife. I understand that she was trying to be supportive, but she did not seem like a real person to me. The only time she really got upset is when she found out that Diago was mortician. However, that might just be a cultural difference. From this movie the wife seems to take care of the husband and be a ""dutiful wife"", but in the US women are more outspoken."

","""Departures"" follows the life of Daido Kobayashi, a washed up cellist that attempts to find a new job and life back in his hometown. Little does Daido know, that when he discovers an ad for an opening at a departure agency that will change help him discover his real passion. Written by Kundo Koyama and directed by Yojiro Takita, ""Departures"" connects with the audience on a level that is very much opposite of its actions in the feature. The departure job that Daido ends up accepting is not for a travel agency like he and others thought, but instead, it is a funeral business that prepares the dead for their loved one's families and attempts to help the deceased, peacefully pass over into the next life. At the same time, we watch the arguments and solutions that occur between Daido and his wife Mika, as everyone encourages him to quit his job and peruse the passion of playing the cello in an orchestra. Overall, the movie ""Departures"" is a great example of what some Buddhist believe and how they treat the afterlife, as well as keeping a sense of entertainment through the journey of the protagonist searching for his true self instead of the self that is given to him by others or even the one that he thinks is the correct path. At its base, this movie shows the audience what it looks like to discover and pursue a person's authentic self that builds a level of identity that is real, true, genuine, inside of each one of us, and although it can change it is truly who you are at the core, and more importantly it is the one thing that separates everyone from each other because you are uniquely yours."

","..The Godfather, 8 1/2, Solaris, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, Paths of Glory.. etc. When it comes to the old cinema, it is easy for me to find a film that I consider a masterpiece.. that's not the case among ""new films"".<br/><br/>However, this is not the case with ""Okuribito (2008)"".. a truly flawless movie that is simply perfect. Based on ""Coffinman"", a memoir by Shinmon Aokia, the film follows the life of an untalented musician who goes back to his hometown only to find himself doing one of the oddest jobs for a living.. preparing the dead for funerals (Nokanshi).<br/><br/>The film drags you into it from the first beginning.. the highly executed film will draw your senses and pull your feelings to where the protagonist ""Daigo"" is.. you will feel his desperation, his confusion, his attempt to find himself, his place in a life that had not granted him enough talent to dig a safe place for himself as a cellist. He is lost and so he goes back to his hometown so maybe he'd find the rebirth.. he is searching for a new beginning.. for an answer.<br/><br/>Daigo is now preparing the dead for cremation.. his wife doesn't know and he is not sure about it.. he hesitates.. he struggles with his ""repulsive"" new job but keeps on doing it. After a while things really starts to change. He doesn't care about all the criticism, the social taboos, or the prejudices.. through one of the most controversial issues he now finds harmony.. through the horrid appearances he finds peace.. through pain he finds love, and through death he finds life. Now he too thinks that death is a gateway.<br/><br/>His wife left him when she knew what his job was.. she went back to him when she knew that she was pregnant thinking that she would find him wrecked without her.. the man who is now in harmony with life, who started to rediscover his own music and the love inside him is far from being wrecked.. he could love her, love everything, and simply live against the conditions.. even the ideas and feelings he carried for his father that left him when he was a child were about to change.<br/><br/>Every scene every shot in this masterpiece held certain significance.. The writing, editing, cinematography, acting.. every aspect of it was great. I should say I was fascinated by the character of Daigo's boss Ikuei (depicted by Tsutomu Yamazaki). The old man who has been in touch with the dead for a long time is now so wise about life in everything he does and says. <br/><br/>Some reviews criticized the film for overt sentimentality and predictability, while simply this film is not about twists or unpredictable events.. it's a journey to the inside.. a search a quest for peace and love and therefore also its sentimentality was more than proper.. it rips your soul from your body only to find yourself questioning yourself and the life you've been leading. In its drama, romance, or humor this film was just fascinating."

","Viewed on DVD. All departments = nine (9) stars. Director Youjirou Takita leads a team of film makers who undertake a very careful, detailed, and emotionally moving depiction of the lives of undertakers (starting with initial motivations to enter the profession). The arts of the mortician as dramatized in this photo play include skillful bereavement psychology, ceremonial showmanship (there is a not-so-subtle link to live theater acting), facial makeup (again tied to acting), and ""encoffinment"" of bodies in caskets (with various price points). It is also shown to be a profession typically despised (death is far from a popular subject matter in Japan and elsewhere) until services are required (marked by an abrupt 180 degree flip in attitudes). Direction and acting are across-the-board exceptional and continuously address this morbid subject in an upbeat manner. Nonetheless there is a drift here and there into the maudlin due to slow-paced scenes. The overly-long production does not help matters either. Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color), lighting, and editing are excellent. Surround sound field is mostly fine. Original score (there are also some short selections from classical compositions) is also excellent with deeply resonating and haunting Leit Motifs.

The topic of death is treated gently and beautifully, full of emotions and, again, poetry. <br/><br/>What doesn't work is once in a while the jarring change of tones.

Although the overall plot is rather shallow and at times comedic, the beauty that surrounds death and those that have to send off their kins away, is something that will keep anyone glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Hence, it is a good film, and it is understandable why it beat other foreign movie contenders (waltz with bashir and entre les murs), however, I personally think that it did not deserve the Oscars, considering that many elements are still lacking in this movie. In particular, I find the lack of visibility on the outcome of the main character's messed-up life, or what he thinks about himself, a little disturbing, considering that most viewers have a severe lack of knowledge on the lives of people in this line of work. Too much focus was diverted to the job and the clients' feelings. If the director have add a little more to this movie, i might change this statement."

He's been gradually working his way up, and while an accomplished actor in his own right, he's been challenging new roles that are experimental for him.

"doctorsmoothlove","10","0","1","2 February 2010"," Life after Death
","Last year's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film came as quite a surprise to many people. The Japanese drama Departures upset the French comedy The Class, and the Israeli documentary Waltz with Bashir. I have since viewed those three but not the last two Revanche (Austria) and The Baader Meinhof Complex (Germany). Until I see the remaining two, I won't decide whether I agree with the Academy or not. Each of the three films I've seen is an in-depth look at one cultural facet of their countries of origin. The Class is about the integration of mostly African immigrants into French society and Waltz with Bashir is an Israeli self-aware recollection of the 1982 Lebanon War. Departures has no chronological label and concerns the eternal event of death.<br/><br/>Too many ""serious"" films sugarcoat death into something overly dramatic, which renders the on screen image emotionally empty. A lot of time is devoted to watching someone pass. The act of dying is not what should be important. After all, the person responsible is unaffected by anything after the act has happened. Life must continue after someone dies. Departures is a film about this phenomenon from a Japanese perspective. It treats its subject matter with a carefully reserved respect that beguiles the pithiness so often ascribed to it.<br/><br/>At hand is Daigo, a young cellist from Tokyo, who relocates to his childhood home in the countryside following the dissolution of his orchestra. He and his wife move into a home inherited from his mother, and he begins looking for a new job. As fate dictates, he mistakes an ad for ""departures"" as a position in a travel agency, when it is really for a funeral home. He takes the job, much to the dismay of everyone outside of the business, including his wife. One family he works with openly acknowledges his new occupation is a social abomination. Daigo persists and does not quit even when his wife temporarily leaves him out of shame.<br/><br/>In his job as funeral director-to-be, Daigo travels to funerals to clean and dress bodies for cremation. As I assume is customary, the immediate family of the deceased watches in reverence. He must take great care in tending the bodies as nothing should be visible other than the hands and face. Director Yōjirō Takita purposely places the camera near Daigo's body to invite the audience to participate in the process. Whenever Daigo is dressing someone, only his hands are visible. Mr. Takita wants us to be aware of what is happening in detail. Families are then shown at slight distance. Some cry or become enraged, but nothing derails Daigo in his efforts as a human agent of the Spiritual Realm.<br/><br/>Daigo is successful in his apprenticeship and the community assumes that his job is permanent. His wife returns as a metaphorical allusion to the effect this film has on the viewer. She loves Daigo more than she fears rejection from others and begins to function normally, and her behavior is less erratic. His local fame brings him to perform for many of the close friends from his childhood. Yet he does not stoically approach these hurdles. He cries and finds solace in his music. Mr. Takita includes a montage of Daigo playing his cello outside in an overtly well-lit space and lets Daigo cry to show his character is a real person. It's both humbling and unforgettable."

Daigo Kobayashi is a devoted cellist in an orchestra that has just been dissolved & now finds himself without a job. Daigo decides to move back to his old hometown with his wife to look for work & start over. He answers a classified ad entitled ""Departures"" thinking it is an advertisement for a travel agency only to discover that the job is actually for a –Nokanshi- or encoffiner, a funeral professional who prepares deceased bodies for burial & entry into the next life. While his wife & others despise the job, Daigo takes a certain pride in his work & begins to perfect the art of Nokanshi acting as a gentle gatekeeper between life & death, between the departed & the family of the departed. This film won best foreign film Oscar 2009 81st Oscars. I was uncertainly about the word encoffiner. I could not find it in any dictionaries I wrote several & Miriam Webster replied the word has been in use since Shakespeare's time. The equivalent of a casketer in our context would be the embalmer or embalmer's assistants. (the bodies are not embalmed in Japan) Masahiro Motoki (The Longest Night in Shanghai) stars as the lead protagonist Daigo Kobayashi, a cellist in an orchestra & his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue). I especially enjoyed the casket business owner (NK Agency) performance (Tsutomu Yamazaki ) it was especially amazing, hilarious at times, and played with seriousness and comedy! He was so great in this role! Director Takita is a terrific visualist and the film's cinematography in and around this small town in Japan is phenomenal. It is really a beauty to behold. This is an excellent movie which covers ground not usually talked about in movies –the after death process. Japans rituals are much more unique & interesting than ours. It is a very well crafted drama with some very comedic moments. It does not get trapped into melodrama as some movies might have. Death reveals many things. Some maybe be harsh, some kind. This movie gives us an interesting look at all of them. The music is beautifully captivating in almost every scene of grief. The film could be criticized for its long length & sentimentality these were not negatives for me. Many in the film world were surprised and upset/angered when this film won best foreign film Oscar over the film Waltz With Bashir. It is a small film compared to Bashir (which was a really profound innovative film) I think this academy chose this film as it has a wider audience due to the film's earnest appeal for renewed respect toward the old & the dead. The film has also won 28 other prizes besides an Oscar. Departures is a somewhat difficult film to decide to see, especially after the story and theme are understood ( this is a movie about washing preparing dead bodies before cremation- not exactly the plot summary to encourage date-night romance or family night movies at home) The film covers heavy subject matter with delicacy, gentle psychology and at times comedic air. A cinematic masterpiece the film is highly recommended 5 stars (be sure and watch Waltz with Bashir also!)"

Yet as the film progresses and Diego struggles with the prejudice against his profession and his growing affection for it, the humor gives way to the seriousness of the subject and an implicit argument about art, individual fulfillment, and the complex relationship between the living and the dead.<br/><br/>Anyone who finds the thought of touching a corpse revolting, much less witnessing encoffineering, should see this film to see how lovingly a dear one can be prepared and how important the ceremony can be to the family's and friends' satisfaction that the body is ready for whatever journey comprises the next stage of ""life.""<br/><br/>I might even call this a romance as I think of Diego and his wife, and Diego as loving gatekeeper to the families and their beloveds. If you see it, you'll know why it won an Oscar and why encoffineering may be the most important departure any life-traveling family could take."

","In Yojiro Takita's heartfelt film,'Okuribito' (released in the U.S. & other English speaking countries as 'Departures'),Daigo Kobayshi is a cellist with a symphony orchestra that mainly plays to sparse audiences. When the owner of the orchestra drops the bombshell that he is disbanding the orchestra, Daigo sells his cello, and with his beloved wife,moves back to the house he grew up in. Seeking employment,he answers an advertisement proclaiming departures, figuring it's some kind of travel agent. When he discovers that,due to a print error in the newspaper that the job is preparing the dearly departed for the undertaker,he balks at the idea,but eventually warms up to the job. Daigo also begins to ponder the fine line between life and death & the relationship with his own parents (he lost his mother while on tour with the orchestra,and his father abandoned both Daigo & his mother when Daigo was only 8). This loving meditation on life and death is directed by Yojiro Takita,with a well written screen play by Kundo Koyama that blends drama,pathos & dark humour to put across the point. Masahiro Motoki plays Daigo,in a winning performance of a man coming to terms with life & death. Royoko Hirosue is his wife,Mika, who just beams charisma with every scene she plays in. Throw in some crisp photography and editing,and an enlightening evening of fine Japanese cinema is in store. Spoken in Japanese with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 by the MPAA for mature subject matter,and a bit of naughty language."

","This movie is unique in every way. It has a neither inspired, neither copied story about a person who carry out the encoffining of deceased people and how his life goes around with his beautiful wife at the town of his birthplace, to where he moved in after his musical career in an orchestra failed miserably, making him question his talent as a cello player. The performance of the cast, most notably Masahiro Motoki is astounding. The way he goes around his uneasy job, telling lies about his job to his wife, dealing with the memories of his father who left him at an early age makes his performance really mesmerizing. Add the beautiful story and performance with the picturesque surroundings and wonderful score, you get a movie that really deserve the Academy Award For The Best Foreign Language Film. <br/><br/>This movie is very different from the usual horror movie coming from Japan. This movie is not boring for a single instant and will make you cry by the end of the movie. Don't miss this movie because its a very special kind of film.<br/><br/>My Verdict: 9/10."
