","I totally agree with the blog posted on Dawn.com regarding this movie by Nadeem F. Paracha.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty', was quite an experience. Though sharp in its production and direction and largely accurate in depicting the events that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden, it went ballistic bad in depicting everyday life on the streets of Pakistan.<br/><br/>With millions of dollars at their disposal, I wonder why the makers of this film couldn't hire even a most basic adviser to inform them that<br/><br/>1: Pakistanis speak Urdu, English and other regional languages and NOT Arabic; <br/><br/>2: Pakistani men do not go around wearing 17th and 18th century headgear in markets; <br/><br/>3: The only Urdu heard in the film is from a group of wild-eyed men protesting against an American diplomat, calling him 'chor.' Chor in Urdu means robber. And the protest rally was against US drone strikes. How did that make the diplomat a chor? <br/><br/>4: And how on earth was a green Mercedes packed with armed men parked only a few feet away from the US embassy in Islamabad? Haven't the producers ever heard of an area called the Diplomatic Enclave in Islamabad? Even a squirrel these days has to run around for a permit to enter and climb trees in that particular area.<br/><br/>I can go on."
"DopamineNL","7","73","101","17 December 2013"," High quality (little action) and realistic depiction of the hunt for Bin Laden
","It's not an action flick, it's a thriller. About a tough CIA-chick who has a hunch about a guy who might eventually lead them to Osama Bin Laden. It takes her almost 10 years, a little waterboarding, a couple of dead colleagues and a lot of arguing with her superiors, but she manages to follow the lead all the way to the now famous raid in Abbottabad.<br/><br/>It's a very captivating film (even with its 160 minutes runtime), and the big raid at the end is quite intense and realistic. That said, Bigelow's previous 'The Hurt Locker' was (even) better. But it's close!<br/><br/>As for the controversy whether the film is 'pro-torture propaganda' or not: it shows what (likely) happened. A very unpleasant sight for Americans, sure, but that's no reason to leave it out. Whether or not 'OBL' would've been caught without the use of torture is speculation that has no place in this movie (it's a depiction of events, not a moral study).<br/><br/>Some Americans might still find it hard to watch a movie that requires you to form your own opinion about the actions of your country/government/army, instead of getting one spoon fed by those very same institutions. But given the America's options in government- potential it seems a luxury Americans no longer have."
"Danusha_Goska","7","471","785","11 January 2013"," Technically Impressive but Surprisingly Hollow
","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a grim, clinical depiction of the CIA search for Osama bin Laden. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. That sequence is so professionally shot it could be actual documentary footage. <br/><br/>""Zero"" has no real plot. Episodic scenes occur in a choppy manner, one after the other. Scenes consist of depictions of beating and water boarding of detainees in order to gather information, agents stalking a suspect in Pakistan's crowded, chaotic bazaars, terrorist bombings, assassinations and assassination attempts. There are also scenes in offices where characters stare intently at computer screens or interrogation videos, and characters yell at each other and use obscenities, as their frustrating hunt for Osama bin Laden wears them down. <br/><br/>""Zero"" makes no attempt to draw the viewer in with any human sentiment. Characters are given no backstory and no character arch. CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, is the closest the film has to a main character. She reveals no affect. Her face is blank. She isn't so much robotic as inert. We know nothing about her, except that she was recruited to the CIA while in high school – we are never told what would draw the CIA to a high school student. I didn't care about this character at all. All I kept thinking was, ""Jessica Chastain is being praised for *this* performance? Why?"" The dullness of her performance, and the underwritten character, made it almost impossible for me to lose myself in the story, such as it was. <br/><br/>Jason Clarke is very strong and charismatic as Dan, a CIA interrogator. Dan humiliates, beats, and water boards suspects, and then feeds them delicious meals of hummus and olives when they deliver. His depiction of his work as just another job – he could be playing a bus driver with the same amount and degree of expressiveness – is provocative. I wish I had gone to see a film built around his character and his performance. <br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed in the film. Feature films are an art form. I want them to do to me what drama can do. I want to be made to identify with a character and I want, through that identification, to learn more about life, or I want to be entertained. ""Zero"" did neither for me. I wasn't entertained, and my understanding and worldview were not expanded. I think the same material could have been better treated in a documentary with selective re-enactments. <br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" sidesteps key questions. Maya sacrificed years of her life to the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Dan risks his humanity by making his living beating and humiliating other men. Men, women and children throughout the Muslim world, and, as the film makes clear, in America's and Europe's cities, are eager to blow themselves up, as long as they can take some infidels with them. Why? The film doesn't even acknowledge that there are people out there asking the question, never mind attempting to suggest an answer. <br/><br/>The film opens with audio from the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, suggesting that the war between Islam and the non-Muslim world dates from that attack. Not so. Islam increased its territory through jihad from its invention in the seventh century until September 11, 1683, at the Battle of Vienna. After that defeat, Islam stopped its spread. The significance of the date of September 11 goes back over four centuries. <br/><br/>America's founding fathers had to deal with jihad; see Thomas Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates. Some argue terrorism, including the 9-11 attack, is caused by Western imperialism. The solution to these thinkers is for the Western world to be nicer to non-Western nations, to practice multiculturalism and to share the wealth. Others argue that jihad is inextricable from Islam, and that one necessary step is for the West to recognize and cherish its own unique virtues – to cherish that for which its spies, soldiers, and citizens fight, sacrifice, kill and die. <br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" never so much as brushes up against these questions. At its key moment, the film is hollow. We all know how the hunt ends – we all know Osama bin Laden is dead. ""Zero"" might have addressed why Maya gave the time of her life to that hunt, why Dan risked his humanity, why Seal Team 6 trained for years and risked their lives. ""Zero"" never does consider why these, who might have been the film's heroes, did what they did, and I walked out of the theater oddly unmoved by all the high tension and graphic violence I'd just sat through."
"weeatphish","5","386","640","30 January 2013"," Ehhh... seriously?
","I was honestly expecting a lot more, given the multiple nominations for awards. I really thought this movie was overdone and could have been pared down by at least 45 minutes. In the end, it was just a glorified ""we killed bin laden"" pseudo-documentary. The character relationships never developed and seemed empty. And I didn't really find the main actress very believable or that great. Scenes of shooting dead bodies also were probably a bit too much -- overall this movie seemed overly nationalistic and simplistic without delivering much in the way of content. I thought Hurt Locker was a significantly better movie. Again, I am somewhat surprised at the number of award nominations this movie received."

Especially if one is to make a movie about an event a couple of years after it transpired, surely a little Googling would help? It's an error so enormous that it made me think, ""If they got that wrong, why should I believe they got anything right?"" It's grossly insulting and reminds me that one should never rely on others to represent oneself.<br/><br/>""You don't understand Pakistan!"" White Chick screams at her supervisor at one point.

"superduperspit","1","354","598","6 January 2013"," I can't believe how bad this movie is
","After watching Zero Dark Thirty I am simply amazed at the critical reception it's received. In fact it's one of the most bizarre and puzzling critical reactions I've seen since more than 60% of critics liked Spiderman III on rottentomatoes To me this is simply not a good film. In fact I wouldn't even be as kind to call it merely OK or middling. I believe it's flat out bad.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is the type of film that needs exceptional editing and writing to work. This is because it's about a long drawn out process mainly done by people sitting at desks. The film I imagined, if as good as its reviews, would have cracking dialog, sharp plotting, quick editing The problem with the film is that it's writing and editing is quite poor. The dialogs in this film simply do not work and undermine talented actors/actresses. The characters talked to each other at a TV movie level of depth and linguistic expression. Many scenes, including some like the infamous F bomb laden ones simply do not feel believable as happening in a professional CIA setting. Many of the arguments feel stagey and ""we need you to act emotional here"" outburst-y, as mentioned like they'd do in a TV movie. I suspect the screenwriter wanted to make the people feel ""real"" and down to earth, except it does just the opposite. The dialog makes the characters feel contrived, as if trying too hard to feel real.<br/><br/>SPOILER - The other problem with the script is that while I do not know the details of what really happened vs what Bigelow and co. fictionalized, many parts of the manhunt felt ridiculous. eg. There is a scene where a terrorist spills all his guts information wise just because Chastain tricked him into thinking he told him all of that the night before and had memory loss. Would he really just give up and say everything like that? There's an entirely predictable explosion/death scene prompted by a smiley CIA agent going ""oh just let him into the base, we don't want to spook him by scaring him"" which was ridiculously naive by a trained professional. The CIA are shown a video of a detainee saying ""X character is dead, I buried him, btw here's a picture"" and they all just believe it as fact without questioning whether he'd be lieing. The entire plot hinges on catching a courier who they seem to find because of a long lost picture, and some other details I didn't really catch - either way the way they caught him was very confusing and not drawn out well plotting wise. The manhunt did not come off as very complex, intelligent or plotted well to me. It felt like the characters just sat around for a decade and waited for clues to fall in their lap!<br/><br/>Then there's the editing. This is a long, sloppily put together film. Many of the scenes feel unnecessary. There are long, forgetting scenes of people talking. For a large portion of the film I could hardly stand to watch the dull back and forths while keeping my eyes open.<br/><br/>Many people have pointed out the lack of character development. This is true but I also blame the dialog most of all. Chastain is a blank terrorist catching robot and simply does not feel like a real person to me. None of them do really. This makes it harder to cheer for them. They come off as terrorist catching line delivery devices, not real people with emotions.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty came off to me as a misfire on almost every level. It's poorly written, edited, it fails to make its characters or plot interesting. Zero Dark Thirty tries so hard to be ""realistic"" and ""naturalistic"" that it forgets it's a film. But not only does it go in that docu-drama wannabe direction but it does a very poor job of feeling realistic due to its stagey characters and dialog and clearly contrived plotting and set-ups. It neither has its cake or eats it.<br/><br/>This is simply a colossal misfire after the near masterpiece that is the Hurt Locker for Bigelow. I am truly shocked at how poor a film this is on every level after the critical reception to it. One of the very worst films I've seen all year"
"naerayan","5","231","398","12 January 2013"," Why on Earth should this movie deserve an Oscar?
","Poor screenplay, poor dialogs, extremely bad actors and some strange and disturbing way of directing for a two hour and a half movie. The film is boring, the plot is childish and Maya it seems to be a little bit psychotic. Kathryn Bigelow tried the Hurt Locker recipe once again but this time her way to shoot just couldn't make anything understandable and bearable. Sometimes steady, most of time shaky, the camera is so confusing, especially in small spaces that you don't know what the director want to say anymore....<br/><br/>And the script is as shallow as a B series movie...<br/><br/>Please don't loose your time. You'd better watch Tinke Taylor Soldier Spy or even Looper, at least you'll get entertain. Or if you want something European (because Bigelow it seem to me that she wants to copy some of the European ways to shoot images) take a look at Beyond the Hills. ;)"
"pwiesike","10","146","246","15 May 2013"," A Perfect Depiction of the UBL Saga
","I'm not claiming that this movie is 100% factual or even close to it but I think the filmmaker did a brilliant job of chronicling the UBL saga. IMO the theme of the movie in a nutshell is this: We got this guy (maybe?) but at what cost and were we justified? These are not easy questions to answer and they are left open ended for the most part.<br/><br/>The three main criticisms I've come across in the reviews is that 1) The movie is propaganda 2) It glorifies torture and 3) It is factually inaccurate. The third is probably a legitimate criticism but the movie really makes no pretenses about being a documentary and there is a prominent disclaimer at the beginning that it is based primarily on eye-witness accounts (and it is common knowledge that those can be unreliable). Regarding the death of UBL - well the movie even leaves that open ended which is pretty consistent with the actual reported events. We only get brief blurred glimpses of the side of his face and the only definitive identification comes from the 'expert' protagonist who is clearly somewhat derailed and obsessed with the manhunt (and who also stated UBL was at that location with 100% certainty).<br/><br/>That leads in to the first criticism. I fail to understand how this movie can be perceived as propaganda. How does portraying a 10 year ordeal culminating in an unglamorous methodical execution style raid (in which a helicopter crashes and SEALS kill possibly innocent bystanders with machine like precision) where the target's identity is not a even a certainty even remotely constitute a biased pro American agenda? Not to mention that the whole raid is brought about by a hunch and a fluke stroke of luck and not any actual key pieces of information obtained through interrogation (other than a name). If anything luck was the deciding factor in taking down UBL - not American awesomeness.<br/><br/>Now the torture - How does showing torture equate to glorifying torture? Does Braveheart glorify torture too? Again - this had the opposite effect on me. The viewer is forced to confront the unpleasant reality that we tortured many detainees (probably pointlessly) in our desperation to capture UBL and bring him to justice. What was the primary motivation? Revenge? Safety? Do the ends justify the means? Essentially that's the exact question the filmmaker is posing to the viewer by exposing the torture to public scrutiny.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie just rubs people the wrong way because they find it too sympathetic to government officials. It's easy to criticize to the Government and trust me I am far from an optimist when it comes to American politicians so I do it often. Obviously our leaders were faced with some difficult decisions after 9/11. Did we handle things the best way? Certainly not, but for better or worse this thing played out the way it did and we have to deal with it and move forward."
"OriEri","5","214","381","5 January 2013"," Poor writing. Requires too much suspension of disbelief to pretend it is real...and slow
","If this movie had been entirely fictional, I would have given it 2 stars. The importance of the story and the care taken in some parts gave it 5.<br/><br/>Before I excoriate, here are the good points. It tells a very important story. Our country was spending soldiers' blood and sanity and HUGE amounts of money. Getting UBL made it easier to stop. Even if he had become less relevant to Al-Qaeda as the Pakistan station chief said in the movie, he still was important to many voters.<br/><br/>The movie used real names and stories of persons of interest to the analysts.<br/><br/>The movie shows how nasty the relatively low key torture techniques that were used in the US's name are. I have no idea how realistic they were, but certainly it was not fun to watch. Hopefully it gives the viewer some sense of what they are approving or disapproving when they express their views to their elected representatives.<br/><br/>The raid was depicted realistically, though I am no expert. It was quiet; the soldiers weren't jumping around yelling ""Hooyah"" during the operation. The children and women in the house were upset and terrified and pitiable. Things went wrong and the soldiers needed workarounds. The writing did not put the analyst physically present at the raid just to add drama ( I have no doubt that was discussed and rejected.) The only complaint I have is the man who killed UBL went into a shell shocked daze afterward. I suspect after all that training, those men are VERY professional and would be working quickly and with focus to get the job done and get out.<br/><br/>Now the criticism: A few more subtitles and back story explanations of names when they were used, would make easier for westerners to follow the interesting paths of reasoning the analysts were following. Would have kept the brain engaged a bit more. <br/><br/>The movie ends up being rather slow...seriously. A few people in my row were nodding and one woman two seats down was sleeping through almost the entire movie. (Maybe she had a rough night. . . ) <br/><br/>Would have been nice to see some more character development. Except for a few pairings, you could hardly tell from one scene to the next how two people would interact. One scene professional, one scene companionable, the next screaming and the next compassion, with no explanation of the shifts. Huh? Maybe a little more time with the character's back stories or seeing them interact in different ways would have smoothed this out. <br/><br/>When a movie pretends to be documenting real events, even if embellished for dramatic effect, it makes operation of suspension of disbelief more difficult for me. The depicted behavior of the civilian intelligence analysts was often amazingly unprofessional, ignorant of very basic security practices and inconsistent and that pulled me out of the story.<br/><br/>Examples: Maya is meeting a colleague for dinner at a Marriott. She floats the name of the person they are hunting for across a table in an insecure environment where anyone could hear! I hope real analysts operate with a bit more discretion when they are away from the ID badges and pass code protected doors and computer systems.<br/><br/>Later in the movie after the bombing at the Marriott, Maya is invited out to eat and says ""I don't eat out...too dangerous."" Later, she is seen half intoxicated at a bar when a colleague delivers a rather important piece of intelligence equipment to her (which we never see ir hear about again).<br/><br/>A senior CIA officer screams at his team during a meeting. Nothing more constructive was communicated than ""Please get me some answers"" except with no ""please"" and lots of histrionics. Not exactly effective leadership. Really? With all the stress in the lives of folks in the field already, it is hard to imagine any high level worker lasting very long in that position with that sort of behavior. The team would self destruct around him.<br/><br/>Maya, shrieks at her boss in a hallway in a way that would make anyone question her stability. Very unprofessional. Unstable people don't work in classified environments very long.<br/><br/>Maya, in a high level meeting with the CIA director, blurts out irrelevant-to-the-discussion-data just to get some attention. (Paraphrase: ""the house is 4021 feet away, eight tenths of miles, not one mile"") This is 10 years into her character's career! A ""I have nothing important to say, but pay attention to me"" meeting strategy is discarded rather quickly after a little experience in the real world. . .or folks who use it find themselves in quiet positions pretty quickly where they won't distract from the core discussions and waste people's time. Surely the writer could have had her say something that was actually important to the discussion that no one else could have known? <br/><br/>Multiple classified conversations between CIA folks on *cell phones* ?? What are they even doing with cell phones in a secure area?<br/><br/>I was a tad disturbed that real suicide attack stories where real people died were doctored up to make them apply more directly to the characters in the movie. I am thinking in particular about the Chapman attack. A 45 year old mother of three was killed for real, but she wasn't an analyst out of Pakistan at the time, and her name was not Jessica.<br/><br/>Check out the wiki article on the Camp Chapman attack in 2009 and read the section on contractor and CIA casualties.<br/><br/>I have to give the writer that leeway to turn a complete snoozer into something with a little excitement, but this seemed disrespectful.<br/><br/>In short too unrealistic to feel like a true to life story, and too slow to enjoy like a piece of fiction."

That being said, this movie had me literally on the edge of my seat for 2 1/2 hours and is a fantastic f-ing movie.<br/><br/>People will want to compare this movie to the hurt locker, which is fair in the way that it locks you into scenes and is a war movie.

It's not your typical Hollywood movie that introduces a protagonist and develops him/her until the conflict is resolved. This movie is about tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden, and the way they used the main character as a metaphor for America as a whole was really impressive, even while refraining from your typical, often boring character developing scenes.<br/><br/>Much more than your average action movie, Zero Dark Thirty was a combination of badass scenes, phenomenal editing, and music, and a fantastic (mostly) true story with epic scope that I can't wait to see again.

","Knowing this movie was nominated for best picture, I was afraid that I was losing my mind after seeing it, since what I saw in the theater was: one dimensional characters being frustrated about not being able to do anything, inter-cut with a newsreel about current events, followed a ridiculously overdone operation to kill a couple people in a house.<br/><br/>No doubt this is a difficult story to tell dramatically, since it's about people who are doing a job that is passive by nature. But what was striking is how completely devoid it was of character. Courtroom dramas trade in the same stock, but even the most pedestrian episode of Boston Legal or LA Law contain more compelling characters than anyone in this movie.<br/><br/>And most movies about real events overcome the inherent story problems by provoking thought in the audience about the events themselves. What they lack in dramatic momentum, they make up for in unsettling questions. But it was amazing how completely empty this film was of anything resembling a question about what was going on. It was as if Kathryn Bigelow thought she was just ""presenting reality"" to the audience. <br/><br/>In 50 years, people are going to look back at this movie in the same way that we look at the jingoistic WWII Hollywood features now - as empty fare designed to prop up our fragile national psyche.

The idea of doing it mostly in the dark with flashes of illumination by ""night vision"" green is a brilliant touch, which most directors would never have attempted. <br/><br/>The performances by Jessica Chastain, of course, Jason Clark and Jennifer Ehle are top drawer and the torture scenes, while brutal, are necessary--because that's the way it happened.

","Mrs. Bigelow is obsessed with obsession. Blue Steel, Point Break, the Hurt Locker, now Zero Dark Thirty. The background of the story changes, but the story remains the same. Behind different faces, the same obsessive character. The obsession portrayed in her films actually is quite simplistic and straightforward, but anyhow, in our time her ""oeuvres"" are considered as deep, realistic, and arty. After an adrenaline fix come the inevitable frustration and emptiness of living, Mrs. Bigelow shows it to us over and over again; her hero has a conniving streak in him/her, but a hero nevertheless. She's so focused on her obsessed character, it's easy for her to claim that the Iraq war film she made was apolitical, and ZDT, a political thriller, has no political agenda. <br/><br/>Mr. Boal is a journalist. When he begins to write stories for the big screen, we praise his ""journalistic approach"", and we can easily forget that, as most journalists these days in the US, Mr. Boal is an embedded journalist. <br/><br/>Unlike the Hurt Locker, which, by opening with a quote from Chris Hedges, gives a false impression of an antiwar movie, ZDT is at least honest. At the very beginning it gives us a warning:<br/><br/>""Based on first-hand accounts of actual events""<br/><br/>Aka what CIA told us and what CIA wants you to see.<br/><br/>The decade-long war on terror seen through a CIA agent's eyes, the whole film is shaped into a CIA narrative. As Mrs. Bigelow wrote in her LA Times article, defining ZDT's raison d'être: <br/><br/>""we should never discount and never forget the thousands of innocent lives lost on 9/11 and subsequent terrorist attacks. We should never forget the brave work of those professionals in the military and intelligence communities who paid the ultimate price in the effort to combat a grave threat to this nation's safety and security.""<br/><br/>How many times do you hear this from a CIA/Pentagon/WH spokesperson?<br/><br/>Yes never discount and never forget the victims of 9/11, we heard their voices; we saw the London bus bombing survivors bloody faced, eager to share their story. But we can well forget hundreds of thousands innocent civilians killed by US forces in the past ten years, not single one of them had a place in this film. We saw angry Pakistanis gathered in front of American embassy, jumping like savages. But we would not see those CIA drone strikes, bombing Pakistani wedding, killing women and children. ""They hate us for our freedom!"" we saw Mayor Bloomberg repeat Bush's line. Yes never forget the brave work of those professionals in the CIA, they worked their ass out torturing terrorists, what a psychological trauma it would be watching so many naked men every day? But we can certainly forget there was also innocent people got kidnapped, tortured by these brave professionals. Forget torture is a war crime, we got Ben Laden.<br/><br/>""Those of us who work in the arts know that depiction is not endorsement."" Mrs. Bigelow defends her film in her LA Times piece.

"ferguson-6","7","95","185","5 January 2013"," No Easy Decade
","Greetings again from the darkness. Kathryn Bigelow entered the realm of elite directors when her war thriller The Hurt Locker exploded onto the Oscar scene a few years ago. Once again she proves why the critics adore her, and the movie going masses stay away. She is an expert filmmaker, a brilliant technician, though not much into the whole entertainment scene.<br/><br/>We always try to label films and this one doesn't quite fit as thriller or action, or even war, genre. It's really a tense, procedural drama focusing on the behind-the-scenes CIA hunt for Osama bin Laden. In fact, it's mostly the story of one obsessed CIA agent's research and un-wavering pursuit of the one most responsible for the tragic events of 9-11-01 (as well as many others).<br/><br/>The film started out as a story of the nearly decade long pursuit and the failure to find him. Everything, including the movie, changed on May 2, 2011 when Navy SEAL Team Six pulled off the daring and historic mission to kill bin Laden. The book ""No Easy Day"" by Mark Owen (pseudonym for real life SEAL Matt Bissonnette) was released and many of the details became public. Bigelow and her writer Mark Boal (former journalist) went even deeper into research mode and now the film has instigated Congressional hearings in regards to some of the scenes.<br/><br/>Bigelow presents this as old school, hard core males vs the intellectual, instinctive and brazen Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. In the book, she is referred to as ""Jen"", but her name matters not. What's important is her laser-like focus for almost 10 years, despite the numerous attempts by her superiors to ignore her theories.<br/><br/>Much of the film deals with the group meetings and presentations to CIA mid-managers, who either don't trust her or refuse to put their own careers on the line. Maya remains relentless. She finally gets a audience with CIA Director Leon Panetta (played by James Gandolfini) and introduces herself as ""the M*****F****R who found this place, sir"". This comes across as confident, not disrespectful.<br/><br/>Bigelow and Boal refuse the temptation of providing any real backstory or personal life on these characters. We do learn that Maya was recruited right out of high school, so we can assume she wasn't a typical 18 year old. The only thought of a romantic interlude is quickly shot down by Maya proclaiming (in so many words), she's not that kind of girl.<br/><br/>Most of the men in the film are presented as near Neanderthals. Jason Clarke is the old school field agent who has mastered the use of torture, water-boarding and humiliation to gain information from detainees. The ""60 Minutes"" clip of Obama saying that America will no longer utilize torture is one of the few tips to national politics that the film offers up. The only politics are those played by station chief Kyle Chandler, who is protective of his job, and Mark Strong, who seems relatively helpless without the support of his superiors. All this while Maya keeps pushing and pounding for action.<br/><br/>The Langley vs Field work provides a distinctive line in the sand between the two worlds, and emphasizes just how easy it is to make a mistake in judgment. What if we had been wrong on the location of bin Laden? What if the ""fortress"" had belonged to a drug dealer instead and the SEAL team had invaded a private home within the boundaries of supposed ally Pakistan? Jessica Chastain is believable and tough in her role, and Jason Clarke dominates the screen in his early scenes. Other fine support work comes courtesy of Edgar Ramirez, Mark Duplass, Harold Perrineau, and Jennifer Ehle. When we finally get to the strategy session for the mission, we meet SEAL's played by Chris Pratt and Joel Edgerton. The 25 minutes or so dedicated to the helicopter mission are filmed as if we are wearing the same night-vision goggles worn by the brave souls storming the castle. It's a very impressive sequence.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the details of a procedural drama, then you will find much to like here ... knowing the ultimate outcome doesn't affect the suspense one bit. However, if you seek an entertaining respite from your daily grind, this one will offer no assistance ... despite another excellent and minimalistic mood score from Alexadre Desplat."

","This (slightly) fictionalized dramatization of the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden is often difficult to watch, for a variety of reasons, but that doesn't mean it isn't any good. It's just not your typically polished, glistening Hollywood rendition, and that takes a bit of getting used to. Flubbed lines are left in the final cut, which serves to humanize the cast. Quiet, unsuspecting character moments are unforgettably interrupted by sudden explosions of violence - effectively mimicking (or so I have to imagine) the bloodrush of a real-world terrorist assault. The methods of torture employed in America's hunt for Al-Qaeda's leader are brazenly featured, as are the mixed spoils of their occasional success. The first act points a firehose of information at the audience, leaving them just as overwhelmed and buried by minutiae as the lead. Jessica Chastain is fiery and confident in that role, essential traits for the complicated character she occupies, but the rest of the supporting cast fades into the wallpaper when she's around. The actual onslaught on Bin-Laden's compound, which eats up the last hour of the film, is the smoothest and most accessible scene by a longshot, remaining factual and vividly lifelike while also ratcheting up the pacing and the tension. As a whole, though, the film is well-acted and effective, but often slow and over-inflated. Though it paints just one side of the story, it refrains from drawing any final conclusions and instead leaves the viewer to deal with the validity of America's motives and methods."

What we see is much more important than what we are told in movies, and what we see is an endorsement of torture.<br/><br/>One has to believe that the bad guys (terrorists) are ""out there"" and not within; it is of course possible that bad guys are everywhere, including here. This glorification of violence, terrorism (not their terrorism, ours), and jingoism - simply because it is directed by a woman does not mean that it is pro-woman, or pro-human.<br/><br/>I especially hate the obnoxious scene after the torturing of the tortured individual accepting (almost like a slave with his master) his lesser role by kowtowing to his torturer.<br/><br/>I also don't believe Jessica Chastain gives an even ""good"" acting performance. Claire Danes does the same role better on the offensive t.v. series ""Homeland"". There are no great supporting roles either.<br/><br/>I don't go and see everything, but of the films I did see in 2012, this is definitely the single most offensive and disgusting movie I saw. I worry about the mindset of critics who loved this movie. I find it fascinating to read their excuses and their weird re-construction of what is actually up there on the screen.

The other strange fact is the casting of Jessica Chastain. She seems elsewhere, emotionally and otherwise. I couldn't connect with her, I was far too aware of the ""acting"" I see she's getting lots of acting nominations, I don't quite get it. Katheryn Bigelow at the helm does a truly extraordinary job, but I can't help, worrying that most people will take this as fact and, perhaps, the most important aspect is pure fiction.

"babe_in_arms","Null","51","98","13 January 2013"," torture is just another form of terrorism
","(1/10/13, one star) Kathryn Bigelow and her new movie Zero Dark Thirty deserve our universal contempt and condemnation for condoning torture. Bigelow revisits the darkest chapter in U.S. history (U.S. torture in the Middle East in the aftermath of 9/11) and dwells on it, not to condemn the actions of U.S. leaders who authorized this campaign of state terror against Muslim prisoners but rather to vindicate the torturers and justify the savagery that earned the undying enmity of millions of Arabs. Bigelow is too crafty to explicitly hold up criminals as heroes worthy of veneration but instead constructs a superficial veneer of faux-journalistic neutrality that will fool only the most gullible along with those anxious to buy into the dangerous delusion she is peddling. She dedicates large segments of her movie to portraying U.S. torturers as selfless patriots and their victims as homicidal maniacs, but not one minute to explaining why they attack us. Of course, we can't have Americans wondering what our government had been doing to make Muslims hate us so much. And with 9/11 our national descent into deceit, denial and self-delusion began, with no end in sight yet. According to the official myth still being perpetuated by our government and unconscionable propagandists like Bigelow, Muslim radicals are never rational actors but rather just crazed fanatics, to be tortured and destroyed like mad dogs. And now Bigelow compounds this ongoing national folly with the resurrection of its corollary Big Lie: torture of detainees is compatible with democracy, even necessary to protect it.<br/><br/>Torture is just another form of terrorism. When the state tortures detainees, it is state terrorism, directed ultimately against all humanity as well as against individual detainees. Torturers degrade and dehumanize themselves, their victims, and any society that tolerates their crimes. How can anyone claim victory over terrorism when they employ it themselves? Besides, torturers (most famously, the Nazi and Communist regimes in Germany and Russia) have always rationalized torture on grounds of public security, but have always ultimately used torture as a weapon to terrorize the public and crush political opposition. (Do we really want to emulate the Nazis and Communists?) In the long run, torturers are a more pernicious threat to both our security and our liberty than any Al Qaeda agent could ever hope to be.<br/><br/>Senator McCain is right when he says that Zero Dark Thirty gives our enemies powerful ammunition to use against us, especially if it garners awards. Audiences around the world will see the movie as confirmation that the horrors of Abu Ghraib reflect the real soul of America."
"billygoat1071","10","77","154","13 January 2013"," The Straightforward Hunt
","One's appeal for Zero Dark Thirty is to see how it depicts the search for Osama Bin Laden like it seems too impossible to find him, like he's probably already dead, or almost doesn't exist. Even though there are controversies going around and some revelations, the story is still all dramatized. Without a surprise from director Kathryn Bigelow, the film is totally electrifying and deliberately engrossing. There is humanity left in the end that made this a lot more compelling, but that's the last thing we should talk about. It never backs away from the promise and stays focus on the mission. Zero Dark Thirty is a powerfully gripping thriller.<br/><br/>It's a straightforward mission and only about the mission. We can see the main protagonist's obsession of capturing Bin Laden even without showing any backstories. She's brave, probably too brave, enough on what she's doing. They have to make difficult decisions to where are they gonna go or who are they gonna find. The film is indeed a dramatize version of the ten year hunt. It plays too much suspense and sudden shock, but no matter what, every tragic event are still portrayed in a completely terrifying way.<br/><br/>There is no doubt this film will fall into a controversy. It features a torture scene that many think they justify it. It is so talked about and was against it but it seems the scenes only exists nothing more than showing that sort of truth. The most awaited part of the movie is indeed the climax. Just like anyone would imagine, it's a silent and mercilessly violent raid. There's a lot of humanity in the character Maya. As much as she aggressively wanted to find her target, she still cannot stomach any brutal interrogation and tragedy happening on her associates and other people. Jessica Chastain manages to weigh all of her personalities. Other strong actors like Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, and Mark Strong keeps their roles effective as well.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's prominent style is slick tension. Here she displays danger in any place where the characters go like something will suddenly explode or a loud gunfire. The action scenes is filled with suspense. One of the sequences can be tad too ridiculous for this movie but it didn't ruin a single thing to the experience. When it takes place inside the CIA or a meeting, it gets undeniably absorbing. The screen writing makes sure it's factual enough and interesting.<br/><br/>People's expectations might mislead them. Zero Dark Thirty is not only about finding and killing Osama Bin Laden but it's also about one's obsession and revenge to this terrorist. In the end, there's plenty of guilt to express but that proves that they are still human beings. We could merit its brilliant filmmaking and strong storytelling that made it feel like we're part of the search. We all know this is just a dramatization of the true events but all the horrifying truths like the violence stays to the picture. It's a story with nobody calling themselves heroes even though they defeated their enemy. It depicts the darkest parts of its history. Some might wonder how worse it could have been but ignoring all the commotion, Zero Dark Thirty is still a compelling thriller."

(NOt sure this is a spoiler since we were told by the US that OBL was there and was killed). Hilarious anyway that one of the choppers crashed. It seems that in all American rescues they must destroy at least one helicopter, from Iran through Somalia to Pakistan.<br/><br/>Anyway, it takes a long, long time to get there, in which we have to watch completely unsympathetic characters about which we care little, witness torture scenes where the torturers take too much delight in their work and seem worse than Nazis, and where we follow a completely bonkers CIA woman who probably cannot spell the word insubordination never mind avoid it No CIA analyst or any government employee would last five minutes with her attitude and actions.<br/><br/>It got to the point where I was cheering when anything bad happened to the Americans, who are supposed to be the good guys.<br/><br/>Also the audio used at the beginning from Sept 11. Whether it was real or not, it was an absolute insult to the victims and their families.<br/><br/>Crap dialogue, totally unfocused 'story line'.<br/><br/>When one thinks of low budget revenge films such as Raid on Entebbe and Victory at Entebbe and classier ones such as Munich which were gripping and made one feel good about the actions taken, one would think Hollywood could have made a superb movie about this event.<br/><br/>After Homeland and the manic Carrie and this with the crazy Maya, I would expect lots of off the wall women thinking they were ideal candidates to be front-line CIA officers in the fight against terrorism.<br/><br/>A missed opportunity to tell a stirring tale, possibly because a woman director wanted to make a feminist statement using a woman as the main character, drawing the men as idiots who were all wrong when the woman was totally right.<br/><br/>And creating a film that depicts US servicemen and civilian officers as amoral, torturing murderers is not the best way to convince the population that the fight against terrorism is not in fact the right way to stir up even more hatred and even more recruits to Jihad against the Great Satan."

"rooee","6","26","47","28 January 2013"," Propaganda done properly
","Zero Dark Thirty is a procedural CIA-based thriller in the mould of TV's Homeland. This film, however, is based on real-life events, so it doesn't have the benefit of being able to withhold in the way Homeland's first series did with Twin Peaks-like delectation. What Zero Dark Thirty does have is a narrative based on first-hand accounts, and it makes no explicit judgement about the content of those accounts. We simply get to see what (apparently) happened during the manhunt for ""UBJ"".<br/><br/>The film's lack of polemic is both a blessing a curse. It's a blessing because it's rare that a film dealing with such volatile subject matter is depicted procedurally. Usually when a narrative is made ostensibly apolitical it's as a result of an unconvincing moral rebalancing, where the filmmakers go to great lengths to present both sides fairly. But Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow's disinterest is also a curse because, in avoiding judgement, it surreptitiously falls firmly on the side of the CIA. It shows what it's allowed to show, but keeps their secrets (""undisclosed location"" and all that); and it portrays the operatives as the honourable front-liners getting their hands dirty (but not bloody), beyond moral reproach by virtue of hard graft. In Bigelow's world, it's the suits in Washington who have the blood in their hands - they're disconnected, as evidenced when torture-specialist Dan (Jason Clarke) returns to US headquarters from the field and loses his nerve, becoming a man of soft probabilities.<br/><br/>Clarke is solid but lost amidst superior talent, as he was in John Hillcoat's recent Lawless. Jessica Chastain delivers a nuanced performance. Driven professionals in films often come across as stolid, but Chastain is an actor of subtlety - even if Bigelow can't help lensing her like a wind-swept movie star in the Middle Eastern magic light. Jennifer Ehle uses her moon-faced radiance to good effect, filling her eager operative Jessica with youthful energy. There's a fair amount of distracting spot-the-cameo going on, particularly toward the end, when Joel Edgerton, Mark Duplass and James Gandolfini turn up.<br/><br/>Bigelow's directorial talent is never in doubt. The final sequence in particular is harrowingly tense, even though we know the outcome. And she generally gets the best out of actors. But make no mistake: this is a deeply patriotic film which is cheering for the home team, and it does so under the guise of objectivity, which makes it more manipulative than flag-waving fare like Last Ounce of Courage or Act of Valor, albeit much more skilfully made."

We're told time and time again throughout the movie how important the ""detainee program"" was to finding Bin Laden, we're shown how torture broke the captives, and then how prisoners eventually start spilling vital secrets because of ""biology"" (the inevitable conclusion to torture, the movie tells us, is the truth). This all is, by most clear thinking and civilized people, morally reprehensible and patently false.

Like myself, I am eager to explore the dangers and the accomplishments that the Americans risked to be involved in the most successful manhunt in the US history.<br/><br/>The film is not only great at dramatization purpose, it's also great journalism. The film starts with a concise dash of the 9/11 bombing which was lately rumored that Bin Laden was on play. Then two years later, a lone-wolf CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) is focusing solely on the al-Qaeda who has spent her entire career for it. She is assigned to work with Dan (Jason Clarke) on a black site in Pakistan to interrogate Anmar (Reda Kateb) to who has several links with Saudi Arabian bombings.<br/><br/>Chastain's uses her acute awareness of every facial expression and vocal intonation to humanize and add authenticity to a defiant, hard-nosed CIA analyst who tells the US Secretary of Defense, ""I'm the mot***r who found this place (Bin Laden's hideout).""<br/><br/>Maya is not a young woman you would care to have a dinner conversation with but she does have a no bullsh*t attitude needed to hunt down the elusive Bin Laden in a country she offhandedly describes as ""kinda all f***ed up"". <br/><br/>Over the course of the decade long manhunt, Maya transforms into a post 9/11 Captain Ahab of sorts. According to the movie's director, Maya is a fictional character partly based on a CIA operative that led the US Navy Seal team that killed Bin Laden.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is directed by Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow and written by Marc Boal, the same team behind 2008's The Hurt Locker. There has been controversy that the duo received ""top-level access to the most classified information in history"" as well as over the film's graphic use of torture from sexual humiliation, waterboarding, confinement in a tiny box to bloodied beatings.<br/><br/>Several inaccuracies in the portrayal of enhanced interrogation techniques have been cited by a CIA veteran and concerns have been raised that the movie promotes the use of torture. Bigelow has responded to these criticisms stating that depiction of torture is not an endorsement and reiterated Boal's comment that the movie is ""not a documentary"".<br/><br/>Screenwriter Marc Boal does a commendable job of condensing 10 years of intelligence gathering into a 2 ½ hour thriller. Though the first half of the movie does stretch a bit too long, the momentum immediately picks up once Maya locates the courier who leads the CIA to a compound in Pakistan.<br/><br/>It's fascinating how the CIA exhausted all possibilities in their attempt to determine the identity of an unknown third adult male living in the compound. The CIA considered obtaining DNA, such as from a toothbrush, but all the garbage was burnt. When their target stepped outside for fresh air, he was always hidden under the cover of thick leaves in the garden. They even started a vaccination program and sent a doctor to the house to get blood samples.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that this movie was in development for many years and that the ending was rewritten due to the successful mission last May that killed the al Qaeda leader. The last half hour of the movie, as the US Navy Seals assaulted the hideout in the dead of night, is an incredibly riveting and suspenseful movie experience even when we know how it ends. It's hard to imagine how else the movie could have concluded.<br/><br/>However, above all else, the only memorable moment of the film is the final payoff, no doubt about that. Many viewers will think of this as just a predictable notion of a movie where Bin Laden will die. It's hard to make a film about something that just happened which makes the resulting action inevitable, but the whole narrative is compelling and less jaded despite this criticism.<br/><br/>The death of Bin Laden brings a certain sense of closure to Americans as well as for Maya having spent a decade of her life hunting the world's most wanted terrorist. In the final scene, she boards an empty military plane and the pilot asks the lone passenger ""Where do you want to go?"". She takes a moment for reflection. As she is overcome with emotions and thoughts, tears start to run down her cheeks. So where do we go from here?"

","A very unrealistic and flat out boring depiction of this so called ""suspenseful search"".<br/><br/>The ONLY REASON I DID NOT WALK OUT due to how terrible the film was in general, was to see the final search and assassination of Osama Bin Laden- which turned out to be even less suspenseful than the rest of the film...<br/><br/>The situations were blatantly unrealistic, as well as the speech/communication between characters.<br/><br/>Characters were very bland and annoying.

","Zero Dark Thirty, an ambiguous title, never explained, is a metaphor for the movie itself.<br/><br/>Beyond the sheer heroism of the Seal team responsible for the ultimate assault, a product of superior men, hand-picked for a team which is called upon for only the most dangerous pursuits, everything else is as ambiguous as the title.<br/><br/>Never before has celluloid been as TWO dimensional as this movie was depicted. We learn nothing of the main characters, a full two-thirds of the movie setting up the eventual assault through the exploits of a heroine who speaks like Rambo, but looks like a ""Bond"" girl.<br/><br/>It is incredulous to believe that she was recruited out of high school. Is this where the modern CIA finds their best applicants. Did she excel in showing a propensity for killing, or as a dogged pursuer who was a human ""bloodhound""? Don't worry, it is never explained.<br/><br/>The ultimate capture seems more a product of dumb luck, than any organized plan. In fact, there are moments we are reminded that the actual hunt promised by Bush, was long forgotten, if it weren't for the actions of one woman who would not stop looking. It was almost as if she was autistic, an idiot savant with one skill, never giving up, but not for any reason that is explained. Jauvert in Les Miserables at least gave his reasons for his single-minded pursuit.<br/><br/>If anything, this movie is one of ironies. No one doubts the malevolence of a man who would plot to kill so many Americans, and did. Then again, this movie never went into the rich fodder of moral ambiguity in the manner that that the Bush Administration ginned up false evidence to turn a terrorist act, a nation-less act, into a war that also killed thousands of innocents in Iraq.<br/><br/>You learned nothing about Bin Laden, his motives, his rationale. You never saw the President, just the liaisons between the CIA, pictured as almost the Keystone cops, hardly inspiring.<br/><br/>The movie was a cardboard cutout, the scenes depicted in chronological order like a security tape with the running time at the bottom. It had no pacing, skipped all over the world and picked mere dates in time, when things happened, no more than a cinematic scrapbook called, ""How I killed Bin-Laden"".<br/><br/>What is lost so ironically in this movie, is the morality that made ""Lincoln"" sear the pain of moral ambiguity into anguish. Here, there are just ""drone-like"" CIA personnel, doing a job, never stopping to see the conflicts between the Geneva Convention, the War Crimes we punished after WWII, and their bullying tactics, ordained by men like Dick Cheyney, as heartless as the movie was.<br/><br/>Cheyney, Bush, Rumsfeld and the Neocons turned a national tragedy into a war for plunder while our Nation was mourning and confused. Movies like the ""Green Zone"" with Matt Damon have shown how false the intel was to support a war against a Country that administration wanted to wage so badly, only needing a ""Pearl Harbor-like excuse"" to exploit, and kill innocent civilians, and countless brave American soldiers for false WMD.<br/><br/>The real bad guy was killed off here. What did we learn? The CIA hires, and then ""retires"" it's no longer needed operatives. I'd say, just ask Hussein and Bin Laden, both on the CIA payroll, but they were retired by ""The Company"", permanently. Oh, the ironies....<br/><br/>Five stars as a great Mock documentary. No passion, no feelings, except a numb feeling leaving the theater."

","Went to the movie expecting to get the real scoop on the assassination of Bin Laden. Turned out it was really historical fiction based on a real event. It amazes me because the way it really happened was exciting enough that there was no need to embellish the story. The real kicker to me however, was inserting the torture scenes into the picture. It not only was not true, but it added nothing to the picture. Worse, when this film is shown in the Arab world, there will a lot of backlash against America and perhaps cost American lives. It is unbelievable that the writers and producers were not insensitive to this but one of the problems with Hollywood today is that anything goes regardless of the potential consequences. Being a combat veteran I was not impressed by the directing of this movie. I thought it was too faked up at times. They say that this movie wasn't meant to be a documentary and it certainly isn't. Too bad. And too bad it didn't lay off the torture scenes. We don't need that and neither did the movie."

","It's unfortunate that this film is made as purely a piece of entertainment. Typically, when you get a film of this nature, there is some sort of redemption or sacrifice that leaves the viewer with a sense of something. Private Ryan gave you a sense of the brutality one encounters in war a leaves you with an appreciation for life and sacrifice. Letters from Iwo Jima shows you that there are two sides to every story and allows you to understand that humanity the greatest victim of war. Full Metal Jacket and Jar Head both give you an understanding of the absurdity and personal costs of war. However, Zero Dark gives you none of this. You don't feel for any of the characters, you have no emotional connection to the film and you are left with ""Zero"" impression of the human or emotional costs associated with the sacrifices made in order to eventually catch/kill UBL.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of the scene in Gladiator when Russell Crowe walks into the arena and summarily kills all of his opponents and turns to the crowd and asks ""...is this not why you came, are you not entertained?"" No, this is not why I came and I was not entertained. There is a deeper costs to war and terrorism. There is more sacrifice made than this film makes you feel and I find it difficult to enjoy watching what can only be described as a dispassionate depiction of the singularity of retribution."

","For over eleven years now the War on Terror has dominated global foreign policy and has transformed America as we know it. One can hardly remember what life was like before 9/11 anymore. Since then we have been in a constant state of war and, in many ways, a constant state of fear. We have given up many of our own liberties, abandoned many of our stated principles and have sacrificed thousands of our own in an attempt to ""make us safe."" Where do we go from here?<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film to validate your own political position on America's recent international exploits, Zero Dark Thirty is not for you. If you want a film to take a moral stand on perhaps the most significant event(s) of your lifetime, you may want to look to a different source. Zero Dark Thirty transcends politics. It isn't a film that tells us we were right or we were wrong. It's a film that shows us what lengths we went through to kill the man responsible. Kathryn Bigelow's masterful follow up to the much lauded ""The Hurt Locker"" is no doubt the best film of the year, and I think it is an important movie in the history of American cinema. <br/><br/>The film is led by Jessica Chastain's astounding performance as Maya, a CIA operative who dedicates more then 10 years to finding Osama Bin Laden. The film begins with Dan (played by Jason Clarke) who is interrogating a detainee named Ammar (played by Reda Kateb) while Maya observes from the corner. Amid the torture, which is often hard to watch, Dan steps out of the room for a quick minute at which point Ammar begs Maya for help, for compassion. For a second it appears as though Maya may succumb and help the poor man, but instead she replies with stony passion, ""You can help yourself by being truthful."" Jessica Chastain's Maya goes against the conventional ""female"" role often given to women in Hollywood. These roles are generally broken down into two categories: sluts and mothers/wives, and usually involves plenty of tears and emotions. Very rarely do we see a bad-ass female character like Maya surface. At the same time Maya is neither the bad girl or the good girl of this story. She's not the evil stepmother, nor is she the fairy godmother. She is a shade of gray. <br/><br/>Perhaps the same can be said for the movie as a whole. It isn't really a heroic tale, nor one of failure and defeat. It is somewhere in between. The film takes us on a decade long journey in America's effort to bring justice to the worlds most hated and notorious terrorist. Throughout the struggles and hardships, we finally reach our goal. We find out where Osama Bin Laden is hiding, and after months of surveillance and planning, we go in for the kill. The last 30 minutes of the film are breathtaking, as the SEAL team boards helicopters and make the journey to the compound in Abatobad. Controversy has, of course, surrounded this film as many decry it's use of torture. These people believe that just because it doesn't take a firm stand against torture means that it must be pro-torture. Nothing could be further from the truth. First of all, we shouldn't need a movie to tell us that torture is wrong, we have a conscience for that. Secondly, the film is a story about the War on Terror, and to omit torture completely would not tell the full story. Whether torture directly led to finding Osama Bin Laden or not, torture was used in the hunt and it was important that we saw this in the film. <br/><br/>The real brilliance of Zero Dark Thirty comes with the allegory of Maya, however. In many ways Maya represents the country as a whole. Like Maya we invested a decade in this hunt for Bin Laden. Like Maya we sacrificed a lot for this war. For the last ten years we have put all of ourselves (as a nation) into this single goal. Now that Osama Bin Laden is dead, and the War in Afghanistan is coming to an end, where do we go from here? Maya is asked this same question at the end of Zero Dark Thirty. It is a question she cannot answer. Perhaps in her zealousness, and in our own zealousness to find and punish terrorists, we lost ourselves along the way. Now as this difficult time comes to a close, we should perhaps sit down and take a moment, as Maya does in the film, to think about what we have done over the last decade and reflect on what we lost, and more importantly reflect on where we go from here."
"bhulval","1","59","123","5 January 2013"," A Fantastic Fiction Based on a Historic Event
","IMHO this is the absolute worst of movies. They had the biggest story to tell since the death of Hitler and they made a day time soap out of it.<br/><br/>Here are my reasons: 1) Bad/overacting acting...by almost everyone except Jessica (Maya)<br/><br/>2) Who writes such script?...sounds like a school play. Bad dialog...""I am the mother*****r who found that house.""....was the rock bottom which to me sounded like a daytime soap.<br/><br/>3) Factual inaccuracies abound...starting from the premise that torture yielded actionable info leading to OBL. Also if you want to show enhanced interrogation show it properly. I remember torture scenes from Syriana that churned my stomach. EDIT If you look into the torture scenes one detainee is being made to stand forcibly by tying his arms to the ceiling....fine. But in almost every scene that was transitioning showing his arms bound to the ceiling...his arm kept moving too much upwards in one scene to very slack in another that it almost got quite distracting for me to focus on anything but the angle of the arms. This is clearly an amateur mistake. I am sure others will pick up similar other silly things. Perhaps the only reason I will re-watch the movie when it is available in DVD is to get kicks out of them.<br/><br/>4) A string of incidents we all read in the papers starting from the bombing of the Karachi Marriot, to double agent CIA suicide bombing, to unmasking of CIA operative in Pakistan after a shooting incident have been strung together as if it is a fact that they all had something to do with the hunt for OBL. Somehow the characters were forced to be a part of all the incidents.<br/><br/>5) There is a scene where the CIA deputy director gives everyone a dressing down on how incompetent a job they are doing in tracking OBL and thwarting terrorist acts...and he slams the table as he makes a point. EDIT This outburst was rendered somewhat comical due to the timing of the table slamming which if you watch closely is slightly off-timed and that millisecond difference made it look fake/comical emotional outburst.<br/><br/>6) The depiction of what was perhaps a nail-biting raid on OBL residence was slow, boring and lacked drama. Katherine Bigelow should learn from movies like Green Zone, Syriana, Argo, Rendition how to maintain taught tension (even though viewers know how it ends).<br/><br/>7) Also this happens right under the nose of Pak Agencies and nothing except a few passing reference to the ISI is made. What was the relationship between the CIA and ISI, the spy Vs spy angle the back channel communications or failure of back channels...so much have not been explored. (see movies like Fourth Protocol, Quiet American, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and you will get an idea what I mean).<br/><br/>This movie depicts arguably one of the biggest historical events since the death of Hitler and fails in historic proportions in doing so. Honestly this movie would have been so much better if it came out some 20-25 years later after some of the documents gets declassified and we know for real what actually happened rather than going on a fictional trip where perhaps the only real historically correct event shown was the death of OBL.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope someone with better skill, writing ability doing proper research does justice to this historical event and not just pander to the jingoist."

","This is largely a work of fiction, as are all movies that pretend to recount history. They may contain a few facts, but they invent more and leave out most, giving at best a distorted, partial view, and at worst outright propaganda.<br/><br/>However, this one is much worse than usual. It begins with an extended and entirely gratuitous sequence of torture scenes, and then pretends that torture produced actionable intelligence against Osama bin Laden. In real life torture is useful only for extracting false confessions and whatever ""information"" the torturers have settled on in advance.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the creators of the movie pretend that they are not defending torture, but simply presenting what happened for the viewer to evaluate. This is in the spirit of the Fox News propaganda slogan, ""We report, you decide"".<br/><br/>There are multiple versions of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. It is proposed that someone, possibly Barack Obama, possibly CIA torturers, possibly those who actually got the information, heroically defended the nation from the ultimate bad guys, or else someone, possibly Barack Obama, possibly CIA torturers, possibly CIA operatives posing as immunization workers in Pakistan to look for bin Laden, shredded the Constitution and the standing of the US around the world in assassinating Osama bin Laden, with little effect on actual Al Qaeda operations, and increased danger to US soldiers and to civilians everywhere. Or Obama did it all for political gain, because he hates America. None of these versions has much to do with the facts of the case. Certainly this movie is more part of the problem than part of the solution.<br/><br/>For example, CIA torture is one of Al Qaeda's strongest recruiting tools, and the CIA's fake immunization program in Pakistan has resulted in the murders of nine actual immunization workers in the tribal regions of Pakistan, and will result in hundreds of deaths of children and crippling of many more by polio. As I said, movies are necessarily fictional by omission, and this one is more fictional than most."

","She made a sub-standard movie and gained recognition that the movie did not deserve. How she manages to pull that off two movies in a row, I have no clue. No character development and plausible storytelling. Your main character who is supposed to be a 'killer from Washington' does nothing but standing around. She is a diligent, hard-working agent, but that is just like the next guy in the movie. Her female co-worker doesn't like her in one scene, and they are the best friend the next scene. Her male co-worker doesn't respect her one scene and become her faithful friend who will pull strings and travel to Saudi just to get her some phone number. I am not saying that can't happen over few years of working together, but the plausible storytelling would tell us how such a tight relationship came about. <br/><br/>Junior analyst like her meeting a senior officials and giving one-liner with profanity or writing how many days they are doing nothing on the windows may work nice to decorate your heroine as a bad-A right before she raids the villain's house and kill 200 men with her bare hands in 90s action flick. But if you wanna pass as an artistically well-made movie inspired by true events that shaped our way of life, you should take this movie making seriously and try to portray our men and women in clandestine service and their working environment in a bit more accurate manner. Just as people served in a military were disappointed in the implausibility of movie ""The Hurt Locker"", this movie passes as an average drama mixed with a bit of an action and a boredom.

In Zero Dark Thirty it was like it was based on a ""chick flick gone kill bill with out action."" ""Maya"" who is formerly known as Jessica Chastain told C.I.A. director ""I'm the mother****** who found that place."" ""LOL"" all i got to say to that, yes she's driven and she was recruited at a young age ""wtf"" however, the audacity the director had to focus the entire attention on her from beginning to end. I found that to be preposterous. The trailer was almost compelling especially when Bin Laden got caught, the viewers of America and the entire world will want a insight of how it occurred but what we were left with was Jessica. The rating of 7.5/10 is absurd ""literally"". The acting was mediocre, the special effects were not up to par as hurt locker. I do not dislike, i hate when i director can make a almost immaculate movie such as hurt locker and just breeze through their second just for financial spectrum. I would be definitely surprised if it won any awards such as golden globe or an Oscar.

","Well, this was certainly an improvement over the overrated predecessor / prequel. For the first hour, watching the film was the equivalent of enduring the torture shown in the film, much worse... In fact, I have never seen so many people get up and go to the bathroom or get some much needed caffeine. Mercifully, this very long film has a very good second act, but it doesn't redeem the rest of this film.<br/><br/>There is attention to detail but very little suspense/dramatic flair for the first two thirds of the film, as we just witness plenty of conversations, meetings, kind of see the process that leads to the ultimate find of the century. Unfortunately, unlike the much better ""Argo"", it is all shown with no regard to pacing. Much of the acting here consists of frowns, a couple of frustrated stares and the inclusion of a couple of expletives to spice up the dialogue. Personally, I don't know how these type of words make anyone look either tough or intelligent. Some people have been impressed by the type of acting we see here, but acting is supposed to provoke some type of feedback from the audience other than drowsiness. Mercifully, the director places a couple of suicide attacks when we are about to collapse from exhaustion, and interesting enough, we don't really care what happens to the people in those scenes.<br/><br/>Unlike, Affleck's film, we never really get to understand the background of the people involved, particularly the film's protagonist. It's almost like if we are supposed to develop empathy, but other than some pouting and some cutesy scrawling on a piece of glass, we don't seem much emotional range here. Yes, there's a sole tear at the end, and an honest exchange between Maya and her boss when he demands to know what else she has done before, and the answer is as puzzling to him as it is to the audience.<br/><br/>We do get to visit more exotic locales, rarely get to know who inhabits these regions. They're nothing else but pieces of the art decoration in the movie. To be fair, many of the American agents are nothing but stereotypes. I read somewhere that this heroine and some of the colleagues where compared to the people of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", and that the unraveling of the events here is similar to ""All The President's Men"" drama, and the truth is that people who made that evaluation should go back and study Pakula's masterpiece, a film that gave us personal involvement, intrigue, and exposed the audience to all the participants' nature. We felt the fear of those who dared to speak. We understood the way deep throat made his approaches, and the difficulties encountered by the reporters. Nothing like that occurs here. We might as well be viewing a bad travelogue where the camera zooms in and out of the different locations, but we don't even talk to the locals.<br/><br/>However, the whole thing is not lost because when the much, much, much awaited mission finally arrives, we are treated to very good scenes, and things finally pick up. From the moment we see the specially designed aircraft to the scene when the final identification is made, we are treated to almost a completely different film. There is tension, suspense, some very effective editing, and events hit with the right impact, even the technical aspects of the film are renewed with much more dynamic energy. It is dark, and we feel the claustrophobia of the night vision goggles. We finally dread and welcome the force of the explosives. We have human faces and emotions on the faces of both parties. There is a very touching scene involving a soldier and a child. And, we have the imminent race against the clock, as the enemy forces are about to arrive. Now the explosions make sense, and we only wished the rest of the film matched this.<br/><br/>Overall, character development is very poor, and the story suffers from endless repetition. It is the reenactment of one very important historical event, but it has not been given the proper treatment. Thankfully, other Hollywood talent has put together projects that deal with similar themes, offer us more information and enough historical exposure to what leads to actual events. I was one of many who got up and cheered when the plane flew out of the danger zone in that other film; this time I was just cheering because the ordeal was finally over and I could run out of the theater."

","Like many other people who gave this movie a bad review, we expected much more. I have not found a bad review that I did not agree with. Just read them all, lump them together and you have my opinion of this Oscar nominated overly long load of crap. Bad editing. Bad acting. The mumbling dialogue at the beginning should have given me the clue that this was going to be bad from the start. Spoiler: I found it insulting to my intelligence in the scene when the soldiers put their fingers to their lips and just say ""Shush"" to the children who have just witnessed their parents being shot to death. I guess they want us to think that Moslems treat the death of their parents much as the equivalent of one of their favorite toys being broken. My wife called it ""Violence Porn"". I don't find the depiction of violence for no good reason exciting and worthy of praise. I am aware that there are many others who do. Maybe that is where the good reviews come from?"

That a friend of hers died on 9/11 or at least something. That would have at least explained her obsession.<br/><br/>And in this movie you practically have nothing to laugh (ZERO entertainment). Well, I laughed one time, but I doubt it was intended. I laughed when she said: ""Im the motherfu..er who found this place"".

"athomed","3","40","83","10 January 2013"," The source material may lend itself to film, just not this one
","I should speak of the good things first. How many can there be if I only give this film a 3 out of 10? Not that many. I do think that Jessica Chastain (a new name to me) and Jason Clarke gave fine performances. Kathryn Bigelow's direction was only serviceable. I must confess to not being a fan of her past work.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but it's time to get into the elements I disliked in the film already. Bigelow herself has stated that she saw this film as telling the story of the hunt for bin Laden, not fictionalizing nor judging, but leaving that to the audience. Such aspirations for a film about something still very personal and visceral to most Americans are hard to accomplish. More importantly, this comes with a certain responsibility. Such responsibility was not met.<br/><br/>I find both halves of the film difficult to watch for different reasons. The first half because of its depiction of torture by CIA agents on the behalf of our country. The second half because it can get kind of boring. But let me stick to the first half. One positive thing I can say about the torture scenes is that no one, or at least, no one with an open, sensible mind can say that ""enhanced interrogation"" is anything other than torture after watching this film. Arguments to the contrary always remind me of Nixon's response during one of those iconic David Frost interviews. ""Well when the President does it, that means that it is not illegal."" We've prosecuted and convicted people who employed water boarding on our own soldiers. To make the argument that water boarding is nothing more than ""enhanced interrogation"" and entirely legal is really to make the point, ""Well when America does it, that means that it is not illegal."" The film does more than trip over its own feet when it suggests that a detainee gave up information upon the threat of more torture. No such occurrence took place. It's a fiction of torture's defenders and it's a fatal sin that the film would follow that direction. Another suggestion of the film, I'm sure at the benefit of making it more interesting, is that there were greater ties between the Camp Chapman attack and the hunt for bin Laden. This is another creation. This film fails to meet the expectations placed on it by Bigelow.<br/><br/>I do think that Bigelow did a responsible job with the actual raid. It's quite accurate to most of the accounts an ordinary citizen like myself can get their hands on. However I will admit my frame of reference isn't as an ordinary citizen. As a former Ranger, I've had experience with high value targets. I believe the film was able to capture a piece of what an actual mission can feel like. I find this film to be a better representation of SEAL Team 6 than the recent HBO film Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama bin Laden. That's the only takeaway for me."
"seanebuckley","6","26","51","11 January 2013"," Bigelow's Masterpiece?
","Zero Dark Thrity is the new movie from Hurt Locker director Kathryn Bigelow who has enjoyed a rich and varied career to date which will surely be swamped under the weight of opinion lumped on this picture. She is a highly adept film-maker and the aforementioned Hurt Locker might just be the finest example of a war movie since Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. Zero Dark Thirty is a different beast altogether. It is a fact-based account of the events leading up to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Its a touchy subject which is largely handled with great care and aplomb by the cast and film-makers. Thats not to say the movie is perfect, its actually far from it.<br/><br/>The movie is talky without being overly analytical or detailed. I learned nothing from the 157 minute runtime that i couldn't find out in 20 minutes on the web, but maybe that's the point. The word chronicle is often bounded around when talking about Zero Dark Thirty. Chronicle is defined as 'A factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence' and thats precisely what the film is and not a touch more. There is no meat offered to the viewer by way of engaging character or story development, indeed, the film is mostly an anti-cinematic experience aside from the last 20 or so minutes. <br/><br/>An interesting counter point is the popular 'Homeland' show which also charts a driven female CIA agent as she tracks a known and dangerous terrorist. Its true that both works have completely different end-games but it is interesting to note just how far removed the two are. Homeland is purely for entertainment purposes and Zero Dark Thirty strives to be factual and relevant. I would argue that Zero Dark Thirty could have never won over every critic and begs the question, can you really expect to make a piece of solid entertainment about tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden? The answer is no. They would have been surely lambasted for glorifying a potentially inflammatory event (please see Oliver Stone's dreadful 'World Trade Center'). Therefore, we are left with this glossy, extremely well made, pseudo-documentary which is never particularly involving or like-able. <br/><br/>Also with all due respect, Chastain can count herself very lucky to have just been nominated for best actress. She was surely a shoe-in for the Oscar nod for just turning up here as the film lends itself, due to its 'factual' nature, to receiving the adoration of the academy. Her performance, much like the film, barely exists but to prop up and relay the events. She cries when people die and she is cast iron in the face of a male dominated, scary world but she is barely a character in her own right. People aren't talking about Maya's dominance of the screen, they are talking about the half-truisms of the events themselves. I'm not asking for any meaningful superfluous back story or exposition but i wanted to see her out of the situation, if just for a few minutes. As an audience we need to know the characters aside from them telling us what is going to happen in the movie. Don't get me wrong, Chastain does nothing wrong here, its more a problem with the writing or maybe just with the style of movie they were trying to make here that breaks her for me. Another interesting counter-point is Ben Affleck's excellent Argo. Here we have a movie based on some pretty harrowing true events but its handled with a cinematic eye. Affleck takes some liberties with the truth in Argo but what he does make is a piece of cinema that excites the audience, involves you in the picture and the characters completely and most importantly stays with you after the fact. I felt nothing at Zero Dark Thirty's conclusion, even when watching Chastain cry, i didn't appreciate the action or care. I didn't feel anything for her character, i knew her about as well as i did Osama Bin Laden (movie equivalent of course).<br/><br/>I think my main problem was with the point of the whole exercise. Its a film that sits on the fence, never glorifies or revels nor does it offer any comment or insight. So what then was the point? Do we really live in a world where is it necessary to make a film about every important event in history? How is this any different to watching a fluffy news story? Do we really need attractive people on the silver screen for people to give a sh*t about whats going on in the world? I hope not.<br/><br/>All of that being said, Zero Dark Thirty is never an exercise in patience, it rumbles along at a steady pace and if all your looking for is a chronicle of events post 9/11 you'll find a lot to be interested in. I just cant shake the question, what was the point?"

","Given the various plaudits bestowed on this film around about it's release I was expecting a lot more.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise to me was Jessica Chastain's performance and character. She was guilty at times severe over-acting; e.g. frantic am-dram gurning, snarling, and shaking to telegraph ""I AM ANGRY NOW"" - in a way that felt quite unnatural.<br/><br/>For a film which sets itself out to be unflinchingly serious, the dialogue was sometimes quite corny. For example, the exchange between Chastain and James Gandolfini; something along the lines of:<br/><br/>""Who's she?""
""I'm the m*therf*cker who found the place.""
""Hey I like the cut of your gib - let's hear what the chick has to say"" (groan)<br/><br/>I found it difficult to get emotionally involved in the film, since frankly none of the characters are likeable, sympathetic or particularly interesting. I couldn't care less about any of them.<br/><br/>The end of the film with the Navy SEALs is by far the strongest part."

","I won't address the many aesthetic flaws in this film amply recounted in the many 1-star reviews below, but will focus on the content over the form, and how it made me sick:<br/><br/>I'm sure Ms. Bigelow thought she was making a heroic film about American spooks and servicemen seeking justice for 9/11, but it's a symptom of American ""exceptionalism"" and lack of self-consciousness that the ""heroes"" of this saga were distinctly unsympathetic and their methods repulsive -- as another reviewer and a friend of mine stated, they were actually cheering for al-Qaeda by mid way through film.<br/><br/>The first third virtually revels in the torture scenes with not a shred of self doubt or moral scruple, and later we have a CIA agent whining about ""losing the detainee program"" -- the script might as well have been penned at Langley by CIA hacks as justification for their crimes. As we now know from the more or less redacted Senate hearings into this despicable episode, virtually no actionable intelligence was obtained from all the water boarding and other repulsive abuses at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and the many black sites. But according to Zero Dark Thirty, waterboarding was crucial to our never-ending counterterrorism campaign.<br/><br/>The Abbottabab raid depicts innocent women and men being mowed down by the SEALs, and the denouement is the implausibly hyperbolic lead character finally peering into a body bag to view her trophy -- I was left with a feeling of disgust. This was truly an UGLY film, it was definitely propagandistic, and this is the face America now proudly and shamelessly shows to the world, garlanded with a bevy of award nominations.<br/><br/>For the naive simpletons out there (about 60-70% of the American populace), even renowned journalist Seymour Hersh believes the official account of the bin Laden raid was a complete fiction. They dumped the body in the ocean and we can't even see the photos of bin Laden's corpse because it would be too offensive to Muslims? If you believe that, you're already a mindless drone living in Orwell's dystopic USA. Hollywood has merged with Washington, and this film was a bad pseudo-documentary about a political fiction hatched to continue fueling the bogus ""War on Terror"" that was spawned by another complete fiction -- 9/11 itself."

What a disappointment.<br/><br/>The movie was extremely slow and uninteresting. Don't get me wrong - I didn't come into this expecting full blown action film but at least an interesting plot. <br/><br/>First, I couldn't understand what the characters are saying the majority of the times because they mumble and use specialty words on top of unfamiliar foreign names which subtitles would've been greatly helpful. Second, there was a lack of character development that we simply cannot relate or even sympathize with. Honestly, I find the main focused character, Maya, to be highly unlikable and annoying. Yes she has determination and this is what she's worked on her entire life; but she lacks emotions and when she does show emotions, she borderlines psychopathic b*tch.<br/><br/>Many people commented on the torture scenes but that didn't bother me - what bothered me was how this film WAS torture.<br/><br/>The entire direction and story line of the movie was so dull that I was baffled at the 95 it had scored on Metacritic.

Silly characters, having silly conversations about unrelated topics, most of them women for some reason. Jessica Chastain, who is grossly miscast here, is hunting Bin Laden with a passion, for no apparent reason however. She behaves as if she has been personally gang raped by AL Queada, the way she obssesses over his capture. The final scenes, which should have been intense and thrilling, came across as a bad ""Rambo"" film, one where we care little about the end result. The way that the US troops busted into that compound and just began shooting everyone in sight, was disgraceful, and does nothing to change the negative opinion that much of the World has of America. I doubt that this film would have gotten much attention at all, if director Kathryn Bigelow hadn't won her Oscar, and if the subject matter was not so volatile.

","After the success of her little Iraq war drama, the overrated and sleep-inducing Oscar winner 'The Hurt Locker', auteur Kathryn Bigelow hit the jackpot. Tired of her old silly movies like 'Point Break' or 'Blue Steel', she decided to get serious. <br/><br/>And what a better why to do so than tackle a hot, controversial event that has been debated in this last decade: the war on terror?<br/><br/>0030 gives us another sleep-inducing view on the hunt for bin Laden. We follow the CIA agent Maya, who pursuits the terrorist by interrogating prisoners linked to the terrorist groups. As everybody who saw the news in 2011 knows, the hunt ends up successful.<br/><br/>Bigelow is terrible in action scenes, and manages to screw up the only 'good' part of the film. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain, who plays Maya, has been praised to heaven and back for her performance; I can't understand why. She is monotonous and tired looking which, while that's the point in certain moments, is rather strange in others; moreover, she is robotic in her line delivery (though, in her defense, most of her lines seem made for a robot anyway). Still, she is alright considering the character she plays: an extremely unlikable character who, in Bigelow's attempt to represent as 'broken' in a show of the effects of emotional turmoil caused by the hunt, ends up as little more than a brooding, impulsive bitch. Despite being described as a 'killer' (comment which is not elaborated upon) near the beginning of the film. she acts on her hunch in many moments, once even saying to a superior (after he points out she doesn't have proof to support her point) that he doesn't know Pakistan or Al-Qaeda like her, so he can't talk back. It baffles me how they would let someone like this kept in charge of the hunt, and even worse: follow her advice! <br/><br/>The hunt was based on a obsessive idiot's guess!<br/><br/>The other characters are not very far behind. The development only makes them more and more unlikable, to the point that it is mostly impossible to connect emotionally with most of them. The dialogue is horrifying: when not overly technical, it is done in such a bad way or with such a bad delivery it is cringe-worthy. And then there's the director choosing silent shots at the wrong times, at times where a dialogue would really contribute to an emotional moment or at least to character development.<br/><br/>It's an extremely boring movie, with unlikable characters, weak dialogue and badly shot action. The last 30 minutes or so are alright, despite being badly shot; but then, you have to survive the first 2 hours, which is not worth it.<br/><br/>The torture scenes, which have caused a lot of controversy, are not bad. They aren't as hardcore as one would image (the ones from 'Unthinkable' were stronger, for example), but I give her props for not shying away from showing them; I expect a lot of people would have left them implied only."

This ham-fisted propaganda piece was so shallow and obviously manipulative it often had me laughing out loud. One comedic moment: head torturer feeds ice cream to caged monkeys, then later when he learns they are eliminated for no reason, we see his anguish. See, torturers do have feelings  for monkeys.<br/><br/>The torture scenes, taking up most of the first half of the movie, are not just propaganda, but slow the action down and provide little useful narrative. Most of these scenes could have and should have been cut, especially when the internee is led around naked on a dog collar. Really? Come off it, Bigelow. This dramatization of the Abu Ghraib photos that so appalled the world is an offensive insult to the audience's intelligence. The message is that, no, despite the obvious evidence, Abu Ghraib guards weren't half-wit rednecks denigrating human life for their own sick amusement and Facebook fun, but serious intelligence agents using scientific dog collar interrogation techniques to protect the free world. Pathetic.<br/><br/>By the time the story finally picks up the pace and becomes engaging, half the movie has gone. There is even enough tension to overlook the slightly ludicrous central characterization and storyline – one woman fights not only terrorists but her table-thumping, swearing, macho bosses to find bin Laden when everyone else has given up. Her mother f**ker outburst, mixing it with the boys, is another unintentionally hilarious scene.<br/><br/>But after Zero Dark Thirty finally promises to become a half-decent thriller, we have to sit through a tedious drawn-out finale shot in night vision inside the Bin Laden compound. It looks like the US military wrote this part of the script, and demanded nothing could be cut. It was visually difficult to follow, needlessly long and left questions unanswered, like how did they know with certainty it was Bin Laden.<br/><br/>And why didn't we see Bin Laden's body dumped in the sea? Could it be they're planning a sequel. Bin Laden lives and is being tortured in Gitmo! If so, let's hope Katherine Bigelow doesn't direct it, or any more movies. She is to the war on terror, what Leni Riefenstahl was to Hitler's Germany."

","I had fairly average expectations for this film. I'm a fan of The Hurt Locker and assumed that I would at least like ZDT or at the very least appreciate it cinematically. Wow...I was wrong.<br/><br/>Bigelow's constant use of shaky, hand-held, tight shots and quick cuts doesn't allow the viewer to get a sense of the scenes at all. For the most part, we got to see the bland, over-made-up face of the lead actress as she flatly jumps from place to place eating stuff along the way. I felt like I was in a moving car trying to watch a movie from the window as we were traveling at 65 mph. I didn't care. I couldn't care. There wasn't enough time to absorb the content, and there was nothing about the characters (except for perhaps the SEALs) that made me feel any kind of empathy or sympathy for them.<br/><br/>The dialogue, especially in the beginning, was almost inaudible, and perhaps that helped the film because overall, the dialogue was dreadful - predictable, clichéd and flat-out silly in some parts.<br/><br/>I hope Bigelow uses a tripod for her next film and finds a script with some compelling characters and dialogue. I was extremely disappointed and had to fight my urge to leave the theater."

","One of the worst pieces of propaganda I have ever seen. Torture does not work and lowers the US (and by association, my country, Canada) to the level of the Taliban. It's not news that the so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" employed by the US did not and do not work. We knew this before 9/11 and that is why the US didn't employ torture. The US Senate report confirms this past week that the CIA lied about torture and what was gleaned from detainees. We know now, as a matter of record, that torture did not lead to Bin Laden. We also know that whatever info they did get on Bin Laden was obtained before torture was employed. We also know that when field operatives in the CIA said a detainee had no more to give, Langley told them to keep torturing them. This movie should be boycotted. As a movie, this film was long and painfully boring. It felt fictitious, but not in any fun drama or action movie kind of way. I had to watch it in three different sitting as the bile that I would taste in my mouth from watching this propaganda piece was almost too much to stomach."
"drakula2005","9","34","74","12 January 2013"," Jessica Chastain in Command ! ! !
","Do not get me wrong, the movie is not that good when you get the lovely, energetic, fascinating and brutally honest portrayal of Chastain's CIA agent Maya out of the picture.It would've still be solid, controversial and updated with events, but the X-particle would have been missing.That's what the actress brought to the movie.<br/><br/>The cast is fine-a solid, convincing ensemble, that did their respective jobs very well.I can see why people like Mark Strong and James Gandolfini got some roles in the movie.It's always good to work with a so-called red-hot director at the helm of her so-called favourite turf- war movies.Their cameos, especially Gandolfini's (because Mark Strong was under the spotlights for a little longer) made a refreshing break from the main tone of the movie midway through it, at the moment we needed something different the most.Overall, the cast was an improvement over Bigelow's last effort in the genre.<br/><br/>With ""The Locker"" i wasn't impressed at all, i was actually on the other end of emotions-i did not understand what all the people saw in it.Overlong and flat, you' be left wondering why so many strange sequences occurred in the movie.And if you are still awake, that is.But Bigelow has improved in those few years.She has a better eye for the cinematic, her cast is stronger, she changes paste effortlessly and now has a sense of jumping in one scene after another almost flawlessly.Those things, in my humble opinion, were not that visible in ""The Locker"" as mostly critics screamed they were.But the movie ended being the biggest Oscar contender and winner without being the best movie that same year, so what do i know.The only department ""The Locker"" still overshadows ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the tension.No that it wasn't evident here, but more than enough was provided by Bigelow in her last effort.Well, frankly, the nature of the movie was different and couldn't have hurt it.<br/><br/>So, with all that being said, with the beautiful performance by Chastain, who is becoming a real power on the horizon with every single movie she takes, with a haunting performance from Reda Kateb's Ammar in the beginning, where one might feel heartbroken for the guy, what's the problem with the movie, You might ask.<br/><br/>The script!This thing that has been nominated out of sheer patriotism is worth nothing.Some of the lines Boal wrote were sheer ridiculousness at it's finest.No one screams words like ""motherfucker"" in the CIA director's face at a high-level terrorist-related meeting, even if there is no profane context hidden behind it and even if the CIA boss's role has been handled by the almighty Tony Soprano.Jessica Chastain was actually so good and mesmerizing throughout the course of the movie, that she handled this particular scene with calm and confidence.She was the one screaming it, if it is not yet crystal-clear.And she's been forgiven, she's not to blame at all.Continuing with Boal's outrageous screen writing we find ourselves in the middle of a mission, where the SEALs (who behaved like total children throughout their limited number of scenes, shame on you, Edgerton, i'm looking at you, because one would expect this from Chris Pratt) enter a suspect's house and begin to quietly repeat every single inhabitant's name until, like rabbits, they all come out and they all get shot.A totally unneeded and distracting scene, which took off a lot from the sheer brilliancy and tension off the last sequence of the movie.And even if there were some documented evidence speaking that it was all true, i don't believe that a clever off-the-grid person will be so stupid to get out and check who is calling him by name in the middle of a SEALs mission in his home.I repeat, even if it were true, for the sake of the film itself, leave it out, do not go there!!That's why i think the final act was less suspenseful than Bigelow's last warfare effort.Besides the fact we all now how it ends, of course.And, once again, thank God Jessica Chastain is around to save the day and bring some humanity and emotion to the movie.:But what the heck, let's give a 100/100 to the movie, because we love America"".That's the reception right now, as it was with ""Argo""...and once again, thank the cinematic Gods for Jessica Chastain's true, emotional, fascinating, electrifying performance!!<br/><br/>At the very end she showed that even in a job well done and even in the years spend doing nothing but this particular job, there is no consolation, there are no smiles, nor happiness.Only a 12-years long hole of emptiness that's being left there.Like a homecoming soldier, who still lives with his brothers in arms, Jessica Chastain's Maya-has a tough way ahead of her.A way filled with new strives and challenges, dreams even.But a long and tough way back to ordinary life, life as it was.This sense of nostalgia is brought in absolutely uncompromising way to the screen by Chastain.<br/><br/>The movie itself would have been a 6/10 without Chastain to say the least, with Boal it falls even steeper, but this new actress (by Hollywood laws that is), makes this whole ride unforgettable in the coming awards-season.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up for a lovely Chastain and hopefully an Oscar this time around!!<br/><br/>My rate:9/10"

Further, the movie does not show the corpse of Osama being dumped into the sea.

","I found this movie painfully boring. I specifically wanted to see the raid scene, so I made sure I was awake for those thirty minutes, but that was still boring. I understand that the raid happened at night (hence the name of the movie), however, a director isn't supposed to have shots that are almost pitch black. So the final thirty minutes is a combination of night-vision shots, and no-vision shots. The two hours before that is interrogation, or looking at films. And some random conversations between characters that have a forced interaction with each other.<br/><br/>Chastain is a horrible actor. Bigelow is a worse director. Neither of them should be nominated for anything, but they will because they are women, and because of the subject matter. I do not feel that all of the events in the movie are properly tied together, and it simply drags along in places. The best actor in the movie was Jason Clark. Everyone else was fairly wooden. Chris Pratt is hard to shake from his Parks & Rec role, so I am not sure that I buy him as a DEVGRU team leader. At all. However, it doesn't really matter as the SEALs have a fairly minor role in the movie. You see them get the op, and you see some first-person shots from them in night-vision during the assault. Which, as I said, is painfully anti-climactic.<br/><br/>Now, some of the reviews here are all caught up in the use of torture or ""coercive interrogation"". I, for one, have no problem with it whatsoever. I remember the way that I felt on September 11, 2001, and if an individual had anything to do with that in any way, shape, or form, then water boarding would be the least of his worries from me. So, I don't find that this takes away from the movie. My problems with it lie elsewhere.<br/><br/>I was not entertained by this movie, and I never plan on seeing it again. I sat for 2 hours, waiting to see the part of the movie that sounded the most interesting, and that was like watching paint dry. Bigelow missed harder here than she did with Hurt Locker (which, I thought was misguided garbage through and through. ... War is a drug? Oh please. Validate that statement please. ... That's what I thought.) and there is nothing redeeming about this film. It is a waste of time, and sure to cause your legs and/or lower back to cramp."

"dfranzen70","6","21","44","20 January 2013"," The bin Laden Identity
","Zero Dark Thirty will appeal to fans of action movies, and the fact that it is based on true events should complement that appeal. It's an odd- duck movie in that the ending is never in doubt; only the path to the goal. The hunt for the most notorious terrorist of them all, Osama bin Laden, occurs over a ten-year period from the point of view of the Americans and, chiefly, the CIA operative running the operation. It is very compelling, riveting stuff. However, I don't feel that it is a great film; despite a remarkable performance by Jessica Chastain and solid camera work, the movie comes off at its worst as over-the-top jingoism masquerading as patriotism, making America look great to those who wave their arms at how Number One the good ol' USA is, the best of the best, and making America look terrible, perhaps, to those who are not American.<br/><br/>The movie is unflinching in its depiction of violent methods, but we should get one thing clear right away: it's a work of fiction based on true events. Just because something occurs in this film does not mean it happened in real life.<br/><br/>The film is difficult to watch for a couple of main reasons. For one, there is audio of phone calls from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and those alone may raise your hackles. Then there is the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, and knowing that this sort of thing did go on after 2001 makes for some harrowing viewing. <br/><br/>Here's an interesting comparison for you. Adolph Hitler was a genocidal maniac. When the war was closing in on him, he took his own life, thus depriving his enemies the same satisfaction. Bin Laden, however, did not; he continued to operate remotely, unseen except by the occasional video to al-Jazeera. His mere presence kept people angry, demanding action. Whereas Hitler's death definitively ended WW II, bin Laden's survival began a new one. What if bin Laden, who had been cooped up in the caves in Tora Bora, had killed himself? No war, perhaps, and no real satisfaction on the part of America and its comrades.<br/><br/>Maya (Chastain) is a neophyte operative when she begins the search for bin Laden. She needs to fight bureaucracy and lack of good leads; she travels from Langley (CIA headquarters) to Yemen to Pakistan to Afghanistan and on and on, surviving only on her zeal to capture the fugitive. We're never really told why this all means so much to her, after a decade of work. Is it personal, or is just for the sake of country? Somehow, if it is the latter, one gets the feeling that move has been played out in so many other movies - we must get our man. But perhaps her motivation is immaterial. Since we know so little about our main character - just that she is a loner with apparently no friends or family - the main thread is simply Finding bin Laden. Simple and to the point.<br/><br/>So. If we remove the relative recency of 9/11/2001 from the equation, this is simply another action movie. Lots of explosions, Navy SEALS, blood and guts, political intrigue, and so on. But we can't remove that from the equation, can we? Many of us were alive and kicking in 2001 and remember this all too well, so it's a little different from watching an old Hollywood movie about the Second World War.<br/><br/>It is implied, very subtly, that information gleaned from detainees leads, obliquely, to the capture of bin Laden, but this was never the case. People say all kinds of crazy things under extreme duress. Again, I stress that this is fictitious based on true events; liberties have understandably been taken with plot elements.<br/><br/>As I was leaving the theater, I had some questions to face: Did I see what I expected? Well, I knew the ending, so yes, I suppose I did. But was it truly a great movie? I don't think so, no. I think it glorified - to the consternation of the US government itself - many aspects of our operations overseas that we'd rather not have glorified. The movie made us look great to the win-at-all-costs populace and look worse in the eyes of the international community. And, to be clear, this isn't a political statement, this review: President Bush is hardly mentioned, and when President Obama is shown on screen, he's declaring that America does not torture - while a room of CIA operatives who do just that watch, idly.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a good film. Kathryn Bigelow's earlier The Hurt Locker was much more entertaining and better crafted; this one is not as well directed, as it feels like a cookie-cutter action/political thriller with a dash of topicality thrown in for spice."

","CONS: As other reviewers have already noted the script is on the weak side, the acting is so-so, and the Hollywood take on what would have been a great story (if told accurately) - is a waste. The pacing suffers as well with most of the movie feeling very slow.<br/><br/>I get the feeling the story was warped to make a strong female lead seem to single-handedly drive the takedown of Bin Laden. However I remember numerous reports which said the intel and the compound were known and observed during the Bush presidency...while the movie implies it was discovered just before the raid occurs. This, and the strong single woman stereotype driving the show while nearly averting assassination and never wavering from her convictions (which happen to be 100% correct) - wears a bit thin.<br/><br/>PROS: The production elements are excellent and it feels like a well polished bit of cinema. The locations, the clothing, the sound and visual effects - all seem well selected.<br/><br/>The compound raid is far and away the most interesting part of the movie. If you wondered what it might have looked like, Hollywood's take here seems fairly accurate - based on the information that has been leaked to the public of course.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film, it's just too slow and historically inaccurate. If you want to change history fine, just make sure the end result is a more exciting or interesting movie! However, for a visual of the compound raid alone you may want to watch it. Just save yourself the trouble and skip to the 2 hour and 4 minute mark as the raid will be just beginning in earnest."

Thus, the film is at best propaganda and possibly pure falsehood - certainly not art. If he existed as a spokesperson, he is easily replaced. If he was an actual person wielding power, there is an endless line of thugs to replace him. My guess is that he was a fictional character played by an actor.

Its a shame this film was so bad, as i expected a lot more from the director of one of my favorite movies (The Hurt Locker). Overall, not one I would watch again. And 157 minutes? Seriously? It could have been done in 30. Might have enjoyed it more if it was."

","So we'll get this out of the way now so we don't have any miscommunication. If you still firmly believe that 9/11 was 100% the work of the US government, as in they set charges in the towers, they killed everyone on United 93, then don't watch this film because this is not for you. <br/><br/>Now to the film. Much like The Hurt Locker, it was an excellent film with great acting writing and directing. But before we go into the film and it's positives and negatives (and it's lacking of them), let's close our eyes and take a ride down memory lane (Please picture this as rough as it was). 11 years ago, our nation was changed forever by deliberate and disgusting attacks that not only put an unfair stereotypes to Muslim's everywhere, but it also killed about 3,000 people around the time a normal person becomes productive at work (10:28 A.M. to be exact). People jumped to their deaths, people lost family, friends and people were taken from this world way to soon. Now open your eyes and watch the film knowing that you know the ending without even seeing the film (if you don't you're an idiot). <br/><br/>Ms. Bigelow does a great job introducing us into the film without any visuals and it allowed you vision the things yourself. Something anyone could consider chilling, which shows her skill as a director to bring the audience in. Then the hunt begins, as the film progresses through our hunt. She reminds us on why America keep hunting and the attacks in between 9/11 and the day of justice. Along with that, she, with the help of a solid script by Mark Boal, showed the politics and the pain that was getting the plans in motion. With that we get to know the people who helped make it happen. We meet Maya, who is played wonderfully by Jessica Chasatain, who if in another world, would be a great as a homicide detective. We see her changed as time progressed. Along with her is great performances by a solid supporting cast. Jason Clarke plays a great CIA agent who has his fair share of great moments as he mentors her in the ways of hunting terrorists in the good ways and the bad. Jennifer Ehle does a great job as her closest friend in the agency. Plus with good brief performances by Tony Soprano, Michael from Lost, Mark Strong, Edgar Ramirez and even Mark Duplass from FX's The League. Not a lot was wrong with it, even the interrogation techniques and the politics that made you either uncomfortable or angry or both. But what makes this film great isn't the story itself, but the feeling of it.<br/><br/>Bigelow doesn't make this film anything more then what it its, a honest portrayal of history. It isn't a right wing rah rah piece of American propaganda nor is it a left wing Michael Moore selfish anti-government video that was made just to make money (even though it was made for that reason, anyway). She wants us to feel what those people felt and it worked like a charm. You couldn't feel happy, you couldn't feel sad, which brings up the final part of this review.<br/><br/>No matter what kind of film or thing that is done regarding 9/11, it can't bring back the lives lost that day or after that day. So the best thing we can do is learn from past mistakes (mistakes that continue throughout the film a.k.a politics) and learn from them and bring everyone responsible to justice whether it's in court or Seal Team Six style. That's what Bigelow expressed in a great way, she showed how far we went to get to the prize and what prices we paid to make it happen. The only flaw was that the film was predictable but then again we all knew the story when we went in, we just wanted details.<br/><br/>For those who were uncomfortable with the content. Yes, this film shows torture at it's finest and respectably, much like Django, it will make people uncomfortable. Like Django, you got to keep it in perspective, remember what happened on 9/11 and every attack after that. Is it wrong, maybe (personally I didn't have a problem with it but then again I'm not everyone), but was it the right thing given the circumstances and knowing what's at stake. Hell Yeah. On that note enjoy the film and let's not forget what was lost and what it takes to bring justice to those who want to kill our friends and family. If you remember that you'll understand it. <br/><br/>Bonus Points: Seal Team Six performers were solid as well, particularly Chris Pratt from Moneyball, that man has a future to say the least."

","There is little sympathy for the characters, not EVEN the ""good guys!"" Poorly constructed film and rather disjointed! In order to accept that there is some merit in torture to get information to protect our country, one must be able to get into the heads of the characters and ""understand"" why they do what they do. In Zero Dark Thirty, the characters are muddy, often vague, and lacking any social redeemable qualities. They are not likable, interesting or sympathetic--How can we possible like them or EVEN understand them and their motivation?? In addition to the poorly defined characters the movie is choppy and poorly edited. It is often confusing and spotty! Needless to say, while I watched the full film, I wish I had spent my time with another!!"

","I looked around the movie theater. The audience was very 'ethnically homogeneous'. Only Danes. I could write about that in my review, I thought. But then two girls seated themselves. One of them wore a headscarf. The other girl wore no headscarf, but she had dark pigmentation.<br/><br/>The film begins with a series of desperate phone calls from WTC. Then it cuts directly to the film's first interrogation scene. The beautiful heroine is visibly shaken by watching the torture, but when she is offered to follow it at a distance through a monitor, she bravely refuse. Not only that, she also goes into the torture chamber without being masked. The male torturer humiliate the prisoner by dragging his pants down. A closeup of the face clearly shows how hard this is to watch for the poor female heroine. The torture victim exploits her weakness and asks her to make the torture end. She pulls herself together and explains to the prisoner - and to the audience - that he can get the torture to stop if he starts talking.<br/><br/>The heroine is what you might call a politically correct torturer; she tortures because she is ever so dedicated, and weeps afterwards.<br/><br/>To show who the baddies are, there is a suicide bomb going off at random intervals. The beautiful heroine can't have a cup of coffee at a café without it exploding, nor is it possible for her to get out of her driveway without suddenly being shot at. One could easily get the idea that the director have added yet another explosion each time the test audiences have complained about the movie being utterly boring. Explosions or not -- Zero Dark Twenty is really an exceptionally dull ride.<br/><br/>The film is mostly an office drama that focuses on the female protagonists status compared to that of her male colleagues. It's all very cliché. There were scattered giggles in the theater at the most corny one-liners. The movie even have that stupid scene where the heroine earns respect by shouting at her boss. It shows she have character, you know. Next time your boss is being stupid, try to screaming at him hysterically. You'll probably get a raise.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, the beautiful female torturer start crying again. While she was busy being all emotional, parts of the audience started to gather their stuff and heading for the exit. The two girls was among them. Most of the audience waited for the credits.<br/><br/>The film was over. There was the typical noise of coats being picked up and Coca Cola cups being crushed. A guy in the seat in front commented: ""I just can't wait for the sequel!"""

","Kathryn Bigelow's direction for this film missed out on an Oscar nomination and I can just about see why. I much preferred Ben Affleck's intricately filmed Argo or more appropriately Paul Greengras' thrilling Green Zone. That is not to say her direction is lacking here, it is interesting and unique and more importantly does not dwell on one aspect, particularly in scenes following troops in action.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain leads the acting performances alongside a brilliant Jason Clarke. There are also very enjoyable cameos from Stephen Dillane and James Gandolfini. Overall the support cast is of the highest order, and for me both Mark Strong and Kyle Chandler play traditionally awkward, dull government roles very artistically indeed.<br/><br/>Highly thrilling, intelligent and at times emotional, Zero Dark Thirty confirms film's very healthy engagement with post 9/11 related war material."

Lesser known actors give a sense of reality that is lost with the appearance of James Gandolfini.<br/><br/>Even though going in you know what the movie is about and how that comes out, it is brutal to watch. It is an outstanding achievement in movie making and it will garner a slew of technical nominations.<br/><br/>If you go to a movie to shut your eyes this is for you.

"roskvo","6","9","17","13 February 2013"," Ambiguous and somewhat numbing - like the assassination.
","I'm a fan of Strange Days and Near Dark. With The Hurt Locker, Bigelow seemed to take a fairly major change of direction, attempting a more journalistic approach to film, identifying with people that do controversial difficult jobs. Whether we have journalism in ZD30 is highly questionable.<br/><br/>While I have concerns over the CIA's input into this script, Bigelow has focused on a very small part of the story in order to avoid being drawn into making overt propaganda, as Naomi Wolf has claimed. The downside of this is that we get very little context for the story - I wanted to hear more about the tensions within the back-offices of Langley and Islamabad that lead to UBL slipping down the list of priorities.<br/><br/>I would also say that the portrayal of torture is fairly accurate and appropriately disgusting without being gratuitous. Interrogators are occasionally disturbed by their task but increasingly become cold. The scene at the breakfast table interview with Ammar is the scene which critics focus on: I believe it shows that after torture has failed, it is Maya's intelligent observation that leads them to play an entirely psychological trick on Ammar (it could have been achieved by using sedative drugs). The torture almost loses them the information due to the time wasted and accumulative effects on the prisoner.<br/><br/>Guantanamo Bay is portrayed as a largely unproductive center full of resolute and untrustworthy sources along with some innocent men. The keeping of monkeys also makes it seem like a farcical and pointless hell-hole. To call this an argument FOR torture is inaccurate.<br/><br/>The two best sequences (the attack on Camp Chapman, which rewrites history slightly and the raid on UBL's compound) stand out head and shoulders above the rest of the film both in terms of tension and cinematography. Towards the end, it becomes clear that Bigelow is certainly not trying to glorify war - it may even suggest that one child was shot dead. The soldiers seem to go into a death trance, as if they are hunting an animal. There is no ridiculous dialogue or drawn out violence. Even though most audience members have little sympathy with the primary target, there is still something sickening about the way that lives are snuffed out as if they are taking care of some rodent pests. The bond between the soldiers seems very well researched and their complete lack of compassion for the male householders is convincing (the lack of hesitation). This is an unstoppable assassination and you can believe they would have killed everyone in the house if they deemed it necessary. The CIA's statements against the film may suggest it is uncomfortably close to the truth.<br/><br/>What is far less convincing is the way that CIA detectives speak with one another about the case - the dialogue in some office scenes can seem clunky and superficial, namedropping rather than accurately reflecting the procedures and chains of command. Towards the end of the investigation the team grows considerably, yet there is no sense of how this new department functions e.g. searching through old files passed from the Moroccan government.<br/><br/>I would say that the film is not racist but certainly would make you afraid to visit rural Pakistan as a civilian due to the gangs that are shown patrolling the streets. Bigelow's portrayal of Islamabad and Lahore looks more like Yemen and fails to show the colour, lifestyle and architecture. The portrayal of Islam seems fairly neutral if slightly shallow - one of the caucasian CIA managers is a convert to the religion and Maya's colleague Karim (played by the brilliant Fares Fares) is a Muslim Pakistani man - initially a translator who's role grows after he helps uncover a key piece of information. It is inaccurate to say that there are no Muslim voices present in the script, rather there are no Urdu voices and no subtitles. Apparently colloquial Arabic can occasionally be heard in the background which is inaccurate for the location.<br/><br/>The film is one-sided because it tells the story from the point of view of an understandably paranoid head-hunter living in a hostile situation. Maya is no hero: her boss clearly points out to her that she has lost any focus helping with new, separate terrorist cells due to her obsession. So the story seems to play out as a leap of faith : the belief that UBL's death will some how bring 'closure' to 9/11 and some sort of redemption. The ending suggests that it does not do this but rather just releases a flood of tears (as if mourning for lost years). Maya is shown as highly intellectually developed but emotionally naive.<br/><br/>Bigelow places a glamorous young actress centre stage, a somewhat unconvincing version of an agent. A more gritty actress like Tilda Swinton might have fitted the script better. The partly redeeming quality of the film is that it portrays all of the main characters as pragmatic, scarred, bitter, unhappy people. If this is a recruitment video for the CIA it's a poor one.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Karim was maybe the only character I really felt anything for. I found the scene where he is warning civilians to, ""Keep back or they will kill you!"" very moving - he refers to his colleagues as 'they' and seems genuinely concerned that the operation may end in carnage.<br/><br/>Finally, the music towards the end sequence threatens to kill the ambiguity of the final shot. It's an extremely thorny set of issues to portray in film and Bigelow will inevitably disappoint many with this patchy effort."

","I wondered if after 1 and 1/2 hours when I wanted to get up and leave if I was missing the point. A film with such critical acclaim. I really wished i had walked out and reclaimed an hour of my life! Annoying/poor acting, boring plot. Tacit support of torture. One sided. Propaganda which backfires to anyone with a brain. Do yourself a favour and give it a wide birth. There are a number of reviews on IMDb which are far more articulate than mine in describing how poor this file is from its inaccuracies in context and history, it's acceptance of torture, poor acting and dreadful pace. It's at least an hour too long. There was a documentary shown in the uk which pointed out that the entire operation at the end was a joke. A helicopter tried to land in an enclosed space - when well known this would cause an accident. Trying to breach a door that was bricked up. The movie should have pointed out that the us spent over 10 years tracking down the most wanted man in the world only to be 50% sure it was him, and starting an operation with pathetic intelligence after studying a compound for over 100 days! Clearly propaganda supporting the amazing operation - which came close to disaster and which would have been much more interesting to point out"
"woodiphora","3","15","32","31 January 2013"," Polished production, very watchable out of curiosity, but ultimately dull and vacuous.
","Three out of ten might seem a bit mean, but it reflects my overall view after watching the movie twice. I just found it left a vacuum. The narrative tension was weak, and dependent on spaghetti western tactics of having a few gunshots or explosions every now and then to keep the audience interested. Jessica was entertainingly intense, but the rest of the ensemble gave middling, safe performances.<br/><br/>Bigelow directs well, but only in the sense of giving a professional, technically polished production. Where's the emotion and human involvement? It'll keep you watching and you won't be bored, but I suspect this will rapidly fade in movie-goer consciousness once the hype dies down."

","This movie has created a buzz in the Hollywood with all it's Academy and Oscar nominations, but it is really an insult to all other movies out there. This movie is so insanely one-sided, it makes Fox News like an unbiased media outlet. First off, the characters have no back story, no heartache if a character is in a bad situation, the dialogues were poorly-written and the movie actually has no plot whatsoever. <br/><br/>Now the main part, this movie is politically incorrect, as incorrect as it gets. The U.S government has been raining down Drone missiles over the civilian population on the North in Pakistan, hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed, and this makes the Taliban of the high north very happy (Massive collateral damages done by the American drone missiles = an unlimited supply of recruits for the terrorists) The movie never touched on this colossal issue.<br/><br/>How badly an average Pakistani citizen is affected by the same extremists/terrorists of the North is never shown. In fact, they show time and time again that the Pakistani people along with the bad guys are united with their hatred for white faces, oh and they hate white faces with a passion all around the country.<br/><br/>Way to generalize that the entire population was bred for hate against a white face, oh and it's funny that these people don't speak their native tongue, they seem to speak Arabic usually.<br/><br/>There was a time when political movies like Syriana and W, were a bit politically correct, but this movie is off, the only good thing is that it serves Propaganda and more Propaganda on a silver platter to the general public in the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* - A scene were a women was shot by the Navy Seal, people actually laughed in the cinema as a 'yay', and a scene were a restaurant is shown, people actually went 'oh' to their surprise that there are restaurants in a Muslim nation, looks like the Propaganda works really well.<br/><br/>Seems like making an insanely one-sided political movie just for Propaganda's sake is the way to go in Hollywood if getting 'prestigious' awards is really the goal."

","""Through the eye's of Jessica Chastain's Maya we are given a film of obsession over the period of twelve years seeing a women change from the innocent young women to a strong women not knowing what her next move will be""<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal make another war film but this film unlike The Hurt Locker is not about soldiers but about the search for the man responsible for that war. The film starts as a torture is being done by Dan (Jason Clarke) as he shows new girl Maya (Jessica Chastain) of what her job will entail for the next 12 years of her life. We are then following the development of Maya as she focuses on this one case following many leads which lead to no good but the final lead in the film leads to the compound where seal team six enter to kill Bin Laden on May 1st 2011.<br/><br/>The film is compelling throughout watching this women who was responsible for finding the man responsible for 911 and how she was very obsessive in her look to find the man. The movie does a great job of building tension throughout as we enter the raid scene which is the most important part of the movie as we focus solely on the raid not going back to any other characters or getting reactions from Maya just seeing her plan go through. The final words at the end of the movie ""Where do you want to go?"" where perfect words to describe the main character of Maya because she spent 12 years to search for Osama Bin Laden and the reaction from Maya summed up the whole character and how she does not know what to do next. The film is technically well done from the haunting score by Alexandre Desplat, beautiful cinematography by Greig Freiser and the very detailed recreation of Bin Laden's compound. The film's depiction of torture has been talked about but my opinion is that those scenes are not supporting torture but showing what it truly looked like.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain plays the main character Maya and finally she has gotten a lead role worthy of her talents that have been underused in her many supporting roles. Maya as a character may be a women but in a mans world she does not act like a women throughout. Chastain plays all her scenes so well and in her final scene where the character finally gets emotional it shows the toll this women had been put through over this time period. Jennifer Ehle plays Maya's friend Jessica. Even if she does not appear in movie for a long time she plays all of her scenes so well. Her character was interesting for me because she seemed to be what Maya wanted to beat at the start and her departure from the film left a big change to Maya for the rest of the film. Jason Clarke plays Dan and when we first meet his character he is torturing someone and this is where Clarke's performance is best. Like every other character he leaves only to come back completely changed going from his tough self to what Maya was like when she started at the CIA, this is great to see the transformation especially when the two are in the same scene in front of James Gandolfini.<br/><br/>The film was amazing and unlike Argo (another film about the CIA), this film feels more researched and instead of going for the more Hollywood style the film feels more gritty and real. The film becomes even stronger especially when resting on Chastain's shoulders with her giving her strongest career performance for me.<br/><br/>MOVIE GRADE: A+ (MVP: Jessica Chastain)"
"SnoopyStyle","8","11","22","2 November 2013"," Shocked how real the raid look
","Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA analyst who won't rest from the hunt fro Bin Laden. Director Kathryn Bigelow has followed the hunt from 9-11 to the tension filled raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The movie is based on the true events. There is a relevant question of how true to the events is the movie. Unlike most movies, this is actually an important question.<br/><br/>Most of us have no hope of knowing the true facts that actually happened. This movie is certainly a possible reality. Some of it is probably wrong. They've probably changed some of it to not reveal CIA trade craft. Others looks different than what's been reported on the news. However it is overall following the story already laid out for the public.<br/><br/>The hunt for Bin Laden can meander and not follow a straight line. It doesn't really built like a normal movie. Bigelow is still able to maintain the tension throughout the movie. The last 40 minutes is where this movie truly excels. The raid in Abbottabad is incredibly tense. The Hollywood flashiness is mostly removed. It takes its time. It's done almost in real time. It has the intensity of realism. It's shocking how real the raid looked."
"The-Sarkologist","5","11","22","1 February 2013"," Left me somewhat disappointed with its unrealism
","There has been a number of comments on what is bad about this movie, and I will focus on one particular aspect that I found to be somewhat unbelievable. First though I must mention that while it was what I expected from the creator of The Hurt Locker, it is nowhere near as good, nor is it anywhere near as objective as the former movie. Certainly this film is not a film that runs around trumpeting the virtues of the United States, and while it does not necessarily condemn torture, it suggests that torture is not the best way of obtaining information. However, the film is not about torture, it is about the hunt for Bin Laden.<br/><br/>Personally, if I were to make a propaganda piece I would be more inclined to make a movie like this one than something like, say, the Delta Force, where we have an invincible group of marines storm a hide out of terrorists, and then return heroes. Okay, we do have out bunch of marines storming the hideout, however we do know that that was how it played out, and we do not have the hero's welcome at the end.<br/><br/>My concerns with how this film played out was simply the way it was suggested that when the marines (if they were marines) stormed the mansion in Pakistan, that nobody in the mansion, particularly Bin Laden (if that even was Bin Laden) knew what was going on. Granted, the helicopters were supposed to be quiet, but when they were flying around the house, no doubt they could still be heard (particularly when one of them crashed). Then, when they went into the house, blowing open doors, and having kids and women screaming, why were they not alerted.<br/><br/>The reason I raise this is because they stumble across an intelligence goldmine in the house which is a suggestion that pretty much everything that can be known about Al Qaeda would be in there. However, I wonder why nobody actually tried to destroy this information. It was not as if Al Qaeda couldn't continue afterwards. I suspect that the suggestion that we have that information now, the world has been saved from the Al Qaeda threat.<br/><br/>My position is that it hasn't. Even if that was Bin Laden in the house, that information is not necessarily going to reveal the exact extent of Al Qaeda's organisation. It is a cell based structure where if one cell, especially the head cell, is taken down, the organisation can continue. It is unlikely that every member in every country, is going to be printed in those files or on those hard drives. Also, Al Qaeda is only one organisation, and is generally considered an umbrella organisation that is used to describe a multitude of Islamic terrorist organisations, that may have no actually connection with Bin Laden. It is similar in the sense that the Taliban pretty much refers to any person who is resisting the Western occupation of Afghanistan."
"rogerdarlington","Null","11","22","1 February 2013"," Superb film-making
","The title is never explained, but it is military jargon for 30 minutes after midnight, the time that the raid on the Abbottabad compound was launched, and apparently it refers also to the darkness and secrecy that cloaked the entire decade-long mission to capture or kill al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden (or ""USB"" as he is referred to sometimes in the movie). The film reunites the winning team of director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, who were responsible for the brilliant ""The Hurt Locker"", and who have now produced a stunning piece of work.<br/><br/>When bin Laden was eliminated by SEAL Team Six on 2 May 2011, it was obvious that there would soon be a film about the exploit, but few would have guessed that the director would be a woman, the lead character would also be a woman, the focus would be on the intelligence-gathering operation rather than the military planning of the raid, and the whole thing would be so lacking in machismo and so non-triumphalist. All these unexpected features, plus outstanding acting, brilliant cinematography and superb sound, make this a superlative exercise in film-making.<br/><br/>The narrative is in the form of a triptych: a deeply disturbing set of interrogations involving torture, a painstaking and obsessive pursuit of intelligence links to the courier, and then the audacious raid into Pakistani territory under the noses of the country's equivalent to West Point (depicted in almost real time). Linking the three segments is Maya, the female CIA analyst on whom we have no background information, played by Jesica Chastain who confirms her status as one of the finest actresses of her generation.<br/><br/>In this long, but gripping, film, only one scene did not work for me: when a CIA chief lambasts his team for failing to find their man. This scene apart, the whole movie is utterly absorbing in its authentic presentation. There are clearly conflations and mistakes in the telling of this true story, but it is clear that Bigelow and Boal have had access to people who know a lot about this unique operation and have helped the creation of a work of great verisimilitude and power."

","I am seriously disappointed to say the least. Aside from average acting and unrealistic situations, the story has no continuity and is mildly boring at times. From the fact that 9/11 (as much as we don't want to believe it) is an inside job, plus including the background of a long hunt, (the longer - the better) Americans had a long enough time and under ""terrorist"" danger, enough money, to build several bases all over the Middle East and that was the real plan. OBL was a real person but aside from that the entire ""dangerous man alive"" is a fairytale. I see a movie as just one more unconvincing try to fabricate the truth. At the end, it is a very forgettable make believe propaganda. It could be seen as a fact for someone who was not alive at the time and didn't see what happen on that day in 2001."

But Jessica Chastain is mind-blowing and real in this pompous, predictable and easy thriller. The first half deals with more of details and is a precise stuff of how it all started since 9/11 to 2010.<br/><br/>Coming to the second half is where you move your head closer to the screen. Of what I have heard and watched over 2011 & 2012 in Reuters, BBC, TOI, NatGeo - if you add them up - you get ZDT. It is not action packed as it states but surely is a thriller. Music is typicality, and this is not much of a absolute 'The Hurt Locker' type film-making. Kathryn disappoints a lil bit because the astronomical expectations were not answered well.<br/><br/>The problem with ZDT is that you know what will happen and that oozes 50% of the fun of it. But, still the intricacy and accuracy of this movie (as they say) is worth appreciable. The remaining cast is par excellence and the people who worked as Seal team need a couple of claps.<br/><br/>What I liked about the movie is secrecy that they do not show the minutiae of how, why and when about the operation. One minute you see them in the Langley room/White House and the next second you see two ""canaries."" Second thing is the Quentin Tarantino type narration with titles for scene like ""Human Error""! I felt it is pretty awesome.<br/><br/>Overall experience after watching ZDT is ridiculously average and non-zealous compared to the SEAL TEAM 6: The Raid On Osama bin Laden which released in the 2012 beginning by NatGeo or The Hurt Locker or any similar kinds. But it is recommendable, although I cannot guarantee the enjoyment. As cinema, ZDT fails down and under. But as a documentary of how things get done in certain field of high-tech operation, this is straight must-watch!<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you haven't ANY idea about the OsamaBL raid (read or watched or operated, ha ha) go for it!<br/><br/>WATCH OUT FOR: Jessica Chastain!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 80% YES<br/><br/>Language: Strong | Sex: No | Nudity: Mild | Violence: Very Strong | Gore: Very Strong | Smoking, Alcohol, Drugs: No"

Of course not. <br/><br/>It's a poorly told, poorly acted average film that simply panders to it's target audience of poorly informed Americans who will clap and cheer anything with an American flag draped over it subliminally or otherwise.<br/><br/>At one point someone says '3000 Americans died on 11/9/01' (yes America the correct way to write a date) but of course that's not true as a good number of other countries suffered loss at the hands of the religiously insane. This has been ignored in the same way Spielberk ignored everybody else in his SPR nonsense. American flag and patriotism equates to Oscars.<br/><br/>But it doesn't deserve the accolades and is probably the most over rated film of 2012 which is a shame considering the profound implication the death of UBL has for most of the civilised people on the planet. This man was the monster who ripped away our cushion of comfort and revealed the reality that we can all die at any time at the hands of crazy religious people. <br/><br/>Of course the aftermath of 11/9/01 has resulted in ten times more innocent deaths and even the death of UBL will not satisfy the crazy God of all the crazy people on both sides. But of all the people on Earth he certainly was one that needed Death. And credit to America's president for finally removing such a horrible individual.<br/><br/>But the film of the hunt for this creature should have been better. The story was confusing and some of it did not even make sense. People banged tables and shouted and it seemed to me to be making the point that the hunt for UBL was in someway directly related to the terror attacks being carried out in various countries. A dramatic race to stop the terror by killing the Global Mastermined as in a Bond film. Kill UBL and these attacks will somehow stop? Maybe I read it wrong but that's what it seemed to be saying. Of course UBL dying would not have prevented one single death in the last 10 years. It was a symbolic act that was important to the civilised members of the Human Race but in reality was of little consequence to the death and destruction.<br/><br/>The CIA seemed to be a rather bumbling organisation which I am sure is not the case. The Redhead seeming to be the only one there who had a clue and her 100% certainty that UBL was there swayed any doubters and the operation went ahead.<br/><br/>The raid itself was not very dramatic which reflects on the film maker herself. She is a good director but a tad over rated. And her limitations in telling this story are there for all to see. Seal Team Six were a pretty anonymous bunch who carried out their operation well enough with a few glitches but without any tension being conveyed to the viewer via the film maker. It was not dull as such simply ordinary. Which is probably how it happened but this was meant to be a dramatic recreation of the raid but it had no real drama.<br/><br/>There was nothing in the film that grabbed the viewer. Nothing to immerse them in the film and it's complexities which were myriad. It was a very ordinary film with barely decent acting and few points in the story which made the whole thing watchable.<br/><br/>So when this is crowned best Picture or whatever don't forget it really isn't and is just best picture draped in the Stars and Stripes.<br/><br/>Which is a shame as it was an important story for ALL of us and deserved a better telling. And for the record I am OK with torture for the purpose of saving lives as long as we torture the right people of course which sadly we (and I include my own country the UK here) don't have a great record of."

","I am about to embark on the biggest punhunt in the history of my corny pun-induced movie reviews. And I am also on a mission to hunt down men and women to witness the mastery of ""Zero Dark Thirty"". OK, I am sorry to scare you away, and I am also sorry that I bombed with that opening of my movie review of the spectacular ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Director Kathryn Bigelow's movie about the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden is about as gripping as it gets in watching a motion picture. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" stars Jessica Chastain as Maya, a CIA Agent who had an integral role in finding the Pakistani three-story home where Osama Bin Laden hid and where he was eventually killed by the U.S. Navy Seal Team Six. The Maya character is based on a real female CIA Agent who was the secret-operative defining force in finding Bin Laden. The movie opens with no images but of audio recordings of 911 calls from people in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001; the day that changed our world forever. And then it jumps two years later at an undisclosed Detainee Prison where supposedly CIA Agents used torture techniques as waterboarding to Islamic terrorist detainees to force them to divulge information. The information from the detainees was the watershed or should I say waterboard moment that spurred up the eventual finding of Osama Bin Laden years later; but obviously this did not happen abruptly. It was a rigorous and challenging process that is captured authentically by the great directorial hand of Oscar-winning Director Kathryn Bigelow. Remind me again why she was not nominated for a Best Director Oscar for her exemplary orchestration of ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Talk about terror! The Academy sure slipped big time with that omission. The last 30 minutes of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in depicting the Navy Seals raid and the killing of Bin Laden was a thing of cinematic beauty. Mark Boal's compelling screenplay of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was a bowl of sharp and cerebral dialogue that accentuated the heroism of Maya. Chastain's performance is the best I have seen by any actor or actress in 2012. In fact, it is one of the best (if not the best) I have seen by any leading actress in motion picture history. Chastain brilliantly captures a woman's determination to accomplish a challenging mission. The supporting cast of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" earned their medals of thespian excellence like Chastain. Jason Clarke's performance as CIA Agent Dan, who ran the Detainee Camp, is not torturous to watch at all and it should have merited a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kyle Chandler shined under the ""Zero Dark Thirty"" lights as Joseph Bradley, who led the CIA Delegation in Pakistan. Jennifer Ehle was a revelation as CIA Agent Jessica who also befriends Maya. Mark Strong's brawny performance as CIA Administrator George added to his strong thespian resume. And James Gandolfini was a hit as the CIA Director. Now I am going to hunt down a few more deserving accolades for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in the technical department; those would be Greig Frasier's stunning cinematography, William Goldenberg & Dylan Tichenor's perfect editing, and Jeremy Hindle's astonishing art direction. I also have to score one more, that would be Alexander Desplat's mesmeric score. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the best movie of the year, and please don't raid in my parade by disagreeing with me. See for yourself! ***** Excellent"

","The movie was way too long and, quite frankly, kind of boring.

It was hard to understand what the characters were saying but the sound did get better later.<br/><br/>More explanation and background to some of the characters (good and bad) would have helped this film along. It was somewhat confusing trying to figure out who was who.<br/><br/>I have to agree with the decision to not nominate Kathryn Bigelow for a Best Director Academy Award. If only five movies were nominated for the Best Picture Oscar as they used to do instead of the nine or ten they now nominate, then 'Zero Dark 'Thirty' would not even be in the Best Picture category."

","Everything has been said probably in the comments. The movie by far does not deserve the negativity it gets in the reviews here. The problem of the story of ""the hunt for Bin Laden"" is really that it was such a long road. I'd say a TV-series will come of this sooner or later. There's so much to tell in this decade long hunt.<br/><br/>Anyways, indeed the plot of the movie was not its strongest part. The inclusion of the London bombings wasn't necessary to make the point, we all know that anyways. The Madrid ones were left out, so it makes it hard to understand some of the plot choices. Leaving out some unnecessary details might have given some screen time to develop more character-depth/background. <br/><br/>But all in all I rate the movie 8 out of 10, despite some of its identified weaknesses. It has suspense, action and drama, and the acting was good. The closing scenes were amazing."
"doughelo","5","8","15","13 September 2013"," No doubt this film endorses torture
","I'm deeply emotionally invested in the torture argument, chiefly because I can't believe there even is an argument. I would have placed it on a plane with say, lynching or slavery, as one of those things that is just known to be wrong. Yet some of my own family followed my government down the rabbit hole where ""enhanced interrogation"" might be OK, as long as it's only against terrorists. So it was with interest I followed the controversy over where Zero Dark Thirty stood on the issue.<br/><br/>Having (finally) seen the film, there is no doubt in my mind the film endorses torture; in fact, the first third revels in interrogation scenes, going beyond even what the CIA actually did (like the dog collar). The chief interrogator is sympathetically presented and is a good friend of Maya's. Maya helps him waterboard a suspect by handing him a bucket and repeatedly questions detainees undergoing torment. Nobody in the film questions the techniques, only expressing concern about the political climate changing and ""you don't want to be the last one holding the dog collar"". Most importantly, the vital clue of Bin Laden's courier is given up by a victim just after he's explicitly threatened with being returned to interrogation. The courier's photo and name is then confirmed by a montage of detainees undergoing or just after torture. A few years later, an official states he can't confirm a piece of information because now the detainees will just get ""lawyered up"".<br/><br/>However, the CIA has stated that the film is inaccurate as the courier's name was not found out through torture. So why the obsessive focus on this during the first third of the film, plainly stating that the techniques worked? It's a shame, because the rest of the film, especially the raid, is riveting."
"collinhchs","3","8","15","15 April 2013"," Severe Misrepresentation
","Mark Boal's and Kathryn Bigelow's groundbreaking film Zero Dark Thirty about the hunt and subsequent elimination of Osama bin Laden did not live up to hype that was associated with the release of the film. Due to the lack of overall coverage of all of the events which culminated in the hunt for and killing of Osama bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty did not fully document the widest ranging manhunt in human history, in that the film ignored the President's role in decision making the raid happen, and the intense training and physical sacrifice that the SEALs underwent to prepare for the raid itself.<br/><br/>One major problem with Zero Dark Thirty was the lack of coverage of the SEAL team that took part in the raid on bin Laden's compound. As documented by Mark Owen, a SEAL who participated in the raid on bin Laden's compound, the SEAL team trained for weeks on a mockup of the compound built to serve as a training model for the SEALs. None of this training was documented in Zero Dark Thirty, in fact, the only two times that the SEAL team appears on screen is when Maya briefs the team on the compound and its occupants and when the team goes on the raid. This lack of portrayal of the SEALs is a blatant insult to the sacrifice that these men made to go on this raid and succeed.<br/><br/>Another problem with Zero Dark Thirty is that the decision made by the President to raid the compound was not shown on screen. It seemed as though in the film the decision came out of the middle of nowhere, when in reality the President alone had the power to send the SEALs into Pakistan to eliminate Osama bin Laden. This downplay of the President's role insults him, just as the SEALs role was insulted because of their prominent roles in the hunt were basically ignored by the film makers.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty ignores many pivotal people who made enormous sacrifices and risky decisions which made the raid on bin Laden's compound possible. The ignoring of these people and their roles in the hunt for bin Laden makes this movie an appalling portrayal of the hunt for bin Laden, one which in unsuitable to considered proper filmmaking."
"saschakrieger","9","8","15","21 March 2013"," One Woman's Mission
","The distinction between good and bad is blurred from the outset in Zero Dark Thirty. Maya, a young CIA operative, fresh from headquarters, arrives in Iraq and the first thing she sees is the interrogation of a suspected terrorist against whom waterboarding and other torture techniques are used.Initially clearly uncomfortable with the situation, Maya will soon adapt to the methods and culture employed here to deal with suspects. This, she concludes, is no place and time for scruples. Like her, the film does not condemn any of the tactics and methods used in George W. Bush's so-called War on Terror, it simply shows them and their consequences. For it must be part of an honest debate to also acknowledge that, at least when it comes to the search for Bin Laden, these highly problematic activities did yield some results. In this world, in this permanent state of emergency, the viewer learns, good and bad are really hard to keep apart, there is no black or white and sometimes, the grey turns awfully dark. Zero Dark Thirty leads to many questions as to how far a free and democratic society is allowed to go for the greater good as they say but it provides no easy answers. These are questions we all must answer for ourselves. Too unsettling a thought for the Academy?<br/><br/>First and foremost, however, Zero Dark Thirty is the story of one woman's mission, of her crusade to show the world and everybody else that she is right. And this Maya, no less than those she hunts, is a fanatic, an extremist, uncompromising, relentless, deaf to all reasoning. A woman who writes the number of days wasted every morning on her boss' glass door, who gives herself up to her task, who signs a pact with her very personal devil to complete a mission whose sole meaning seems to lie in its fulfilment. Bigelow does well to refrain from building artificial tension, from working the register of suspense. Watching Jessica Chastain freeze, tighten, unravel, observing her body getting ever more tense when all of her nears the breaking point, is quite enough. There is a documentary feel to how the camera follows Chastain's Maya and it completely takes over when we leave her at last and join the team that invades Bin Laden's final hiding place and ends up killing him. There is nothing heroic about this, just people doing their jobs, not asking whether what they're doing is right, in the conventional sense.<br/><br/>There is no triumph, relief yes, but also a sense of loss when Maya, having completed her mission, finally breaks down. Her mission is over but what has been gained? For her? For us? Zero Dark Thirty is a film that asks questions but provides no answers, questions which we might not want to answer because we might not like what we could find. There are no easy exists here, no comfortable paths, just a look into the heart of darkness – ours, society's, the human soul's. At times we might be tempted to avert our eyes, but maybe it is a good thing that we don't. No, not maybe, it most certainly is."

","Kathryn Bigelow who made history by becoming the first woman director to win an Oscar (""The Hurt Locker"") continues her tryst with 9/11 and its aftermath with her latest creation - Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>ZDT like its predecessor, ""The Hurt Locker"", chronicles the polarization of the world from an American standpoint. To the credit of the director, she manages to build in a fair amount of suspense and edge of the seat thrills as the hunt for Osama Bin Laden reaches its crescendo, despite the end result being known to the viewer.<br/><br/>The other high light of the movie is the portrayal of Maya, the lead CIA operative by upcoming actress Jessica Chastain. Its rare to see a mainstream Hollywood movie where the lead female actor is shown as cold, bull headed, steely, self centered and socially inept. Chastain pulls it off remarkably well. What a transformation it has been for the classically beautiful actress from playing vulnerable, quiet, mother of two in ""The Tree of Life"" or from playing the air headed, rich, bored housewife who wants to desperately hire a house maid and impress her husband in ""The Help"". Slowly but surely, Chastain is building up a formidable oeuvre of work. No wonder she is bookies favorite to pick up the Best Actress Oscar this year.<br/><br/>On the acting front, an honorable mention must be made of James Gandolfini's robust, business like and heavy duty cameo of CIA Chief, Leon Panetta.<br/><br/>Beyond these odd exceptions, the cupboard of ZDT is starkly bare. Is this movie pro/anti war? Is the movie pro/anti Jihad? Is this movie pro/anti prison torture? No one can tell. Director Bigelow takes a convenient and morally ambivalent stand on all these issues. Why is Maya so single-mindedly obsessed about hunting down OBL? What drives her to shun friends, social life and risk her own life and limbs to be devoted to the cause? Once again no one can tell. Bigelow does a shoddy job of fleshing out Maya and other characters. Also for Bigelow, the age old American policy of fostering trouble in Middle East and the resultant rise of militancy in those regions is not something to be bothered with in the narrative. Even a TV series like ""Homeland"" is more comprehensive in its reach and coverage there.<br/><br/>In summary, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a movie bogged down by a weak script, stuffed with process and operational details and helmed by a lazy director, ultimately winding up in the graveyard of many forgettable films on the topic of Islamic terrorism.<br/><br/>I am going with 2.5 stars on 5."

","""I'm gonna smoke everybody involved in this op, and then I'm going to kill bin Laden."" Maya (Jessica Chestain) <br/><br/>It's challenging to think of a more wanted fugitive any time in history than Osama bin Laden. It's just as hard to think of a better thriller than Zero Dark Thirty (meaning military time, 12:30 a.m. when bin Laden was killed), Katherine Bigelow's docudrama about the decade-long search headed by the lone female CIA operative, Maya (Chastain). She tries desperately to convince the boys that she can find bin Laden by following his personal Al Qaida courier.<br/><br/>The cool with which she amasses agent reports and fleshes out her hunch is as fascinating as the final segment where, in cinematic yet real detail, a chopper goes down but so does bin Laden. Yet her cool keeps us from knowing her in any depth, a drawback for me, who prefers fleshed out characters even in a docudrama. Then, we don't know much about anyone else in the film either.<br/><br/>We do witness in the first third of the film some torture techniques scary to behold, including the use of water. And while it is argued that no substantial information was gleaned from these situations, Zero is, after all, a re-imagining, and the torture is instructive about warfare, regardless of where your politics come in.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes fulfill all expectations: Bigelow expertly shows, it would seem in real time, the Navy SEALs infiltrating the Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound. Killing women along the way to get to bin Laden is the collateral damage no one wants but must endure. Realism prevails.<br/><br/>Certainly, the gets-you-to-talk factor is strong--strong for me especially with the distaff topic, the singularity of the female among a dominant male culture. In an inspired move, Bigelow and Boal (they won the Oscar for Hurt Locker) do not lard the film with male chauvinism; in fact I found only one reference to her not taking a lover in her assignments.<br/><br/>Osama bin Laden is the only game Maya has played and the only one I wanted to see.

","This film is about Maya (Jessica Chastain) a potty mouthed CIA operative and her one woman crusade to get Bin Laden. It starts off with 9-11. Maya is a composite character. The CIA is not as dumb as this film portrays. She visits CIA black sites around the world through their revolving door. It appears as if she got all the intelligence on her own. We know this was not the case.<br/><br/>In comparison, I must say ""Seal Team Six"" was a far better film as far as plot. What this film offers is an obsessed Jessica Chastain who borders on insanity. Her character seemed unrealistic at times, but compelling at other times.<br/><br/>Much has been made about the politics of this film which I found they took great lengths to be non-controversial. Sometimes facts have a bias to them. There is excessive torture at the beginning of the film. Information is gathered from people that have been tortured, but not necessarily because of it, as there is a disconnect between the two events. The audience is allowed to decide on its effectiveness. Seal Team Six appears late in the film, almost as an afterthought. The other film was superior in presenting the Navy Seals.<br/><br/>Obama and Bush aren't mentioned per se. Obama appears speaking in the background on TV. There is a new policy concerning torture that is alluded to, but the details are not given. One remark was, ""You don't want to be the one caught holding the dog collar.""<br/><br/>There is a reluctance on the part of some to invade the Bin Laden compound due to the WMD/Iraq disaster although no blame is specifically placed.<br/><br/>Chastain does an excellent job and is the best aspect of this feature. In an idea world she would have played Maya in ""Seal Team Six."" I found the political criticisms unwarranted as was the praise given to this film when ""Seal Team Six"" was clearly the superior production in presenting the tale.

"fabiogaucho","8","3","4","9 October 2017"," A companion piece for visiting UBL's compound
","I've lived in the Muslim world for years and in Pakistan for a few months. Now some friends came to stay and the one place they decided they HAD to see was the empty plot of land where once stood Osama Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad. Three hours to go, three hours back, some pictures and a story to tell (the movie says the city is 45 minutes drive from Islamabad, but that was back in 2010 - not now!).<br/><br/>Once we came back we were so involved with the story of the raid that we had to see Zero Dark Thirty (for the 2nd time for me, 1st for them). The killing of UBL is meticulously reconstructed, but only covers the last 30 minutes of the movie. Most of the story involves a CIA semi-fictional agent who by sheer determination and luck convinces the Agency that Bin Laden can be reached, and that they have a good idea of what men is the key to his whereabouts: Ibrahim Sayed, AKA Abu Ahmed Al-Kuwaiti. Information from detainees suggests Sayed is UBL's courier. Our hero figures that, wherever in Central Asia UBL is, the one thing he is sure to have is a courier. Track him, you get the big Kahuna.<br/><br/>The Agency is initially unlucky to believe erroneous intelligence saying Sayed is dead. And then they are lucky to find out he is not dead. With a lot of push from our hero, they allot the resources to find him. It is no easy task. That's my favorite part of the movie. Surveillance technology can find out from where he is calling his family (busy districts in the Punjab), but it is a lot more tricky to follow him in the middle of the crowd to the place where he lives.<br/><br/>After tracking Sayed to a VERY suspicious compound in a city the CIA never expected Bin Laden to be, it is time to decide if this is really UBL's residence. But the mysterious inhabitant never shows his face. I don't think he was hiding from CIA cameras, he just knows he is so recognizable. So the decision is left to the higher-ups, to bomb the place, raid it, or just keep waiting for more definitive intel. <br/><br/>And that is the part where the Director has to make a dramatic decision. Does she show the President and his top aides deliberating? I think putting Obama, Clinton and Biden in the movie would suck all the air out of the room to the detriment of the focus on the field agents. Leon Panneta shows up, but he is not even named. The final act wrote itself, because it is a documentary-like recreation of the raid.<br/><br/>Some reviewers pointed glaring mistakes: the Pakistanis seem to be speaking Arabic instead of Urdu. One part I had to laugh was when a mob stood outside the American Embassy in Islamabad. If you have been there, or anywhere in the diplomatic compound, you know it would never happen.<br/><br/>It is hard to make suspenseful a story that unfolds throughout 10 years and involves meticulous collection of intelligence and a lot of false starts. So the movie may feel like a ""boring procedural"" for people who are expecting normal Hollywood fare. In order to add a personal touch to the main character, she has a fried killed in a highly implausible scene. Otherwise, Maya just remains a stock character you have to fill in the gaps: lonely woman married to her job, always having to prove herself, obsessed with a task her superiors don't want to give priority.<br/><br/>Some people pointed out to a big lie of the movie: that torture gave crucial information. I'd point out that it is just a half-lie. Yes, nobody gave useful intel for the killing of UBL under torture. However, keeping terror suspects for years under dubious legal status (say with me - Guantanamo!) paid dividends."

Amazing really. They should have made me head of CIA operations - I'm sure I or just about anybody else with half a brain could have done better.

","Zero Dark Thirty is the highly anticipated story of the hunt and eventual ""we got him,"" moment for Osama Bin Laden, and Kathryn Bigelow's big movie to follow her great Iraq war movie, ""The Hurt Locker."" I was extremely disappointed to say the least.<br/><br/>The Good. Their were only a few bright spots in this movie. For one, it showed the CIA's supposed ""torture/enhanced interrogation,"" techniques without taking a Hollywood, far left, holier than thou approached and acknowledged some of the usefulness. That surprised me actually. Second, it is a real life event and that will always make people come out to see it. I was also pretty happy they didn't turn this into a ""worship Obama,"" movie as a lot of people thought they would do, but i think a lot was due to that very thought.<br/><br/>The Bad. You would think after the success of ""The Hurt Locker,"" Bigelow would make a really\ great, stirring movie, and seemed like an obvious choice. This was a movie that was a gift to a Director, and had the potential of being a huge movie because of the feelings that 9/11 and Osama Bin Laden provoke in Americans.<br/><br/>This did not deliver! For several reasons. First, it was straight up boring most of the time. It felt piece mealed together without any kind of rhythm or flow to it. Second, they should really have hired a sound engineer and put some kind of score to it, what we got instead was that dull, indy problem, of many moments of that turns many movie goers off and makes them look at their watch or think about what they need to get done when they get home.<br/><br/>Third, the acting was bad. Plain and simple. Frankly, I was thinking with all the awards and accolades Bigelow picked up she actually might be able to pull in some big time talent, but then again maybe the writing was crap. There were moments that should have been big ones, or make you want to cheer, but for some reason the actors, especially Jessica Chastain, couldn't pull it off.<br/><br/>Lastly, for some reason they tried to make this some kind of Female empowerment movie. The main character, played by Jessica Chastain, spends the entire movie trying to tell everyone in the CIA, etc, how to do their jobs, and how she is right, etc. She gets increasingly hostile through the movie only to be vindicated in the end. I have no reason why they chose that route, it might have worked if they spent the money to hire talent, but it was pushed to the point where she just became quite annoying at best. There was very little character development and nothing that really makes you feel anything towards anyone in the movie, with maybe an exception to the Seal team, but they really were left out of the movie altogether except for the very end.<br/><br/>Something about the disjointedness just says to me they probably changed focus, or rewrote/worked the movie half way through production, or just plain hurried through the whole thing. It leaves me to believe Bigelow's Hurt Locker praise was a one time only flash in the pan.<br/><br/>I know this movie is going to continue some high marks to the movie going sheep out there. They always say they love a movie that someone else tells them they are suppose to love. Don't buy into that crap. Form your own opinion. It was just a very dull, poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed movie. In fact, The National Geographic Channel put out their own movie based on the same events and they are pretty comparable, The Nat Geo one may even be better, and I am sure they did it on a smaller budget. <br/><br/>I give it a 4. It was boring, lackluster, and disjointed at best. This movie isn't going to win any awards, and if it is ever even nominated it proves Hollywood doesn't even know it's own business anymore. Steal it off the internet or wait for it to come to DVD. Don't waste your money going to the theater for this turd."

","This was a well made thriller from Katheryn Bigelow who is one of the best directors in Hollywood. For some reason, this movie slipped through the cracks, and I totally forgot to watch it, but I finally put it on and I mostly enjoyed it. It was very tense, and the last 20 minutes were thrilling and brilliantly directed.<br/><br/>With that being said, my main problem with this movie is how it frames the plot. The real life story of the hunting and killing of Laden is a huge story with a lot of moving pieces, but this movie decides to put the entire weight of the story on one character call Maya. Framing the plot this way wouldn't be a problem if Maya wasn't such an empty character. Where is she from? Does she has any family? What motivates her? What emotional effect does these events have on her? What's the stakes for her? None of these questions are answered, which makes her an extremely uninteresting main character. Katheryn Bigelow centers this entire movie around one character, but she absolutely fails to explore that character anywhere beyond a surface level. This movie is good for what it is, but it just doesn't have the impact it was going for."

","(I have added a spoiler alert for those who have yet to see the film and do not know anything about what happened from the news at the time!) Well I have finally seen this on DVD and was a little disappointed actually! The story lead in and characters were too sketchy; it clearly wasn't a drama documentary but seemed unwilling to commit at the human interest level either. The bizarre handling of the Doctor assassin seems to reinforce the impression of the contemporary news coverage - what were they doing re security????? And the stupidity of the chap driving around in the same distinctive white car and using the same mobile 'phone ditto. What would be really interesting is an analysis of whether it ought to have taken them that long to locate him - and did the CIA really lose interest and leave it to one keen agent and a few henchmen? The actual raid was well done though - in fact the SEALS developed their characters far more in the last 30mins than the others had in the previous couple of hours... Oh and John Barrowman's brief appearance was a bit distracting!"

","I think the the events showed in the movie were quite realistic and dosen't contain any major offensive material against Pakistan. But I was amazed that the professional producers and director made so much blunders while shooting and even did 60% of their work without research. The cities of Karachi, Islamaabad and Rawalpindi and their people, streets and other things shown were rediculas, and opposite to the facts. Even Amaricans and other westerns knows that all these cities are very modern and developed cities and so as the people compared to any developed country. If the director could make a little research he could have done much better. The movie shoot in Cahndigarh, India which I have personally seen and is not in any case similar to these Pakistani cities as it is a small suburban and underdeveloped city. The excent of people speaking ""so called"" urdu was not Pakistani excent. It was a clear Hindi. Embassy of USA is situated in an area of Islamabad where ordinary access is almost impossible but people shown easily accessing the embassy. Pakistanies speaking Arabic is totally rediculas as they speak Urdu, English and other regional languages.A civil policeman standing in ISI detention centre (a military spy agency) is the thinking of an out of mind researcher.

","Kathryn Bigelow is a phenomenal director, an incredible storyteller, and has become Hollywood's mouthpiece for all things dealing with the US's involvement with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her central characters are stoic, driven individuals heavily encumbered by the events and situations in which they are associated. Her attention to detail is totally unmatched by any other director of this genre. Whether she is focusing on the stress and tribulations of an EOD (explosive ordinance disposal) technician in 'The Hurt Locker' or an up and coming CIA agent in pursuit of Osama Bin Laden, Kathryn Bigelow has the uncanny ability to tell their story in an unbiased, unflinching, no holds barred directness that is a clear, precise, and exceptionally entertaining.<br/><br/>'Zero Dark Thirty' refers to the 0030 hrs local time commencement of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 assault on the Osama Bin Laden compound in Pakistan on 01 May 2011. However, the film's main focus is the fortitude and determination of a young CIA agent, Maya, who has dedicated her whole CIA career to the location and capture of Osama Bin Laden. Jessica Chastain (The Help) is remarkable as CIA agent Maya. Maya is a highly intelligent individual who was recruited by the CIA while she was still in high school; her entire 12 year CIA career has been totally dedicated to one single individual: Osama Bin Laden, in which she is the CIA's Subject Matter Expert (SME) for all things associated with Bin Laden. Basically after 129 days of monitoring with absolutely no confirmation or concrete evidence to corroborate, its agent's Maya conviction that Osama Bin Laden is indeed situated on the Pakistan compound which actually 'green lights' the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 insertion/mission. <br/><br/>This is a brilliant film in which I highly recommend seeing. Kathryn Bigelow is an astonishing director, and was definitely robbed with her snub from the Academy of Arts and Motion Pictures by failing to secure a Best Director nomination for this film. Furthermore, all the bad press aimed at this film with regards to Director Bigelow's decision to include detainee torture sequences in this film is absolutely tenuous. The scenes were essential to the film's plot, and neither condoned nor glorified the actions taken to procure the desperately needed critical information. With a 157-minute running time, this film is a highly intensified, magnificently orchestrated, fantastically conceptualized, a masterpiece of celluloid genius, and a firsthand look of what it really takes to successfully fight (and win) the war on terrorism. Kathryn Bigelow cannot be lauded enough.<br/><br/>See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris REEL"""

","Firstly I have to say that I believe that Bob Dobson's one star rating of this film (that for some reason ,at the time of writing, occupies top spot in terms of reviews) may be based on (to paraphrase a moron) ""the classic dim witted American ""misogynist with a chip on his shoulder"" view of life!""This idiot can't even reconcile the fact that some western translations of the guy's name call him Usama rather than Osama.I'm guessing if Fox News doesn't verify it for him he doesn't understand it.Honestly, check his review, he simply can't comprehend why they call him UBL in the film and simply doesn't possess the curiosity or more likely intellect to even investigate further via the dark and mysterious portal into what us Liberal's like to call ""knowledge"" that is Google!<br/><br/>Putting my initial rant aside, I found this to be an intelligent and understated portrayal of a subject that could so easily have been handled in a crass and jingoistic manner by a lesser director. God know's I've seen enough adverts for film's loosely based on the same material, all of them seeming to resemble ""Call Of D..."" sorry I mean ""Act Of Valor"" type Gung Ho fest's designed to make the cerebrally challenged amongst us whoop and holler as the bullets reign down and the eyelids droop.<br/><br/>As an historic document of what probably happened this film is surely a triumph.It doesn't tackle the reasons that 9/11 happened in the first place( Come on Americans do you think people would do that without you REALLY pissing them off first?) but then it was never meant to.At least it was honest about what very likely happened in the aftermath (P.S.

No part of this movie is made to be accurate and this movie is the worst insult to NAVY Seals and the rest of US military. But this is not why I chose to call this movie a snuff film. I would accept this movie as a fictional story. The most insulting thing is that the directors chose to play Real Sept 11, 2001 911 calls from the Twin Tower victims to add suspense to the movie. I think this is completely unacceptable. It is an insult to the victims and their surviving families. And in general terms, showing something like that is considered to be a snuff film.

First and foremost, it leaves the viewer with the erroneous impression that torture helped the CIA find bin Laden's hiding place in Pakistan. Secondarily, it ignores both the illegality and immorality of using torture as an interrogation tool. Torture is illegal in all circumstances. The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a treaty the United States ratified which makes it part of U.S. law, states unequivocally: ""No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.""

You really get impressed by the work of the FBI, the intelligence officers and the special troops. Mrs Bigelow has elaborately shown the step by step process of hunting down Bin Laden and it constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. It also showed me once again the treachery of those Muslim terrorists, to whom nothing is holy: no honor, no humanity, no loyalty, no positivism. They are the Nazi's of our days and vigorously have to be dealt with. Why this movie, despite all of this, gets sharp criticism by some weirdos is a puzzle to me, but I gather these are the kind of people that only can grow by kicking down and spitting on others who really do have potential (a behavior the Nazi's were also good at, by the way).

Let me count the ways.<br/><br/>It's a stupid movie, and the story is bogus, phony, and ludicrously told.<br/><br/>It's doubtful that one 30 year old, attractive woman was almost solely responsible for finding Bin Laden. This version of the ""truth"" is an insult to those people who really did the work and made the sacrifices to accomplish this extraordinary mission. <br/><br/>The soldiers who went on this mission did not walk away from a game of horseshoes, hop on some helicopters and fly off to their mission. They trained extensively for this mission. That truth was lost in this story telling.<br/><br/>It's nice to see an attractive woman, but this movie poses our heroine in a tight t-shirt and tight jeans, standing in interesting stances and acting unpleasantly. I'll buy that if you want to make this a ""Rocky"" fiction movie, but don't try to sell it as a true story. That's bad stuff.<br/><br/>The movie moves too sloooooooooow. The scene of the hanger doors opening to reveal the helicopters is deliberately slow for effect, but the real effect is, ""Okay, we get it, the door is opening."" The whole movie is a story told in slow motion.<br/><br/>As many of the other reviews say, it's an amazement that this movie got good reviews from anyone. Money and pictures of someone must have been involved. It does not deserve anything close to a good rating.<br/><br/>The attack scene is the best part, and is well done. The movie should have been about the truth and not about showing off a fictitious sexy woman whose power comes from her ability to use the ""f"" word with her superiors."

","I feel like people are going into this film with the wrong expectations. I'm not sure what most people went in expecting but I got pretty much what I thought maybe a little less. Not as powerful, emotionally resonant or captivating as Hurt Locker Kathryn Bigelow's controversial follow up to that film is still a throughly engaging, edge of your seat dramatic thriller. One that realistically for the most part tells the stories of the brave women and men involved in the hunt and assassination of the terrorist known as Osama Bin Laden. The film chronicles and centers on the exploits of a woman named Myra who id hired to lead the search. What follows as we all know are many the pitfalls and fake outs that happened over the years eventually leading up to the event. What we do see an an addition to that is a look on the inside of the investigation. The anxiety ridden events, the tragedies, the friendships, the assassination attempts, the vendettas and although the film doesn't fully work as a procedural because there doesn't seem to be enough detail or as a character piece because it doesn't seem to want to go to those depths it does work as a smart, adult piece of grade a entertainment. Jessica Chastain tackles her role of Myra with a fiery, school girl enthusiasm I can imagine such a person filling that role and the supporting roles fill out nicely as well. I'm sure many things were added to dramatize many of the events and you can feel the Hollywood anchor throughout but the film still carries a subtle power to it and even though you know what the culmination of the events will be you still feel like you don't know how they will enfold. And that is the stamp of some truly intricate film making. 4/5"

To call the directing of Ms. Chastain ""ham-fisted"" would be a compliment.

Except for the 30 minutes of torture porn that opens the film and the compound raid at the end (which I'm sure most of the movie-going public sat through the movie for) the action is a badly done procedural featuring Maya's repeated bumping against the CIA's glass ceiling.<br/><br/>The tears she sheds in the closing shot might well be for her empty life or they could be in relief at finally achieving her myopic goal. But my bet is that the actress' true motivation was that this nightmare of a movie was finally over."
"S_Craig_Zahler","5","7","13","2 February 2013"," Mediocre. And Chastain's praise is for the role, not her crummy performance.
","Zero Dark Thirty is dull and plays out like a very long TV cop procedural. In an attempt to remain sort of removed from the incendiary topic, we get a bland, emotionally detached movie.<br/><br/>Chastain is bad. This is pure soap opera acting and sometimes way worse--- like TV anchorwoman kind of stuff. Her deliveries of some lines of dialog (""don't go outside"") are incredibly stiff and just seem like (bad) audition material. The scenes of confrontation with her and her bosses are incredibly uncontrolled (read: sitcom overacting) and forced. She's just terrible. The fact that people think she's good in this shows that people have no idea what good acting is at all. It is clear that she is being awarded because the role is a ""strong"" role about a determined woman, though what we see on the screen is an unconvincing and teary-eyed eighties sitcom performance.<br/><br/>Jason Clarke is pretty good and has some charisma, as does Chris Pratt. The scenes with them don't seem like they are scenes starring actors who are trying way too hard to be something they are not.<br/><br/>The script is mediocre at best. Instead of any scenes that show us anything about these people or their world it's all procedure. Instead of witnessing Chastain's lack of a social life, we get one scene of her drinking a soda, and have several characters tell us about her lack of a social life. Instead of witnessing her fatigue (which isn't in her performance), her friends tell us she's tired. Instead of seeing Jason Clarke grow weary of his job as a torturer, we are told that he has grown weary of his job as a torturer.<br/><br/>Bigelow should get a new writer, cause this one isn't good, and in the end, we land with the exact same exact point of The Hurt Locker--- that ""the people of war"" aren't comfortable outside of their missions. And even the mission is cluttered in terms of her direction--- too many cuts and too many point of views.<br/><br/>A really dull and dramatically uninteresting telling of a powerful story."

For that is exactly what I did NOT see.<br/><br/>The novelty of rush to production was beyond evident here. At the risk of dredging up a very bad moment in history, this reminded me of 9/11 in reverse. Instead of watching a suspense thriller (after all, this is the movies and a certain amount of acceptance towards suspension of disbelief has to be, well, accepted), I felt like I was watching a slow destruction of history, in backwards deconstruction. I could not decide if I should get behind the characters and this so called ""arc"" (I did say run for the hills when you hear that word), or the historical unveiling of events, or just the spectacle. <br/><br/>When the movie ended, I was unable to get behind any of these. <br/><br/>Let's make it simple. Disgruntled employee rises above. Hang hat on premise for 2/3rds of the story. Sorry, worn out premise that fell on its face here.<br/><br/>A good script and good story telling backed by solid characters makes for good flicks. This had none of them. If it had been told in documentary form, it might have stood a chance. That this thing was up for best film of the year is a testament to the fickleness of human nature to back the wrong horse because it might have had an interesting pedigree. In this case, the pedigree was a historical event. This horse needs to be given over to the humane society and delivered to a nice family with a pasture, which is where it should be retired to. <br/><br/>PS, because extra additions are now part of a film's experience (DVD), I must add... when the materials focus on things like ""being proud of"" or ""strove for accuracy"" or such things... run for more hills. I find films that are worthy stand on their own with great writing, great stories, great direction, essentially greatness which none of this had. The most memorable take-away of watching this is when one remembers the phrase ""they are taking themselves way too seriously"". When the work stands, little needs to be said.

I saw Argo at about the same time as this movie & comparisons are bound to be made. Both directors were snubbed in their category by the Academy but Argo was their favorite choice for Best Picture. Argo looks like an afternoon TV special in contrast to Zero Dark 30. Placed in the 70's Argo still comes across as a liberal Hollywood mishmash (Charlie Wilson's War?)

I think she only got this gig because of it. Whilst everything was directed competently, she has a habit of signalling when something is going to happen.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERTS When the friendly source comes to the base it is obvious something is going to happen beyond what was hoped by the intelligence people.<br/><br/>Or when our heroine is filmed leaving her apartment and exchanging pleasantries with her security guard, you knew something was going to happen, otherwise why are we seeing such detail? <br/><br/>That said, there was one scene that took me by surprise, but maybe that was because I didn't recall the Marriott 2008 bombing.<br/><br/>Overall I found it too long and too unclear. The only people I felt any concern for were the Canaries, and we all know they survived anyway.<br/><br/>What have we learnt from this film? That it took one woman's tenacity to track down OBL.

A pushto speaking seal member repeatedly warns curious neighbours on mega phone, they keep ignoring him but the moment he speaks in English they stop dead in their tracks.

No mentions of the hundreds of bounty hunters on the hunt for OBL in Pakistan and afghanistan. The most famous of whom got exposed a few weaks befoe the OBL raid and resulted in CIA-ISI stand off... among other such incidents. No mention of the polio campaign doctor who gave positive OBL ID to CIA. <br/><br/>The movie also unintelligently makes CIA look like a bunch of fools, who would do not have the capability or will to capture/ kill OBL without the undying persuasive efforts of the god-send poker-faced agent Maya. You would think that a CIA top dog is capable of doing better than e.g. naively suggesting mounting cameras on trees near the compound..or asking the main agent on case questions like 'how long have u been with CIA...what have u done for us'.<br/><br/>The movie is a failure on so many grounds, it is clear it was meant for the cheering US crowds happy to see the terrorists humiliated and 9/11 vindicated."

","This entire movie reminds me of Michael Douglas's character ""Dfens"" in ""Falling Down"", the scene where he is stunned to ask ""I'm the bad guy?"" This is a very political movie, so by definition, this has to be a very political review. I initially gave this film a 3, because there were some productions values and it was thought provoking, but upon reflection, it is thought provoking in a negative way. As you know Islamic extremists have launched a number of attacks on Western civilians. In response, the government created a ""war on terror"" to find and murder the people responsible. The Bush Adminisration was ineffective probably because it worked to their benefit and allowed them to pursue 2 wars and destroy American's civil liberties. But there was no discussion of that. There was no discussion of why the Islamists are attacking the west. Is it because of our economic polices that were hurting them? Was it because of their religious beliefs? This movie does not even attempt to address these issues or many others. There are extreme depictions of torture, but no comment on the fact that torture does not work. In fact, in this investigation, all of the torture (and there was a lot of it) produced very little good information.<br/><br/>What we have is a pro-government, rah-rah movie. If it wasn't pro-government, it would have been rated NC-17, largely banned. Two people making love can't be seen, but torturing a Muslim, well take the kiddies. The problem is the final result was it shows our government as being the ""bad guys"". Just because the Islamists are evil, does that mean that its OK for us to be evil? Again, the movie does not care about that ethical issue. All that matters is that ""we"" win. Rah!<br/><br/>I only went to see it because of the hype. Oscars? Eww, that would diminish the Oscars, as well as our nation. On top of that it wasn't even a good movie. I came out of Les Miserable uplifted, Zero Dark 30, made me depressed and disgusted. Yes fighting terrorists is nasty business, but we should at least acknowledge that we have sunk so low as a result of their tactics. There was no mention of that."

"griffolyon12","10","15","34","12 January 2013"," Amazingly Lived Up to the Critical Hype
","Zero Dark Thirty is the story of how the CIA found Osama Bin Laden, and yes it is one of the better films made in 2012. The film follows a young CIA analyst named Maya, portrayed with fierce determination by Jessica Chastain. Maya is the only analyst who chases a lead that most of her superiors feel will go nowhere, and it's her unwillingness to give up on that lead and not succumbing to her human emotions that allows her to uncover Bin Laden's hideout. <br/><br/>How much of this film is true, we'll probably never know unless the government declassifies it someday, but as a film it works as a powerful, taut thriller and a modern history lesson. The film opens by smartly never showing any footage of 9/11, but just leaves the screen black for nearly two minutes, just playing overlapping phone calls and news reports from that horrific day. In this day and age of whiz-bang movie-making, that took guts on behalf of director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal. Then, there is the Seal Team 6 night raid on Bin Laden's compound. Bigelow makes it tense and eerie through the night vision point-of-view shots, but most importantly, it feels real, as the events play out in real-time and nothing is ever over-dramatized for Hollywood. However, even though Seal Team 6 performed the job, it was Maya and her intelligence that led to that moment. <br/><br/>We are never given much backstory on Maya, all we know is that Maya is young, has only been in the CIA for 12 years, having been recruited straight out of high school, and that she is darn good at what she does. She does not have time for friends or relationships and for the past 10 years, Bin Laden was her life. She is dedicated. Even though she is affected by seeing a man tortured, she maintains a fiery exterior to get to the information she needs. Possibly the best moment for Chastain as Maya comes when she is sitting in the plane after Bin Laden has been killed, she's asked where she wants to go and she does not answer, just succumbing to tears. Her emotions finally take her over. At this moment, there is this look that Chastain has, of a person who does not truly know who they are and where to call home. It's the most powerful moment of the film, and easily a scene that will linger in many Oscar voter's memories.<br/><br/>I give Zero Dark Thirty a 10 out of 10!"

","What I Thought: What a dull movie. I'm sorry, but this was really dragged out to fill a huge 2 hours 30 minutes that it just didn't need to. The plot is simple, the twin towers came down and they go look for Bin Laden. Along the way there is some torture of prisoners (of course without the full knowledge of the government.yeah right!) and small snippets of information are eventually gathered together by Maya played by Jessica Chastain, and it finally reveals the location of a stronghold in Pakistan where they believe Bin Laden is living. Cue Navy Seal Team 6.<br/><br/>The film played out like an extended edition of Homeland (which I no longer watch owing to Claire Danes incessant snivelling) and I fail to see what the big deal about this film among critics is. Yes it's nicely shot, reasonably well-directed, and I suppose the Americans will like this much better because of the back story, but it is nowhere as good as The Hurt Locker, that at least had some things happening throughout. I just found Zero Dark Thirty a dull plod along paced film and the hype about it just isn't warranted in my opinion.<br/><br/>Conclusions: Dull, one paced, Jessica Chastain is about as convincing as a CIA interrogator as my grannie would be and I think it has only got on the list Best Picture list to pad it out. Bigelow needs to move away from the war thing now, it's getting very tired. This didn't entertain me."

Again this is not new, we all know that during the 60s, CIA cooperated with many dictatorships in South America (Chile, Brazil Argentina, etc) by teaching different methods of torture.

"theredraylives","6","10","21","26 January 2013"," Intriguing, but lifeless
","When the Oscar nominations were announced, many felt that the exclusion of Kathryn Bigelow, Academy Award-winning director of The Hurt Locker, was a particularly large snub. Having now seen Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow being nominated would have been a pretty drastic misstep on the part of the Academy. While it certainly isn't a bad film, Zero Dark Thirty isn't necessarily a great one either, which is a disappointment from this director coming off of an incredible job on The Hurt Locker. The fact that the film is topping many ""best of 2012"" lists is equally baffling. Despite the even pacing, some great production design, and a phenomenal performance by Jessica Chastain, ""the greatest manhunt in history"" ends up being little more than a whimper when it should really, really be a bang.<br/><br/>Starring as CIA agent Maya, Jessica Chastain absolutely commands on-screen, leading the manhunt to capture public enemy # 1, Osama bin Laden, beginning in 2003 up to his eventual capture and killing in 2011. Make no mistake, despite some really interesting casting choices (wonderful to see Mark Duplass in a supporting role), this movie belongs 100% to Chastain. She owns every second of screen time that she gets in this film, her performance quiet, strong, and dedicated, her mind set ultimately on one goal: finding bin Laden. Her performance is subdued and restrained outside of the few moments that it need not be, and in all of them she shines.<br/><br/>Sadly, however, Chastain's performance is the only thing about Zero Dark Thirty that is subdued. Based on true events, far too many elements of the film seem to be just a touch too dramatized, to the point where they become detrimental to the film. The multiple torture sequences become difficult to watch after a time, and too many scenes of following and tracking and analyzing seem to go on for a bit too long. Perhaps this was Bigelow's intention, to infuse the audience with the same kind of despair and hopelessness that Maya had felt about the mission to find bin Laden, and to express that it was about much more than the final action-packed raid on the compound. This is lost in the translation, however, and despite the film's even pace, it really just seemed to... keep going on and on. Don't mistake this, however, for a cry for more action- the film doesn't have much, and doesn't need or want for more. It is the failure on Bigelow's part to keep the interest, the tension, and the intrigue going through the runtime that is, ultimately, the film's weakest point.<br/><br/>This film did not need to be 2-1/2 hours long, and it feels like it's every bit that long and then some. It wasn't exciting, thrilling, or engaging; it is stuffy, over-long, bureaucratic, and boring. It was all very interesting to watch, of course, and it has glimmers of greatness within it, but too much of the film is spent watching characters stand around, look around, or wander around. Again, this could've been intentional, but if it was, it begs the question: ""Why?"" The film is so well-shot, its production design, sets, costumes, and atmosphere so masterfully realized, that it is criminal that this environment doesn't yield anything that, in the end, is really worth watching. The nuts and bolts of the hunt for bin Laden are so complex and wide-sweeping and Bigelow does a good job of exploring this macrocosm in detail. Why isn't it more interesting to actually watch it? In this light, it isn't difficult to see why Kathryn Bigelow wasn't nominated. The bigger mystery for Oscar devotees might be how on Earth this film was nominated for best picture in the first place because it certainly isn't, and it more than certainly shouldn't win. Outside of Maya, all of its characters exist only on the periphery of her mission to find bin Laden; the audience learns nothing about any of them, and most of them are flat and one-dimensional. Living, breathing characters drive the narrative of any good story, and this film suffers for lack of them. Having directed The Hurt Locker, Bigelow and screenwriter/producer Mark Boal are no stranger to this, so it is all the more surprising to see them fall so drastically short. Maya, as she is written, isn't a very compelling character either- it is Chastain's effortless performance that elevates her to something more, but without her it'd be hard to find anything very redeemable about the film at all.<br/><br/>In spite of all of this, however, the film is not a bad film, and is certainly not a poorly made film. Rather, it just seems that Bigelow chose an odd direction to tell her story, and it just isn't very entertaining to watch. Its marketing is strangely telling of the misshapen structure of the narrative; few trailers for films are so off-putting and boring as is the feature trailer for Zero Dark Thirty. It doesn't even look like a film someone would want to go see. Everything rests on the premise that this film depicts the capture and death of Osama bin Laden, but it lacks any sort of substance, tension, or depth. When the audience already knows the ending, the purpose of the film then should be to make the journey to that destination something engaging and intriguing- Zero Dark Thirty, however, seems to be looking at its watch, wondering when it will ever get around to it.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to other reviews!"

"bdgill12","10","23","58","6 January 2013"," Pretty Much a Masterpiece with the Best Performance of the Year
","NOTE: I do not care about the historical accuracy of this film nor the  supposed stance it takes on torture. It's a movie and its job is to  tell A story, not necessarily THE story. Bear that in mind.   Making a movie about the tracking and killing of Osama bin Laden could  have been a rather easy endeavor. Just about anyone could have made  that movie and turned it into a blockbuster sort of film that would  have brought people to the theater even if the quality was low. Turning  that movie into an award-winning, dramatic spectacle, though, was quite  a tall order. When virtually the entire audience knows the ins and outs  of your story right on up to its conclusion, it can be very difficult  to create drama and intrigue that doesn't seem false. Katheryn  Bigelow's ability to do just that takes Zero Dark Thirty over the top  and propels it into the discussion for best of the year.   Zero Dark Thirty begins two years after the bombing of the World Trade  Center with the brutal torture of an al-Qaeda prisoner at the hands of  CIA interrogation expert Dan (Jason Clarke) and a young special agent  named Maya (Jessica Chastain). The information gathered through the  interrogation leads Maya on an eight year quest with only one goal in  mind: the location and apprehension, by whatever means necessary, of  Osama bin Laden. This process proves more difficult than finding the  proverbial needle in a haystack and costs Maya a great deal throughout  her time on the case but the effort is finally justified on May 2, 2011  when SEAL Team 6 is sent in to take down America's number one  adversary.  Zero Dark Thirty opens with a black screen backed by a 911 call from  the World Trade Center on 9/11, a choice that sets the tone for what is  to follow in no uncertain terms. To call this movie ""intense"" would  require a new definition for the word. It's more like ""mega-intense"" or  ""my- blood-pressure-will-never-recover-intense."" Bigelow throws the  audience into the torture sequence that made me squirm not for its  gratuitous depiction but for its realism. The man being interrogated is  BROKEN and that hits home fast and hard. From there, the pace slows at  times but the tense urgency of that opening scene never wanes, leaving  you on the edge of your seat even when there's virtually nothing  happening. And if you do make the mistake of putting your guard down,  Bigelow is quick to comeback with an action sequence that reminds you  of this film's stakes. Perhaps the finest moment is in the final scene  in which SEAL Team 6 invade bin Laden's compound. The sequence takes  over 27 minutes to unfold and even though I knew exactly what was going  to happen, Bigelow still drove the moment home with a quiet yet furious  injection of natural adrenaline that kept my pulse up throughout.   What really sets Zero Dark Thirty apart, however, is the performance of  its lead. I don't know who discovered Jessica Chastain and gave her the  big break she needed but that person should be given a large sum of  money and some sort of medal. To think that Chastain could go from  completely unknown to the woman who gave the year's best performance  (which is what I would call this portrayal) in less than 18 months is a  true Hollywood success story if ever there was one. Maya is an awesome  and complex character to begin with (a credit to Bigelow and  screenwriter Mark Boal) but Chastain takes that character and runs with  it, creating a persona that serves as the driving force behind the  entire movie. Chastain shows Maya to be a brash, single-minded  personality and in the wrong hands the character could have EASILY  become abrasive and obnoxious. Instead, Maya is truly dynamic and begs  to be embraced by the audience.   It goes much further than this, though; it isn't enough for Maya to be  strong and likable. Bigelow puts the entire film on the shoulders of  Maya and Chastain by making her the in-movie representation of the  audience and moreover, the American people. Chastain is our window into  the hunt for bin Laden and the emotions that she goes through are, I  believe, symbolic of the ones the audience has gone through over the  last decade. Zero Dark Thirty is built with remarkably strong beams in  the form of terrific writing, an engrossing and familiar story, and  outstanding supporting work from a strong cast of actors (most  particularly Jason Clarke who should receive award attention for his  role), not to mention a host of technical attributes that serve to  heighten the experience. But Chastain is the load-bearing beam of the  film and even a great performance might have left the film wanting.  Well, it isn't great but instead a powerhouse portrayal that  reverberates with far more emotion than I expected to find going in.  The relief that Chastain exhibits in the closing moments washes over  the audience in a way that can only be described as surreal and, for  me, it is this final shot that solidifies Chastain's performance as the  best of the year and Zero Dark Thirty as one of the more iconic films  of the last decade."
"saytosandeep","8","6","11","18 January 2014"," MY REVIEW: The Hunt Worth Finding!!
","Zero Dark Thirty. Not sure why it is titled that but anyway it is the chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and his death at the hands of the American military in May 2011. From the word go, the movie takes you to the hunt, importance and desperation of it. Here the lead character Maya played by terrific Jessica Chastain fights fire with ice but in few scenes her outburst gives you the goosebumps in this thrilling chase. In last hour or so where they believe that they have located their man, movie converts into the one of the most thrilling and realistic missions showcased on celluloid. On the flip side, I kept waiting for some back story of Maya to know why she is like that. Even though I felt that they just got lucky in finding Osama Bin Laden and some sequences were over simplified, there is no denying because of this movie I was able to experience the most important man-hunt of recent times. Don't miss it!!"

There's also ZERO proof that he had anything to do with the attacks of 9/11 and some Washington people even say that he was involved with the 1993 WTC bombing, which he had nothing to do with, though the FBI most certainly did and even the NYT reported this.

"badajoz-1","1","8","16","2 February 2015"," Boring procedural overtaken by events
","You have all heard of a police procedural, well, this is a CIA procedural, until the killing of Osama bin Laden just before release meant the film finishes on a high of US Seals celebrating executing an old man as if they had won the Super Bowl! Presumably it was meant to end on a real low note of the heroine working for 11 years to find bin Laden, but not succeeding! I started watching with anticipation. So immediate scenes of US callously torturing countless Arabs ( all excused by the need for revenge for 9/11 - 2,000 - how many innocent killed at Hiroshima?), before heroine (with permanent pained and liberal disapproving look played by Jessica Chastain) introduces a little more subtlety. Don't bother trying to catch the inaudible dialogue, it is pure mumblecore and irrelevant - US filmmakers believe you do not want to know or care about the identity of the various Arabs being tortured. This is a procedural and it boringly drifts along with subtitles showing the different locations (more important than the Arabic characters?) where the various torturing takes place.<br/><br/>Frankly I gave up after 40 minutes and turned to a tenth repeat of 'Foyle's War!' I then watched the end - or should that be two ends? The proper one finishes with a downbeat assessment of 11 years of faithful, hangdog failure, and your career is safe as a minor operative. Then suddenly we are in Afghanistan/Pakistan watching a fully togged, lit up Navy SEAL unit helicoptering in to kill and then steal the body of bin Laden. And guess who gets to visually identify the corpse? Yes, our heroine, the minor operative. Crass and at odds with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>This is really a dramatized documentary for TV. Clichés crowd in from the director and scriptwriter, as well as twitching facials from Ms Chastain instead of acting still. It is a boring non-event except to an American audience, as the early torture criticism (?) is overwhelmed by the final section. To show how bad this film is. After bin Laden is dead, Ms Chastain leaves on an huge transport empty plane - ""You can go anywhere"" and the dreaded utterly predictable visual from Ms Bigelow comes - the huge ramp of the plane closes (Yes, closure for the heroine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Argh!!!!!!!!!!!!) Oscars for direction and screenplay - please!!!!"

Like the story or not, it told the dramatic story of the search for Osama Bin Laden - centering on the CIA female agent who stuck to the information and details. Leaving aside, again, all politically charged ideology, the search and finding of Bin Laden was an amazing feat in the face of deeply challenging opposition. <br/><br/>The movie itself captured the drama and the pain of the search in a powerful narrative. It is difficult to imagine a more realistic account - at the same time making a film in which everyone knew the ending - still come across as riveting and dramatic. <br/><br/>The last 30-40 minutes alone had both a realism and drama that I have never seen before in a film.

This idea didn't excite me as it usually does when I'm given an opportunity to argue with someone about the merits of a film. I asked myself 'why?' and immediately realized why when she began to talk about it. ""I didn't know that a women played such a major role in the whole thing.."" she said. ""Its interesting that someone like her was behind the whole thing pretty much..."". <br/><br/>I was about to begin to explain to her why the presence of a woman in that role was not meant to be taken literally, or perhaps it was, but thats not the point. <br/><br/>This movie is different for Bigelow in that it doesn't appear to have a clear message, to me at least. Her other films always portray the subject in such a near-perfect light. Strange days, The hurt locker, Point break, and K-19 all seem to give a fair presentation to both sides while staying decidedly in the realm of opposition to the main ideals and themes depicted. This ""opposition"" is exactly what draws a person like me to a Bigelow film. I could not find her stamp on the movie until the end. Thats the other thing, did i really spend that much time watching a buildup to an event so highly spoken of in our time? (in north America at least). I was awestruck by the amount of desperate justification of the US' methods of war, interrogation, and the like. Its almost as if she believed that this truly was a means to an end, that showing this would do anything but convince people that harsh interrogation works and that if you make the US mad, seal teams will come to your home and efficiently deal with you. Then i remember what my friend said, and i realize that most people will take every scene as truth, every action as an insight into the workings of the situation. Its our point of view and interpretation that points us on the path of understanding. <br/><br/>That being said, don't waste your time on this two hour bore-fest, this pro-American barfy justification of perseverance and 'righteousness'. the first truly poor film on Bigelows list without a doubt."

","What was that? Despite non-existent character development and a lack of story in both this and Hurt Locker, at least Hurt Locker was deserved of the Oscar for Director.<br/><br/>This was listless and sloppy. Dwelling was the word of the day. At almost three hours there was no perspective and depth to anything. Although Chastain was an amazing beauty to look at (and she gets four points just for that), I am at a loss for any sort of nomination. She was competent at being moody and pensive. And they had her wearing expensive pant suits and perfectly quaffed hair in the armpit of the world, year after year.<br/><br/>And then we launch into her being the ""hero"" in the last hour as she was the ""motherfucker"" who found her target. And the totally manufactured act of her writing the days on her boss' office wall. I can't imagine that anyone would stay employed anywhere doing that.<br/><br/>And I have a few questions:<br/><br/>Chastain said she was recruited by the CIA OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL? WHAT? <br/><br/>They get the courier's cel phone number. AND THEY CAN'T FIND HIM FOR MONTHS? Is it me or can't they triangulate a cel phone very easily? Maybe I've seen too many spy movies?<br/><br/>They finally find the courier in his white SUV. Then they let it go? THEN they find it again by placing men on the various roads?<br/><br/>And how long were the soldiers in that compound? Any longer and they should have brought an overnight bag.<br/><br/>Now her being a NeoCon. <br/><br/>First, the obvious defense of torture.<br/><br/>Second, the constant attention on Bin Laden throughout the years and the total absence of when Bush said ""I don't care about him.""<br/><br/>Third, the ironic scene where Chastain's boss said (in the middle of Obama's term) that he ""didn't care about Obama."" (Obama was the one who reignited the search.)<br/><br/>Fourth, they dwell on an Obama interview where he said ""we don't torture"". And then the CIA woman shaking her head.<br/><br/>Fifth, in the conference room we dwell on shots where W's photo is in the background IN THE MIDDLE OF OBAMA'S TERM!<br/><br/>It says it was based on personal accounts. Truthful personal accounts?<br/><br/>And Bigelow said to see it and decide. I did and call bullshit."

","The hunt for Osama bin Laden is told through a heart stopping, adrenaline filled tale that show's just what a genius film maker Kathryn Bigelow. The story follow's CIA operative Maya hunt to find Osama bin Laden. Following the plot through ten year's it show's just what a mammoth task the hunt for bin Laden was.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastian is brilliant as the CIA agent who is completely committed to the cause. It's harrowing performance that is certainly Oscar worthy. The supporting cast of Mark Strong, Kyle Chandler and Jason Clarke are all brilliant and show just how difficult personally the hunt was on them, with the screen time that they are given. All of the cast do this in such way without having any character development or back-story. Which is great to see. As with such films the flaw can be the back-story that as an audience we don't really care about. Bigelow get's straight to the point. That this is about the hunt for bin Laden and nothing more. <br/><br/>Controversy has surrounded Zero Dark Thirty about the way torture is depicted. Most namely that it is depicted in a positive way. This is certainly an stupid statement. That any one who has watched the film that I know completely disagreed with that statement. The film is certainly not saying that. From the get go you certainly know that it is not glamorizing at all torture. <br/><br/>This is high octane thriller that finishes off with some of the tensest last 20 minuets you will ever see. Considering you know the end of the story you are completely on the edge of you're seat all the way through the sequence leading to a great ending.<br/><br/>Written, shot and edited in a period of 18 months. This is filming making at it's best. From the start you are completely enthralled leading up to a completely satisfying end. Highly recommended."

","Sometimes the truth is ugly. Depending how you look at it: this is the story of how Americans tortured, spied, spent millions of taxpayer's dollars in the hunt of a very elusive Osama bin Laden. It's also about attaining closure, the tenacity and the courage that it took for a Navy Seal team to go on a hunch and risk their lives to capture the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks that affected every American since and the way we live today. The truth is never one sided and that's why Zero Dark Thirty is a great film. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Zero Dark Thirty was originally about the failed attempt to find bin Laden until the news about his death broke out in May 2011. What she did in such little time is short of incredible. Along with screenwriter Mark Boal, with whom she also co-wrote The Hurt Locker, had to go back to their drawing board and finish writing the eclectic finale. She managed to get us inside the compound in Pakistan where Bin Laden hid for a very long time and gave us a glimpse of the operative that almost never happened had it not been for Jessica Chastain's character Maya. Maya is based on a real CIA officer and her investigation leading up to bin Laden's location which took a decade to find. Fresh out of high school, Maya is sent to Pakistan to gather information from several prisoners that are being tortured to get leads to find bin Laden's location. The job is not easy. She is witness to how brutal are the means to get any information from these prisoners, borderline inhumane. Maya cringes at the sight of an informant drowning under a wet towel as gallons of water are poured over his mouth. Maya is clearly not comfortable with the methods, a look at her frightened expression is enough to place ourselves in her shoes. Still, she knows that this is the only way to get any information that will lead to capturing a murderer blamed for killing more than 3,000 people in the 9/11 attacks to the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The lead takes her team nowhere. Meanwhile we see attacks at the Marriot Hotel in Pakistan that kills 54 people while Maya and Jessica (Jennifer Ehle) are having a casual dinner. Maya barely survives another attack when she dodges bullets aimed at her car. Ultimately, her friend and fellow officer Jessica gets killed in a terrorist attack at Camp Chapman when a suicide bomber, claiming to be an informant, gets close enough and detonates, killing seven officers and injuring others. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain in Zero Dark Thirty Maya is sent back to the States for her own safety. However, she is determined that she's found the location to bin Laden's compound in Pakistan although there's no visual proof. Now it becomes her sole purpose to tantalize everybody and urge to send a team to hunt bin Laden down against political opposition. A very risky mission that pays off at the end. Zero Dark Thirty chronicles the operative of the Navy Seal team with such military precision that we feel as if we were wearing those night vision goggles. We become part of the operation and we get a clear idea of what it was like to get into bin Laden's compound. The following scenes are so nerve wrecking that you could almost hear a pin drop inside the movie theater. No history book or documentary is as detailed and truthful as Kathryn's account. She may get criticism for what she's accomplished with Zero Dark Thirty. The probably claim that she divulges too much information in such a secretive operation. I believe that we deserve the truth, as much as it may hurt. We deserve to know what happen to bin Laden. We needed closure and that's what we get with this film. On my part, Kathryn has gone where no other director, let alone a female director, has gone before."
"Ryan_MYeah","10","16","38","11 January 2013"," Kathryn Bigelow's stellar direction, Jessica Chastain's superb performance, and wonderful technical design = The best of 2012.
","It's been three years since Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to ever win a Best Director Oscar for 2009's much acclaimed The Hurt Locker. While I really liked that film, I was never a huge fan of it. I preferred Inglourious Basterds and Avatar, so sue me. So when it was announced that Zero Dark Thirty would be her follow up, I wasn't too excited... up until these last few months, where I was suddenly becoming hyped for it. Not only did it meet my expectations, it exceeded them. It's taken me almost a year of searching and about seventy movies to get to this point. Unless I find a movie from the very few I have left to see that overtakes this one, we're probably looking at the very best 2012 has to offer.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the decade spanning manhunt for Osama Bin Laden, the vicious mastermind behind the bombings of 9/11, and the leader of the Al Qaeda organization, until he finally met his end at the hands of SEAL Team Six on May 1st, 2011. In the middle of all that, the audience observes the procedural happenings from the view of the task force charged with finding him. One of which is Maya (Jessica Chastain), a dedicated but also obsessive CIA officer.<br/><br/>What I love about Zero Dark Thirty is that it fine tunes and perfects every stumble that The Hurt Locker suffered from. Screenwriter Mark Boal's episodic presentation is much more smooth and flowing, and is given more humanity than its predecessor. The movie not only holds our attention, it refuses to let go. It opens up fascinating views of morality, and it gives us a very interesting bunch of characters who never feel boring, all of which go well along with the looming suspense the film builds up.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of The Hurt Locker was Kathryn Bigelow's ability to build tension and unpredictability to any given individual moment, and here, she proves just as capable. A simple look over the shoulder, a sudden movement, and even a change in vocal pitch can do wonders in the way she directs her actors. She rallies together impressive actors like Joel Edgerton, Mark Strong, and Jennifer Ehle. Of every one of them, Jessica Chastain is the unquestionable queen of the castle. After a banner year in 2011, she delivers a stunning lead performance, tough and steely when need be, but also fragile and conflicted at other times to keep Maya from feeling one note, and make her a believable character. She commands every scene with a fiery intensity, but also adds in a charisma that wasn't called for, but was most welcome. I feel pretty confident in calling it the performance of the year.<br/><br/>As for Bigelow's crafts people, these guys all bring their A game, and they know well how to enhance the tension throughout. Whether it happen on the visual side, or even on the aural side; from the shaky and involving camera work by Greig Fraser, to the claustrophobic settings of Jeremy Hindle's production design, or from the startling booms and unsettling silence of Paul Ottosson's sound design, to the brooding pulse rhythms of Alexandre Desplat's musical score. Ultimately, the editing is the technical star. William Goldenberg, already having struck a home run with Argo this same exact year, is just as on the nose alongside Dylan Tichenor here. These two, as well as Bigelow, set the proper, but not always fast pace to this movie. It takes its time to set things up, but as a result, that entire final hour is a masterful example of film making. The raid on the compound, in particular, is a suspenseful sequence where every element comes together in the best way, where each moment had me biting my nails in anticipation. Bigelow's direction is brilliant. Recently, the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, but none of those belonged to Bigelow herself for her direction. For them to drop the ball like this is an embarrassment, and nothing short of the snub of the year.<br/><br/>As enthusiastic as I may be, not everyone will like this movie nearly as much, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't see why. Regardless of that fact, I'd still recommend this movie to anyone. Something as fascinating as this movie deserves to be seen at least once. I know I've given multiple movies this year my highest possible rating, but many of those films do have noticeable faults, and they'd be closer to 9.5 out of ten on a numerical scale. Zero Dark Thirty is the only 2012 movie to earn a well deserved perfect rating of 10/10 from me. Bring on the rewatches!<br/><br/>***** / *****"
"aequus314","10","12","27","21 January 2013"," What it wants, is for you to savour the poignancy of the hunt. Outstanding.
","Political controversies aside, Zero Dark Thirty is a thriller par excellence that grips you firmly and quietly by the neck. It is also the kind of film that demands focus from the outset. If you choose to give in--investing 157 minutes will pay off handsomely. <br/><br/>At the center of Kathryn Bigelow's ninth feature is the manhunt on Osama Bin Laden, and the world knows he is dead. The film title is military speak for half past midnight--Osama's alleged time of death. Popular misconceptions will have you believe that knowing how a story ends works against it; but this film operates outside political and social repertory. What it wants, is for you to savour the poignancy of the hunt.<br/><br/>Set two years after 9/11 attacks and told from a predator's (the US) perspective, it starts on the strength of CIA operative Dan (Jason Clarke). Stationed at a black site somewhere in Pakistan, he interrogates a detainee connected to Saudi terrorists using brazen techniques. At this point, you may be tempted to write the sequence off as propaganda by torture apologists, but don't be too quick--Dan is a red herring--a vehicle at best, for the sole intention of designing cause-effect to the outcome of Zero Dark Thirty's key narrative.<br/><br/>New agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) is assigned to the team and Dan guides her transition in this highly elusive, volatile world. Like a cold and calculating chess-master, Maya quickly learns how to exploit variables of the game. She thrives on psychological warfare required of interrogators, yet cranks to the right rhythm necessary to benefit from a politically oriented trade. Throughout the chain of events leading up to Osama's death; Maya is often photographed behind barriers, suggesting the distance necessary for her to guard against and self-protect.<br/><br/>This is when it occurred to me that something strange is happening to Bigelow as a director--she has emerged from The Hurt Locker with a style that is distinct, yet subtle. In the classical paradigm of historical-war films often infused with dramatic muscularity; Bigelow has forsaken traditional myths, and engineered a new kind of modern, masculine instinct.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is set in the thick of a chase spanning ten years, but it moves fluidly with unknowable force--driving you forward into a riveting climax executed with precision and realistic memesis.<br/><br/>Apart from a screenplay by Mark Boal that reveals masterful technique, film score by Alexandre Desplat (performed by London Symphony Orchestra) evokes the right emotional currents critical to this film. Its musical motifs parallel the aura surrounding Zero Dark Thirty's mysterious protagonist--melodies are sophisticated and stoic, with an undertone of sensuality.<br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"

","I found this movie riveting. I don't understand the negative reviews. I have read nearly all of them for insight. Although the torture scenes are difficult to watch, they are necessary to give the film perspective and emphasize the importance of the mission. The film does have a slow pace and it is not a pure action movie. If you are expecting Mission Impossible, then don't see it. Some of the characters probably could have been developed a little more, but Maya is the central character and is a tour de force. I think Jessica Chastain does an amazing job and her character is multi-dimensional. <br/><br/>The film could definitely be divided in two, much like other war movies, i.e. Full Metal Jacket. The first half establishes the mission and the difficulty in finding Osama Bin Laden's position. The second half is the mission. The depiction of the steps the Seals took to invade the compound kept me on the edge of my seat. I suspect that many of the people that gave this movie a negative review are either a) not American citizens or b) conspiracy theorists c) fans of being indifferent to movies received by critics. It is a great movie and I highly recommend it. I have watched Django Unchained, Life of Pi, and Flight recently which are all good, but I think this movie really stands out among this years elite."

","The torture aspect is a diversion. The fact is this film is nothing more than CIA propaganda of what they want you to believe happened to former CIA asset OBL. Many people around the world don't believe this fairy tale. The fact is the US govt has shown NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE they killed OBL in May 2011, no body, no video, no pictures, no independent DNA analysis, no independent autopsy, and the laughable burial at sea is fooling no one with a braincell or two. A cursory analysis of the videos that have appeared since end of 2001 have revealed telling evidence that the post 2002 OBL tapes were faked (different shaped head, using different hand to write, gold band, different ears, much younger than in 2001 etc).<br/><br/>Bin Laden was reported to be in poor health before he went silent on 14 December 2001. Back in 2000, even before 9-11, it was said he was suffering from Hepatitis C, and could only expect to live for only two more years, and that was back then. In year 2000, he ordered a mobile dialysis machine to be delivered to his base at Kandahar in Afghanistan. No dialysis machine was found at the compound were we are to believe he died.<br/><br/>Most Intel agencies said in 2002 he was dead, he had a funeral and obiturary on 15 Dec 2001, a high ranking Taliban and Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's president, confirmed the information.confirmed this. Former high ranking CIA insider and former assistant deputy secretary of state under 3 administrations, Dr Steve Pieczenik (see his videos) said the raid was a hoax and OBL died in 2001 of Marfan syndrome (which gave him only a few years to live after 9/11), and the govt has been using the myth of OBL to continue the war on terror. <br/><br/>Most of the residents living near the compound say the man living there WAS NOT OBL. Madeline Albright said in 2004 they had OBL on ice and were going to roll him out for the next election. Benezia Bhutto said he was long dead to before they murdered her. Just a cursory analysis of the video of the old man viewing videos of OBL show its not the real OBL (just compare the different shape of the ears in the video with 2001 real OBL photos. We are being sold a lie, just like we were with Iraqs alleged WMD."

But Bigelow and Chastain do just that.<br/><br/>Chastain, hard as nails, yet soft as silk, throughout, carries the movie with so much ease it's like she isn't actually acting. She is miraculous. But only because Bigelow affords her the space to breathe, the edit to breathe, the whole idea to breathe with such subtlety that it's almost as if there IS NO DIRECTOR.<br/><br/>Is this documentary or drama? There's been much made about the depiction of torture (especially water-boarding) in the first reel that it sounded to me like I was about to embark on a torture-porn outing. Believe none of that. This is no torture porn movie. The only porn is what inspired it. Yes, the beginning is uncomfortable, but it is considered, restrained and important in the storytelling.<br/><br/>For two hours this astonishing piece of film does next to nothing other than scratch away at the forensics of tracking down the most untrackable mass murderer in history before exploding into the dimmest lit, scariest half hour of action you'll see in any action movie. And you know the outcome. Weird.<br/><br/>It IS a documentary really.<br/><br/>Character development is minimal and storytelling is at best sketchy, off camera, challenging to the viewer (but that's what's so involving about it).<br/><br/>It's pin drop territory - I don't think I've ever heard such a quiet cinema audience. Popcorn eating would have incited a riot in our multiplex.<br/><br/>James Gandolfini makes his second cameo performance this year in an Oscar nominated movie (after Argo) and it shows that he is politically connected and wise of late career choice. Soon, perhaps, we'll see him in full-bodied, lead role political material.<br/><br/>Two hours in, the first bars of music creep into the soundtrack. The effect is electrifying. It almost immediately disappears before re-emerging in the credits. It's that kinda film where music seems unimaginable, yet Alexandre Despal's contribution is vital.<br/><br/>The final scene sees Chastain reflect on her achievement. Her tears were echoed by mine.<br/><br/>A monumental achievement in cinema."

At times it looked to me as if these guys had some kind of agenda over that subject. The soundtrack and sound edition isn't that good either. Pretty nice photography in my opinion though. It was nice to see the Army paraphernalia up close. The stealth helicopters are very neatly reproduced. I was expecting a better finale.

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is more of a blunt object than a work of art. It is riveting because of its subject matter, and not because of the direction by Kathryn Bigelow. This is a case of where a director and screenwriter (Mark Boal) fail to illuminate its subject matter. Since this film has almost universally positive reviews (93% fresh from Rottentomatoes.com critics) and I am recommending that people wait to see this film on DVD or video streaming, I'm writing a detailed explanation. <br/><br/>(Spoiler Alert) <br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" uses a documentary style (known as cinéma vérité) to demonstrate how one CIA analyst, Maya (portrayed by Jessica Chastain) obtained and analyzed information learned from aggressive interrogations, including torture (some of which she ordered), of Al Qaeda accused detainees to find Osama Bin Laden's most trusted courier that eventually led to Bin Laden's whereabouts and the mission to kill Bin Laden. Without torture, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" would have no hero. <br/><br/>Very little, if any, other information was depicted in this film to identify Bin Laden's courier other than from detainees, who yielded to questions out of fear of being tortured again. In fact, the only other CIA operative, who advocated differently -- that the Cold War technique of bribery to turn double agents (without torture) -- is shown to be brutally murdered for her naiveté by a car bomb. <br/><br/>Since Bigelow and Boal strongly advocate for Maya's story of how her obsession to find Bin Laden makes her the actual hero of the death of Bin Laden, the film is an unapologetic advocate for torture. My problem with the film is Bigelow and Boal's attempt to use the documentary style to push the audience to come to the conclusion that ""of course"" torture was required to get Bin Laden. <br/><br/>My preference for films that use a documentary style or cinéma vérité with no narrator is to NOT pretend it portrays the truth of a subject, but to pose the problem of the truth in the film (paraphrasing French philosopher Edgar Morin), allowing viewers to judge the actions of the hero -- anything else seems insecure. <br/><br/>My last substantive critique of the film is Bigelow's depiction of the actual mission to capture Bin Laden; it's far from a model of clarity. Bigelow depicts Seal Team Six as knowing precisely what it is doing, while not translating that clarity to film or to the audience. Bigelow purposely fails to lead the audience through which building each team is in and the objective of each part of Seal Team Six. <br/><br/>I would be extremely disappointed if this film wins any Academy Awards whatsoever."

","It's always going to be difficult to cover a subject matter such as this without either en-flaming prejudices or offending sensibilities, and regrettably this does neither. The story, while interesting due to it's historical background (although some details have been altered due to true to it's word ""dramatic licence"") Is an interesting story for study and analysis. But it's not really the stuff of blockbusters. The covert, well planned, long term, meticulous nature of the whole operation, pitted against the 'screen' frustration of a character depicting a real person, who no doubt is somewhat more professional in real life, is regrettably. Let down by poor scripting, lacklustre performances on all counts! and a poor execution of the subject material. If this had been portrayed as much as possible, and produced as much as possible as a documentary, fair play. But it's not....it's a movie, and not a very good one. You can't over dramatise a real sequence of events, as that would do dis-service to those who were really there (and there were some elements of that...but even they only warrant a ""huh""), but to try and avoid that whilst trying to entertain....not an easy trick to pull off. The other downer is 2hrs 30 some?... Some movies can be 2:46, or more, yet it feels like time has flown by........I felt I'd been stuck to this for a day and a half........ Could have been better....possibly by not having been made?

","The last nine years of the CIA's decade-long War on Terror manhunt for Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden following the 9/11 attacks on the United States is the specific focus of Oscar-winning duo director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal's often lumbering dramatic account of compelling factual events.<br/><br/>The film stars Jessica Chastain as CIA officer Maya, newly assigned from Washington to the Pakistan-based US intelligence team charged with the singular purpose of distilling the flow and fog of intel surrounding Al-Qaeda's enigmatic network towards bringing closure to a wounded nation and justice to the most wanted man in American history during that time.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is an oftentimes slow-moving, intellectually meticulous patchwork procedural drama sporadically punctuated by the grit of intense chase scenes and brutal violence. Yes, the torture of a detainee depicted shortly after the pitch black cacophony of audio from that horrific September day in 2001 is jarring and inhumane, and decisively sets the tone for what plays out during the next hundred-plus minutes. Remove the film's 9/11 hyperbole, however, and any horror flick worth its salt is far more violent than what's seen in this picture. For the most part, you merely witness the burdensome daily grunt work Maya experiences in doggedly constructing plausible evidence that may lead to tangible results under the collective din of her country's shattered emotions, panicked blood lust and the chill of cautious politics.<br/><br/>This is an investigative drama framed within the context of recent historical events, from 2003 until the assassination of Osama bin Laden by United States Navy SEALs on May 2, 2011, yet this fact-based film's closing credits actually do acknowledge events and characters were fictionalized or invented for the purposes of telling the story. Despite the innumerable populations of CIA personnel devoted to this manhunt worldwide, that a lone figure named Maya ultimately delivers the, uh, apocalypse to bin Laden's doorstep pretty much screams that aspects of Boal's screenplay are concocted Hollywood clichés enhanced by facts. And, that's fine. It never claims to be a documentary. It's entertainment. Barely.<br/><br/>Boal's screenplay isn't particularly overwhelming or crackling with memorable dialog, unfortunately. Given the subject matter and news that he and Bigelow were granted unprecedented access to relevant classified information, I expected much more from the script and characters. The film editing seems uneven as well, leaving you sitting through over-long shots of silent, empty moments that I guess are supposed to mean something to somebody, somewhere at some point. Maybe. Yes, I got that the burning aircraft near the end bookends the burning aircraft we all saw on 9/11. Sorry, it's too indulgently artsy to be necessary. And, while this feature showcases a wealth of wonderfully understated, believable performances, Chastain's starring efforts feel almost robotic and bland throughout.

Who knows,not this movie thats for sure. How do the key characters feel about the job they do and the torture they deem necessary to get the desired result, we don't know as the characters are about as deep as a puddle. The male CIA torturer who leaves when the political climate begins to change,makes a glib statement about seeing to many naked guys but I don't know if that was a reference to the fact he didn't enjoy torturing prisoners anymore or if he was coming to terms with his homo erotic desires.<br/><br/>Do not waste your hard earned money on this rubbish you already know how it ends"

","My first inclination watching this movie was to tell people to wait for it to come out on DVD or play on TV. But I did go ahead and write a full review so here goes...<br/><br/>If I would have left the theater in the first hour and then written this review, I would tell you to skip the movie. Seriously. For the first 50 minutes, take a cat nap. I literally did for about 5 minutes and didn't miss a thing. Save a couple of mild, yet still uncomfortable, torture....excuse me, ""information extraction"" scenes, the first almost hour of this movie is a snooze. We don't even get any character development until after that first hour. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie though reveals why that painfully slow build-up was beneficial. The movie does pick up but keep in mind that this movie will not be a flashy, violent thunderstorm. It's supposed allure is that it's a slow and steady, long (2 hrs 37 mins long to be exact) rain storm. The last hour was unexpectedly gripping (compared to the beginning at least) and you're left feeling satisfied, now understanding the pace and heaviness. If you believe the Osama Bin Laden (referred to as UBL for Usama Bin Laden) search and destroy story in the first place, it's a fascinating look at what really went into finding him. If you're skeptical, which I think is healthy, it's still an interesting look at what tactics our great U S of A uses and how terrorist cells often work. There are quite a few unrealistic elements about CIA operations thrown in though. Sometimes I found myself wondering, ""Really? THAT'S what they want us to believe the CIA would do?""<br/><br/>A little caveat for you, war itself is not pretty. But this isn't the bloody, front lines side of war (though there's quite a bit of blood in the final scenes). This is the CIA side of war, the counter- terrorism side (whom some may argue is ALSO terrorism, but I won't get into all of that). It's uncomfortable to watch a human being purposefully hurt or slowly physically destroyed, no matter for what reason, even though the scenes shown (all within the first hour) were VERY mild, IMO, compared to what's probably really going on in those concrete rooms. I used utilitarianism to justify it in my mind. But if the visual of the aforementioned will bother you, do not go see this movie. If you can get through that first hour, there's no more after that. The rest of the movie is pretty much the wild goose chase to find UBL. And again, I mean ""wild"" only figuratively because this is a subdued movie.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, be PATIENT with this one, do not expect a purely factual documentary, take on the heaviness and seriousness of the actors (particularly the lead actress Jessica Chastain, who did a great job conveying the weight of this world on her shoulders), and you will leave satisfied."

","First off, Jessica Chastain should not be in the running for the Oscar. Why not? Because she was stonefaced, poker-faced while walking and running around Afghanistan and CIA HQ in Langley, VA yelling, ""Please believe me. I located bin Laden."" In other words,Jessie seemed emotionless even when witnessing our waterboarding enhanced interrogation technique which shouldn't be considered torture. I sort of look at it as a way of cleaning the filthy pusses of the filthy RADICAL Muslims who were part of 9/11/01. In fact,waterboarding plus applying shock therapy to the genitalia would have gotten more info out of the scum. Oh by the way there was a scene in which a terrorist's panties were pulled down and Jessie is told to take a gander at his ""junk""-she did but remained poker- faced. The terrorist who was being interrogated however did NOT remain poker-faced.<br/><br/>I must say that to all those who thought Pres. Bush was lying about not approving ""torture"" and about not having CIA sites and prison camps in Europe,you're right.He lied but for the sake of the security of this nation and that's all that counted. Conversely a shot of Pres. Obama is seen-he is saying that torture must be outlawed. The man knows from nothing except vacations.<br/><br/>What impressed me was an answer to a question I had about the role of a woman in the finding of bin Laden. I thought Chastain's character was a concoction for one reason or the other. I was wrong. Indeed, a female CIA operative at Langley had been working on finding the monster ever since the attacks on us occurred. Naturally her real name will never be divulged but it's Maya in the film. All I know is that no one could ever be a misogynist after seeing what she accomplished on behalf of our beloved nation.<br/><br/>I took note of how much effort was applied not to hurt the feelings of, or rile up Muslims worldwide insofar as showing the actual assassination of bin Laden by a Seal Team Six member.I guess it followed suit regarding the non-disclosure of photos showing the torn apart Sheikh. Our guys barge into the room, a quick glimpse of a gray beard is seen, shots ring out and the camera pans down on a rather bloodied face which no viewer can identify as UBL.<br/><br/>Yep, Maya had been telling the frustrated CIA brass that if they got bin Laden's courier, they would get the big cheese. They listened and supposition became reality. Hard to believe that bin Laden was living in plain sight, less than a mile from the Pakistani Military Academy and all along we thought he was in a cave. I learned something valuable from the film. Both the military and government officials HAD to know he was in Abbattabad and we had been treating that country as a valuable ally. The man who ordered the murder of 3,000 Americans was being protected by an ""ally."" I'll call it a day because I feel like cursing up a storm but want to retain my IMDb account."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","7","14","18 January 2013"," Challenging and Gripping Depiction
","Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal's Zero Dark Thirty is a journalistic account (disclaimer: ""journalistic"" does not equal factually accurate) of the ten year search for Bin Laden and one woman's unparalleled determination to see him dead. The film is an absorbing look into the world of the CIA, a gripping action film, and a reflection of the United States's internal conflict over the methods employed by our intelligence agencies in the War on Terror.<br/><br/>The film opens with a black screen and confusing audio from September 11, 2001, but one conversation clearly emerges- a 911 call from the burning World Trade Center. The woman on the phone screams about the intense heat of the fire, but the most harrowing part of this segment was not the audio itself, but the silence that followed after it. <br/><br/>The movie continues with a CIA agent named Dan (Jason Clarke) torturing the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, the planner of 9/11. He is beaten, water boarded, and stuffed in a small wooden box. The film's main character Maya (Jessica Chastain) observes in horror, but eventually she seems to accept these methods as just another part of their information gathering process. At one point she tells the prisoner that he can help himself if he starts telling the truth. The CIA agents only begin to make progress when they treat the prisoner nicely, however, by offering him a meal. He then gives them the name of Bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed.<br/><br/>These scenes have earned the movie the title of the most controversial movie of the year. Opinions on this movie vary just as wildly as the national conversation on the issue of torture today. The controversy of these scenes comes from the movie's refusal to take an outright stance on torture. I don't want to get into this too deeply since many critics have already written excellent pieces on the subject. But this leads me to a question: Is it the director's responsibility to take a stand on issues like this, or is it better to let the audience decide? I can really understand both of these positions, but as someone who likes movies that force the audience to think about these controversial issues rather than spoon feeding them a message, I like Bigelow's approach. <br/><br/>From here, the film begins its second and longest act, a procedural drama about the painstaking search for Abu Ahmed and Maya's struggle for support in the CIA. Her executives and co-workers doubt her lead, but her persistence borders on obsession. Maya seemingly has no personal life or any other commitments- Bin Laden is on her mind 24/7. Chastain is tough as nails as a woman in a man's world. Her performance has been universally lauded, but the character herself has been a source of criticism as the film does not give us any insight into where her obsession with finding Bin Laden came from. However, I don't think the film needs to give her a motive. Maya feels the shame that America felt when Bin Laden practically disappeared from the national conversation only two years after 9/11- isn't that enough of a motive? <br/><br/>Finally, Maya tracks the courier down to a compound in Abottabad Pakistan, and the final act focuses on the Navy Seal mission that ended in the assassination of Bin Laden. We all know how Bin Laden was killed, but the third act of the film is riveting nonetheless. This is the most authentic (feeling) military mission I've seen in a movie since, well, The Hurt Locker, proving that Bigelow is still the master of military movies. Seal Team Six's raid on Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan is executed with remarkable efficiency despite a few setbacks (I don't want to spoil them for you). They kill Bin Laden and the people he was living with (including women) in a systematic fashion, almost like a doctor performing surgery, as we view the mission through the Seal's night vision goggles. <br/><br/>The movie does not question the ethics of invading a foreign country without authorization, but two scenes involving Pakistani witnesses to the mission demonstrated the downside of such decisions. I am not questioning the justification of the mission, but I wonder if Pakistanis will ever trust America. One scene involved crying children in the compound who just witnessed the deaths of their parents. The other scene involved the people from the surrounding homes approaching the compound to investigate. One of the soldiers speaks into a megaphone in Arabic and tells them to turn around, but they don't listen. The soldier tells his companion, Hakim, that if the Pakistanis don't turn around soon he will open fire, which motivates Hakim to yell in English that if they don't turn around they will be killed. You can bet they listened to that. Scenes like these will provoke discussion about the complexities of modern warfare.<br/><br/>With that, Zero Dark Thirty is a challenging, gripping film that does not give us easy answers. Perhaps it's because the United States hasn't come to any answers as a nation. I'm not sure where it would rank on my list of 2012 movies but it's definitely in the top ten."

","There's no doubt about it; this is flat out a well-constructed and a riveting procedural drama. I love the fact that it really is ambiguous and doesn't even try and send any sort of over-the-top political message. It also tackles the subject matter in a serious and proper way. Opening on a black screen and hearing a sample of 9/11 but seeing nothing is exactly the right way to start the film. Closing the way they did by not ""spiking the football"" or showing any American celebration was also the right move in my opinion. We all know the images from those two events. They are not needed. There's enough emotion to carry what was depicted as is. Jessica Chastain is amazing as the lead and now I understand her Oscar nomination. It's well deserved. The torture issue is clearly depicted for what it is and the viewer can make up their own mind about how effective it was and could be in the war on terror. The movie does a fine job of saying how things changed over the years but does so with a boots on the ground approach. Again, great choices and handled so very well.<br/><br/>A remarkable movie any way you cut it."

While there is some basis of fact at times, the omissions, lies and distortions are so plentiful that it really does a disservice to all involved. <br/><br/>Bigelow is a hack and after watching the over-rated piece of garbage 'Hurt Locker' I will never waste my time and money on any other movie she has anything to do with. <br/><br/>At times, the scenes are downright laughable. Again, one would have to know the real events and history to have a baseline for comparison so if you want to go in blissfully ignorant then you may like the movie. otherwise, stay away. <br/><br/>Oh, and if you did care to learn what happened and who was really responsible for finding UBL then read 2 books, Manhunt: The 10 year search for Bin Laden and The Black Banners: Inside Story of 9/11 and the War against al-Qaeda. <br/><br/>Now, if someone could make a good movie and tell the real facts THAT I'd watch."
"matutemats","6","14","34","12 January 2013"," Slow, propaganda but entertaining.
","Well, here's my review for Zero Dark Thirty:<br/><br/>The Bad: This movie has a main issue. It's too long. Almost 2 hours and a half is too much to bear if you don't watch it in two separate parts. This is increased by the fact that the first part is too slow and for some, harsh. The action packed part comes almost in the last hour. I can't say what because i'll be flagged for spoilers, but it is stupid to talk of spoilers when this movie is based on an well-known and widespread operation. So, if you understood me: THE operation is great. THE research is slow and boring. Get it? Although not a Michael Moore movie, it does contain some propaganda. Long story short: with Bush, you torture but you're effective. With Obama, you maintain human rights, but are not effective. Yet, this is an interesting question for the viewer. Which is most important?<br/><br/>The Good: That reflection I was talking about. The final action packed of the movie makes the whole of it. You are able to understand better a confusing operation, and answer some questions like: Why was OBL killed rather than taken to court?<br/><br/>Final Ruling: Try to watch the movie in to separate parts. Although an Academy Award Nominee, certainly not a movie that deserves the Oscar. You'll enjoy it, just, try not to give up with the slowness of the first part of the movie. 6 Stars is fair enough."

She is very ordinary, can be rude and abrupt but she is determined. <br/><br/>I would have expected the film to have described an extraordinarily bright character who we might admire and warm to, after all she succeeds in a male dominated world - the CIA and the Middle East?<br/><br/>The torture scenes are not gross, squalid or shocking. Not very real or nasty. They could have given great contrast to the safe office environments Maya and we are used to. <br/><br/>We see a few stupid things like a trusted Bin Laden courier who apparently exhibits good evasive trade-craft, but drives one vehicle all the time, a car that we are told is unusual for that area and so stands out and also has a reg plate where its first three letters are easily remembered, IDFIsraeli Defense Force?<br/><br/>A long seeked for enemy is driven across desert by a comrade to a US base where a CIA team wait to question him. Apparently if he and his car are searched at the perimeter they might spook him and they don't want to frighten him off. He's allowed through unchecked and they detonate the inevitable bomb in the car or on their person, killing some key CIA personnel. Why didn't the checkpoint search the car?!! The enemy had nowhere to run to even if they were spooked, the camp was in the middle of a desert and he relied on a walking stick! Would senior CIA operatives stand by the car to greet the arrivals or step well back and allow the US soldiers to search them? Just wrong. <br/><br/>The SEAL team infiltration is really exciting as their stealth helicopters fly low through the mountain terrain. We watch them very slowly infiltrate the compound which is great cinema but I couldn't help wondering if they really are this slow?<br/><br/>Most of the film though is slow and if done well could have created great tension as we approach the time for the raid but really this part of the film doesn't do that.

Emotions were high in THL, it was tense, thrilling and there were pulsating moments that captured beautifully the role of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team. Much of this had been shown before but Bigelow was able to unlock the human element and add much more emotion. ZDT fails to do this, resulting in a rushed documentary-like picture where no bond between audience and character is formed; where no dialogue is gripping; and where no part of the story is full of suspense or thrilling.<br/><br/>Much thought was put into, and much will be spoken about, the torture portrayed in ZDT. This was ZDT's unique selling point and indeed is, politically or otherwise, thought-provoking.<br/><br/>In today's modern world, I ask myself whether the media does a good enough job in documenting real life events; whether it is the rise and fall of Osama bib Laden or the Tsunami of 2004 that struck Thailand (and other countries). If so, do we really need a film director to cash-in from these events and churn/re-document these out onto the silver screen? <br/><br/>Taking this point further, The Impossible (2012) - the Oscar nominated picture about a family's incredible tale following the 2004 Tsunami, and like THL, told a single story amidst a big event and proved that a drop of a pebble into a still lake will form more beautiful ripples that the plunging of a boulder. Katheryn Bigelow in ZDT, opted for the latter and it ultimately disappointed."

","Zero Dark Thirty is a film with no real substance. As almost everyone knows what the outcome will be, it being the biggest news story in many years, some attempt could have been made to address the issues surrounding what may well be a very important moment in history. Such as why Muslim terrorists are willing to go to such extreme lengths to attack western targets and why America would go to such lengths to get one man. More importantly it was a very lopsided, one dimensional view of what is a very complex story. The unsubtle insinuation that torture, especially water- boarding, helped capture Bin Laden and is therefore acceptable is disgusting. Over and above all this there is still the burning question of whether a nation that promulgates liberty and justice served these ideals in any way by shooting a man, essentially in cold blood and dumping his body at sea, instead of bringing him to trial. Plus the fact that the the film gives the impression that Maya, the lead character, was the only person really after Bin Laden makes it a dreadful movie."
"Staffenburgen","8","7","15","13 January 2013"," Darkly Compelling
","Zero Dark Thirty opens with a black screen. We hear the distressed voices of Americans immediately after the 9/11 attacks, including many who are still inside the towers. This simple but effective scene draws us completely into the world of Maya, a young woman completely obsessed with finding and killing UBL. The rest of the film details the search for Bin-Laden, a journey filled with innumerable dead-ends. <br/><br/>One would think that the search for the world's most wanted man would be a fascinating story, but unfortunately this film doesn't really portray it that way. What we do see are several dialogue scenes filled with incomprehensible jargon, which really prevents the viewer from understanding much. The basic plot points are easy enough to get, but the film is filled with so many details that it sometimes clouds the overall picture. I was hoping this film would completely lift the veil, and shed some light on the search for UBL, but by the end of the movie, I really didn't know much more than when I walked in. <br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned, Jessica Chastain is perfect for the lead role. Her character is basically a representation of post-9/11 America; she is determined to find and kill Bin-Laden and isn't willing to make many concessions to get there. I thoroughly enjoyed many of the other actors as well, particularly Jason Clarke, who plays Dan, the only person we see torturing detainees on screen. What's most impressive about both Clarke and Chastain is that they play characters who are almost completely emotionless, yet they still manage to subtly show these character's underlying humanity. Considering that neither of the characters are given any back-story to work with, I'd say that's pretty incredible. <br/><br/>Another thing I really enjoyed about this film is its complete lack of a political bias. Every scene is completely objective, which I found remarkably refreshing. <br/><br/>A final thing worth mentioning concerns the final hour or so of the film, which depicts American soldiers storming the compound and killing Bin-Laden. This is one of the most exciting, realistic, and enthralling scenes I have ever had the enjoyment of watching; I have never heard a movie-theatre be as quiet as it was during this sequence. <br/><br/>To summarize, Zero Dark Thirty is a good film. The first hour can be difficult to watch, as it is basically a combination of torture scenes and hard-to-follow dialogue, but the second half of the film is incredible, and the acting throughout the film makes up for many of the shortcomings in the storytelling. Go see it. <br/><br/>RATING: 8/10"

I'm not going to rant for too long but all of this B.S about the torture scenes really is false. The torture scenes didn't go too far but rather showed the audience barely a taste of the torture that happens EVERY DAY around the world, and involving the U.S. All I'm going to say is that there's no denying that worse forms exist in the U.S and the government should be lucky that Kathryn didn't show anything worse than water torture and a few punches thrown. <br/><br/>Go see Zero Dark Thirty and although there's no twist ending of Bin Laden's eye opening at the end, you still will be thrilled the entire time!"

","Zero Dark Thirty is telling the story about a possible series of event that could have led to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.

No, this is the relentless pursuit of a single goal by the CIA, and all the ground work it required. The point of view adopted is somewhat unusual, but absolutely excellent.<br/><br/>At first, you are shocked by the initial introduction to what it really meant originally. After capturing your attention, the film pulls you deep within the folds of the operation, the paperwork, the interrogations, the videos, the calls, the meetings, the orders... It sounds boring, but somehow, it keeps you riveted.<br/><br/>The actual military action is but a small part of the whole scenario and it is treated in the same business like manner, it's not an adrenaline rush. Neither is it a detached affair. You really feel the intensity. The whole flick has very personal feel, you get into the shoes of those working on the whole operation, from every perspectives: administrative, management, investigation, interrogation... It's not just because we follow that one CIA agent, played so brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, but because we get to know everybody, even some individual in the enemy camp.<br/><br/>I can't find even one thing to say wrong about it.

The movie it's self opens with a blank screen and only the noise of the disaster and phone calls from the hijacked planes on the day of 9/11. We then are brought to torture. Things like water-boarding are used to get evidence of the whereabouts of Al-Queda members. Dan (Jason Clarke) the leader of the interrogation tortures a poor Ammar (Reda Kateb) until he can't take anymore. Watching all of this is Maya (Chastain). You see, the problem about these torture ""interrogation"" scenes are the public or critics will say that ""maybe that's not how it happened and they didn't use water-boarding"" and so forth. But, if they didn't put these scenes in Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow the writers would have been criticized for not putting it. So either way it would have been viewed on. The opening couple of scenes aren't great film making. Your not sure what is going on and the plot and your interest is hanging by a thread. But after these couple of scenes the movie gets going and basically turns in to the Jessica Chastain show. Her performance In this movie is just so raw and simple she steals it. Her character Maya has no back story of any sort...the key of this movie is the story. It's all historical events every last shot and we follow the character of Maya. There are a lot of characters that come in and out of the story but there aren't really any character development. Which is a bummer because Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker revolved around character development so much. The events in the movie such as **spoilers** The Marriott Hotel bombing, the bombing of the bus in London, The attempted bombing of Times Square and the bombing in CIA base. The movie is 157 minutes long and takes a lot of time to come to our finale of the raid on Osama Bin Laden but, the movie does have it's long parts and is a slow moving film but it's just interesting and cynical film on the greatest man hunt of all time. It's 2 hours of built up to our raid the moment we have all (let's be honest) waiting for. The raid it's self is very intense and I love that but, not being able to see what's going on...just camera shaking and snipers and cool stuff. It'll do but it's not entertainment. But they do do the scene expertly. It's intense and nerve wrecking. Even if you yourself know how the raid went down you'd still find yourself being all ""DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!""..it's just expert film making. Kathryn Bigelow deserves credit for her amazing work and eye for detail in this movie. While watching you can really tell a lot of work went into it. It's solidly acted also. There's cameos from all sorts from Kyle Chandler to Mark Strong. It's just a great time at the cinemas. The whole movie is a great time...it may not be pretty but you did enjoy it! It's just the best time you'll have at the cinema. And as the final scenes close you can't help but bite your finger nails. When the credits then showed I sat there shocked by what I'd scene. I got up out of my seat and from there as my dad said ""it was alright wasn't it"" I knew it was a masterpiece!"

","The first thing I want to say about this film is related to the power  of women in the 21st century. Not only the film follows a strong, brave  and extremely persevering woman wanting to be heard, but the brilliant,  bold and daring Kathryn Bigelow who directs the film. These two women  put together one of the most desirable scripts out there in Hollywood,  having in commercial plot that features theories from 9/11 and the  killing of Osama Bin Laden, but it also focuses on the life and  psychological mindset of the person behind the planning of a risky and  pretty frightening operation that changed the world. Yes, ""Zero Dark  Thirty"" is raw in its essence and sometimes hard to watch, but it  touches and sticks with you, deeply.  This is not a simple political attempt to show events or inform people  about an event in a nation's history, and although it sometimes feels  like the way a documentary is shot due to the work by Greig Fraser, the  cinematographer, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a powerful tale of a woman who  knows her work and trusts her research and is sure about her vision,  and it is far from being or attempting to be only an informative film.  We follow a historic event through the eyes of a woman who seems shy  and passive in the beginning, being overshadowed by her male  colleagues, but that ends up ripping everybody's theories apart, and  gaining the trust of her boss first, for then even screaming and  cursing to the man in command of the CIA, only before he presents her  idea to the President of the United States of America. ""I'm the one who  found this place, sir"", says Chastain to the man in command of the CIA  referring to the house where Bin Laden is. Mark Boal who wrote the  script and collaborated before with Bigelow in ""The Hurt Locker"", does  an extraordinary job in taking us through this journey without it ever  feeling long or overwhelming. The film moves quick and precise, and it  tells us what we need to know, nothing less or nothing more. I've  watched the film twice and I still ask myself: How do you start writing  a script like this? There are 10 years to cover and 2 hours of footage,  having in mind the last part of focused on the detailed operation to  get the target. It is unbelievable for me to make a film like this work  so effectively like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" does. So many people, theories,  stories, names, locations, details. The Afghanistan American camps, the  offices, the helicopters, the people and extras that are constantly  around, the CIA rules and regulations, the language, the equipment. I  mean, the amount of research and dedication to this project is  mind-blowing. And the result is a clear understanding of the events and  a highly entertaining film that could mean the start of the new  blockbuster, where you have a commercial, appealing film, in the  context of it being exceptionally well crafted. ​ This time, Boal deals  with a globally controversial story that has many sides and personal  truths, and he has the responsibility of sharing only one vision of the  story with the world, including the Muslim population. The security in  the theater was pretty crazy and I think the whole paraphernalia around  the subject matter was part of the impact the film had on me, but that  didn't separated me from analyzing the script and noticing its many  levels and dimensions in terms of character writing and craft. Each  person working in the operation has an important tale in the film and  they all attribute important sides to the main quest, mainly followed  by Jessica Chastain's character. Her CIA girlfriend who gives up her  life, her boss, the American soldiers, all the incarcerated terrorists  and suspects she interviews, they all are solid characters with very  clear roles in the film, and they all contribute to making it not about  a difficult story to understand, but a human journey based on people  involved in a tragic war that has terrible consequences. ​ I love that  the film is not only about the killing of Osama Bin Laden, but  ultimately our desire as humans, to protect our lives, our friends, our  country. Jessica Chastain's performance intensifies that slow discovery  of personality of this character who appears fragile but is stronger  than expected. This is a side to Mrs. Chastain that we haven't seen and  very different from her work in ""The Help"" or ""The Tree of life"". It  really shows her diversity and drive to create and build interesting  characters that are risky and that have captivating and really  fascinating minds. ﻿ ""Zero Dark Thirty"" by Kathryn Bigelow is a  detailed and exceptionally crafted journey of discovery and tension. It  highlights our sense of intrigue and indecision in problems that  affects us all, and makes us feel grief for the bizarre way in which  we, humans, act sometimes. I never thought it was possible to show all  of these in a film, or maybe I simply don't have the nerve to deal with  such delicate issues. This is one of the best films I've seen this year  and puts Kathryn Bigelow in my list of filmmakers to study and from  those who I impatiently wait to see the work they give us."

","Zero Dark Thirty was one of my most anticipated of the year for many reasons. First, I loved The Hurt Locker and it's probably my favorite recent Best Picture winner. Secondly, Jessica Chastain, an actress that broke out in 2011 with several fantastic performances, was starring in it, her first true lead role. This would be a role that would, essentially, define the rest of her career. <br/><br/>The film has been raved about quite a bit, but one thing was certain based on reviews, and that was that it was very much a journalists' films, presenting information and information about countless of attempts to get closer to Bin Laden. Because of this, I did expect exactly what I got from it and from Chastain. A film like this is definitely not going to be loved by the mainstream that want something a little more ""dramatic"". I'm quite surprised it's gotten the level of acclaim The Hurt Locker got, because fortunately, it stands on its own. This isn't the showy technical film Hurt Locker was, not the showy directorial film that was. But its gripping all the way through to the final act, which is among the best things I've seen all year. There's not much to say for it except that one has to surrender to what the film is and not ask for what it isn't. I already expected it would be what it was so I wasn't surprised or disappointed, but I can see many people dismissing this. <br/><br/>I am quite surprised Chastain has gotten so many critic wins for this performance though. It's just not meaty in the slightest, meaty in the sense of drama or any real character-arc that defines awards. I wasn't even sure I would want her to win anything for this during most of the film. But in her last scenes, her performance comes together. I realized just how much Chastain had done with, arguably, so little. There are tons of supporting performances that have a lot more to do when it comes to dramatic stakes, but Chastain makes it work with her face. The best thing that can be said about her is that there are not many actresses that would be able to make this character work as well as she did. The emotional baggage she carries underneath without ever having anything to show in terms of dramatic satisfaction, and the way she lures you to the screen, proves that she has a powerful presence. Even with how detached the film is from her character in terms of not really digging into her most of the time, it's her film. It's her face that haunts you by the end of it when you realize just how much she did. If you weren't sure about it before, this marks the beginning of a true star.<br/><br/>This is a film that I see haunting my subconscious more and more and that will refuse to leave my mind. Another jackpot for Bigelow and Boal? Definitely."

","ZERO DARK THIRTY/MY REVIEW 12/20/12 Kathryn Bigelow's latest directorial effort, has been receiving even more attention than her 2008 Tour De Force ""Hurt Locker"", about a team of ordinance disposal soldiers during the war in Iraq. Ms Bigelow garnered a best director Oscar for her efforts on HL and the film went on to win an additional five statutes. On this go around she tackles the war on terror, specifically the Hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Ms Bigelow has teamed up again with writer Mark Boal a former freelance journalist who was embedded in Iraq in the early years of that war, Mr. Boal also won Gold for his original screenplay of Hurt Locker. On this go around the dynamic pairing of Bigelow and Boal's, sends us on a trip that will reveal the inner workings of our intelligence service (C.I.A) hunt for Osama Bin Laden. As well the internal mechanics of the terror organization we have come to know as Al-Qaeda. Concentrating on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden is the central issue and although the road takes some twist and turns. Ms Bigelow always steers us back, in the direction of the impossible task of finding the needle in a dark cave that was (Bin Laden). <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty may not be for everyone, what may appear to be a slow moving tale for action junkies being deprived of their adrenaline shots. Ms Bigelow makes sure to dispense the excitement for the rest of us, with the consistency of an intravenous drip, methodical and sufficient to achieve its purpose. In Zero Dark Thirty, Ms. Bigelow has opened a door and allowed us to enter. The result is a satisfaction of witnessing a relentless and painstaking process to bag the overlord of all Al-Qaeda attacks on Americans. The films protagonist is a CIA analyst named Maya played by the very talented Jessica Chastain. Maya displays a crescendo of obsessive determination which distances her from her superiors while garnering the respect of her colleagues. In Zero Dark Thirty Ms Bigelow allows Ms Chastain's portrayal of Maya, to slowly develop and engulf us into a state of total support and amazement. Through the years she reveals slowly her sheer determination to capture the world's most dangerous man. Chastain's portrayal of Maya is sure to capture the artistic attention she so richly deserves. The journey that we embark on in ZDT, brings Maya to life through her exhaustive twelve year search. The film doesn't judge, it allows us to ask ourselves some serious philosophical questions along the way. Principally how far are we willing to go exact justice? Ms Bigelow lets us dwell into our psyche and explore the questions which naturally arise from this journey. For me one thing was clear about this film, the journey can be more important than the destination.Those twelve years Maya searches for the elusive Bin Laden were filled with terror,frustration,savagery. We know what the final payoff is (a dead Bin Laden) Ms Bigelow makes sure not let us off the hook so easy. The distinction of Zero Dark Thirty is the authenticity of its source material, which came into question for possible disclosure violation, of top secret materials. Charges that writer Boal's completely denies. The question has risen from the very authentic characters and C.I.A. methodology displayed in the film. Including but not limited to the actual step by step S.E.A.L team mission to capture Bin Laden. Certainly enough to make CIA management question Mr. Boal's sources. This film worked on many levels for me; on limited release in the East Village section of Manhattan, just twenty blocks from the site of the attack on the World Trade Center. I watched it along with a hundred other New Yorkers and not once did I find Ms Bigelow storytelling to be demeaning to its audience or to the subject matter. Ms Bigelow made sure to withhold from making any manipulative or political statements, instead like an expert butcher. She just kept removing the fat and presenting a lean and concise telling of this most riveting story. The supporting cast with Jason Clarke formerly of Showtime series Brotherhood turns in a solid portrayal of Dan, Maya's supervisor. The rest of the cast Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Kyle Chandler, Ricky Sekhon and Mark Strong without exception were equally as effective in delivering home this remarkable project. As I sat watching this film with my fellow New Yorkers, I felt something that I rarely feel watching films. I felt a mix of emotions mostly gratitude to be an American. I felt a beaming pride in the incredible hard work it took for justice to be handed out. In many ways Zero Dark Thirty was not just a film but a cathartic experience for me as well. It resonated and released many unresolved feelings within me that had been locked up for eleven years. I suppose with all the division that continues to take place in our nation. Zero Dark Thirty truly delivers a bipartisan gift worthy of Santa himself."

","I still remember when I watched this movie the first time, it was in theater and I didn't liked it then, so in the question why I didn't liked it? I wen to see it again and when the movie got over it was like someone punched me in the face for not liking it the first time. For me it was the second viewing convinced me that it is one of the best movies that I have seen and two times in theater.<br/><br/>When the first scene starts we see a man is being tortured, he is beaten up still he is firm standing.<br/><br/>Dan: It's cool, that you're strong and I respect it, I do. But in the end, everybody breaks, bro. It's biology.<br/><br/>Maya is standing there observing everything that is happening. Her expression suggest that she not fond of the view but that view is going to give something that will be important.<br/><br/>The story revolves on Maya and her dedication to the job she is doing, she is sometimes failing, she is losing her friends, she is chasing ghosts but she is strong in every moment.<br/><br/>The movie is shown with like a file operation of the events taking place like in the Human Error part, we see that how a little error can make a huge difference and can lead to something even bigger. <br/><br/>Abu Ahmed who Maya is chasing is for some time, gets the news that he was dead long before she started to chase him but after she gives up on him she gets a lead.<br/><br/>The movie has a power that shows how much effort is required to stop something that a bunch of fu***rs and their madness has caused so much blood.<br/><br/>Then the scene where Maya says she is 100% sure Bin Laden is in that house and she is the only person sure of it. It was like I think a gut feeling and well as we all know it was bulls eye feeling.<br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat when the team is in the house to kill the Jackpot. It was shown flawlessly and edging.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain..... I just don't have words for her performance. She was just you can say extraordinary, powerful, strong, legendary. How she defines the role of Maya which I think was a difficult role to play.<br/><br/>About the last scene where Maya starts to cry, I think either it was the emotion of her which she hold out for so long came out or the term where to go because for last ten years finding Bin Laden and killing him was the only thing mattered to her are the reasons to cry.<br/><br/>I think this is Bigelow's masterpiece and her best movie. She handles the story delicately and strongly and to show this story is I think the most daring thing to do. Because half the time she was going dark on what happened, even though Mark Boal had the material but still how much of it was true was the question and as we know CIA doesn't give so much information on anything.<br/><br/>I don't know why Alexandre Desplat was not nominated for Best Score, it was intense and used perfectly for each moments in the movie."

","Holy cow! I thought The Hurt Locker was bad, but this is even worse! Since we all know what happened to UBL, I would rather see a documentary on the subject. This is Hollywood tripe, creating fictitious characters that are totally unbelievable. OK...I will accept that since it's a fictitious movie based on a real event. But my god, it is dang boring and slow and not entertaining at all! During the ""climatic"" scene, all I saw was a dark screen for 20 minutes with glimpses of light! I suffered through 2 hours of dreariness to end up watching darkness. Like ARGO, this was a very much over-rated movie. ARGO was also based on a real event with a known outcome, but it at least had a bit of suspense at its climatic scene for entertainment value. I don't know what the point of this movie is except to waste 2.5 hours of your time."
"lh22344","2","5","10","30 July 2014"," Dislikeable main character comes across as a petulant child...
","*Contains what may be considered spoilers*<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty... Well I hated The Hurt Locker so didn't have great hopes for this one and my expectations were not misplaced.<br/><br/>My problem with this film wasn't, as many others have stated, that the film was boring or that the characters were plain. The action sequences were rather good especially the raid scene at the end, the scenes where they were chasing the courier were tense and interesting, and some of the intelligence work by SUPPORTING CHARACTERS was also pretty engaging. My main problem was that the main character and the performance of the leading actress were inherently unrealistic and dis-likable. Several instances of her behaviour seemed to me to be entirely inappropriate for her professional role and in the real world would probably have seen her dismissed or at least reprimanded. <br/><br/>I'm sure the standards of professionalism required to work in the intelligence services is very high and that one requires a stable and professional personality to hold such a position. The use of belligerent and unnecessary profanity like ""I'm the motherf**ker that found this place"" during a formal meeting with a very high ranking senior or childishly writing the number of days that nothing has happened each day on your bosses window like a sulking two year old just do not ring true for me and left me really just detesting the main character. Her general attitude and sense of entitlement even when there was little or no real evidence (the '100 percent' scene being a perfect example of arrogance) was never once even cautioned by her superiors... Perhaps this was part of the films determination to portray every other agent or official involved as a bumbling idiot. I'm talking about things like taking a single detainee's word that someone they were looking for was dead with no supporting evidence besides his word, or allowing a known terrorist to just drive into a military base without any checks on their vehicle, not even asking them to dismount at a safe distance resulting in several stupid agents and sensible but outspoken military personnel being killed... <br/><br/>Everything not featuring 'Maya' was pretty good. The Seal Team stuff was engaging, I had no problems with the torture scenes or the (reputedly) pro American stance of the film. Why should that be a factor? Of course its a pro American film given the subject matter.. I'm not an American and have no strong feelings either way about the Foreign policies of the United States but I understand the significance of these events to Americans and to the last decade of global politics. Asking a film about this subject to not celebrate a countries victory against someone who committed an atrocity would be like asking to make a film about the fall of Hitler that didn't celebrate the victory of the Allies.. <br/><br/>In closing I would just like to say that the final scene where Maya shed tears just seemed weird given how dis-likable she was throughout the film. Were we supposed to connect to her? Because I literally felt no sympathy or connection to her at all and as a result that final scene seemed forced and unnecessary. <br/><br/>My advice would be if you want to see a GREAT film about this kind of intelligence work go check out Body Of Lies... That film really puts this to shame.."

","It is inevitable with movies such as ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to wonder how accurate the portrayal of historical (albeit recent) events can be. Most of us who lived through those times will be in no doubt that Osama Bin Laden was clearly labelled ""US Public Enemy No. 1""<br/><br/>Yet this movie revolves around one woman's determination (""Maya"" played by Jessica Chastain) to find this vindictive and reclusive figure-head, often forced to clash with her bosses to get her own way, as she closes in on her target.<br/><br/>Whether or not the portrayal is accurate it is clear that a lot of hard graft, and determined (if somewhat questionable) interrogations- plus one vital piece of previously overlooked intelligence – went in to locating the Al Qaeda No.1.<br/><br/>And whilst it has to be said that the CIA operatives who died at a supposed meeting with an informant were naïve in the extreme, their deaths in action can be considered no less a sacrifice than all those innocent souls whose lives have been truncated by these dangerous zealots without any real cause.<br/><br/>The ambivalent security situation in Pakistan is evident as three terrorists armed with sub-machine guns rake Maya's car (which luckily for her is modified with bullet-proof features) with bullets in broad daylight.<br/><br/>The eventual raid on the Bin Laden household is clinical and bloody – with enough intelligence captured that the CIA must still be poring over it even now.<br/><br/>This movie captures the powder keg that is Pakistan, the painstaking work that went into locating Bin Laden, the crucial debates in the President's office on percentages of probability that it was Bin Laden's residence (Maya was always 100% convinced), and the professionalism and discipline of the military as they planned and carried out what was, and remains, a daring military raid on foreign soil.<br/><br/>It does it though without fanfare or embellishment. It depicts the events but does not seek to influence, and that is what makes this a truly great movie – it is made by those who understand that it depicts one of the most momentous events of the 21st century, an event that exorcised the demons of an entire generation.<br/><br/>No further dramatization is required."

","I'll try to make this short and sweet. The beginning of the movie did had me interested with the interrogating scene. When this same interrogation was going on 15 minutes later I was not impressed. No wonder this movie is 2.5 hours long; they drag on every scene just long enough so you don't say ""screw it"" and turn off the movie altogether. For the next 2 hours I silently begged to see a scene with some real action. The director does a great job of teasing you with an odd explosion here and there, a few bullets to change it up, but nothing that gets your heart pumping. <br/><br/>Now with all that said, you really do feel the desire that Maya has to catch Bin Laden throughout the entire film; especially after her newly found friend dies in a suicide bombing. The other characters just seem to be ""there"" and you never really develop interest for them. <br/><br/>The last half hour or so of the movie is what I watched this movie for: the reenactment of SEAL team 6 infiltrating Bin Laden's house and putting an end to his life. This part of the movie should have been a movie on its own because it was nothing like the previous 2 hours. It was action packed, exciting, nerve wrecking and it felt like you were there with SEAL team 6 taking the big guy out. Without this last segment I would have rated this movie a solid 3/10. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to others, but I would definitely forewarn them about the long delay until the real action starts."
"Rob_Taylor","6","5","10","2 March 2013"," The slow pace of the film kills any chance it has of being watched again.
","To be honest, I found it reasonably interesting, but that was coming from knowing the film is based on real events. If you made a fictional story about a manhunt in the same way that this movie was done, it would get slaughtered by the critics. The reality of the story gives it a certain gravitas which the film-making entirely tries to ruin.<br/><br/>We all get how long and drawn out a process it was to track down Bin Laden. But quite why they needed to show this in such a tedious manner is beyond me. Imagine if Titanic had been two hours of showing the process of building the ship then twenty minutes of it sinking. That's essentially what you get with ZDT. A lot of relatively dull spy drama followed by a twenty minute action sequence.<br/><br/>As to how accurate the events of the movie are in relation to actual events, I have no idea. But there was one scene, where a supposed Al-Qaeda traitor goes to a meeting at an airbase and is allowed to drive right up, inside the base, to the building where the meeting is. Whilst I was watching it, I couldn't believe that ever happened. Surely the better option was to have him transfer from his vehicle at the main gate to one of the base vehicles? Not to let him drive his car bomb right inside! If that really happened.... Jesus Christ! Words fail me! I just hope it was idiocy on the part of the film-makers.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I say, a lot of tedious spy drama. Not a lot of action. I'm not sure film was the best medium to tell this story with. You can't condense a ten-plus year manhunt down into two hours and make it remotely interesting. There is little along the way to break the monotony of watching people play Scooby Doo with the clues. Especially when the reason most people will watch the film is to see the events that took place inside Bin Laden's compound.<br/><br/>I know, the film was primarily about the 'hunt' for Bin Laden, not the final minutes of it, but really, most of the movie was about as much fun as watching someone else play Scrabble.<br/><br/>In short, not terribly entertaining and not particularly enlightening. I doubt anyone will be interested in watching it more than once.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, there is a very small cameo by John Barrowman at one point. I actually like him a lot, but his presence here, much like it does in the TV show, Arrow, completely destroys any sense of tension and menace. Here, he was barely on screen for thirty seconds, but that was more than enough. Fair actor, but he just tends to make you not take what you're watching seriously and in a movie such as this, he was a bad casting choice.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: A bit dull really which, considering the subject matter, is not what I was expecting."
"jdneukom","8","5","10","23 February 2013"," Solid Effort
","I have to commend the Bigelow/Boal team for making a movie about such a controversial topic when it's this fresh still. I've seen nut jobs coming out of the woodwork saying nonsense like:<br/><br/>1. This film is liberal propaganda meant to prop up the Obama Administration.<br/><br/>2. This film is conservative propaganda depicting how awesome torture, err, ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" are.<br/><br/>3. This film is just the cherry on top of a massive conspiracy wherein all of a sudden the govt. decided to announce the murder of Bin Laden, but he was either A) already dead or that B) it was not Bin Laden they murdered.<br/><br/>And so it goes with anything remotely political in this country--there are crazies on both sides, but there is little middle ground. Naturally people view this through their lens of choice, whether Fox or MSNBC, but I have to say I did not find this movie to be rife with political ambitions. In fact, I think Bigelow, despite any partisan view she may or may not have, went out of her way to distance this picture from anything partisan (other than maybe pro-American) for that very reason. Due to the meandering timeline of this film, we got to see small snippets of a GW Bush appearance as well as a 60 Minutes interview with Obama. And in both cases, they were depicted as merely presidential--not bumbling, not good, and not bad--just as Commander in Chief at certain periods in history. What's more, is none of the characters in the movie made reference to either, other than something to the effect of 'you have to get this together before I present it to the President.'<br/><br/>Having gotten past the politics, one can actually start to critique this movie. And, it's basically a character study of Jessica Chastain's Maya. As depicted early in the film, Maya was repulsed by the torture that was occurring and when left alone with a detainee, you could hear the trembling idealism in her voice. Juxtapose this against a frenetic Maya angrily scribbling the days elapsed while the CIA sat on its hands about intel, and you have quite the contrast. Her character grew, and as the final scene leaves open to us, was it good growth for her? Certainly it was satisfying professionally, but was it worth that much of her life? Tears of joy? Tears of release? In the meantime, she'd been nearly killed and had some of her few friends blown up in a suicide bombing. While not the most engrossing character study I've seen, it was quite believable how Maya basically sacrificed any kind of normal life to do CIA work in Pakistan, work needed to be the MF'ing heroine that found the compound in Abbottabad. When asked point blank if she had any friends, she had no answer. And, kudos as well for not sticking an obligatory, Chastain is kinda hot so let's toss in a gratuitous sex scene. That was the right choice for her ""tortured"" character.<br/><br/>As far as the filmmaking, it was a confluence of capable parts. Nothing extremely visionary here and no one is going to put Bigelow alongside Orson Welles, Kubrick, or Hitchcock for this picture. The score was good, the script was believable, the cinematography was good, and the acting was also solid. This was a story-driven movie for the most part, not a technical masterpiece. Nothing really stood out, although I see that some are saying Arabic was being spoken in Pakistan when it should have been Urdu. Not being an expert on those languages, I have nothing to add there, but that may be a wart in the production of ZD30.<br/><br/>There were two memorable parts to this movie for me, other than the obvious focus on the heroine Maya. First, there was the totally unexpected Mariott bombing in Pakistan. I usually see these coming (as with the utterly predictable CIA compound car bomb), and I'm not sure if I missed the fact they'd entered the Mariott, but the explosion came completely out of left field for me. The second thing was basically the commitment to show a reenactment of the actual Seal Team operation in what seemed close to real time. Even though I obviously knew how that played out, the suspense was actually gripping during that whole 30 minute period. And for the people I see asking, well what did the movie's title mean? Run that scene back where the choppers head in and the mission is a go, Maya looks at the ops clock, and it reads 00:30. That scene is worth another viewing anyway.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Despite what the crazies are saying about how this movie is just ""propaganda"" being fed to the ""sheep"" out there; I say this is actually a solid movie. It takes a recent historical happening that most people care about, threads the needle between a military drama and a documentary with a nice touch of suspense. Though this movie is not a masterwork, hopefully ZD30, SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK, or LIFE OF PI can stop Hollywood from making a bigger ass of itself by giving unworthy pictures like ARGO or LINCOLN Best Picture."

","The main hot political potato that has arisen with the film is the subject of whether or not it champions torture, and whether it was, in this case, successful or not as a means to obtain information. For me, there are two very straightforward things to say on the matter. Firstly, and backing up my feeling that the film maker remains at a moral remove from the subject, I am not entirely sure what the people who are upset about it wanted; torture occurred regardless of our feelings about it, and as Bigelow has pointed out, to not depict this part of the story would be dishonest. Secondly, the very fact there is a raging debate as to whether the movie does or does not champion its use is evidence, in itself, that it does not make it a clean-cut, black and white case. Unlike other reviews, I will not spoil the movie by mentioning the crux of a key plot point in relation to the matter, but it could be well argued that the film remains deliberately neutral on it. Boal and Bigelow put the subject out there for debate, seemingly playing devil's advocate in terms of their own feelings; I suspect they felt it would be wrong to imprint their personal stance on a film such as this.<br/><br/>This film is larger in scope than The Hurt Locker, but they actually share a lot of DNA; both are timely works about the war, and both are notable for examining the psychology of their central character, the big difference being that one film is set in the midst of the hot zone and about a group dynamic, while the other shows us a war which becomes almost personal, and is fought from behind a desk. Where The Hurt Locker had the freedom afforded it by not being based on a set of events, Zero Dark Thirty adheres very strictly to a specific set of events, namely the zig, zags and frustrating dead ends that were the decade-long hunt for the world's most wanted terrorist.<br/><br/>This is, at once, a strength and a weakness of the movie; the film focuses on detailing one event after another, with a cold precision and little character development. Thankfully, the movie is crafted in such a way that, despite knowing how it ends, as with Apollo 13, we find ourselves gripped by the details of the hows, whys and wherefores. Nevertheless, whilst the who's who of a cast all give believable performances, there is generally the sense that you are simply a fly on the wall, not getting to know these people, but rather watching things play out, in the moment. There are two exceptions to this, one being Dan, the expert in ""enhanced interrogation techniques"", who in another context you feel you could like. He is played by the fantastic Jason Clarke, previously of Lawless; his lack of nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars is a huge oversight. The other is Maya herself; Chastain plays a woman who does not give much away, and so it is understandable that, to some, her performance seems flat, and certainly not worthy of her Oscar nomination. I will not say she deserves to win it, but I definitely disagree that it is a flat performance; on the contrary, she actually has some rather amusing and deftly written dialogue, which is a pleasant surprise, and I find the subtle shifts in her character's psychology, the growth of her obsession, even in the face of people telling her to let it go, to be one of the most compelling elements of the film.<br/><br/>And it is on her performance the film takes its final bow; Zero Dark Thirty goes out, not with a bang, but on a downbeat. The final half hour of the movie is a well-executed, realistic depiction of the raid of the house and the killing of Osama, and yet we miss the drama of the preceding two hours. Could this be the point? Maya's tears and final exhalation are of what? Relief or joy? She's not smiling. Sadness? Understanding of loss? Perhaps it is something not so easily captured in just one word or phrase, but one things is for sure, you know you are looking at a character who, like us, found that the chase became more important than the objective, and only now has come to realise that the last decade of her life has yielded nothing; no friends, no love, no family, no real home, nothing but one man's death. At one point in the movie, upon being asked what she has done for the CIA other than this, she has to answer: ""Nothing, I have done nothing else."" You do not leave this film, with its quiet closing credit score, feeling at ease or like it celebrates anything, other than perhaps the bravery of the men who put their life on the line for an important job; the movie actually leaves us with an unexpected feeling of hollowness. This is a thoughtful movie, put together by somebody who understands it is not a simple subject to relay; it doesn't tell the audience what to think, and there are those who might not like or admit that. Those of the general public passing judgement on a subject about which they know little, especially when they have not even bothered to see the film, are, I believe, bandwagon jumpers who like the sound of their own, mostly ill-informed ramblings, and who should perhaps see the film first."
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","5","10","27 January 2013"," A supremely crafted docudrama
","In his book ""What is Cinema?"" film theorist André Bazin stated: ""But realism in art can only be achieved in one way - through artifice. Every form of aesthetic must necessarily choose between what is worth preserving and what should be discarded, and what should not even be considered."" Realism in cinema is therefore determined by an audio- visual language that differs from real life. Any compression or fragmentations of events are a result of the limitations of the time, space and technique of the screen. A filmmaker is responsible for selecting these techniques within the frame of the narrative. <br/><br/>Looking to cinematise the lead up and execution of Operation Neptune Spear, the hunt and assassination of Osama Bin Laden, Kathyrn Bigelow and journalist turned screenwriter Mark Boal compress facts and timelines and omit significant figures from this decade-long search. However, the film moves through a decade long period with such ease that the realism is never compromised. It sidesteps Hollywood clichés and sentimentality as comfortably as few others have done before it. Boal's script is clear of tragic back stories, its character development is quietly stated and its moral compass, if there is one, lingers under the film's surface.<br/><br/>The film has been described as being in the tradition of ""New Journalism"": a method of journalism that adds subjectivity rather than an objective perspective to the facts. It is an appropriate means of describing the film because even as it condenses multiple real world terrorist attacks over the years, from 9/11 to a bombing in London, the impact is still extremely shattering to the audience and its characters. The attacks grow increasingly personal to the film's lead subject Maya (Jessica Chastain at her most intense and emotive), a CIA operative who spends over a decade looking for clues on the whereabouts of Bin Laden. <br/><br/>Contributing to the film's authenticity, Zero Dark Thirty makes fewer concessions than Bigelow's previous film The Hurt Locker (2009), which to avoid any political waves, was purposely coy on its subject of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This uncompromising nature is immediate from early scenes where torture is used to extract information from a prisoner. Both Democrats and Republicans alike have been publicly critical of the film, deeming the use of enhanced torture techniques to track Bin Laden is inaccurate and that the film praises torture an effective means of investigation. <br/><br/>This is a misjudgement and hypocritical given the extensive amount of research assistance by the CIA, the Department of Defence and The White House, who provided extensive interviews and documents about the operation. The interrogation scenes are, as they should be, ugly and difficult to watch. A man is strung up by his wrists, punched, stripped down and shoved into a box. His answers are varied, unclear and unhelpful. We see the stress that these moments place on the interrogator (played by Jason Clarke). It is difficult work and impractical compared to other advanced techniques, like aerial surveillance. An important subtextual development is how these techniques are gradually being phased out, which is true given the closure of the black list sites and the outlaw of enhanced torture techniques. <br/><br/>If the film does have a message my interpretation is that it is, in many ways, a film about how vacant revenge and obsession can be. Maya's entrance to the film is through one of these horrific interrogations, which she is not mentally prepared to engage. A deep focus shot of the room frames Maya in the background. The shot shows her isolated from the action, true to her inexperience, and her face conveys great discomfort in watching the interrogation unfold. She arrives in a dark suit, unideal for waterboarding prisoners, and when asked to participate she is clumsy in handling the situation. <br/><br/>Yet her inexperience also provides compelling movement in Boal's screenplay. As the terrorist attacks mount over the years and the deaths become more personal, Maya's viridity is dissolved and replaced with increasingly determined anger. This change is also complimented by through the costumes, as Maya's clothes become more combat-like, and her dialogue which grows more sadistic: ""I'm going to smoke everyone involved in this op and then I'm going to kill Bin Laden"". These fascist undertones, also echoed by Mark Strong as the head of Counter Terrorism at the CIA, are dispelled by how tactful much of the film is, particularly the meticulous and intense raid on the compound. <br/><br/>Like The Hurt Locker, the film isn't politically right or left. Once the breathless mission is over and the objective is 'won' the film obtains a brief but powerful feeling of melancholy. There are no 'hooahs' or flag waving. Maya's tears are not ones of joy or relief but unfulfillment. In a single close-up shot, her face reflects the hollow aftermath of conquering our enemies, and I think, the ambiguity around the next chapter of global terrorism. 'Zero Dark Thirty' itself is a military phrase, referring to the early dawn, once darkness has passed. What follows from this moment? It is an unexpected and brave question to end this long but supremely crafted docudrama."
"Deepak_Shah","8","5","10","27 January 2013"," Patience pays off at the end !
","Curiosity is at the center of our taste for cinema. A new premise always makes for exciting movie watching with most of the thrill preserved for how the climax culminates. Now even before you have bought your popcorn and settled into your seats, you're already aware of the Zero Dark Thirty's premise (the hunt for OBL) and the climax (the infamous capture at Abbottabad, Pakistan). Then why watch it ? The devil, and all the chilling thrill in this case, is in the detail.<br/><br/>Director Katherine Biglow's progression as a story teller from her previous work Hurt Locker to Zero Dark Thirty is highly laudable. While Hurt Locker did win the Oscar for Best movie for 2009 and Zero Dark Thirty may not in spite that it is nominated, there is no doubt that the latter scores remarkably higher in drama quotient and entertainment value compared to the former. And although Biglow is divorced from her ex-husband and one of the most famous directors of our times James Cameron, she is truly wedded to this genre of cinema and settled very well in this marriage indeed.<br/><br/>Biglow unveils the intense and passionate search by a CIA agent named Maya in the movie (real name is CIA confidential info for obvious reasons) who will move heaven and hearth to find Osama Bin Laden. Her struggle to find OBL is compounded by the natural ethos of her organization, the CIA, as she battles the intensely bureaucratic system and it's surprisingly high aversion to risk. Jessica Chastain as Maya excels in this role, and already stands vindicated by the Golden Globe award for Best Actress awarded to her for ZDT. The movie depicts her meteoric rise from a shy newly hired CIA agent to someone who rattles the top brass of CIA in order to nab OBL. Several times during the movie Chastain reminded me of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockvich due to her feisty no-nonsense character and performance that showcases the steely spine of a go getter. The meat in her role is enough for the scholars at the Academy to chew on and have no room left to ask for more before they get compelled to declare her as the best female performer of the year.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty does try your patience at first due to slow pace at the start of the movie, but it gradually builds and then compensates to a large extent in the second half when the pace almost inverts and the movie just can't run any faster. The detail which emerges behind the hunt of America' most wanted man is purely captivating, and leaves even the highest detractors of our government with some respect for what the men working in it's agencies do to keep us safe. The sets built for OBL's Abbottabad mansion with its compound look fascinatingly real and support a perfect climax to the tale. And although everything about the climax is known in advance, one of the most memorable scene is about the 2 Blackhawk helicopters that begin the daring raid at 12:30am on the fated day to travel from Afghanistan border deep into Pakistan territory and land into OBL's compound that is just a mile away from a Pakistani military establishment. The scene is so hair razing that I felt compelled to keep my fingers crossed in spite of everything we know about the terrific success of that mission without loss of a single American life.<br/><br/>Mark Boal's writing and his research that has gone into writing the screenplay is exemplary, in spite that it has attracted Republican accusations that the Obama administration inappropriately provided material to make this movie. The dividing line between a fine screenplay and fine directing is sometimes blurry, as one could be easily mistaken for the other. In the case of Zero Dark Thirty, the balance appears to have moved in favor of Boal who is nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay, but not Biglow for direction of the same movie.<br/><br/>Subjects like this generally make powerful documentaries but not necessarily entertaining movies. Creating a power packed dramatization without deviating from facts is a huge challenge but one that the team of ZDT has successfully overcome. This movie is a must watch for every American to learn what went into the capture of the nation's most wanted outlaw. And finally, this movie rekindles the spirit in you.. that if one puts his mind and heart into a task then nothing is mission impossible.<br/><br/>Love USA."

","Best movie of the year. Enough said. I didn't see that the torture scenes were offensive or as nasty as people say. Put your left wing garbage aside because this movie shows how during the Bush era water boarding, sleep deprivation & other techniques were used in getting information to track down Bin Laden. After Obama has changed policies of detention & torture, we noticed that we still were able to get information to finally get the evil man. Jessic Chastain deserves best actress Oscar for her performance she gave a tenacious inside view of the women behind the scenes in CIA who never gave up, when others did. This movie was long but told the story that needed to be told about the 10 year hunt. Navy Seals scenes were well shot & just down right amazing to see, these men are true professionals. This is not a propaganda piece. It's based on truth, how much. I believe it has a lot of factual events in it, or why would the CIA make such a stink!"

","I purchased my ticket to see ""Zero Dark Thirty"" for a 12:00 PM showing 2 weeks prior to the Nationwide Opening date. Going in from all the early reviews and notices I expected to be both disturbed and sickened by the supposed scenes of Advanced Interrogation Techniques AKA Torture. Thirty minutes into the film there were a few scenes of water boarding of about 60 seconds each. The sexual humiliation consisted of one detainees pants being pulled down and exposed to the films female lead Maya. Guys on the NYC subway expose themselves more. The same detainee was placed into a wooden box on a table that he was forced to crunch into. Once he is placed into it that box we never return to see if he was in this box for 10 minutes, 10 hours or 10 days? The other thing that really bothered me was that 99% of these detainees all spoke perfect English. I have seen professional female dominatrix in S & M clubs treat there male and female submissive more harshly. In the USA Network series La femme Nikita head strategist Madeline who also handled interrogations for the shows fictional anti terrorist group Section One would have gotten the information in under 4 hours. I did like the attitude of Maya in going up against the male dominated CIA boys club at one point in a conference room with a model of the bin-Laden camp on the table Maya spoke up saying she was sure bin-Laden was there a male member asked ""Who are You"" she replied I'm the mother-bleeper than found this place"" The raid itself was annoying to watch as we had to see it through the night vision goggles worn by Seal Team 6. And it seemed to go on and on with no ending in site. Is this a good film ? Yea I guess I would say it was good but it's not Oscar worthy either for film or direction or acting. My biggest complaint was it did not fade out with President Obama standing at the podium in the White House on May-1 -2011making the announcement to the world that the United States had conducted a mission that resulted in the death of Osama bin-Laden."

"Dondi0","8","9","22","6 January 2013"," Processing Ghosts in a Morally Ambiguous Maze
","In Katherine Bigelow's previous film, The Hurt Locker, a borderline mystical, obsessive outsider(Jeremy Renner) attempts to exorcise violent malevolent spirits (bombs) from within their innocuous, unassuming hosts(cars, cadavers) whilst negotiating a labyrinthine haunted house teeming with spectral enemies(post-invasion Iraq).<br/><br/>In this equally hauntological follow-up, a woman (Jessica Chastain), who's self seems more defined by what's absent than what's present, hunts the ultimate ghost(Usama Bin Laden) in a perhaps misguided attempt to vanquish and banish the black hole vacuum that's been feasting on the soul of her and her country since September 11th 2001 and attain a sense of, well what exactly? Retribution? Justice? Closure? Maybe she's simply trying to lay some ghosts, both public and private, to rest...<br/><br/>Chastain anchors the film with a controlled, subtle performance proving she has a versatility that should propel her beyond her already brilliant support slots as wife/girlfriend etc. Only Cate Blanchett, and possibly Charlize Theron, can touch her right now. Her delicate exterior of feminine porcelain fragility belies an intelligent, taught and tough core that combine to create a surprisingly believable performance. One that puts paid to the lie that women have to act like men to succeed in a man's world. This is a film driven by a female character operating in a male dominated environment that never once resorts to hitting us over the head with gender politics. She is a professional person going about her profession in a professional manner. Nothing more, nothing less. This is true equality of the sexes on screen and it's refreshing to see it handled in this way.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are equally as good and all give note-perfect, generous low-key performances that are entirely in keeping with the ensemble-like nature of the film. Nobody is out to steal the picture here and it's all the better for it.<br/><br/>Technically Zero Dark Thirty is near flawless in direction, camera-work, cinematography, editing and music. Never once are we subjected to BOOMBOOMBOOM audio cues and blaring emotional music. Restraint is the watchword here and Bigelow manages to wring tension out of every set-piece whilst keeping us guessing, which is no mean feat considering we all know the overall outcome before we've even sat down.<br/><br/>Sadly I don't know how popular this ambiguous and complex film is going to be with mainstream audiences. Already, a simplistic knee-jerk critique implying that the film is a justification for torture seems to be emerging and becoming consensus opinion amongst some people, most of which have not even seen the film yet. I would position myself as centrist to left-of-center/liberal politically (I subscribe to Chomsky,Klein and Zinn, but also Ferguson and Hitchens) and I find these accusations to be overly glib and analytically myopic. Whilst within the confines of the story torture does elicit useful information, the characters never seem entirely comfortable with it and it is left up to the viewer to decide whether the ends justify the means. Events are presented as they, supposedly, occurred and, I felt, served more as a jumping off point for discussion rather than a pro-torture polemic. This is not a didactic film and its ambiguity and, perhaps misplaced, faith in the intelligence of its audience could be its ultimate downfall.<br/><br/>There is also a refreshing lack of triumphalism and nationalistic fervour permeating the film (the stars and stripes are especially noticeable by their absence for example). At the end of the day this is a story about process. Laborious, painstaking process. About people doing a job. About that job taking them to the darkest recesses of human thought and action and trying to return unscathed. About attempting to negotiate a map-less and morally bankrupt terrain in search of answers to questions nobody's posed before. Answers they may not even really want.<br/><br/>It's also quite a cold film (which is as it should be given the subject matter) and many audiences may find it difficult to connect with it in an emotional way. The characters have little to no back story and relationships are more professional than personal. At one point the death of a 'lead' appears to be mourned more than a colleague. Perhaps this is what happens when humans become mere collateral in the pursuit of ideologies...? <br/><br/>Ultimately Zero Dark Thirty is certainly not for everybody, but if you like adult, technically adept, taut, political info-thrillers that don't lead you around by the nose and aren't afraid to leave moral spaces in place of simplistic didactic-ism then you'll find much to wrap your brain around. It poses more complex questions than offers simple answers but, as we enter the second uncertain decade of both the 21st century and its questionable 'War on Terror', this seems entirely apt.<br/><br/>The problem with hunting ghosts is: how do you know when you've caught them and, like memories, how can you be sure they won't simply rise again to taunt you once more?"

","It's been said numerous times elsewhere but zero dark thirty really feels like it should have been made 20 years from now. The film employs an objective observational style to some highly contentious and prescient issues still at the forefront of America's political and military conscious.<br/><br/>This film seems to have jazzed everyone off with the conservative right proclaiming it as pro-Obama propaganda and many on the left stating that the way in which torture is depicted is dangerous and morally wrong to even be shown. That first point I won't touch on but I've read pieces from people such as Alex Gibney who I respect highly attacking the film for depicting torture as more effective than it actually is. I strongly disagree with this as no effective information is ever really yielded from the interrogations, and although there is a greater statement to be made about the wider reality of ""advanced interrogation techniques"" yielding extremely little and unreliable information on high ranking members of Al-Qaeda, that simply isn't the story the film is telling. In fact I feel these sidebars and themes that get pushed into the background in the hunt for Bin Laden heightens the drama on display showing the lows a country was willing to sink to in its hunt for revenge (I'm not opposed to him getting capped, rather delighted actually).<br/><br/>The film is divided into 4 sections and all offer different yet important aspects of the whole operation while remaining a cogent whole. My personal favourite scene in the film is a conversation between Mark Strong and Stephen Dillane discussing the statistical probabilities involved in the assault compared to those that justified the invasion of Iraq which is masterwork, mad props to Mark Boal on that one.<br/><br/>I feel the movie kind of negates the need for other films on this subject matter through its exhaustive attention to detail for the entirety of the 11 or so years it takes place in and should be viewed as a reliable text on a lot of what America meant to the world for this period in history.<br/><br/>Quickly, Jessica Chastain and pretty much the entire cast are awesome, the night raid sequence is tense as all hell, the score is quickly becoming a personal favourite (if a little derivative of Desplat's past work on Syriana) and the direction and writing meld superbly. I wish Kathryn Bigelow was up for a second Oscar on this one but I'm sure this film will be remembered for many more years than whatever does win for 2012."
"DICK STEEL","8","6","13","12 February 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Zero Dark Thirty
","Let's get a key sore point out of the way. There are those who take offense and have genuine concern about the torture scenes in the film, which had actually opened the movie, and have a few more going in various interrogation scenes given threats, and veiled ones, aimed at enemy combatants in order to try and elicit useful information from them. I suppose it is tactically naive to deny that torture, in its various forms, and as loosely used a term, does not exist. Otherwise there would be no need for black sites in locations of allies who condone such a practice, and frankly speaking, depravity is something quite expectedly used as a tool, because humans are susceptible to using any method to force or coerce co-operation. It's hypocritical to deny the propensity of evil within us.<br/><br/>After having run around with the big boys and their various operations in The Hurt Locker, director Kathryn Bigelow now opts for another aspect in the theatre of war, and that's of the intelligence community, working behind the scenes to obtain credible information, where content is truly king. It took almost a decade to hunt down what would be the most elusive man on the planet at the time, with his closed network of associates and trusted inner circle, to shield him from everything that technology can be used to track him down. It is this hunt, based on gut, instinct and sheer hard work, that forms the basis of interest in a film like this, and worked as a capture of key milestones that had gone to this monumental effort.<br/><br/>And for a film spanning a decade, Mark Boal's story managed to weave in the various iconic terrorist incidents that had taken the world by storm, starting with September 11 recapped without visuals, then the recreation of others such as the London bombings that followed, the attacks in camps, and the blowing up of the Marriott hotel in Pakistan, amongst others. Perhaps the bit of a stretch would be to weave Jessica Chastain's lead character of Maya into some of them, because it's almost a statistical stretch to have someone at the right place at the right time, if not to lend an almost personal objective to Langley's mission to get their man.<br/><br/>For characterization, we can look no further than Maya, whose hard nosed determination we see being developed from the days of being a rookie where we start, to a seasoned veteran in the field unwilling to make compromises, and almost always demanding her ways because as part of the rank and file, she's there to see through changes, rather than to be air-dropped into the ivory tower. Politics also comes into the fray, and just like The Hurt Locker, Bigelow throws on some uncredited roles played by famous faces, that you'd be looking forward to just about who she'd throw on next.<br/><br/>But it is Maya's story and development that makes Zero Dark Thirty compelling to follow, one who is void of emotion, with very little personal life, deliberate in clue us in on her immense dedication to the cause and mission. Not only as the noose around Bin Laden and his hideout get closer, but to observe Maya's change as an intelligence analyst in a world where it's black versus black, with real and present danger set amongst them even though they're in office most of the time, especially when complacency sets in, and enemies use that as leverage when games are played against each other.<br/><br/>Action junkies will take heart at the key action sequence in the film, which is that full scale assault on a rather conspicuous three storey building by the Seal Team Six. It is presented in almost real time, lending some authenticity to its version of the event, although not without its own controversy since nobody can vouch for accuracy given the cloak of silence surrounding this operation. So it's pretty much left to the filmmakers' discretion in how it all went down. Those looking for more development behind the Seal Team Six preparation can perhaps view Code Name: Geronimo, which provided that army preparation that's missing in Zero Dark Thiry, offering a different take as well on the final assault, something that this one is clearly steering clear from in order not to distract from its cat and mouse focus amongst the think tank involvement.<br/><br/>Still, Zero Dark Thirty proved to be immensely engaging and gripping as it unfolds, even if artistic license got liberally applied to tell this tale of a determined manhunt in recent history. A definite recommend!"

","Loved this film! But my entire family fought for our freedoms and rights in our country their entire lives and I appreciate them for doing so.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the past posters, that people are grading the film based on their political leanings and sadly, they've forgotten the most important philosophy when it comes to art depicting life. Passion and appreciation.<br/><br/>So, unless you've made a film that tells the same story and you've done it better, shut your freaking mouth and try making a movie that has any backbone, for appreciating the real people that allowed you hyper-critical-shallow-followers, to spew dung from your holier-than-thou-flapping gums.<br/><br/>""Ignorance is bliss"" is a catch phrase that I feel describes people that have never had to fight for anything of any value, ever.

"CSHaviland","7","6","13","12 January 2013"," A good but dry film, igniting overreactions from all sides
","Zero Dark Thirty was a gritty, docudrama-like movie much in the flavor of Black Hawk Down and Munich. Unlike the Hollywood fiction formula of old, you won't find a ""love interest"" and ""comic relief."" It is a dry film - meaning the plot had very little bandwidth and the characters were all business.<br/><br/>As such, it is a not a theme that greatly interests me, or attracts me to the theater. In fact I go to the theater to escape dwelling on these types of realities, not immerse myself in them.<br/><br/>Nonetheless I'm compelled to voice my opinion on this one because the film is harshly criticized for an assortment of reasons. possibly some even conflicting. I thought the film portrayed itself exactly as Katheryn Bigelow (whose career I've followed since Near Dark, not since The Hurt Locker like most younger people) advertised. ""Boots on the ground."" The story is very zoomed in, not zoomed out.<br/><br/>I avoid movies like this because I have very little interest in the political opinions of Hollywood (or of anyone else for that matter). Opinions are opinions, and I give none more or less weight than my own, frankly. Harlan Ellison is quoted of saying, ""You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion."" Which is an agreeable notion, but it depends on the quality of the information, doesn't it? And how can you confirm that information? If one is misinformed, his or her ""informed"" opinion may be of nor more value than an ignorant one.<br/><br/>I never felt that Zero Dark Thirty was taking any stand for or against torture. There were no debates or analysis or reflection between the characters on the merits or ethics of water boarding and other methods of duress interrogation. It's only risk was to choose to depict members of the CIA using torture as it is commonly defined, and there are strong opinions that we did no such thing. Those opinions, I daresay, are based entirely on what one wants to believe, not on facts. The facts, unfortunately, are elusive. I assume we did torture, based on my gut feeling on how various officials reacted to the question, especially President Bush. But it's just an assumption on my part - I am not informed, and neither are most people.<br/><br/>So Zero Dark Thirty made some assumptions, based largely on information fed by the Obama Administration (which is an eyebrow-raiser for most Republicans of course) and built a story about the long and arduous hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Despite claims to the contrary, there was nothing political about how the movie played this out. I was actually quite relieved. It didn't point accusing fingers, act ashamed, or express pride. Intelligence mistakes that occurred were human ones. It was an extremely difficult hunt, with CIA members sometimes chasing bad information that looked pretty good at the time. In fact, the final attack on Osama's compound (which was amazingly powerful) was itself an exercise in probability, not fact. We didn't know for sure Osama was that compound, but there were lots of compelling reasons to think he was. Similarly, the CIA didn't know for sure that Iraq wasn't hiding WMD production, but there were lots of compelling reasons to think they were. In one case we made a judgment call and lost, in another we made a judgment call and won. I'm sorry to say, that's the way the game is usually played.<br/><br/>So if you like this genre, this is a movie well worth seeing. If you flatly refuse to believe we tortured anybody in the war against al qaeda, probably you will be angered by the film, but I'm betting you haven't a shred of proof one way or the other. I don't, and neither do the filmmakers. So put your crystal balls down and try to enjoy."

","Film is an extraordinary medium in that it empowers filmmakers to sign a unique contract with its audience that is intimate, passionate and daring. <br/><br/>Following their success on The Hurt Locker, the Oscar-winning creative duo of director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal deliver another hard-hitting pact with Zero Dark Thirty. <br/><br/>In contrast to fictional characters thrown into the terrifying real world of Iraq in Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty is distinctive and singular in its approach; it is an amalgam of action-film and investigative reporting and drama, neither a work of fiction nor a documentary but an exciting hybrid that tracks closely what is known of the intelligence hunt for Osama bin Laden, while shedding new light on the secretive, dark corridors of the war on terror. <br/><br/>The intriguing title is military jargon for the dark of night, and also refers to the moment—12:30 a.m.—when the Navy SEALs first stepped foot on the bin Laden compound.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is an exceptional film that not only connects with the Bigelow on a personal level – as a filmmaker who made history as the first woman to earn a Best Director Oscar statuette – but a story who details the personal quest of a woman in the militant male dominated world of brutal interrogation with terrorists. <br/><br/>What makes Zero Dark Thirty extra special, is that it is a film that feels as if someone is letting you in on a secret no-one knows about.<br/><br/>Yes, you might have heard of the detailed account on news reports or compare it to films dealing with similar issues, but the silent voyeurism of Zero Dark Thirty is captivating from start to finish and never lets go.<br/><br/>Like a lover whispering a secret info another's ear, or a friend gently sharing scandalous information, Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty is an intimate odyssey into what we think we know and ultimately reveals a close encounter that is sacred and private.<br/><br/>We share this journey with Jessica Chastain, who delivers an astounding performance as a woman who crosses the threshold into a world fraught with danger, where nothing is certain and everything is at risk.<br/><br/>Equally impressive is Australian actor Jason Clarke, a CIA operative who initiates her right away into the wrenching work of handling hostile terrorists; Clarke's personal experience come into play in CIA interrogations, but they also get mixed in with adrenaline and primal instincts as frustrations grow. <br/><br/>The sensationalistic operation of searching for bin Laden is extremely difficult to capture, but Boal's meticulous screenplay confirms his status as the world's best investigative reporter, journalist and screenwriter; his intensive research, personal experience and passion indisputably results in a great story told with meaningful intent. <br/><br/>What makes Boal's screenplay unique, further amplified and complimented by Bigelow's perceptive interpretation, is that it never becomes a subjective scrutiny, but an objective observation that respectfully tells its story without becoming exploitative.<br/><br/>With subject matters dealing with headline news it is so easy to use it as a tool for propaganda, but Zero Dark Thirty never exploits its story or characters; in fact, it strips the characters bare and reveals a vulnerable fragility that further enhances the emotional connection between film and its audience. It allows its audience to have an empathetic understanding of issues that are controversial, and through its unique medium, adds incredible texture through its visual exploration. Zero Dark Thirty shares its secret honestly without becoming scandalous.<br/><br/>It is extremely difficult to fully grasp the world Zero Dark Thirty explores; a warzone and hunting ground where a cat-and-mouse hunt ensues between rebel and oppressor; between terrorist (or freedom fighter) and militants, between political activists and its victims, between the filmmaker and its audience. <br/><br/>It's a dangerous and terrifying odyssey into the human condition, where right and wrong blur into a surreal nightmare.<br/><br/>Can anyone ever fully comprehend what motivates acts of terrorism, revenge or obsession?<br/><br/>These are personal issues and with films like Zero Dark Thirty, it becomes communal, where storytellers effectively communicate the essence of fear and fantasy with its audience. <br/><br/>This experience of sharing fosters listening, and in the end, allows us to be closer to a truth we mostly avoid or refuse to understand.<br/><br/>Bigelow skillfully manages to create a suspenseful telling that is revealing, but equally meaningful; she proves that it is vital to be fully immersed in a visceral experience, one that is visual and explodes with emotion. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty poignantly examines the affect of our actions on those who share our lives; our loved ones, families, friends, strangers and in particular children. If what we do defines who we are, Zero Dark Thirty definitely exposes the darker side of humanity and how its cruelty can destroy the world, but also shows how important it is to remain human, no matter how difficult it can sometimes be to endure what few understand. <br/><br/>A film like Dark Zero Thirty sets us free from unknown fears and paranoia, and in its own way, becomes a dignified freedom fighter for self expression and human rights"

","One of the best movies I have seen in ages. Director Kathryn Bigelow did a masterful job with Mark Boal's script. <br/><br/>Yes, it was about the hunt for Usama bin Laden, and yes it was about Seal Team Six and their raid on the compound in Abbottabad, but it was so much more than that.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine one awards show or one critics choice for Best Actress no going to Jessica Chastain, who played Maya (Jen in Mark Owen's ""No Easy Day). She nailed the character. She made the film. She was it.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the film just circled around Maya. She was the one driven to find UBL. So driven that the real CIA agent depicted by Maya was denied promotion because she managed to really irritate her superiors. Go figure. <br/><br/>So driven that the CIA Station Chief that replaced Bradley (Kyle Chandler) told her he found it easier just to agree with her.<br/><br/>I was understandably impressed by Maya because I have found myself in that situation many times in the military, and in government service. ""We're 60% certain"" is often as far as most bureaucrats will go. They talk mission, but it is the resume that drives behavior. You see this in those around Maya, and it makes her drive to succeed so much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I was not expecting the ending. It was not typical, but IT WAS PERFECT.

","Kathryn Bigelow seems to have found herself a niche in thrilling, gripping War on Terror films. I absolutely relish her masterful The Hurt Locker, and Zero Dark Thirty is as fine a companion piece as can be found.<br/><br/>Inevitably for a film about a decade-long manhunt, the first third (with false leads and an overwhelming sense of helplessness) drags mercilessly. The first time I ever watched this film, I turned it off thirty-five minutes in and went to sleep, before I came back to it and was blown away by the far better paced and high stakes second and third acts. A series of explosions are catalysts in the film - I just love the way Bigelow does explosions. Its all dust and vibration, no excess of flames that would make it feel like a Michael Bay or a Roland Emmerich. Its understated and thoroughly believable. <br/><br/>Pacing or not, Bigelow is a master director. She knows how to film tension and pain like no one I've ever seen. Her cutting between the lead up to the bombing of Camp Chapman and Maya's instant messaging screen to her friend is so brutally effective its almost sadistic. The storming of bin Laden's complex is so well directed that I was taken out of the film and put there in real life - only when Maya appears back on screen did I remember this was a film. Zero Dark Thirty is very much a sum-of-all-parts film, and the film's cinematography, sound, visuals and editing comes together spectacularly. Above all else, I can feel Bigelow's mark on the film, just as I can in The Hurt Locker. I maintain to this day that the 2012 Oscars accidentally nominated the 5-9th Best Directors instead of 1-5, because the omission of Bigelow (and Affleck, Hooper and Tarantino) is inexcusable.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is a powerful actress - probably my favourite working today - and she's in her element here. Not many actresses could turn from a loveably ditzy housewife to a determined woman seeking to find and kill the world's number one terrorist. See one scene in which Chastain screams at her Station Chief for the single reason why she got a well- deserved Oscar nomination. But unlike Jennifer Lawrence, who undeservedly took home Oscar gold that year, Chastain's performance is impressive beyond one shouting scene. I fully believed that Chastain - who is a stunning actress - was a withdrawn, friendless obsessive with certainly no husband prospects. I completely bought into her reactions as the culmination of her life's work leaves her without a sense of direction. She completely earned her Golden Globe, and its tragic that she lost the Oscar to Lawrence."

I'll give you the tl;dr (too long didn't read) version now - OMG some of the reviews here are hilariously bad, - movies are terrible vehicles for historical events, - and strangely enough; good movie. <br/><br/>I like to read the reviews on IMDb in a voyeuristic oh what did everyone else think of it kinda way. Everyone's got a point but my issue is with people writing like they KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY CLEARLY DON'T. I sometimes want to hear the word of the man/woman on the street, but lets face it, the man/woman knows little about well.. directing.. the behind the scenes.. script writing.. well everything really. Most people writing/reviewing here are not professional critics or even budding critics in the making, they probably didn't study acting, drama, script writing or set design. They may not even know the director's name or anything about Italian cinema and there is a strong chance some of them thought Shrek 3 was OK. My point is I am interested in your opinion but please be honest! If you are not very smart and the amount of the color red in the film left you feeling queasy, great! But before you start judging the script, acting, or hair styling was, trying adding a constructive argument and even some cross referencing e.g. the hairstylist in Indiana Jones really captured the style of the times whereas in this piece of garbage etc.. It was bad because I didn't like it seems to be what Im getting from the negative reviews here. I enjoyed this statement very much, ""I don't think the writer knows how to correctly use the F-bomb and other variations"", it is not the writer of the film that needs to be worried about their writing dear fellow. <br/><br/>I have strong reservations about historical movies because in essence they are false. Based on actual events does not mean real events. It annoys me greatly when I watch a movie or documentary and delve deeper into the subject only to find facts have been altered to serve the entertainment of the piece. Movies are a falsehood, a fabrication, but yet they can also contain deeper truths that plain facts and figures can never convey. In my opinion its a fine line to tread so I was not anticipating that a movie about the death of Osama Bin Laden could possibly be a good thing. I don't even 100 percent believe that half the truth of the entire situation regarding 9/11 is and ever will be presented, but that's just my dumb opinion right? <br/><br/>So after saying all that I really enjoyed this film and was even quite moved by it, there is a very poignant and rather sad/theme statement about humanity that left a lasting impression on me. As a piece of art and entertainment the movie worked for me rather well. Now get back to typing your wonderfully well thought out reviews friends!"
"dfle3","7","3","5","12 February 2013"," Odd mix of the serious and Hollywood action movie clichés. 75%
","""Zero dark thirty"" is quite a dry movie and its endgame looks like a fly-on-the-wall documentary. Presumably you are well aware of the resolution to this tale - the execution of Usama bin Laden - but are more interested in how his demise came about. In broad-brush strokes, this movie tells that story. One issue I had with this movie was just being baffled about who the terrorist suspects were...I feel that an actual documentary would just have a greater feeling of coherence as to how all the pieces of this 'jigsaw' puzzle fit together. Sometimes it wasn't even clear to me what was happening...as with that sequence where a Middle-Eastern looking man is fitted up with...something...and notices women (?) in full Muslim cover around him.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain stars as ""Maya"", a crucial C.I.A. operative in the hunt for U.B.L. At the start of the movie she comes across as being a work experience would be torturer or something and progresses to following the script on the strategy to get information from detainees. I'm not exactly sure what Maya's position title in the C.I.A. was, but she does appear to have more clout than her seniority would dictate.<br/><br/>I am curious if many of the comments she makes actually happened. It's these moments of bravado or vulgarity which make this movie come across as some sort of Hollywood action movie...Maya's dialogue is along the lines of something you would expect Eddie Murphy to utter in ""Beverly Hills cop"" or Bruce Willis in ""Die hard"". They didn't really ring true to me. Fair enough if she actually said this, but hopefully these weren't inventions to make the movie function as a C.I.A. recruiting ad. Other times Maya looks like a sitcom character or a Little Princess having a hissy fit. I have in mind that part of the movie where Maya writes numbers ostentatiously in lipstick on her superior's window. Again, fair enough if this actually happened, but if not, it just seems a clumsy way to make Maya look ""sassy"" or...whatever.<br/><br/>For a while I made a point of not reading reviews of this movie or articles which delved into it and the topic of torture. That was short lived. Before watching this movie I did read a couple of articles, one a review, I think, and one on the topic of torture. What I saw on the screen was not particularly horrific...I was perhaps expecting some stomach-churning gore as you might see (implied) on the TV drama ""24"", as practiced by the anti-terrorism agent Jack Bauer. There was nothing so bad as that...which is not to say that the torture you do see inflicted by the C.I.A. is not horrific if you imagined yourself being subject to it. It's just not horrific, in other words.<br/><br/>From my own point of view, I think there is one issue which is relevant which the movie does not cover...all the times that torture was inflicted on people who were actually innocent. In the movie, the tortured were always guilty, so ""the end justifies the means"", one could argue. If we saw depicted horrific torture which was of no purpose, our views on the practice could be challenged.<br/><br/>One of the articles that I read was ""Tortured justifications"" by Waleed Aly in The Age newspaper (07/02/2013?). His view was that since director Kathryn Bigelow got most of her information from the C.I.A., the movie is pretty much supports what they did. Before I had watched the movie, I did read Bigelow's article where she said depicting the torture in the movie was not condoning it. Years ago I watched a very interesting documentary called ""Operation Hollywood"" which outlined how movies which used U.S. military props or whathaveyou were subject to censorship by the U.S. military...in other words, they got to say how they were depicted...for instance, they insisted a story element from ""Lassie"" be removed...one which implied that the U.S. military might make defective products. The point of raising all this is just to suggest that I hope Bigelow isn't a C.I.A. dupe or apologist...the former charge being more serious, perhaps.<br/><br/>In any case, the torture was not that big of an issue for me. And I had even less problems with the U.S. taking the action it did against U.B.L. without authorisation from the sovereign nation (Pakistan) where he had been 'hiding'.<br/><br/>Points of interest: <br/><br/>* I did find the actions of one C.I.A. woman in this movie incredibly stupid (naive at best), which had devastating consequences for U.S. citizens...the one where she does not follow strict protocol.<br/><br/>* Was it necessary to shoot (kill?) U.B.L's wife? * I get the impression that a British actor played the role of a senior (government?) figure in this movie...and I wasn't convinced he was an American...I would have guessed it was the guy from ""The thick of it"" who swears a lot (I've not seen that series though)...but looks like I'm wrong on that.<br/><br/>* Usama bin Laden is referred to as ""UBL"" by the Americans...I had read somewhere that the U.S. made a point of spelling his name ""Osama"" as they didn't like the fact that he had ""USA"" in his name (i.e. ""Usama""). So, it's interesting that they call him ""UBL"" for that reason. Calling him ""Osama"" in general thus seems like a propaganda move.<br/><br/>* Surprised to see two Australians in this movie...the Edgerton brothers.<br/><br/>Personally, I would really like to see a movie or documentary concerning the events following 11/09/2001...the fact that the president of the U.S. (George W. Bush) ignored all evidence of Saudi Arabian involvement (the Bush family had lucrative relationships with Saudi royalty, I think, who were implicated in the attacks on U.S. soil in 2001. He also waged war on a nation not involved in those attacks on U.S. soil...as a useful diversion since Saudi Arabia was implicated?"

","Zero Dark Thirty (2012) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Excellent thriller from Kathryn Bigelow about the decade-long hunt for Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. ZERO DARK THIRTY ended up hitting theaters less than a year after the final events in this movie so one might think we'd end up with a rush job but that's certainly far from the truth. What's so amazing about Bigelow's direction is that everyone watching this movie knows how it ends yet she still creates a wonderful tension that grabs the viewer during the opening scenes that are just audio and holds them till the very end once the mission starts. This movie clocks in over 2 1/2 hours yet it never feels long, which is another compliment to Bigelow because the majority of the movie is mostly dialogue. You have to give the director credit for making the dialogue scenes just as tense and compelling as the more controversial torture scenes and of course the scattered action throughout the film. Another major plus are the terrific performances with Jessica Chastain leading the way as the CIA agent who has given her life to bring bin Laden to justice. Jason Clarke, Mark Strong, Jennifer Ehle and Joel Edgerton are also excellent in their supporting bits but everyone from the lead to the smallest roles are perfect here. The visual look of the film really puts you in the middle of the action and I think this helps with the tension and especially during some of the terrorist attack scenes. The same is true for the torture sequences but I give the director credit for just telling the story and not shying away from anything or trying to play political on either side of the subject. I like the fact that the film doesn't preach at the viewer and instead just tells its story. The final sequence is certainly incredibly thrilling and seeing how Bigelow managed the various visuals is quite an achievement and it works beautifully. ZERO DARK THIRTY is a political thriller at its very best and one of the best directing jobs out there, which just once again proves how smart the Academy is."

Unfortunately those that criticize this are surprisingly ignorant, or purposefully deceitful. If you want convincing evidence that EIT's were instrumental in keeping the world safe and in limiting terrorists, you must check out the book Hard Measures from Jose A. Rodriguez the former chief of the CIA's clandestine service.<br/><br/>As far as the action sequences and the plot line go it is as good as can be expected from Hollywood. They are intense, well choreographed and get the point across. Of course they depict some of the most secretive and poorly known groups in our intelligence and military services so the fidelity is always suspect as it was likely someone's interpretation. As a soldier myself, I always find inconsistencies and dramatic twists that affect the accuracy and veracity of these kinds of films, but none that necessitate discussion here.<br/><br/>Overall the gestalt of what transpired is all there. Bad guy does something terrible, we dedicate a wonderful group of highly trained and completely committed men and women to finding and killing him, and at the end it all works out with the bad guy being dead.<br/><br/>I recommend that you see this film, it's definitely worth it."

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a masterpiece. Bigelow does an outstanding job of making the first 2 hours of the movie seem like 10 years, without boring the audience. The film is filled with its small ups and deep downs but all prepares you for a momentous ending. It dos an outstanding job of hooking the audience with an intense interrogation scene to open the movie up. The first two hours of the film are nothing less than genius and a task that many modern directors could not accomplish. Rather than bore us, she keeps us on the edge of our seats by throwing in surprise bomb explosions and surprise action sequences. Rather than tell us the main characters feeling, she lets us grow to know the character to be more than just a character. She makes you feel the despair and hopelessness that the main character feels throughout the film. We also see the maturity of the main character progress throughout the film, starting as a young agent, and ending as a hero. The ending scene is arguably one of the best scenes ever. You feel as if you live within the moment as the soldiers slowly and swiftly raid the compound and they make you feel as if you've accomplished something after the mission has ended. This movie is an overall masterpiece that is rare in the motion-picture business today."
"mina_legolas","6","8","20","8 January 2013"," A splendidly shot yet hollow and soulless film
","Let me begin by saying the positive side of things - the pacing is really good, occasional scenes and the finale are very intense and the film is overall very well shot. That being said, it is a soulless hollow film based on unforgettable true events which could have been handled with absolute care and precision in characterisation and storytelling yet still providing the thrills and entertainment, like Argo. This film has no hugely interesting characters, the acting is nothing above average, I don't see how Jessica Chastain staring into space, being very frustrated, angry and saying ''motherfucker'' a lot means fantastic acting. The only actors who did a good job were the Middle Eastern ones and they usually ended up being on screen for a short while or just get tortured. James Gandolfini stood out for me despite his short time on screen and not because of how greatly interesting his character was, just because he will always be the unforgettable Tony Soprano. So moving on from characterisation, the film shows many events throughout the past 10 years leading up to Bin Laden's capture. These were very well shot yet failed to provide any huge deal of suspense, grit or excitement (aside from the occasional short scene) and in general the storytelling or screenplay had nothing impressive to show. To say I love The Hurt Locker a great deal but I hope this doesn't win any Oscars for Bigelow although I can see it probably will because the Academy can't wait to get their hands all over this American political propaganda of a film and its re-telling of what could have spawned one of the most intelligently done thrillers of at least the past five years. Having said all this the excellent manner in which it was shot, the few thrilling scenes/good finale and its pacing still allows me to give the film some respect."
"arnieiam","10","11","30","4 January 2013"," Insanely well done
","Who knew that the director of Point Break would make one of the best films I have seen so far. You thought the Hurt Locker was good.<br/><br/>Now the Hurt Locker when I saw it, I couldn't find a story out of it. This movie is based on true events, so there is an excess of story. The actual manhunt for UBL goes back to the Clinton administration in the late 90s. The story here actually starts in 2003, and the screenplay does a good job in actually keeping the progression of the plot pretty linear. You can actually keep up with it and it trims a lot of the excess information. The movie focused solely on one narrative from the point of view of a single CIA agent who is obsessed with finding a certain courier.<br/><br/>Now the actress who plays the CIA agent is very solid, I really enjoyed her screen presence. She really convinces you that she is thorough, dedicated and methodical and at the same time you still notice that she is hot. And the supporting cast were pretty good too.<br/><br/>You will also notice that some of the lines are kind of cheesy or the delivery of them were cheesy. For example 'he is one of the disappeared ones','I'm the mother****er who found the compound', 'what convinced you? (guy waves his hands around) her confidence' or 'I'm not your friend. I'm here to break you'. Seriously we didn't need lines for the trailer.<br/><br/>The authenticity is what really struck me. I am kind of suspicious as to how production manage to reproduce the surveillance footage of the compound. Hmm. Also the torture scenes, wow, they really make you uncomfortable. Is the film pro or anti-torture? Or is it that they just want to present you with the hard truth? Still the director decided to take some artistic liberties, such as the depiction of the Marriott bombing, which you will see what I'm talking about or actually notifying the SEALs who their target is days before takeoff to name a few.<br/><br/>Speaking of which the last half hour is intense. We all know what happens so this isn't really a spoiler. The realism of the event was phenomenal, showing every maneuver and breach etc. So if your expecting some sort of Rambo like shoot out... umm no.<br/><br/>What I actually really liked about this film was that it really didn't on the religious aspect that much, in fact barely at all. Generally films about Islamic terrorism like Executive Decision, The Siege, Body of Lies and The Kingdom always have this message of religious tolerance. This movie, like me, doesn't care about that at all. It just outlines who the bad guys are and how they operate. It doesn't explore the topic of their ideological motivations that much, but in one or two scenes they do talk about their financial motivations.<br/><br/>All in all this is a really well done, gritty production and I don't think personally it glorifies or antagonizes anyone. It just shows what happened. OK there maybe a small chance where some guy in the theater may go 'USA! USA!'."
"cprust","10","7","17","13 January 2013"," One of the Best Movie in the Recent Memory
","There has been so much controversy surrounding this film and the fact that it was only released in a few theaters up to now made it frustrating to just listen to debates and have no input. Well, I finally got to see it and here is my two cents on it.<br/><br/>First off, I would recommend seeing this movie with other people. I left the movie a bit dazed and it was a big relief to talk to the people I went with about what had transpired on the screen. But anyway, onto the movie.<br/><br/>The fabled torture scenes at the beginning of the movie are indeed every bit as horrible as people have said they are. I'm not particularly squeamish (I've seen Saw and Hostel) but there was something deeply unsettling watching the scenes. I couldn't quite put my finger on it; maybe it was just the fact that in other movies that try to deal with this subject (such as in the horrible Samuel L. Jackson movie ""Unthinkable"") everything seems to go too smoothly, practical matters are just completely ignored. But this movie does address the little things. For example, in the first water boarding scene the interrogator, Dan, holds the detainee down but forgets to bring the water jug with him and realizing his mistake he shouts to the new agent Maya (our main character), to bring the jug over. There isn't any complex system or advanced machinery, there is just Dan, Maya, and a few ski masked, covered men. It may not seem like much, but to me these little annoyances and details seemed to add authenticity and made it all the more unnerving.<br/><br/>It could be that I missed something (this is one of those movies it would be good to see twice) but it seemed to me that the information obtained from the detainee that had been tortured was also obtained from numerous other detainees that were not being tortured. I certainly did not come away with the impression that torture was indispensable to finding Osama Bin Laden. I actually can't really see how anyone could construe this movie as pro torture, but I suppose everyone will have their own opinions on that point.<br/><br/>The intelligence gathering aspect of the movie (most of the middle section) is portrayed as hugely pain staking and almost single handedly run by the determined (borderline crazed) Maya (excellently acted by Jessica Chastain). I won't say anything more on this part because it is very complicated and I wouldn't like to ruin anything if you haven't seen it, but suffice it to say that it is every bit as gripping as the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Which bring us to the raid of UBL's compound. I think that this half and hour sequence will go down as one of the best ""action"" sequences in movie history (I say action, but really it is slow and methodical). It is different than similar sequences in other movies because no one is portrayed as heroes. There is no epic music playing in the background. The SEALS aren't super humans (like in Act of Valor), just very competent operators who approach the mission methodically and efficiently. They are brutal in their approach, killing everything that they perceive as a threat and riddling the corpses that they shoot with even more bullets when they are down (understandably wanting to protect themselves). Finally, when UBL is killed, there is no dramatic scene. In fact, we are not even aware that he was killed until a minute or two later. Everyone in the whole theatre was leaning forward throughout this sequence. It was truly a remarkable sequence that will go down in movie history.<br/><br/>There are so many aspects of this movie to talk about that it is simply impossible to capture all of them. Above all the movie makes you think. It is not just pro American propaganda (quite the opposite in fact). I walked out with more questions than when I walked in. I think that's good thing."

Zero Dark Thirty is a glossy, oversimplified, distinctly Hollywood re-telling of the CIA's version of how the Osama Bin Laden hunt went down.<br/><br/>Every character on the roster can be described in 2 words: tough guy.<br/><br/>I imagine the casting department had fun auditioning all the potential actors. ""Can you read that scene again but without a hint of a soul? Also say your lines as if you're trying to impress your high school prom date. You know, be a tough guy!"" (Even the women)<br/><br/>If you can see where this is going, congratulations, you have a brain and will probably dislike this movie. Zero Dark Thirty attempts to glorify everything the USA did, and it does this by portraying the CIA as a tough guy, too-cool-for-school gang of superheros. Torture, ""accidentally"" killing civilians and general ignoble behavior is glorified because, tough guys are always right, and they get the job done. Because they're cool.<br/><br/>If you've seen ""The Spy Who Came In from the Cold"", an excellent EXCELLENT espionnage thriller about how the USA obtained intelligence during the Cold War and the repercussions thereof, then I can explain Zero Dark Thirty in one sentence: it everything that ""The Spy"" was not.<br/><br/>The whole movie seemed like all the rejects from Predator and all the rejects from Aliens decided to have a tough off.

","Zero Dark Thirty (2012): Dir: Kathryn Bigelow / Cast: Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Ehle, Mark Strong: Powerful and emotional film about the biggest man hunt in history. It regards the thirty minutes after midnight that two helicopters invade the compound that is believed to be the hiding place of Osuma Bin Laden who was responsible for the dreaded September 11th 2001 attack that killed thousands of people. Jessica Chastain plays Maya, a CIA intelligence agent who devotes years of searching for Bin Laden. Arriving on the scene she witnesses her partner, Dan use methods of torture to abstract information from a terrorist captured. After another fellow agent is killed in Pakistan Maya becomes obsessed with seeing Bin Laden dead. Director Kathryn Bigelow gained great acclaim for Hurt Locker and here again she creates a war film that equals the best of her male counterparts. She also made the underrated science fiction film Strange Days. The raid of the compound with its night vision point of view brings greater realism as the Navy Seals storm through the concrete walls in search of an enemy that has eluded them for so long. Flawless acting from Chastain as the frustrated yet determined agent out to prove herself. Jason Clarke plays Dan who is growing weary of the interrogations. Joel Edgerton leads the raid into the compound. Jennifer Ehle plays another agent and friend of Maya's involved in a mission gone wrong. After the heartache of 9/11 this film allows answers and relief with regards to a date will forever be etched in our memory. Score: 10 / 10"

","I understand why this movie was made and I also understand why many people wanted to love this movie but unfortunately it proves to be a disappointment. Everything up until the moment they actually capture Bin Laden is extremely dull and not really necessary. When you really think about it, it took 10 years to track him down and real life is not always as interesting as the movies. I imagine tracking down Bin Laden would have been boring with time delays, dead ends, misinformation and just generally painful and that's what shows in Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>Do civilians really have the right or need to know what goes on when the government does their job to bring down terrorist scum. Maybe not. A television special probably would have been sufficient to inform the world of the circumstances following the take down of Bin Laden not a 2hr, 40min movie. If you can't handle the full movie fast forward to when they infiltrate the compound he was hiding in. You won't miss anything and you will still get the satisfaction of seeing how everything played out."
"Rickting","2","4","8","4 May 2014"," Zero suspense, emotion, interest. Dark, nasty, unpleasant, boring. Thirty minutes too long.

Critics may have been raving about it, but some things can't be explained. This is a terrible movie which aside from some good performances bringing the characters (sorry, robots) to life, this has little to recommend it.<br/><br/>This movie is very badly edited, and is literally just a collection of clips and events pasted together with the skill and art of a 3 year olds paper collage. There's no backstory or emotional depth whatsoever, it is simply a re-enactment. I could excuse that if it was well directed but it really isn't. None of the shots contain any meaning or emotional power, and the script is one of the worst I listened to in all of 2013. ZDT is more robotic than a Terminator, and it's far too long. It's hollow and totally un-enjoyable and something no-one should ever watch more than once. Kathryn Bigelow clearly can direct, but here she doesn't even really direct the film. The first 2 hours are repetitive, boring and unpleasant, with the first 40 minutes being a man getting tortured. The attack on the compound is not tense and is nothing more than cross cutting between night vision shots of other dark shots. I wasted an entire afternoon on this, and this really is an awful film which didn't deserve the critical acclaim it got. If you thought Avatar was overrated, wait until you see this.<br/><br/>2/10"
"advaitkamat","8","4","8","19 February 2013"," A pulsating thriller that may not be everyone's cup of tea.
","Following Osama Bin Laden's execution last year, there were many questions left unanswered and a lot of theories surrounding the incident. With ""Zero Dark Thirty"", director Kathryn Bigelow attempts to dissect the actual theory that compelled the CIA to raid Bin Laden's house and execute him, a theory, that the film states, came from a hunch. Now, I have no clue about what's fact and what's fiction in this dramatization of the events that transpired, taking into account the clamor that broke following the film's release, but as a film, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a fine one that works both as a thriller and as a documentary.<br/><br/>The film opens with a disturbing torture scene where a CIA interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke) tries to break the conscience of a suspect by subjecting him to various forms of torture. Of the few people present in the dimly-lit prison cell, one is Maya (Jessica Chastain) , a CIA officer who has dedicated her life to tracking down Bin Laden. Maya examines the statements of the detainees and thousands of interrogation videos of them for clues regarding the whereabouts of Bin Laden. The film follows her decade-long journey into procuring the necessary information that finally led to his execution.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is devoid of a plot, though Bigelow wallows us in a world where the line between fact and fiction is so thin that the former seems almost insignificant. Cramming ten years of fact, fiction, lore and rumors into 157 minutes is no mean task but Bigelow does it with such skill that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is seldom arduous or uninteresting. It has an effortlessly-created grim atmosphere which is imperative given the plot that strives on palpable tension. The film follows a non-linear narrative where the facts that made a difference are examined and argumented upon with a sense of enthusiastic urgency.<br/><br/>When a film is carved entirely out of facts, the license to fictionalize or imply something is a peccadillo. Some of the facts the film talks about are frustratingly implied rather than stated. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, working from their own research and some classified information, do not offer a plausible reason for the most important fact that the film states : how could Maya be so sure that her hunch is in fact- as we find out later- correct? In one sequence of the film that could well be the most important one, we see a whole room of CIA officers discussing the chances of Bin Laden being in a walled-house in Abbotabad, Pakistan, while the rest say that 'the chances are 60%', Maya says that 'the chances are a 100%'. The reason for her confident answer is never stated though, which is harrowing. The reason, which could possibly be a befitting answer to most of the errors of the film, is the hurried inclusion of his assassination that Bigelow weaves into the pulsating climax, a story, admittedly, was not the one she kept chasing for most of the film. <br/><br/>Despite the few problems I have with the film, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" disarmed me with its marvelous execution. It's fiercely alive and happening, cunning and sly when it's supposed to be and above all, peerless. Bigelow directs with assured confidence, occasionally punctuating the plot with nerve-wracking suspense and in the end, manages to tell a difficult story admirably. For me, the best sequence in the film is a mellow chase, where a few CIA officers attempt to track down an important suspect in the bustling market using only the signals from his phone. The sequence is a triumph, a dazzling concoction of film craft and artistry.<br/><br/>Of the performances, Chastain is sensational, playing Maya with such gusto and unpredictability that you're fully aware of her significance in the film. The rest of the cast are stellar, with Mark Strong doing exceptionally well in a small role.<br/><br/>Of the many films that have been made on 9/11, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is easily on the of the best though it's nowhere as good as ""United 93"" which, according to me, still holds the top position. But it's one film that bravely asks questions no film before has attempted to seek answers to, not to mention how the events it recreates are so believable. Though some questions still linger on, we must exult that such films, though rare, are still being made."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","2 February 2013"," Engaging with an even-handed approach but it is a bit dry and not all the hype suggests
","This film arrived in the UK with the critical praise and Oscar nominations all very fresh and mostly untouched by negative opinion. The story is one all viewers will know going in – or at least the ending is. It is a story that has such a potential for emotion, whether it is in the terrorist attacks played out on screen or the final raid of the film and this potential had me worried that it would be overdone. Indeed since the events happened there was always going to be a film made of it, the question was whether or not it would be a gloating, excessively patriotic affair made to make 'Murica feel good about the revenge aspect of Bin Laden's death. Happily this is not really the case here (although it is hard not to feel some satisfaction) because director Bigelow and writer Boal have delivered a very patient film that condenses a decade-long manhunt down into a few hours and done so without overly pushing any agenda so much as trying to remain distant and just play it out.<br/><br/>On one hand this makes for a very engaging film. Using Maya as our central character, we follow the story through torture, setbacks, small leads and ultimately into the risky raid. It is unfolded in a patient way which summarizes without making it a total simplification and, while it moves slowly, it does still hold the attention because the path is interesting and the destination important. The manner of the telling is important because it could easily have overdone the torture to condemn it, or alternatively overdo its use to justify it, but it really manages to do both and neither at the same time which is another reason it engages the viewer. It takes the same approach with the raid; those of us with Call of Duty style images in our head of what happened will be disappointed but it is actually more effective and tense for just how simply it is allowed to go – there are no excessive action move clichés and it is better for it.<br/><br/>That said, I don't totally see the film that the critics are gushing over because the downside of how methodical and even-handedly it approaches the story is that it does lack the emotional highs that a more manipulative approach would have brought and it is telling how often we get these in other films since their absence is something you'll feel even if you know you don't actually miss them. The character of Maya is one example; Chastain has been roundly praised for her performance but actually I found her quite blank – which fits the approach but does mean she is not a strong character at the core of the film. Likewise the matter-of-fact move through the story does occasionally drag – not in so much of a way that it lost me, but just in a way that at times it felt quite dry to watch. The performances throughout fit this mould although again it is a necessary evil to keep it balanced and not allow big colorful characters or set-pieces to overtake reality.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a really interesting and engaging film that benefits and loses from the even-handed approach that it takes. It is a good story and I appreciated that I was allowed to bring my own politics to the film, not have others heavily thrust onto me. This does mean that at times it can be a little dry and slow in the telling and this does hurt the film, but to me the benefit outweighs the loss. Not everything the hype would suggest but certainly a very well told story."

","Contains spoilers but lets be honest we all know the bad guy gets it at the end.<br/><br/>Whilst we all know the basic story of how the US special forces went in and shot Bin Laden this film depicts an excellent dramatisation of the story leading up to the event.<br/><br/>People have complained at not being shown the back story to the characters but I was happy with this as the film was all about the search for and ultimate death of Bin Laden, we didn't need to know if Maya had a happy childhood or if Dan was actually a normal person and not a psychopathic torturer. We were just shown the relentless mission of Maya to get her man. By the way Jason Clarke who played Dan does a fantastic job showing that for him torture of his prisoners was just a job. <br/><br/>I was surprised in such an American centred film to see the 7/7 bombings in London featured, I don't actually think this added anything to the story as there are other events such as the Madrid bombings which could have also been shown if more international terror events were to be used. <br/><br/>The actual raid towards the end of the film whilst very well depicted was for me the weakest part of the film as this is the part the viewer knows happened and I didn't think that as much time needed to be used to show this. <br/><br/>I feel that the way the film ended was very well portrayed with the sensation that a job had been completed and completed with success."

","And failed big time! I admit i am being subjective, but after watching Homeland, i cannot be but compelled to address this issue. I'm not a fan of anything, but Homeland does stand out! It's a thriller based on very powerful, complex, characters. You need top class actors for that! The drama of being a human being that has to manipulate, spy on, torture or turn on other human beings (guilty or not, friends or foes) and still never let go of everything that stands for humane however conflicting it may be, is a tough challenge, both on screen and in real life. Homeland does exactly that! What does Zero Dark Thirty do? It takes an impressive subject (and it is the only reason why this film won't get awful from me) and turns it into an essay or a transcript, if you like. It's like bringing the actors on set and telling them: Read! That's it... Whoever thought homeland is too dramatic thought wrong. ""...no, it can't be like homeland, intelligence doesn't imply emotions, they're a breed between zombies and accountants..."" And that's exactly how they look. Maya is like the zombie version of Carrie (even wears a similar shawl). It should have been a documentary, with a narrator to depict the events and the actors to fill in the gaps (mostly the action gaps). But it lacks even the authenticity it's supposed to have, like more archive material. Maybe the intention was to keep the characters somewhat anonymous, simply to emphasize the teamwork, but there are so many better ways of doing it. You still need actors that do more than just read. Jessica Chastain winning Golden Globe alongside Claire Danes for similar roles? No way that should have happened. It's simply unfair. I can't believe Chastain will even have a shot at the Oscars. So i return to the impressive subject aspect. It stops me from giving awful to this movie and it also lifts it in the eyes of critics, simply because it is impressive and it has a lot to do with American history in the making. For those who are content to read newspapers to get all the drama and information this world has to offer, this will be a good movie. For those who appreciated movies like JFK, Charlie Wilson's War and even All the President's Men, this movie will appear simply as a waste of money and time (both for the producers and for the public)."

It is an intense climax to the film.<br/><br/>This is a case of a very well-done flick that isn't as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. I am reminded of Schindler's List. It was not entertainment as much as it was a gut-wrenching experience. No one comes out of a movie like SL talking about how entertaining it is. I don't know of anyone who would see it a second time.<br/><br/>Which brings us back to ZDT. It would be worth watching a second time just to see what you might has missed. But this is not an adventure/action film. This is a film about politics and extreme violence.<br/><br/>When you leave the theater, you will be more informed than entertained."

","What's wrong with Zero Dark Thirty? Too many things to list here. Unless you are blind to the factual and ground evidence, most of the crap in the movie was overblown and over exaggerated. Sure, it showed CIA torturing prisoners but it never really showed the true picture. It painted a very bleak picture of Pakistan, never cared to show anything positive. I didn't find it as offensive to me as a Pakistani but as a story based on true events, they should have at least stayed close to the facts. Seals came to Pakistan like a Ninja and do you really think each detail that they show in the operation was correct.It was also pretty funny how they crashed their helicopter. Did it all look believable to you. Than there was one totally ridiculous scene in which Jessica shouts out a slur in front of the CIA director , he doesn't even seem to care about it. Lastly, look at some scenes like the one that showed the guys in Burqa and the other one where they were showing excitement by the CIA female agent, who was going to meet a insider of Al-Qaeda, who ended up blowing himself. It is like they were trying desperately to gather sympathy for that woman so that they can make the story emotionally stronger.Zero Dark Shitty was a bad movie if we look at the facts shown in the movie. It barely deserves a 4/10 on facts alone. As a standalone movie, based on entirely fictitious accounts, it is pretty mediocre and deserve no more than 5 to 6. Also it is too much lengthy and has a run time of 2 and half hour, most of which ends up being boring unless you want to see Chastain. And if you REALLY want to so Chastain so badly, just watch her in Lawless and skip this movie."

The subject matter I have always found interesting and it should have made for a good movie, but it is disjointed, jumping from year to year, and your never feel or bond with the characters. I personally couldn't stand Jessica Chastain's character and this is despite it being abundantally obvious that you should because of the politics and time passing whilst awaiting a decision. More character development would have aided this movie no doubt. The best thing about this is the wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat, which is suitably haunting, enduring and tense.

","Very well made. There's very little real military action, most of the story is tedious intelligence work. It's essentially a decade long search for Osama bin Laden's hiding location. Nonetheless, it's filled with tension and a few surprising turns of events. The CIA's portrayal is balanced I guess? The film doesn't shy away from ""rendition"" and the invasion of Afghanistan or the WMD in Iraq fiasco. The MC is a great operative, great intuitions and very persistent, but she's also quite cruel. She said she'd rather drop a bomb on the compound than using the special forces. There're kids in the compound, I'm glad they sent in the canaries instead. I wish they'd included more of Obama's input. Originally the CIA didn't have a exist plan, they assumed the diplomats would sort it out with the Pakistani government even if the canaries were captured, Obama insisted they made an exist plan. These little things show how politicians and CIA think differently."
"classicsoncall","8","2","3","30 April 2017"," ""In the end, everybody breaks Bro. It's biology.""
","While watching, I began to form the opinion that the character of Maya wasn't a single, specific person who might have 'broken' the case of finding Usama bin Laden. The FAQ board for the film here on IMDb answers that question. Maya, portrayed by Jessica Chastain, was a composite character of several female CIA agents who worked on the bin Laden case, both before and after 9/11. I don't know if knowing that before seeing the picture helps or not.<br/><br/>I thought the picture effectively demonstrated the excruciating detail and frustration of gathering evidence to pin down a shadowy figure like bin Laden. Additional viewings of the picture would probably help in keeping up with the myriad of characters involved on the Muslim side. This is highlighted by the fact that the first Abu Ahmed turned out to be a false lead. A sit up and take notice moment occurred for me when a particular negotiation for information rested on a deal for a Lamborghini.<br/><br/>The most impressive scenes for this viewer involved the storming of the compound in Abbotobad. The harrowing tension one feels while watching the Navy SEALs is juxtaposed by their own relatively calm demeanor in fulfilling their mission. That's probably what was most impressive about the SEAL team performance, composure under duress, even after one of the choppers went down before the mission even started.<br/><br/>I held off watching the film until now because I thought there was more of a political agenda attached to it. One might possibly argue that point with the torture scenes or the seeming incapacity of the upper echelon personnel in the CIA to make a decision, but I perceived the picture almost as if it were a documentary about the planning and execution of a complex mission to take out the world's most notorious terrorist at the time. On that level, I think the film makers did a good job."

","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty may not be as highly accurate as it is advertised but it does contain all the potent & explosive elements that made The Hurt Locker, the Best Picture Oscar winner of its year. Right from the beginning until the very end, the film generates an unrelenting atmosphere of severe tension & throughout its runtime remains highly gripping, suspenseful, very well detailed & is a superbly crafted film.<br/><br/>This is Kathryn Bigelow's most mature effort, much ahead of The Hurt Locker & her direction is very impressive. The writing is taut, very well-researched, finely detailed & nicely layered. The acting is brilliant as well with Jessica Chastain stealing the show with her intense knockout performance & the crew has tried to re-enact most of the events with as much authenticity as possible. Photographed in a documentary style, the film is finely edited & features a potent score too.<br/><br/>Yet in spite of what's great about it, the film isn't devoid of flaws & there were two things that really disappointed me. First is the absence of 9/11 footage when it gloriously displayed all the other terrorists bombings in full scale and the final climactic scene which, in my opinion, should've been entirely filmed in the night vision camera technique instead of jumping out from that into absolute darkness.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Zero Dark Thirty may not be suitable for all viewers due to its explicit display of torture & grim atmosphere but there is also no denying that it's one of its year's best films which promises & delivers a nail-biting experience to its viewers."
"eshwarmail","8","8","21","12 January 2013"," Perfect pacing, attention to detail and a fantastic lead performance.
","For a movie that had so much to tell, pacing has to be right and it was perfect here. Driving this epic story which the entire world has followed so closely through a single human going by a single lead may sound preposterous but may never be far from the truth as well. Another good aspect is that it gets emotional only to an extent to remind the viewer that the characters are indeed human but the entire movie is more about leads, operational details etc. I have closely followed Jessica Chastain's career from the time I have enjoyed her performance in 'The Debt' and she has never disappointed so far. Coming back from a superior directorial performance by Katheryn Bigelow in 'The Hurt Locker' she doesn't hurt her reputation here with her complex yet structured, sensitive yet brutal, emotional yet efficient handling of her movies. <br/><br/>Maya (Jessica Chastain) is following up leads on various terror suspects post 9/11 and is assigned with Dan (Jason Clarke). After chasing a few threads she arrives at a pattern that could potentially lead to a courier of Osama Bin Laden. Along the way there were disappointments, dead ends, loses her friends but what keeps her going is her infectious confidence and belief in her lead.<br/><br/>There are so many characters in this movie and one cannot go into performances in detail. But to generalize it, not one gives a bad performance. The screenplay could have been a little hastier in the first 20 minutes, but the director and writers might have done this intentionally to communicate to the viewer about the tedious process of getting information and during the later part of the movie this point is brought back to emphasize on the reason that they could not confirm the identity of Osama in his house due to the stricter detention rules and the tedious process. This might also be intentional but the background score or the lack of it did not work for me. May be the creative team might have thought this way it may look more realistic or just could not find the right theme they liked. Again the hierarchy and the working process of CIA is repeated in the most generic way and also plays the underdog card to its advantage. One more aspect I did not expect was the amount of screen time given for the actual raid itself. Based on the trailer I assumed they might just open the door to the compound and rest is history, but they actually go through the entire process of entry and exit which was good. <br/><br/>Perfect pacing, attention to detail and a fantastic lead performance."

Nope.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't call Zero Dark Thirty ""entertaining"", exactly, it is a superb piece of movie- making, all the more amazing when you realize that Osama bin Laden was killed on 2011 May 2, and this gripping full-length feature film was released a mere 619 days later. Director Kathryn Bigelow's mastery of the logistics rivals that of SEAL Team 6 itself. You'd think it would be gravy to get even a decent performance out of the lead performer (Chastain, playing dedicated CIA analyst Maya) in such a hurried time frame, but Bigelow doesn't settle for anything less than a brilliant one, assisted by rock-solid supporting performances and thoroly convincing sets, props, locations, and dialog, all wrapped up with the you-are-there immediacy of the final half hour, depicting the Abaddabad raid itself as seen thru the eerie green light of the SEALs' night-vision goggles.<br/><br/>What a terrific movie!"

"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","1","25 May 2020"," Zero Dark Thirty chronicles the decade-long hunt for bin Laden with profound neutrality.
","Darkness. A blank screen echoes the desperate screams and howls of innocent civilians telephoning their loved ones before the World Trade Centre crumbled over them. 2,977 fatalities. Over 25,000 injuries. ""9/11"", at the hands of Islamic fundamentalist group al-Qaeda, became the ""deadliest terrorist attack in human history"". The Bush administration swiftly launching the ""War on Terror"" to depose the Taliban, after the proposed extradition of leader Osama bin Laden floundered. Future terrorist attacks were imminent, with the CIA employing controversial systematic torture programs known as ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" to extract information from detainees in undisclosed black sites. Maya, a fictional CIA analyst tasked in locating bin Laden, soon becomes obsessed with potential lead Abu Ahmed that rapidly sends her down a monomaniacal path of danger, with growing pressure to save thousands of lives in the process.<br/><br/>Bigelow's thrilling decade-long depiction of events, in what is claimed as the ""greatest manhunt in history"", can only be described as uncompromising scintillating cinema at its most raw. The extremist behaviour of Islamic Group members have been widely reported, detailed and sensationalised by the media for countless years. ""7/7"" bombings in London. The Camp Chapman attack. The 2008 Mumbai attacks. All co-ordinated actions that drew widespread condemnation. However, dramatising these profound events to stir further hatred for extremist behaviour and imply celebratory national patriotism, are not functionalities for Boal's succinct screenplay. Both Bigelow and Boal, whom collaborated on 'The Hurt Locker', utilise modern history to insight political critique upon the questionable actions of the Bush administration and malevolence of al-Qaeda.<br/><br/>A proliferate narrative neutrality that produced an unyielding barrier of risk, querying the legitimacy of bin Laden's assassination and the gruelling process leading up to that pivotal raid. In the process, supplying sensitive philosophers and cowardly politicians with enough controversial ammunition to fire allegations from every direction. Supposed partisanship with the Obama administration, improper access to classified documents and pro-torture portrayal (more on that later...). These assertions are just that. Allegations. Because Zero Dark Thirty is a stark reminder of how ambivalent America's contribution to this war was, and that undoubtedly irked ""experts"" and officials.<br/><br/>Putting aside the historical politics for one moment, the essence of Bigelow's intellectual assertion comes in the form of Maya. A lone female operative shrouded in the masculinity of warfare. Her tenacity and tough-minded persona undeniably receives the most acute character development arcs ever written, acting as an independent pressured employee expending her entire career in chasing bin Laden and a conduit for the narrative's neutrality. Her initial reserved attitude towards approved ""enhanced interrogation"" allows viewers to question the permissibility of such authoritative techniques. Then she becomes obsessed, gradually succumbing to the ferocity of her work. Weeks, months, years. A decade passes. The pressure breaking her meticulous persona down, utilising any and all methods in finding bin Laden. Yet Maya combats the systematic ideologies of the CIA consistently to grant her fictionalisation a required neutrality that issues humanity. Chastain's exceptional performance is littered with nuanced emotive details that gingerly bestow a provocative rage. Commanding, intimidating and menial. Chastain fluctuates her power from quaint whispers to enraged shouts, yet never lets her guard down. Until the final scene. A scene that profoundly reflected the morality and ethicality of all the preceding events that happened over the decade-long manhunt. The first and only moment where Maya exerts emotional fragility. A cluster of overwhelming feelings. Relief. Disappointment. Melancholy. Maya is the representation of the entire Iraq war from an emotional standpoint, and her culminating frame of film is perfect.<br/><br/>Bigelow, alongside Fraser's clinically bleak cinematography, explores the dark side of war. Bolstered by a commendable supporting cast whom exude professional urgency to the matter at hand. From the desolate anticipation of the Camp Chapman attack, to the night-vision filtered compound raid of Operation Neptune Spear. Zero Dark Thirty never dissipates its tension and technical astuteness, despite the chapter segregation that does regrettably disjoint the elongated runtime.<br/><br/>Now, the torture interrogations. Waterboarding in particular. Famously generating a mass amount of controversy for its propagandistic nature and pro-torture stance. Makes you wonder why it conjured so much attention in the first place. To add on Bigelow's response, it is a part of history. It shouldn't have been, but it was. Consequently these government approved techniques should not be ignored regardless if it lead to bin Laden's location or not, and it absolutely does question the morality behind such actions. Maya's inclusion complying with that thought-process entirely. It categorically does not normalise torture, nor does its involvement endorse such issues. It simply provides exposure, arguably creating a statement against torture by implying the antagonistic behaviours of CIA agents.<br/><br/>There's a reason why Zero Dark Thirty was marred with controversy. There's a reason why Zero Dark Thirty pursues a neutral narrative. It raises a fundamental question. ""Was the death of bin Laden worth the price we paid?"". By showing the unspeakable, unflinching and the uncompromising, Bigelow audaciously challenges on an intellectual scale by using modern warfare as her weapon of choice. Producing a near-perfect film in the process."

","The main criticisms I have read about this film are either that it glorifies torture or that it is boring. <br/><br/>Firstly, I don't see how anyone can view this film in its entirety and leave thinking it glorifies or validates torture. The only thing it is guilty of is humanizing both sides through objectivity. You feel sympathy for the terrorist being tortured but you also realize the CIA interrogator (Chastain) is just a person too. I know it is popular to view the CIA as these mysterious evil sadists but ultimately they are people too, and apparently some of them are very attractive redheaded women. Their jobs come with the burden of national defense and when they have a bad at the office thousands of people die. And on their good days only a few people might die and they also might water board someone. Like this film I'm not defending their practices but I appreciate Zero Dark Thirty's objectivity even though some may not. <br/><br/>Secondly. this film is not boring at least not for me. A lot of people say that Lincoln is boring, which though I disagree I can see why. Civil War battlefields are usually far more compelling than back room political dealings however I think Lincoln is easily the best Civil War movie I've ever seen. Similarly, CIA grunt work might not be as sexy as a violent shootout but Zero Dark Thirty is richly layered with so much superb acting and suspense that I was enthralled for the film's entirety. If you go to this expecting to see something of a mix between Skyfall and Inglorious Bastards but with Osama inserted instead of Hitler and SEAL Team 6 instead of Brad Pitt and some Jews then you will also be disappointed. However if you go wanting to see a smartly directed thoughtful film that is more drama than action then you should be rewarded. <br/><br/>In summary this film does not glorify torture it merely remains objective. I greatly enjoyed it but it isn't for everyone. If you go into this movie wanting to see an almost 3 hour diatribe on torture then you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>This is off topic but I can't help but wonder whether it was both Argo and Zero Dark Thirty's seemingly positive portrayal of the CIA that kept Bigelow and Afleck from getting Oscar Directing Nominations. That might not be the case but I know that it certainly didn't help."
"myc4971","10","9","25","9 January 2013"," Boal and Bigelow's Best Yet
","Before watching this, I almost made up my mind that I wasn't going to like it. The trailer looked a total departure from the Boal-Bigelow team-up that I know. But at the same time, I have high expectations after reading so much fantastic reviews about it.<br/><br/>Lo and behold! This movie even topped The Hurt Locker which I thought was a landmark achievement in this particular genre! The masterful, intelligent, snappy and ultra gritty writing of Boal was translated by Bigelow into the silverscreen with gripping intensity with a very thoughtful approach. The material itself could have gone in so many direction depending on the treatment: a boring indie docudrama or a highly cliché action movie or an over the top political drama. But Bigelow and Boal has effectively steered this movie across genres. It almost felt I watched three movies!<br/><br/>And the movie is already sparking a worldwide debate! 1- Some are saying that the movie glorifies torture. I totally don't see this. If anything the movie went as far as stating that the interrogation methods mainly depends on the policy that the government made. All the torture in detention cells that happened in the beginning of the movie all stopped after Obama was elected. Dan was also quick to warn Maya about being caught as the last ""man"" holding the dog collar. <br/><br/>2- Some are saying that the movie is wildly inaccurate. Hmmm, but then again, how do we know if it's accurate when we really don't know what really happened. All the CIA files and documents are highly confidential and I suppose heavily redacted already by now. No civilian would really know the entire story. This is where the imagination of the writer comes in. <br/><br/>3- The movie will leave a lasting imprint on how torture is conducted. A lot of CIA agents (?)/military men are commenting that the movie over dramatized the torture scenes. They're claiming that in real life, these interrogation tactics are conducted under the supervision of a medical specialist and there are rules and standards. I find this hard to believe after pictures of Abu Ghraib came out. What's even more outrageous is that they're pointing to movies having an influence on how military interrogators do torture. I highly doubt it. What I saw in the Abu Ghraib pictures are so disturbing and I've never seen anything like that in the movies.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, Jessica Chastain is just pure perfection. I'm officially convinced she's able and capable of taking over Meryl Streep. She's just like a chameleon. Though her character was given so little to work with, she just magically presents us with what can be considered as one of the most memorable characters in cinema. And I'm not exaggerating. In the first 15 minutes of the movie,it was uncomfortable to watch her. She was even annoying, at times. She came across like an wannabe agent. She was acting tough as to opposed being real tough. But in one of the highlights of the movie which was a pivotal point for her character, there was a complete shift in how she handled herself. It's like the little warmth that she had in her and all her personality just totally disappeared. And then she transformed into this irreverent, impatient, ballsy and icy agent who just means business. She was the portrait of a woman driven mad by one goal. That's when I realized that it was part of her character build-up. A lot of posts from the message boards are ""crucifying"" Bigelow for putting feminist undertones in the movie. That's totally stupid. Maya could have been a guy it wouldn't make a difference. I've certainly didn't see any of Maya's co-worker treat her differently because she was a woman. If her superiors see her differently, it's because she was irreverent and marvelous at the same time. Chastain deserves to win the Oscars for her work in this movie. I think she will. I read a review that the movie could have used more time in building the back story for the character, I say he watch the movie again and watch Chastain closely. <br/><br/>Another standout for me is Jason Clarke who also deserves to get noticed for his role as a brutal and cold agent who just wants to be a regular guy.<br/><br/>I can't praise this movie enough and I hope more people can appreciate the movies of Boal and Bigelow. But sadly, the movies they make doesn't have that mass appeal. I'm just going to keep on that one of these two things happening: (1) they make something more commercial soon or (2) there will be more audiences who can appreciate movies that break the formula."
"mwburrows","10","14","44","5 January 2013"," The best film of 2012.
","Believe it. This chase-thriller is an absolutely cracking good time and the best $15 you'll ever spend. Zero Dark Thirty starts off with a high-energy pace and holds this throughout the film, thanks to both the script and effective direction that make potentially banal scenes engaging and exciting. Each act is more riveting than the last as the protagonists chase clues with high- tech gadgetry and stomach-churning torture - a subject that the film has been criticised for, but in my opinion it comes with no pre-packaged bias. The audience is left to their own morals to decide if it was justifiable or not, again, applause to the director and writer for framing it this way. <br/><br/>The loose strings begin to tie together and our CIA heroine becomes set on chasing a ""courier"" whom she suspects works for Bin Laden, although she is beset by doubtful colleagues and sceptical higher-ups, she sticks to her gut instinct and becomes quite the celebrity as her hunch comes up smelling of roses. <br/><br/>In the third act, we finally witness the moment we've been waiting for; the raid. Personally - and many of you might baulk at the thought - I think it is one of the best action sequences ever captured on film. The scene where the Navy SEALs share small talk on their Black Hawk choppers is eerily reminiscent of scenes on the Sulaco in Aliens; both in style and content. A brilliant and unique score adds to the tension, and as the raid begins you expect an adrenaline-fueled stunts extravaganza - what you get is quite the opposite, but in many ways much more enjoyable. The entire sequence from start to finish is something like 30 minutes, and is every second is utterly engrossing. You will not be able to look away from the screen. I found myself sweating and elated alongside the soldiers as if I was with them myself. <br/><br/>There is a low body count and a lack of massive explosions and fireworks. Instead, we are indulged in an authentic experience with military realism to spare and enough tension to power a nail-biting factory. Die Hard this is not. Soldiers move slowly and ponderously as they clear each room of the dark and dank compound, encountering new obstacles along the way. When the climactic moment comes you will find yourself starry-eyed as the soldier who fires the killing shot, but somehow, the event is rather nondescript and the world of Zero Dark Thirty keeps turning long after Bin Laden's death. <br/><br/>Go and enjoy Zero Dark Thirty. Your knuckles will be white and your shirt may be soaked with perspiration, but the narrative will inspire."

On a neutral point of view the topic of this movie is possibly only interesting to US Americans where the documentary style of this movie might serve as the rehabilitation of a national trauma. To the rest of the world the topic is what it is. He lived, he blew stuff up, he died. Wheres﻿ a movie in that except for Michael Bay? It's good stuff if you are into documentaries where you expect it to be boring but it fails as a movie. The 95 metacritic make me feel as if it's opposit day. It's not rationally comprehensible since this movie lacks so much that a good movie has to offer. Not because of the topic or the documentary style of the movie but of the bad craftmanship the director and producers showed. Worst of all was, since we probably all know most of the events that were depicted in this movie and especially how the movie must end, the real torture that needs to be criticized is the movie itself since especially the last scene appeared as if it tries to reinvent dullness. For the major part of this movie it is just plane boring. There is no such thing as an arc of suspense and the only emotion the movie manages to create is disgust right at the beginning when you partake in the torture scenes. I actually expected/feared that they also would have show how a man get's his head severed or his throat cut in some dark shag in afghanistan in every painful detail. Luckily this didn't happen. Yet on the climax of the movie - the final scene - the director desperately struggled in an attempt, to make a scene artificially suspenseful, where no suspense could ever be found and in the very last ending scene so stagy, that the most natural reaction you have to this cheesy attempt of pathos is to roll your eyes like an eightball on its way to the pocket. To me this is the most overrated movie i encountered on metacritic for one reason only: because Americans feel like this movie has to matter because of the subject it deals with. To everyone else it is revealed as the waste of lifetime it actually is where the strongest emotion it created was the feeling of relief when you finally could step out of the cinema and proudly say ""Yes! I managed to endure that movie!"" Still i would give this movie one point for its excellent scenery. Everything appeared impressively authentic up to the house and the stealth helicopters. This was extraordinarily well done yet it isn't by far enough to turn it into an impressing film itself.. or even a mediocre one SCREW THIS GARBAGE WE WANT CRASH BANDICOOT MOVIE!"

","It was SOOOOO so so so Hollywood.<br/><br/>Most of the movie was a snoozer.<br/><br/>They went overboard to make the Seal Team look like a bunch of misfit losers as in fat, un-kept, undisciplined red-necks. In all fairness, the cast members, as far as the Seal team goes, did a good job considering the material they were given to work with.<br/><br/>The photography was awful.<br/><br/>The screenplay pulled every selection possible from the smörgåsbord of cookie cutter Hollywood movie gimmicks that they could cram in.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain's part was written so poorly that if she was anything close to a good actress I'd have felt sorry for her. Honestly the stuff they had her do and say in this amateur hour was beyond the pale.<br/><br/>They left very important parts of the story out such as everything that happened after the killing. That would have made the movie more interesting.<br/><br/>The very last scene was so hokey that I really wanted to barf. All through the movie Chastain's character was the smartest kid on the block, she knew everything and could do anything. You know, a ""women are just as good as men"" lesson for all of us. Then, at the very end, she gets on an Army carrier and sits down and starts crying. GIVE ME A BREAK! She didn't even bother herself with acknowledging the crew member who asked here where she wanted to go. I guess if you're Superwoman you can do that. I wonder how many of the Seals that did all of the heavy lifting and dirty work cried.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a joke from start to finish. And that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Pretty disappointing."

","This was not a good movie. I imagine that even the most career minded CIA agent understands the agency exists to protect the American people, and the reason for chasing Bin Laden was to exact justice for the people who died during the 9/11 attacks. There was almost no mention of 9/11 in this movie. The portrayal of military guys was shallow as well. I can't imagine professional soldiers and sailors at this elite level would speak in such a crass and frankly dumb pattern, ALL THE TIME! This movie wreaked of Hollywood phoniness. I also can't imagine a high level CIA meeting being run in he fashion they were portrayed in the movie. The directer coming to sit with the lead character while she's eating was straight of out a dumb movie as well. I do think the lead gal character was very beautiful though."
"sooprcool","8","6","15","19 January 2013"," Well Executed Movie
","This movie was not what I expected but was very well done. Knowing Hollywood, I figured there would be a lot of dramatization and needless action/shooting sequences that had nothing to do with the capture of UBL. However, it came off as very realistic and accurate, as as far as the general public knows anyway. I suppose that Hollywood was trying, in part to support the presidents call for stopping torture. But it is impossible to hide the truth and the truth is that it was data gathered during earlier interrogations, to include ""water boarding"" that the information was gathered, leading to his capture. Thanks to a determined CIA agent who likely will never receive the amount of praise she deserves. I think this movie also shows us just how bad things are in that part of the world and how they will stop at nothing to hurt Americans."
"ford-boyce","10","5","12","9 February 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty is a fantastic film, filled with almost 3 hours of suspense and great performances
","Zero Dark Thirty is a film following the hunt for Osama Bin Laden directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who has done Point Break and The Hurt Locker to name a few. It stars Jessica Chastain as Maya, the woman who tracked down Bin Laden for years and responsible for finding most of the data leading to his death, Jason Clarke as Dan, an integrator who helps Maya, Kyle Chandler as Joseph Bradley, Maya's boss through the 1st part of the film, Joel Edgerton as Patrick, a Squadron team leader who is part of the raid to kill Bin Laden, Chris Pratt as Justin, a DEVGRU member who is part of the raid, and Mark Strong as George, Maya's other boss. The performances is where this movie stands out from many films. Jessica Chastain is perfect in this movie as Maya. She brings emotion to her role and words can't describe how great she is. Jason Clarke is great in this movie too. He was my favorite part of this film. He was quirky and had chuckle parts but could waterboard a a victim the next second. I don't want to dwell one the performances too much, but everyone one is great or fantastic filled with cameos such as James Gandolfini as the C.I.A. Operator and Mark Duplass as Maya's friend/partner for two scenes. Kathryn Bigelow did a fantastic job directing this film. My heart was beating from when the film began until I woke up the next day. Mark Boal did a great job writing this with great tone for the movie. This is a must-see for me and definitely go see this in theaters and I can't wait to buy this when it comes out."

","This is just a outstanding movie, I really liked the movie but it<br/><br/>would've been much if they reveled the face of bin Laden,<br/><br/>Literally no one knows whether he is Bin Laden or no? but overall its a good performances by actors who ever acted in this movie.<br/><br/>Highly appreciated for shooting at real places, but the dog didn't do anything in movie? in reality he did something to find terrorist. isn't he ? The truth is that the film, having been shot in India, is more close to the Indian reality than it is to ours. Jessica Chastain's character tells her colleague ""SUV's are very rare in Pakistan"". Nothing can be more farther than the truth. In India, yes, the trend of bigger cars is quite non-existent. But in Pakistan? I can bet we have more Range Rovers, Land Cruisers, Pajeros, Prados, Vigos and Lexuses than in most middle-sized American cities like Denver or Dallas. Streets are littered with such displays of status and power, and they are often used even in the villages by local landlords. The number plates did not match any of the ones in use in Pakistan, and the beautiful and juvenile city of Islamabad was shown as a shabby, dingy, worn-out city one could have called Hyderabad from India. Places like the Marriott Hotel are some of the most upscale places in the capital with little or no conservative practices, yet women in the film are almost always burqa-clad."
"Zaffy-1","5","5","12","26 January 2013"," mediocre I am afraid and controversial
","I saw the movie mostly for Jessica Chastain. Plus the story was supposed to be interesting. <br/><br/>But at the end I got really disappointed. Nothing impressed me in this movie. Kathryn Bigelow was in much better form in ""Hurt Locker"". The writing was bad so she didn't get any help from it either. I also found the editing poor. There was no rhythm in the whole movie, no power, no tension, no strong scenes, no character's development (basically no characters at all), nothing that made me care. Not even during the raid scene.<br/><br/>I think Chastain did whatever she good with a VERY mediocre material and a rather uninspired direction. As much as I like J.Chastain, I don't think this is her best performance,but as I said, not her fault. I just have this feeling that if she gets the Oscar this year it would be more for her overall presence in movies than in this actual role.<br/><br/>As for the torture controversy. Does this movie goes pro torture? in my opinion it does. The scenes weren't shocking or powerful so I don't think she wanted to condemn torture. She made them shown like just a daily routine of some good CIA agents that one moment they torture a guy and the next moment they wanna go for a coffee. Plus how many times we heard on the film that ""we cant get more info because we cannot torture anyone anymore""? which according to CIA it is a lie, since none of the info leading to find OBL was obtained by interrogation.<br/><br/>So I dunno if Bigelow did it on purpose but yes it is a pro-torture movie that presents one big anti-terrorism success as a result of torturing terrorists.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it had potentials that never reached. 5 only for Chastain and Jason Clark."

","Maya is a CIA operative whose first experience is in the interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks on the U.S. of 11 September 2011. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics.<br/><br/>For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.<br/><br/>The film makers say it's a Work of Journalism. But really, it's just a standard action revenge movie with the fingerprints of the U.S. Government all over it. That very same government that has proved over and over again to lie to we-the-people about everything from WMDs to the reasons they send our fine young men and women to die while killing innocents around the world in the name of defense.<br/><br/>The same ole guy did something bad to us and we got him script is standard issue. They do it in a very icey cool objective style.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain, actress and nominee for the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of CIA operative ""Maya"" in the new movie Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>From an entertainment stand point, it was compelling and interesting. But make no mistake, this is NOT a documentary, it's a movie; a Hollywood movie made by the Director who gave us The Hurt Locker: an Oscar winning best picture film that clearly made her friends in the bowels of Foggy Bottom.<br/><br/>Yes, I am talking to you Ms. Kathryn Bigelow. Yeah, you.welcome to the club! You are now the Frank Capra of our generation. You make propaganda films that support the ruling class and their narrative. Yeah!<br/><br/>But then again, this whole dam script is a farce.<br/><br/>To paraphrase screen writer Mark Boal he fell in love with his CIA handlers. What the heck does that mean? You mean, the number 1 spy agency on the planet? Those professional liar guys! Stop me now cause I am laughing falling on the floor. Really?<br/><br/>Now I am NOT just slamming this movie as a farce but I am talking about this whole dam Osama Bin Laden character. This Washington D.C. creation is one of the best characters created, well, probably ever! Well, scratch that, clearly Moses, Jesus and Mohammed trump this over embellished so called real person cartoon character. But that's a another story!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the Bin Laden character has now become a legend, a brand, an ongoing narrative that is now in the consciousness of the American public who can't seem to figure out that there was NO BODY, NO DNA, NO IMAGES, NO REPORTER ON THE SCENE and a government cabal that told us the reason we do NOT have his body is that we respect Islam and so we threw him into ocean with the sharks in the same manner of respect that we gave Saddam Hussein as we hung that Muslim by a rope. Hum? I guess Saddam did not practice the same kind of respectable Islam as Bin Laden right? Come on people! Geez!<br/><br/>Look, I don't know about you, but what novice just out of film school script writer came up with that idea? Geez us that's really sophmorish don't ya think?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, here we are and now we have it.

"kindtxgal","5","7","19","10 February 2013"," Zero Yields Zero Viewer vs Movie Empathy
","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a gritty but bland depiction of one of the world's most notorious manhunts for Osama bin Laden.<br/><br/>Personally, I could not conjure up any emotional foothold whatsoever, not even disgust during the interrogations sequences, and even the actual 9/11 event itself feels under dramatized. Emotional connection to the primary characters? Not a chance.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me figure out what Jessica Chastain is nominated for her role. She prissies around in solid black slacks from one scene to the next despite an allusion that Washington has sent her because she's a killer dynamo --hmmm, one who appears queasy at fairly tame interrogation sequences -- I've seen more graphic footage in former Vietnam movies.<br/><br/>The strongest part of the film is its depiction of the actual Special Ops scenario in Abbottabad, Pakistan which yields bin Laden. Extremely well enacted one feels they're running through the house with the soldiers.<br/><br/>I couldn't get a grasp of a plot line, story and again certainly ""zero"" connection with ANY of the actors. There are at times some pretty intense yelling at one another, profanity of course, but nothing HUMAN. None of the characters, including Jessica Chastain's role -- are ever given room to breath much less develop.<br/><br/>Without any plot or directive, the movie lumbers through an excruciating long, three hour, dimly lit montage of scenes to the final outcome history now knows."
"JBlueNote","8","7","19","11 January 2013"," Kathryn Bigelow Does It Again
","Kathryn Bigelow has done it again for me with her film ""Zero Dark Thirty"". It may have taken awhile to get to some of her scenes that almost make you too scared to see what's behind a corner, but those scenes were as equally exciting as they were in ""The Hurt Locker"". Going in to this film, I actually had something to compare this to besides what I and the whole world heard and what the U.S. government allowed us to see. Yesterday, I saw ""Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama Bin Laden"", and I definitely could tell the difference from that movie, or some film made for TV, to this one. That movie obviously wasn't as intense as this one was, but it at least gave you an idea of what the soldiers went through to get ready for their big mission. I felt that the main focus was on the main character played by Jessica Chastain. In the beginning of the movie, you see how she seemed so innocent and new to the task she was assigned to, but as the movie progressed, you see her become more and more obsessed with reaching the goal of this task, even if it meant her life or the lives of others. It kind of amazes you when you see the things the CIA did to finally reach 5/1/11.<br/><br/>Once the movie gets to the point where the dream team comes in, you notice how it automatically focuses on them a little and gets straight to the action. Once the big objective commenced, it was as if you were transported into the room where Obama, Biden, Hillary, and many others were while watching a masterpiece play before your very eyes. I'm glad that I saw this movie since I got to see a depiction of this event that I doubt our government would ever release to us. The movie does give you that sees of doubt regarding some things and makes you come up with your own solutions, but even if the #1 target in that compound wasn't him, seeing the carrying out of that objective was thrilling and epic at the same time. I think I probably held my breath a lot during it. Besides that scene, there were some other scenes that made me hold my breath since you could feel that something was a little off during them.<br/><br/>Overall, it's definitely a movie to see, but I don't think it was material for Best Picture. I really enjoyed it as much as I did Django Unchained, but I believe Django's nomination for Best Picture was right. Maybe my mom was right and that it got nominated solely on the subject and how authentic Bigelow made it. I got to give it to whoever designed the Bin Laden compound since it looked as so real you'd think that they were actually filming the movie in it. But still, I just don't see it making Best Picture. If it somehow manages to get that title, I'll be shocked. Overall, I'd rate this movie an 8.4/10 and would recommend seeing it if you want to see how we ""got"" Osama Bin Laden."
"dpugh47","9","7","19","11 January 2013"," A film that must be seen
","Important elements that make a great movie are ambiguity and paradox. Zero Dark Thirty has plenty of these. From the moment we are drawn into the movie with the black screen and the 9/11 telephone calls we are drawn into accepting this movie's dubious moral premise (the same as Django's and most other ""action"" movies) – vengeance is as important as, if not more important than, justice.<br/><br/>Going along with this fundament, and complaining about the immorality of the use of torture to gain information is but to clutch at the straws of political correctness and hypocrisy, as we are enticed into a morality that is only relative to 9/11.<br/><br/>The torture scenes are handled brilliantly: a ""fascist Dr. Kildaire"" says, ""If you lie to me I will hurt you"" with the same charm as if, ""Take these two pills and you will feel better"". The scenes are not gratuitous but we are confronted with our rejection through the reaction of the female agent, whilst being seduced into acceptance.<br/><br/>There has been criticism the resulting individual information can apparently be valueless, but it is the CIA's analysis of the ""patterns"" of what is said, made up, or not said that expose the clue.<br/><br/>The film is remarkably bloodless considering it is based upon and includes acts of terrorism. The military action is tense, cool, calm and efficient. A tribute to the Special Forces.<br/><br/>As for Islamphobic: the final scene which to me shows the female CIA agent reacting as though she has lost her virginity to the wrong man for the wrong reasons – would suggest, concerns of Islamphobia are but secondary to the troubling image of the moral collapse of the USA."

Here, there's just nothing else. Needlessly long scenes on the plot dilemma, just the usual things; and of course, the president denies all the methods, they show. No twists, or real accidents. All the events shown are expectable and the movie is just soooo slow, that I could release a sigh when it happened at last. Fun factor almost zero (maybe 2 funny scenes).

"Troy_Campbell","9","4","9","26 January 2013"," Intelligent, gritty and riveting.
","Filmmaking duo Katheryn Bigelow (director) and Mark Boal (screenwriter) follow-up their astonishing The Hurt Locker with another gritty, authentic inspection of the individuals faced with the most extraordinary duties during the Middle Eastern conflict. Exchanging a bomb disposal sergeant in Afghanistan for a female CIA agent (Jessica Chastain in an Oscar-nominated role) striving to find Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan, Zero Dark Thirty has a more emphasised thriller streak but retains the grounded realism and unsettlingly deep devotion to truth of character that made Locker such a riveting experience. We all know how the search for Bin Laden ends, however this film cares more about the journey; about the mistakes made, the chances taken, the opportunities missed and the decisions pondered over at great length. The tension is built remarkably well and the sparse pay-offs are smartly chosen, with Bigelow refusing to sensationalise the events though never cheating her audience either. Chastain is understandably garnering the plaudits but there is a wealth of small yet pivotal supporting performances that are essential to the film's success: Mark Strong, Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle and Joel Edgerton, among others, elevate proceedings. An outstanding effort that deserves a big screen viewing."
"in1984","6","4","9","26 January 2013"," Like Bigelow's Hurt Locker in quality and excess hype
","As with her first film Hurt Locker, Bigelow has managed to accomplish far more in film PR than in the films. Both I end up rating 65 of 100. They both have moments and are worth seeing, but far from being great or Oscar/Academy worthy films.<br/><br/>It fulfills the basic aspects of an intelligence action/suspense film and is interesting and entertaining in that respect, far more so than the last 007 film Skyfall.<br/><br/>This film is more of a recount of a history timeline with dramatic filler. It, like Hurt Locker, feels almost like a military propaganda film. Far more interesting and historically significant after Osama's discovery and killing is Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden (done in 2008), which was ahead of the military/CIA by 3 years in tracking Osama's location. Strange there's no reference to that actual documentary anywhere in this.<br/><br/>While the film claims to be made on ""first-hand"" accounts, it's mostly first-hand public accounts rather than Wikileaks/whistle blower accounts. While that make it seem more real, and some publicly known information definitely deserves repeating and more than a couple minutes of time in the news, it limits the film to the conventional. In addition, first-hand accounts don't mean true. If not verified or given broader context, they're like listening to any other story. Bush & Cheney could give you a ""first-hand account"", but that doesn't make it accurate or worth listening to.<br/><br/>Contrary to criticism, there's no endorsement of torture. If anything, it reinforces ""enhanced interrogation"" is actually torture. It also ties together a massive failure with torture-based intelligence."
"Radagast23","8","17","59","2 January 2013"," Controversial? Sure. Entertaining? Oh yeah
","A chronicle of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden from the perspective of the CIA culminating with the raid by Navy SEALS? Yes, please. While this year's Act of Valor had the action and authenticity, Zero Dark Thirty brings the writing, pacing, and true story to the big screen, and it's one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Relative unknown Jessica Chastain takes the lead as Maya, an abrasive and driven CIA agent that joins the search for those that are responsible for 9/11. Over the course of a decade, her grit and determination bring the ultimate goal within reach: finding enemy #1, Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>This movie is evidence that Kathryn Bigelow can continue to meet the high standard she set with 2008's The Hurt Locker. Even though the search takes place over a decade and there are many more setbacks than successes, Zero Dark Thirty keeps your attention throughout and has you on the edge of your seat for the gripping conclusion. The acting is superb; Chastain knocks it out of the park and the performances by Jason Clark and Kyle Chandler add a lot of depth (both of them should get more prominent roles in my opinion, especially Chandler). In the end, though, it's all about the story. With the book No Easy Day coming out last year, this story is already known to some, but it's always different to see it on the big screen. The fact is that Americans grew tired of wars that seemed to be producing no results, so it's a pretty big deal when our original target is finally eliminated. Whatever your political stance is, you have to respect how important this event was. The script was actually originally written before Bin Laden was killed (and was subsequently changed afterwards), so believe me when I say that this film isn't the waving of a victory flag. Instead, Zero Dark Thirty is a testament to how long and difficult the mission was.<br/><br/>The only real issues I had with this film are also something to be appreciated - the true story wasn't overly cinematic. I don't want to give anything away, but the end sequence just didn't feel as smooth as the rest of the movie. Go check it out and judge for yourself, though!<br/><br/>8/10"
"Kash898444","7","17","59","27 December 2012"," Surface readings don't do Zero Dark Thirty justice
","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a cinematic masterpiece and a fantastic examination of the post-9/11 era in America. Just like Bigelow's last work, ""The Hurt Locker,"" most of the film is presented without commentary; a nearly documentary account of the hunt for bin Laden, starting from the nascent days of the Bush-era War on Terror, to the more recent and more surgical approach of the Obama administration. But, in the same way as ""The Hurt Locker,"" the film builds to a climax where the main character - seemingly underdeveloped and superficial - comes to represent something greater than herself: potential and innocence consumed and slowly corrupted by the hunt that offers no meaning at its termination.<br/><br/>The raw nature of the cinematography is to be commended. Even the most difficult to watch scenes, the famed torture scenes, are presented without commentary, without music or any particularly fancy effect. Realism is emphasized. Hand-held cameras are used whenever possible. This realism builds to an amazing 30-minute climax at bin Laden's compound that brings the event back to life.<br/><br/>Surface readings of the film don't do it justice. The torture, while questionably successful in the film, does not serve to glorify the practice, but builds toward the film's greater point. Complaints about the one-dimensional and unexplained obsession of the main character fall under the same category. A deeper reading, more evident when the ending is taken into account, reveals the futility of the enterprise of the hunt for bin Laden in the same way Hurt Locker's final scenes revealed the obsession with combat and danger that had beset the main character throughout the film. It is not relevant that torture had ""worked"" if the end that it worked toward was never worthwhile in the first place.<br/><br/>Among the best films of the year and well-deserving of Best Picture."

Wow Jessica Chastain is perfect for an independent romantic cliché film but not for this type of movies. This movie was for a director like Jose Padiha (Tropa Elite) , Ron Howard or someone like that, that can make any script into a heart beating film."

","I believed that it was a terrible idea to make this film and, even after having watched and thoroughly enjoyed it, still believe (albeit, to a lesser degree) it might not have been the best idea. Certain things don't need to be publicized. However, the movie itself is terrific. It doesn't matter that all the details may not have been completely accurate. The point was to make a movie about how Bin Laden was captured and they managed to do it well. Every element is well executed and Chastain really made a name for herself (and definitely a fan) with her performance. I really felt like I was part of all the operations taking place. And the level of pride and patriotism evoked is an achievement in itself. Not only that, my heart was pumping throughout and especially towards the end. I would highly recommend this to anyone and would gladly watch it a second and even a third time. Watched 04/05-04/06/2013, written 08/08/2013."
"brando647","9","3","6","13 July 2013"," A Thrilling Manhunt and One Woman's Obsession with the Mission
","I've never been much of a patriot but that doesn't mean I wasn't affected by the events of 9/11/2001. I still remember where I was when the news broke (sitting in senior English class, waiting to begin an exam) and I still remember how I couldn't quite process the events at first. Nothing of this magnitude had occurred so prominently and close to home in my lifetime. And I still remember the anger towards those responsible that I soon felt. So, while I've never been a huge supporter of a lot of our government's behavior, I was always gung-ho with the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan (before everything turned toward Iraq and it's ""WMDs""). I became incredibly intrigued with the hunt to bring this modern face of evil to justice. ZERO DARK THIRTY is all about one woman's obsession with just that: hunting Osama bin Laden. Maya (Jessica Chastain) is somewhat new to the C.I.A. but she's got laser focus on her goal: locating the man behind the most horrific attack on American soil in decades. Her quest begins at a CIA black site where Al Qaeda operatives are being interrogated and drained of information through any means necessary, and over the course of the following ten years she will risk her career (and at times, her life) in pursuit of bin Laden. Seeing as how this is a recreation of recent historic events, we pretty much know how it will end: with a team of expertly trained Navy SEALS and a seemingly impenetrable compound in Pakistan.<br/><br/>I've never seen Kathryn Bigelow's last major film, THE HURT LOCKER, though I have read the script (and don't recall much of anything about it). I just wasn't interested. The only war movies I've ever really been interested in focused on the Vietnam War (FULL METAL JACKET, APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, etc.). Modern warfare just doesn't grab my attention the same as Vietnam, but I was willing to give ZERO DARK THIRTY a shot based on the subject matter. I'm glad I did because Bigelow's account of the hunt for bin Laden is tense, exciting, and had me sucked in until the end credits began to roll. A lot of the credit belongs to Jessica Chastain. She brings a severe intensity to the role of Maya. Her character is driven, focused on the hunt and only the hunt. She's a keen thinker and uses her unique perspective to pursue leads that her superiors find too insignificant to bother following. Over the course of her ten-year mission, she watches as friends die and colleagues are shamed but she pushes on relentlessly. While the overall premise of the movie is the search for bin Laden, the movie is truly Maya's story. She's our hero and it's her quest we're following, even if she doesn't really figure into the final half hour or so of the film. Noinstead the final half hour is the pay-off of two hours spent following Maya's investigation.<br/><br/>Right, so there have been a lot of accusations against this movie with angry viewers labeling it ""propaganda."" And my response would beso what? What do you expect from a movie detailing the United States' hunt for its most hated target since World War II had us killing Nazis? The movie portrays America going to insane lengths to uncover each and every bit of information they can to bring them closer to their goal (so much so that the actual C.I.A. decided to come out and vehemently deny some elements of the movie). All of this builds up to a killer TEAM America: WORLD POLICE moment with American soldiers sneaking into Pakistan for a top secret operation culminating in the moment people have waited almost an hour and a half to watch. The propaganda complaints might not be unfounded, but I just don't care. It's an engaging movie with a real-world villaina villain that murdered thousands of innocent people. I'm not watching ZERO DARK THIRTY for the ""Hooray America!"" vibes but for the manhunt and the payoff.<br/><br/>The trick with a movie like ZERO DARK THIRTY is to go in with the mindset that you're watching a moviea fictional movieand not a documentary. Because that's what it is. I knowcrazy, right? This might be based on actual events but that doesn't mean it is 100% accurate. It is a film made for our entertainment. And it entertains. At least, it did for me. I thought ZERO DARK THIRTY was a great movie, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't normally care for these sort of movies."

","This was a pretty good film. While everyone liked the raid in Abbottabad, I found the buildup, the chase, to be very entertaining. Kudos to Jessica Chastain, with whom I was unfamiliar. There is a lot of comment about the portrayal of ""torture"" leading to leads on bin Laden, and terrorist attacks in general. I use the scare quotes to differentiate the techniques that the CIA used from real torture, such as that practiced by, say, Arab despots, or American Indian tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries. People say that torture will not get you real information, but they do not come to it cold. They extract information that can be checked, or that they already know, in order to judge the veracity of the terrorist in question. As it happened, most of the detainees had a mindset that they must resist up to a point, but beyond that, they generally sang. As for the moral aspect, this was strictly done to gain information, and was not punitive in nature. Anyway, the film is worth seeing."
"Forgotten_Conscience_Productions","8","3","6","6 June 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty Review: Where were you at Zero Dark Thirty?
","Funny thing, I actually don't remember where I was when the announcement was made. I remember hearing the news, and the emotions that came along with it. It was after all one of the biggest events of the 21st century, overshadowed only the World Trade Center attack of September 11th, 2001. You might even say that this was a defining moment of my generation. A watershed moment that was 10 years in the making that could end up defining how we govern and/or deal with the world when our time comes. And it is coming soon. Yet as I was watching the movie detailing how it happened, I was struck by the thought that I couldn't recall the moment I had heard.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about the film and controversy surrounding it, most notably regarding the torture and detainment of prisoners as a way of finding him and the representation of it in the film. I have to say, that the scenes in the film were hard to watch. Anyone who can watch this type of thing and not cringe should be examined by a psychiatrist. Which is not to say necessarily that the scenes were overly gory or violent. By the standards of some films out there in the torture porn genre, these scenes are pretty tame. They don't really push the envelope in any serious way of cinema.<br/><br/>I would say that the reason why there is so much controversy around this film is because we know that where in most films the characters being tortured or killed are entirely fictional. Given that this is based on a true story, it is harder to imagine that these people aren't real. It is more than possible that the characters in these films really existed. Their names and physical attributes might be different but there really could be someone out there in the world who was on the receiving end of this type of treatment, and that rubs people the wrong way. Very much rightfully so in fact.<br/><br/>Despite that though, I think that the scenes are necessary exactly for that reason. As much as Seal Team 6 should be commended for what they did, the people who were hurt along the way deserve to be allowed their place in history. As disturbing as it might be and uncomfortable as it is to watch they played a part in what happened and the ultimate result. If we are going to be outraged at the prospect of torture let's make sure we actually understand what it is that means. A lot of people in the Western world talk about having standards and only doing things which are morally right but they don't really understand the true extent to which people go through.<br/><br/>More to the point, if it was used in the process of finding and killing Bin Laden then let's not sugar coat things and gloss over it. Put it out there where people can see it and decide for themselves. Let's present ourselves as who we are rather than who we want to be. I may not like torture being used and I certainly wouldn't want it used on myself, but I don't presume to be morally righteous about whether we should use it or not. I'll leave that up to the people in a position to decide whether to use it. Voicing my opinion is one thing, but I will neither condemn or support those who I voice it to. Nor will I do that to Kathryn Bigelow for putting it in her movie.<br/><br/>Where were you at Zero Dark Thirty? I may not remember where I was, but this movie should be remembered and for more than just the torture being used.<br/><br/>To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/"
"socrates99","8","3","6","30 March 2013"," Despite all the bad publicity and the grousing, I thought this was brilliant filmmaking
","I resisted seeing this film for several political reasons. In particular I thought it would be a smear campaign and the worst kind of one-sided propaganda. But despite all the 'mistakes' pointed out in the IMDb, most of which I am not capable of picking up on not being from the Middle East, I was very impressed. As filmmaking, it's hard to fault on almost any level.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Chastain is not glamorized or even unduly prettified in this film. I didn't expect that at all. Instead she comes across as the hard-working girl next door. And the Pakistanis and Taliban, or Al Qaeda, are not unduly demonized either. Instead they seem more like real people you can actually believe exist, though I imagine the real parties would be far more exacting in their verbal assaults.<br/><br/>Though I didn't particularly like The Hurt Locker, I do like this film and have to admit that Bigelow shows enormous talent in putting this story on the screen. You would not think she would have as savvy an understanding of this subject matter as she does, being a woman. I might have desired a few small changes, having been in the military, but have no problem recommending her take."

","Hearing about director Kathryn Bigelow for the first time in connection to her ex-husband (and fellow film maker) James Cameron,I was disappointed to find out that her soon to be Oscar winning movie The Hurt Locker was sadly not playing in any cinemas near me,which lead to me deciding that I would keep a special look-out for her follow up to The Hurt Locker,in the hopes that it would be given a wider cinema release.<br/><br/>Being very impressed by the 3rd trailer for the movie, (backed by a haunting cover of Metallic's Nothing Else Matters) and also intrigued about Bigelow taking on a decade long spanning subject,I was thrilled to discover that the film was going to play at a near by art house cinema,which led to me getting ready to witness ""The greatest manhunt in history.""<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Ever since she was hired by the CIA shortly after she had finished high school,CIA officer Maya has made it her goal in life to do everything possible to capture al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.Joining up with a fellow CIA officer called Dan,Dan and Maya interrogate captives who are suspected of having terrorist connection.<br/><br/>Focusing a good amount of their time and attention on a terror suspect called Ammar,Ammar ends up giving them details about an old acquaintance of his,who he clams is now a courier for Bin Laden.Getting confirmation from fellow terror suspects that the courier (called Abu Ahmed) does exist,Maya is left confused and infuriated about finding the elusive Ahmed,due to there now sadly being no sign of him at all.<br/><br/>As the years go on without a single trace of Abu or Osama,Maya is disappointed to find that she is one of the few people in the CIA who is still searching for Bin Laden,which leads to Maya deciding that she is going to do everything she can to pick up Abu Ahmed's tracks,and also be the person that finally tracks down the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Spanning a turbulent 8 year period,the screenplay by Mark Boal surprisingly lacks any sense of scope,with the events feeling that they are taking place over a number of weeks,and not years.Whilst Boal's sense of pace does allow the movie to feel pretty quick moving,it takes away from any feeling that this manhunt is something that takes over Maya's life,due to the manhunt unexpectedly being shown as pretty straight forward,with Maya and her fellow CIA officers being shown to hardly hit any brick walks,which led to this search lasting for over 8 years.<br/><br/>For the torture scenes in the film,producer/director Kathryn Bigelow smartly keeps away from stylising the scenes at all,to instead show the audience the ""enhanced interrogation"" methods in a sharp, blunt form,with the camera being firmly placed right at the front,so that the viewer feels the full horrific force of the torture taking place.<br/><br/>Contrasting the blunt style that the torture scenes are shown in,Bigelow and cinematography Greg Fraser give the movie a weirdly dust and gritty free appearance,that along with making Maya's (played by a very middle of the road Jessica Chastain) search for a needle in a haystack feel oddly non misty,also leads to the movie failing to increase any tension until the final 30 minutes,just before the darkness becomes dawn."
"rubenm","8","3","6","10 February 2013"," Extremely suspenseful
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is extremely suspenseful, even though we know how it ends. It shows how, by combining tiny bits of information, by patience, hard work and sheer luck, the CIA succeeded in locating Osama Bin Laden's whereabouts. We know everything about the raid in which he was killed, but not very much about the decade long hunt for him. This has been a complicated affair, with bribed informants, bugged cell-phones, mistaken identities, and yes, information obtained by torture. However, I don't see 'Zero Dark Thirty' as a film tolerating torture. It merely shows torture, in a graphic way that just as well could be interpreted as criticizing it. <br/><br/>What makes this film special, is that it is focusing on a woman. The strong point of this movie is the contrast between Jessica Chastain's pure, breathtakingly beautiful looks and the cruel, ugly world of killing and torture around her. All she wants to do is hunt down Bin Laden, and there is nothing female in the obsession she shows for her work. There is no love interest, no relaxation, no private life. Only at the very end, when the job is done, she shows the first sign of emotion. <br/><br/>The film focuses entirely on chasing and capturing Bin Laden. There are no subplots, no psychologic insights, no sidelines. That's what makes this film so good: there are no Hollywood-like concessions to a wider commercial appeal. It would be incredible if Kathryn Bigelow would win the Oscar for Best Picture again, after 'The Hurt Locker'. But in my opinion, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is the better film. So it would be entirely deserved."

","""This is what defeat looks like bro. Your jihad is over."" On September 11, 2001 the United States was attacked by a group of terrorists taking orders from Osama Bin Laden. Following that attack the intelligence agency of the US began a man hunt for him to bring him to justice. Ten years later with the help of Seal Team 6 he was taken down. This is the story of the man hunt. I love movies that are based on real events but they are sometimes hit or miss. The hardest part for a movie like this where the events have just happened is to keep it interesting and keep you watching even though you know the end. This movie succeeded beyond all hope. Much like Apollo 13 when the climax happens you are on the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens even though you know the outcome. That is what makes this movie great. Also Bigelow has almost a Spielberg like quality to take hardcore war movies like this and Hurt Locker and transform them into movies that rely on great actors and not just the action. As great and exciting as this movie was Jessica Chastain was incredible in this and she is one of the reasons you get so involved with the story. This is another movie I could go on and on about but this is a definite must see and one of the best movies of the year. Overall, tense and gripping. Which is great for a movie where everyone knows how it ends. I give it an A."
"rebecca-ry","8","3","6","31 January 2013"," Gripping
","'Zero Dark Thirty' is director Kathryn Bigelow's follow-up to the brilliant 'The Hurt Locker.' It's based on the events which led up to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. <br/><br/>The film can be looked at from two angles; one is that the film is nearly three hours long and sections can go on for quite a bit. The second angle is that it's trying to tell a story which spanned over ten years and there's an awful lot of source material to try and squeeze into a film. Personally, I didn't mind the film's length; it was gripping, interesting, the acting was very good and the information revealed was useful and showed how painstaking the process was. However, three hours can be a long time for some people, regardless of the film's content. The script was very well written; the dialogue seemed realistic enough. It is split into chapters which works very well and means it's easier to keep up with the time line. <br/><br/>The acting is a lot better than I had expected; Jessica Chastain was truly fantastic and I'm now rooting for her to win big at next month's awards. Even the smaller roles played by Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong, James Gandolfini and Joel Edgerton were very well done. One thing I will not however is the really weird cameo from John Barrowman in one scene. For British people and maybe some Americans this will seem really random and I honestly don't even remember what was discussed in the scene he was in. All I remember is saying ""Wait, is that John Barrowman? Why the hell is he there?"" For what it's worth though, he does deliver his two lines very well.<br/><br/>When it comes to controversy and this film I really don't get it. Yes, there are scenes of torture but they don't glamorise it or try and make it seem like it was crucial to finding Bin Laden. They show scenes of torture because, in the early 2000s, it was seen as acceptable in terms of terrorist treatment. It would have been wrong for Kathryn Bigelow to gouge it out of her script. Bare in mind, these scenes were set in a time where the then President Bush jr. did not see water boarding as a form of torturebut then, George Bush says a lot of ridiculous things. Anyway, torture is shown and it can be quite uncomfortable to watch but it needed to be in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is very good. If you like films like 'The Hurt Locker' or even 'Argo' then you will probably enjoy this. It's an interesting film with great performances and, given that the wounds Osama Bin Laden inflicted on the USA are still very raw, it is an issue that remains a huge talking point for people."

","On the off chance you are wondering what ""Zero Dark Thirty"" stands for, its a reference for 00:30 hrs, or in English half past midnight. It's a pretty important time in the film, so keep an eye out for it.<br/><br/>This film I found rather interesting. There isn't a mass emphasis on the actual strike against Usama Bin Laden, but more of a focus leading from 11 September 2001 up to how they found him, including the dead ends and trials and tribulations within. Some parts of this film might seem a bit boring and bland to some, however a lot of the people on the way out of the cinema last night enjoyed it. I think there is a lot of appeal here for different groups. If you're an action film fan, you will enjoy the back end of the film but appreciate the lead up to it. This isn't a suspense film as you all know what happens in the end, and they sure as hell won't be able to make a sequel. However, this film isn't a documentary but it also isn't a completely fictional film. If you enjoyed Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy then you will really enjoy this film. As for the rest of you it could either way, but it is a well made film and doesn't come across as something cheap and nasty.<br/><br/>The main character in this is an attractive redhead and she starts out as very non confident and wet behind the ears. You see her developed into a harder and more determined person. My favourite line in the film is when someone asks who she is ""I'm the mother f****r that found this place"". Though the film doesn't directly place its success purely on here performance and many of the characters in this add value and decent performances. If you are easily entertained then don't go see this, if you like a good thinking persons film then despite there not being a ""6th sense"" style twist, you will very much enjoy this."
"amit_imt2002","9","3","6","25 January 2013"," Dancing in quicksand..
","Zero Dark Thirty is a compelling film with a real chance of making the largest number of people, yet, to introspect and come to their own conclusions about the war on terror, its troubling origins and its continuing cost.After one Sunday of watching Bin Laden's killing on the news networks, most Americans and the rest of the world went back to business.Several scholarly books and newspaper articles tried to overwhelm us with information and commentary on the greatest manhunt ever.Most of these did not find itself into the consciousness of the masses who continue to struggle with economic realities despite the ""Osama Bin Laden is Dead and General Motors is Alive"" rhetoric. Zero Dark Thirty arrives at an opportune time.<br/><br/>The debate about torture is meaningless, we will always be willing to kill for stuff that the powerful value, like political mileage.Its a technique as old as the hills.Obama may try to rise above torture, but drone strikes are nothing but a rich nation swatting flies for political gain. Drones are neat, so must have been torture when it was invented.Rendition, the 2007 film by Gavin Hood was an impassioned commentary on torture and put a huge question mark about its effectiveness. Zero Dark Thirty is brilliantly scripted and shot by the team of journalist/screenwriter Mark Boal and veteran director Kathryn Bigelow. It holds our attention for all of its 150 mins runtime, which is remarkable because we all know the ending.In the course of the very complex hunt for Bin Laden we see lots of torture, small victories in eliminating some key players, large losses in the continued terror attracts around the world except on American soil, and more importantly a regime change.We are swept up in the passion of Maya, a low level CIA operative played by the increasingly brilliant Jessica Chastain. She pursues her hunch about a courier with great single mindedness and embodies the promise of both Bush and Obama to hunt down Bin Laden.<br/><br/>In its own way its also a film about work, how we approach our jobs and how wide the gamut of human experience can be, if we cared to look.The question of what motivates Maya remains open.She remains an enigma till the very end, true to her name which also means ""illusion"" in Sanskrit. How I wish Maya was an environmentalist! The most important events in history take a very long time for society to assimilate.The assassination of JFK has still not been resolved, nor of Mahatma Gandhi.Some of the issues that were at the heart of Gandhi's assassination will surface in 2014 when India goes to the polls.Its just that they will not be linked directly to his death. Perhaps a long way off in the future there will be somebody like Oliver Stone who will rake up the Bin Laden killing to illuminate issues in America but for the moment Zero Dark Thirty must serve as the first cinematic draft of history.This is another milestone in the growing importance of film as the current medium of choice to engage with history. Obama's address to the Islamic world from Cairo, which was dubbed an apology tour, was a step in the right direction and so is a growing reluctance to go to war in far corners of the world.The Iraq war has amply illustrated the futility of shoving profound political change down the throat of a people who will continue to engage in bloody battles on Shia Sunni lines. Zero Dark Thirty shows us the high cost of capturing a high value target, both human and material and the long term cost which must be paid by future generations. A forgotten film by Wim Wenders called Land of Plenty made in 2005 captured a fractured post 9/11 American state in a beautiful and sensitive way. The Clash of Civilizations, a theory proposed by Samual Huntington which identifies cultural and religious differences as the fountainhead of future conflict, is certainly underway.While the world obsesses over the nuclear weapons Iran is building, it conveniently forgets that Pakistan is the most dangerous and unstable owner of a huge nuclear arsenal.When this clash of civilizations takes a turn for the worse, India is likely to be biggest collateral damage in history, thanks to the Pakistani militaries cunning use of India to maintain its grip on that failed state. Charlie Wilson's War was a smart Hollywood comedy which depicted the genesis of the whole Afghanistan/Pakistan crisis that is unfolding today.<br/><br/>As a people we continue to dance in quicksand."

","Zero Dark Thirty has a lame beginning- a couple of minutes of 911 calls during 9/11. The ending is lame too. What happens in the 2:40 hours in between isn't all that different.<br/><br/>For the first hour we experience nothing but CIA failures. And it puts our main character, Maya, in the center of every significant event during several years. But there is one bright spot- a clue about one of Osama's couriers, a clue obtained through torture.<br/><br/>During the next hour we see the CIA follow this clue as it gets them closer and closer to the courier. We also see some mild intra agency politics and war of wills. Nothing spectacular but the aim here is to glorify our heroine as the sole genius in the agency.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes or so the order is given to go ahead and attack Osama's compound and we witness the operation. But not even that is remotely as thrilling as it should be. It's a very slow operation, performed not by the best of teams but by a goofy bunch of soldiers motivated solely by--get this--Maya's confidence! When it's all over, you are left with very little.<br/><br/>A lot could have been done with this story. The filmmakers chose to do nothing with it. Sure there is the issue of torture, but what is the message? We are shown some scenes of torture light, performed by some agent with a PhD who cares more about the life of some monkeys he plays with. And the actor who plays him has one hell of a time properly articulating his lines. Even though we are told that this isn't some Obama propaganda film, that is belied by one scene were agents are talking during a televised interview of candidate Obama during which he says that waterboarding is torture and there will be no more torture. I guess in Hollywood drone bombing is better than waterboarding. Then the director shows countless scenes during the raid where the soldiers kill women and children, and once dead shoot them again. Why? What's point of focusing on that so often? And what's the point of centering the movie on this Maya character (other than Hollywood's favorite pet project- grl power)? She is everywhere but doesn't do a whole lot. Why is the team that is assigned the Osama operation portrayed as a bunch of dummies? <br/><br/>With this story, they could have made a thrilling patriotic action movie, or a sober and serious movie critical of certain policies. Zero Dark Thirty does neither. It's a slow, lazy, pointless movie that doesn't ask tough questions let alone provide answers."

This isn't a gung-ho or a political film..; but instead, it shows the talents & intelligence it took for the men & women behind the CIA & military had to take, in order to catch the most wanted man in the world."

","Remember ""Act of Valor"" from earlier this year? Do you also remember how terrible it was? What dreadful performances the SEALS tried to provide? That movie was a bad concept to begin with, but the last thirty minutes of the thrilling and powerful ""Zero Dark Thirty"" make up for it swiftly. The half-hour scene where the SEALS invade Bin Laden's hide out and gun him down is easily the most pulse-pounding half-hour of the year. Somehow it goes by in seemingly both mere minutes and long hours, because while thoroughly enjoying ourselves, we are also painfully eager to find out what happens next. <br/><br/>The director, Kathryn Bidgelow, who brought us a great film called ""The Hurt Locker"" in 2009 after twenty years of making bad ones, has surprisingly made a film even better than ""The Hurt Locker."" I have a feeling Mark Boal, the screenwriter of both movies, brings out the best in her as a director. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" tells a story spanning a decade with a brilliant and electric urgency. It's the blow-out, eye-popping, heart-stopping, mind-rocking thriller of the year. Be ready to be blown away. Like I said a paragraph ago, the way the film rolls along is almost indescribable, because we're so eager to get to the end, yet so wrapped in the moment, that keeping track of the way time is actually passing is virtually impossible. Though it doesn't sound like it, I'm nearly completely sure that's a compliment. <br/><br/>Let's move on to Jessica Chastain. She's incredible here, even better than she was in ""The Help"", and, though the performances were vastly different, that's still saying something. It also says something that both of those performances can be so vastly different, but still both manage to be great. Chastain is currently a very underrated actress who can display a variety of emotions, but isn't familiar to your average Joe because rather than picking mainstream money-makers, she picks good films to star in. I hope to see her in more developed and varying roles in the future. <br/><br/>You can expect ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to take a chunk out of Oscar, because, not only is it a great film, but it also touches on a subject that was featured on the news. Oscar loves those types of movies, because they don't judge films based upon their quality. No, Oscar judges films based on their ambition and their relevance, so Bidgelow's thriller should be a shoe-in for a Best Picture nomination and four or five others. Though both aren't the Best Picture of the year, but are both great film, I believe, and you heard it here first, that the award will go to either ""Lincoln"" or the film I'm currently reviewing. Apart from award-show banter, I just want you to go see ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" and see it in the theaters. I assure you, it's a knockout."

","Thirty minutes after Zero Dark (the military term for midnight) on May 2, 2011, the greatest manhunt in history came to an end. Osama Bin Laden, the man responsible for 9/11, was finally found and assassinated. It was a triumphant day for the U.S. military. But who was the hero behind it? (If you say Barack Obama, I will be starting a manhunt of my own) The writer and director of the Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" give us ""Zero Dark Thirty"", chronicling the events behind the hunt for Bin Laden with superb craftsmanship and unquestionable accuracy.<br/><br/>The central character of the film is Maya, a young CIA officer who has spent her entire brief career since graduating from high school focused solely on gathering intelligence related to Bin Laden following the September 11 attacks. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics.<br/><br/>Despite losing the Best Picture win, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" blows ""Argo"" out of the water, in all drama, detail, and verve. Running necessarily for almost three hours, the film is intriguing and exciting from start to finish, and stays respectful by never showing any more of Bin Laden's face than we see of Jesus's in ""Ben-Hur"". Even if, for some, the leisurely pacing takes some getting used to, it's impossible for anyone not to be stimulated by the suspenseful last 45 minutes, in which the Navy SEAL Team 6 flies in to Bin Laden's hideout to carry out Maya's final plan.<br/><br/>The screenplay was actually in progress before Bin Laden was killed, and completely re-written after his death. The film was originally going to tell the story of the unsuccessful decade-long hunt. It's hard to believe that the movie could have worked this way. It's a fascinating story on its own, true, but looking forward to the climax is the main cause of how invested you get in this picture. Plus, Maya's research and determination wouldn't be building up to anything. You wouldn't feel her directionless mode as you do here.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain gives a persevering and intense performance as Maya, who is a composite character primarily based on a female agent described in the book 'No Easy Day', which was written by a member of the SEAL Team 6. Otherwise, very little is known about the woman whose work made the vengeance of 9/11 possible. But whoever she may be, the film certainly pays honest-to-God recognition to her. This is one of those films like Paul Greengrass's ""United 93"" that truly honor the heroes of this wonderful country. ""The Real Maya"" is one of those heroes.<br/><br/>And Obama thanked himself.<br/><br/>10/10 for ""Zero Dark Thirty"", for my money the best film of 2012."

","First off this is a Hollywood movie and not something you should count as a history lesson. Folks are thinking that it is true because there was some ""discontent"" with our government over some scenes--but those were the scenes that were showing the CIA torturing suspects. In this liberal society, God forbid Americans know that you have to become dark to fight evil. To the movie: it is extremely long and boring. This movie is as dull as K-19. It lacks the tension and suspense that a movie of this ""supposed"" quality needed. Compare it to Argo and you will see a third rate movie when shown side-by-side with Ben Affleck's film. The direction is slow and ""yawn"" as much as it was with her previous films. The acting is decent, but there is not one single performance that would be an Oscar nominated performance. I still remember the article that questioned how this movie was given an Oscar nomination when it was still in the editing process--but like it's false claims to ""real"" it purchased its ""false"" claim to an Oscar."

","Movie, Zero Dark Thirty was a real eye catcher but that is it. Movie had very less to offer and it's plots were stretched. Nothing aggressive, nothing new. Movie got its fame in an obvious manner, but no special execution on director's part was seen. The script lacked nearly in every aspect. There were only some touches of thriller. Even execution of drama was a bit narcissistic. Actors on the other hand were equally terrible, maybe because the whole production of the movie was a confusion between a partial documentary or of something more. Movie rolled just because of some life in the script and due to its circumstantial fame. Could and should have been a lot better."

","In 2009, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal hit a career peak with ""The Hurt Locker,"" a searing exploration of wartime strain and its addictive residue. The effort collected awards and Oscar gold, while bringing Bigelow into the big time after years helming cult hits and ambitious misfires. The pair return to the stress factory of the Middle East with ""Zero Dark Thirty"". A direct and riveting procedural picture with a foray into military action, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" isolates a fascinating inner drive of revenge to fuel interactions with international terrorism, maintaining a hauntingly personal perspective that burns bright while the screenplay spins a sophisticated web of last names and motivations. <br/><br/>Sent to Pakistan to assist with C.I.A. black site operations dedicated to extracting information leading to the capture of Osama bin Laden, Maya has arrived two years after 9/11, finding a bleak location filled with frustrated agents led by Dan, who's mastery of torture tactics has provided few leads. Tasked with bringing bin Laden to justice, Maya begins a near-decade-long journey to piece together any information she can find, while her superiors, including station chief Joseph, grow accustomed to her steely, driven personality. As the years pass, opportunities for breakthroughs in the case are decimated by terrorist violence and detainee silence, leaving Maya increasingly obsessed with capture, eventually isolating herself from those tasked to represent her interests to the White House. As the dead ends pile up, Maya finally digs up a promising lead with an Abbottabad compound home to curiously secretive inhabitants. Certain she's found bin Laden, Maya takes her case to important middlemen, commencing a lengthy process of doubt and debate, with the White House wary of any further embarrassment in the region. <br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a throwback to the core films of the 1970s, with its cold-blooded approach of details and intrigue. We learn very little about the characters outside of their C.I.A. mission, rarely following them into their personal lives. In fact, Maya doesn't have an existence outside the bin Laden hunt, using her spare time to eat and absorb information, spending her youth on maddening details, approaching her assignment to find the al-Qaeda leader as a religion -- a personal mission that acts as the foundation for ""Zero Dark Thirty."" While recreations of key terrorist attacks appear and data pertaining to the instability of the region is exhaustively discussed, the feature is not a summation of global terrorism. It merely isolates and studies a single strand of malevolence, concentrating on bin Laden's ability to elude capture and the reach of his influence as those in his command are tracked and tortured inspecting the frustration of impasses and dire developments in the case, without taking on a larger study of fanatical inspiration. <br/><br/>Although the film offers a level of authenticity to its research, how much of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" reflects the actual hunt for bin Laden remains in question. Boal's screenplay is an extremely advanced affair, saturated with confidential discussions and last names galore, leaving those without a profound understanding of al-Qaeda hierarchy and its ties to the outside world a little bewildered at times, forced to take furious mental notes as Maya sinks deeper into her Pakistan stay, chasing anyone who could provide vital information. Boal doesn't skimp on the bureaucratic particulars, which are labyrinthine at times, but he's skilled at keeping those seated in the back row in the thick of the hunt, using Maya as an audience surrogate, peeling her one layer at a time to convey the emotional and professional pressure of her life, especially in the middle of Pakistan, where her fair skin and red hair make her stand out even more. Boal aims for a sweep of time, dramatizing terrorist attacks around the world to remind Maya that she is failing in her quest, paring down her ambition from one of duty to punishment, tracing her arc from an ashen agent (Chastain's naturally soft voice comes in handy to reinforce the character's deceptive vulnerability) watching Dan work over a black site detainee to a hardened, solitary woman with a singular drive to follow through on her goal, despite every possible roadblock in her way. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" sustains a hypnotic flow of information and evaluation, breaking up the story into chapters for easier consumption, yet remains firmly entrenched in the minutiae of the hunt, while Bigelow maintains pace and visual combustibility with propulsive cinematography and fiery performances. <br/><br/>While the early going of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" primarily consists of research and devastating setbacks that threaten to undermine Maya's job, the final hour reaches a question of compound living, where the sullen, sleep-deprived agent discovers bin Laden's home after years of chasing his ghost, only to find her breakthrough treated with hesitation by her superiors. The movie stews in Maya's impatience, which carries for over 120 days while men in suits are unwilling to commit to a raid. The buildup of frustration is superbly realized, priming the film for its final wave of violence as SEAL Team Six is at last deployed to take down bin Laden and examine the interior of the compound. The sequence, largely captured through night vision goggles, is stunning, communicating the precision of the military team and the insanity of the target's domestic tranquility, living with wives and children in the middle of a nondescript city street. It's here where Bigelow comes alive, climaxing the feature with a thrilling display of training impulses and mission success, though the death of bin Laden is left as blunt punctuation, not celebrated as the cure-all for the world's ills. <br/><br/>It's first-rate work from Bigelow and Boal, who treat the tale with conviction and knowledge, yet never lose sight of its inherent alarm, packaging a combustible narrative into one of the best pictures of 2012."

","Another tense nail-biter from Kathryn Bigelow, who is easily one of the top, say, three directors working when it comes to filming combat action sequences.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" isn't quite as visceral as ""The Hurt Locker,"" Bigelow's break-out film from a few years ago, but it's not meant to be. This story about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden takes primarily in makeshift offices, where various people comb over CIA intelligence in an attempt to track down clues as to Bin Laden's whereabouts. The film is anchored by a no-frills performance by Jessica Chastain, playing a somewhat odd and unsympathetic character, a young woman who's so obsessed with finding Bin Laden that she comes a bit unhinged when he's found and she realizes she had nothing else in her life but the manhunt for him. Bigelow makes some of the smartest action movies ever put to screen, completely lacking in bombast or audience manipulation. She directs with an objective, journalistic approach, and lets her audience do its own thinking, a rare treat in movies these days.<br/><br/>The last twenty minutes or so are given over to a breathless sequence detailing the raid on Bin Laden's compound and his death, and I was sweating bullets by the time the whole thing was over even though I already knew the outcome.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","There was movie a long time ago, ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight,"" about some bungling mafia guys. ZDT could be subtitled ""The Gang That Couldn't Think Straight,"" in reference to the bungling at the highest levels of the CIA that unnecessarily prolonged the track-down of Osama Bin Laden, except that this movie focuses on the analyst who stuck to the job and got it done, with only fleeting glimpses of the higher-level nitwits in D.C. that she had to deal with right up to the day of the climactic raid. I liked the way the story was told as a detective mystery thriller, not a military action violence-soaked saga like so many other war movies have been lately. Well, after all, the raid on Bin Laden's hideout lasted less than an hour anyway. What came up missing, though, was the backdrop of politics that pervades all decision-making in the CIA/Defense Department, and how their incompetence helped delay the tracking down of Osama Bin Laden. One scene depicts a suicide bomb attack at a ""secure CIA base"" in the Afghanistan in December 2009 killing eight Americans including a DC-based analyst, a direct result of CIA administrators bypassing security measures and sabotaging that analyst's efforts at finding Bin Laden, but we don't get that political backdrop in the movie. The heroine of Zero Dark Thirty had to have faced the same political hurdles, but all we see are the male vs. female attitude conflicts, like a bunch of guys in a meeting room who can only give the CIA Director 60 percent confidence they've found their target because they're afraid of saying 100-percent and putting their careers on the line. If the story/movie is accurate, my first question is ""if this is the gal who found Bin Laden, why isn't she running the CIA now?"" Well, because she's a woman, that's why, and the movie makes that crystal clear. It would have enhanced the movie to include scenes of what Bin Laden was doing in his lair all that time, based on what we now know that he wasn't ""in the background of Al Qaeda"" like many CIA thought simply because his house wasn't on the electric grid. It never occurred to these guys how a guy who hid in caves could mastermind 9/11, he could just as easily keep running the outfit while hiding in an apartment? Duh! The performance by Jessica Chastain is well worth the acclaim she has received for it."

","When you ask yourself ""Is this the same movie I saw ads for?"" it's usually not a good sign but in this case it is. The ads sell Zero Dark Thirty as a pure action movie which it defiantly is not. The hunt for Osama Bin Laden was a long and arduous process and director Kathryn Bigelow does a remarkable job illustrating the devotion and sacrifice that was required to finally find him. It's a unflinching look at the tactics and internal politics that evolved over the years it to bring Bin Laden to justice.<br/><br/>There is a sense of of tension and urgency that drives the movie forward from the first moments of the movie.

Her strong portrayal of an agent who's determination turns to obsession in her ceaseless campaign to find Bin Laden is central to the success of this movie.<br/><br/>Bigelow has made one of 2012's best crafted films that should be in contention for much recognition (and rightfully so) during award season.

While the film may not be the best of the year, its true winner is Jessica Chastain's knock-out, Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a taut, sometimes menacing thriller, but with an almost three-hour runtime, it is a slow burning movie.

Until that time, the film is stagnant, but once it takes flight ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a nail-biter all the way to the final raid on Bin Laden's compound.<br/><br/>While the torture scenes and the SEALS raid bookend the film, it is Chastain's mesmerizing performance that is most memorable. Chastain is brilliant showing us the dramatic change of character over a ten year period. The majority of the dialogue in ""Zero Dark"" is unemotional, centered around data, field-talk and speculation, but Chastain shows all the inner conflict in her tired, exhausted eyes.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is often like a cinematic history textbook as it takes us through some of the past decade's most horrific moments, from the 2005 London bombings to the 2008 attack on the Islamabad Marriot.

It is 11th September, 2001 and there are voice overs talking about the crash,about the cockpits and last words of the passengers who were on board the fateful flights or who were burning to death in the towers. The action then shifts to 2003 wherein the CIA is torturing a detainee to find out relevant information. There is a CIA analyst who is watching the torture and is being repelled by it. A few years and a few bombings and attacks later, the detainee tells them the name of Bin Laden's courier and the hunt begins. Brilliantly directed, this for me is the movie of the year. The viewer has to have rudimentary knowledge about the ""honchos"" of Al Qaeda to follow the proceedings and I was kind of fortunate that I had read No Easy Day by Mark Owen before watching this. The acting is brilliant with Chastain looking like a sure shot bet to win the Best Actress Oscar. She is amazing and conveys her disgust,anger and sadness so well that it is very difficult to digest the fact that she is a comparative newbie.Screenplay is very gripping and Boal is in a fight to the finish with Tarantino for the best original screenplay.

","This movie is outstanding. The acting is strong, the story is compelling, the dialog incisive and the cinematography impressive. The movie does not play politics. Rather it tells a tremendously dramatic story about courage, fortitude and determination. The story has a beginning, a middle and an end, and although the audience knows the final outcome, that does not affect or reduce the movie's dramatic impact. The source of the drama is not the actual tracking down of Osama bin Laden but the interactions within the intelligence community that was under a lot of pressure to find targets, relying on uncertain information obtained by questionable means in a hostile environment. The movie graphically depicts frustrated American operatives frantically using torture to obtain information from detainees regarding bin Laden's whereabouts with limited results. The movie also depicts American operatives flagrantly violating Pakistani airspace to attack bin Laden. Whether these actions were proper is left to the audience to decide; the movie does not take sides. But what the movie does convey is the fact that the United States is fighting a war that is unlike any war previously fought, with an enemy that is elusive and transnational, and that tactics requiring speed and stealth can produce positive results, provided there is accurate intelligence."

","I went in to this film with mixed opinions, hearing all the praise but also hearing lots of hate. So I really didn't know what to expect. And, my God, it was fantastic!<br/><br/>The film was executed so beautifully. Ever since the first scene I was attached and couldn't keep my eyes off! No doubt about it, Jessica Chastain led this film, she was just brilliant. Watching the film, you knew her character, her personality, and her determination to kill Bin Laden. She was SO strong on her part, and it was by far her best performance. I also have to mention that Jason Clarke was undeniably amazing in the movie. He was terrific for his role(like always), and his performance was so deep. There were also some other actors that didn't stand out as much, but still gave a good performance, like Kyle Chandler, and Mark Duplass, many more. <br/><br/>While the acting being so brilliant with every character, I must say the film was shot so extraordinary. Throughout the film I was honestly thinking, ""Wow, this is truly beautiful!"", and it's true because it is. It almost plays out like a documentary- and it makes it feel like one because of the solid performances- because of the shaky cinematography. For some people, the shots and shakiness may get on people's nerves, but I find it absorbing, it keeps it feeling more realistic.<br/><br/>I also have been hearing many people saying that the film is too long and boring, and I definitely disagree. I can understand why people are saying this, though, because it IS a very slow-paced movie about the search for Bin Laden. This is no action-thriller(although there are some explosions which are pretty awesome), this is a very slow moving film. But for me, I found it very suspenseful, and the length was just perfect. if anything I thought it was too short, at the end of the film I wanted more! <br/><br/>If you want to go see an action-packed thriller with explosions and gun shots every minute of the film, do NOT see this. This is NOT action-packed! i must say,though, the last 40 minutes of this film are just teeth-chattering. This has to be one of the greatest ways to end a film! <br/><br/>Anyways, none the less, the film is brilliant. Best movie of the year, I loved it so much! 10/10 for me!!"

Where some long films tend to drag in the beginning this one doesn't it gets right to the point keeping you thrilled and entertained, and there's some great jokes tossed into the circle here and there.

Many scenes do not feel believable. But great performances help to enhance this amazing story. This is one of those movies that the cast isn't only in for the paycheck.

","On the edge of my seat the first 45mins but lost interest after. I think this movie is more about Maya's (Jessica Chastain) role coming to terms with her own femininity and sexuality than what the original story was planned or wanted us to think. Is this really a film about tracking down Bin Laden or more about let's make a movie with a strong female lead? Maybe just poor character development and an overlong stretched out story line made me just turn it off. This one is not what I expected. It could have been done better with an emphasizes on plot and others too in the movie and less on Maya. Does she take on a strong female lead? I think that was intended but poor acting and no character development on this one. Another one of those cookie cutter movies that just goes nowhere but tries to sell itself on the 9/11 tragedy."

There are other characters that come in and out, but Chastain is the center of this movie. Zero Dark Thirty spans quite a few years, starting in 2003, all the way to Bin Laden's death in 2011. It's interesting seeing Chastain's character grow up from a rookie at the start of the movie to a veteran near the end. This type of character development is almost as stellar as that of Tom Hanks's Forrest Gump. The development of Maya is one of the most important components of the film. In watching it, the viewer is truly on board with her, hunting down Bin Laden with her. However, the amazing development of Maya overshadows the other characters in Zero Dark Thirty, making the majority of them much less important. <br/><br/>What was really lovable about Zero Dark Thirty was that it really pushed the limits. There were a lot of scenes that were disturbing to watch and unapologetic, but that's the beauty of it because these things really did happen and it makes the film that much more realistic and engrossing. At times in the movie, you really feel like your in the situation with the characters. The realism doesn't stop there; it continually transcends itself for the two-and-a-half hour run time. Unfortunately, the realism of it also includes some boring and long scenes of office work and phone calls. Though, this adds more to feel that you are there with Maya on the hunt. You feel how she feels: the frustration, the boredom, and the apathy at some points.<br/><br/>On the contrary to the long and drawn out scenes of the office, the film contains a ton of intense and suspenseful scenes; particularly the last half hour. Before watching this movie, I was informed that the last 30 minutes of Zero Dark Thirty would be one of the most thrilling movie- going experiences ever. It really doesn't disappoint. Even knowing how the movie will end, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>All in all, Zero Dark Thirty, so far, the best film of 2013. It's acted phenomenally (especially by Jessica Chastain who was my pick for the Oscar for Best Actress); it's gripping to the edge; it's strong, realistic, and unapologetic. Zero Dark Thirty is a movie recommended to anyone who can handle the intensity of it and will, without a doubt."

","I just can't believe how much praise this film received. Seriously. I wouldn't call this film awful though, because it's very very well made in the technical regards. But the plot is just bad. A lot of unrealistic events, as the sequence where the CIA woman was killed in the terrorist attempt. I mean, seriously? She was so desperate for her plan that she left a bunch of agents running the risk of death by an attack? Where is the professionalism? Sorry, but is just far away of what would happen in reality. And the sequence where both women were sending messages to each other before the attack was equally ridiculous. <br/><br/>The dialog is pretty awful as well, a quick example would be the super-cliché one liner of revenge declaimed by the main character. 'Osama killed my friend, now i'll kill him.' Come on. This is so idiotic that it basically wasted single-handed all the credibility of the film, in filmmaking aspects. Not to mention that the character development is almost non-exist, so i couldn't care any less about the protagonist. But OK, the story has his own merits. The controversies about the torture methods used by the government and the CIA are by far more interesting than the so expected climax, which don't affected me at all.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this film, because it has a bad plot and isn't entertaining at all. However, if you want to see some shocking facts about the government, though poorly dramatized, watch it. 5.5/ 10"
"Chris_Silver","7","3","7","20 July 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty simple review.
","Zero Dark Thirty, thank you for introducing me to Jessica Chastain. She is not only a great actress but in the movie she is perfect for the part. Emphatic and grasping. She is also beautiful. Most of the other movies on the list you could buy the DVD, with this one I was unable to take my eyes off of the screen. I had to urinate so badly after the film ended. Not because of my excessive water drinking but because the movie took hold me of so well I couldn't stop it, couldn't take a break. The assassination of Osama Bin Laden wasn't the best part of the movie although it was a fantastic edition. The raid on the house was a great scene to finish the movie with. Afterward toward the ending moments of the movie you can feel the emotion running through your veins, the same emotion that Jessica Chastain displays. The beginning of the movie is a little bit slow as the first scene lasts for what seems 20-30 minutes. But it is only slow because you are not introduced to the characters or the setting, you are thrown into the plot automatically. Although I didn't take much of a liking to it at first I do feel that Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal aimed to do this. Telling you that the movie is unconventional and (slightly loosely) based on the true story. Though i didn't like the beginning of the film at first, thinking of it now i don't think that i or anyone else could think of a better way to start it. Kathryn Bigelow is creating a better name for herself then her ex- husband. First ""The Hurt Locker"" and it's Oscar achievements, then ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which could've easily won multiple Oscars any other year. Just watch it."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","3","7","18 July 2013"," Intelligence has to be smart more than greedy or painful
","With time the film has become a lot less pungent and pregnant than it was when it came out. It is nothing but a fiction documentary on an essential event of the beginning of the 21st century. There was September 11, 2001 before and now there is May 2, 2011. The ten years during which terrorism seemed to be dominating the world and the USA to be running after an uncatchable ghost, will remain the ten years during which the West ran after its own tail like a deranged dog.<br/><br/>And Osama Ben laden was a ghost. He had managed to be ever present everywhere and to be untraceable at all in any way imaginable. No telephone link. No Internet connection; No going out of his fortress at all. A fortress well hidden right in the middle of an urban area in Pakistan, 585 feet or so from the main Pakistani military academy, their West Point. To be unseen hide in a crowd. To be invisible hide in a fortress that stands out on its surrounding neighborhood and protect it in the most standard way so that everyone may think it is the residence of a drug lord. And it would have worked if there had not been one girl who was crazy enough to believe what her reason and deduction told her with certainty though she had no material proof of the presence of her target.<br/><br/>She was a subductive mind who built a conviction from a pile of circumstantial and partial facts and subductive she had to be to subdue all the males around her in the secret service, CIA, armed forces and other agencies of the type, subdue indeed, if not abduct their rational mind for a trip onto the other side of visible reality, the invisible side of reality. To believe is at times enough.<br/><br/>But the film was a very scandalous film when it came out because of the torture used to get some information. The case was abducted out of reasonable behavior and intelligence. First the only TV skimpy appearance of Obama was when he declared he would put an end to torture. All the torture took place in the film before that declaration. That's an ellipse, my dear film viewers, meaning that Obama put a stop to torture. Then the film even shows how a ""tip"" was in fact a trap that led a loaded car into a military base in Afghanistan and it exploded killing many, including some CIA agents who were so happy to have invited someone in the base who was going to tell them where Ben Laden was and all that with the torture of greed, for 25 million dollars. Idiotic. Money is a very good bait for suicide bombers.<br/><br/>So torture did not give them a lot. And money did not give them a lot. It is only crossing and crisscrossing intelligence from many sources that led to a track, a trail, a path to the man they were looking for. Nothing replaces intelligence, and I should say a vast diversity of intelligence. Nothing is better than human intelligence, I mean intellectual work, to build a conviction from a mass of data that seems to have no logic at all. No machine could reach that conviction because a machine would work on probabilities, and let me say subduction, the truth emerging from the deeper layers of the accumulated data, is irrational, illogical, absurd in many ways. That's how Homo Sapiens invented God. Today we use it in science all the time. <br/><br/>As for the unethical side of torture, it is a very bad argument. Of course it is unethical but Guantanamo will only close when the last prisoner there dies provided they don't bring any anymore. Guantanamo nevertheless worked and works very well because of the reputation it has, the myth about it and the legend about the methods used there. Of course it is unethical but with terrorists fear is the best incentive to try anything to defy that fear, to defy reason and prudence and to get caught. <br/><br/>Torture is ineffective as for the intelligence it brings out but it is unluckily effective in the fear it creates in some people on the wrong side of the divide of humaneness because then they get reckless, sloppy, careless and even talkative. In fact real torture is not necessary. Just a public reputation about it is enough to reach its target. And yet real torture in inhuman and unethical.<br/><br/>But once again the manhunt of the first decade of the 21st century was constructed on real intelligence obtained through intelligent collecting and not fake intelligence obtained through torture. Was torture actually used or not? Who knows really. We can trust the perversion of some intelligence gatherers for them to turn themselves into torture-masters. But these are probably the little ones on the chain, particularly if we are speaking of physical torture. And it takes a woman to know that a woman witness to a torturing session is a lot more effective on the man who is being tortured than the torture itself because the presence of a woman becomes psychological torture that is untenable for real Islamic people from the Arab or Middle-East world. To be stripped naked in front of a woman is the worst psychological and moral torture you can invent in that situation. <br/><br/>Christians on the other hand are used to the quasi-naked Christ tortured to death on his cross and Jesus did not wince at the presence of his own mother and Mary Magdalena at the foot of the cross, and a third Mary, at least in the conscience of Christians who even believe Jesus presented John as being her son now, directly from the cross. <br/><br/>This film has to be seen and known as a fiction documentary on an important event of our time.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" lies between art and entertainment, realism and spectacle, effectively intertwining journalism and drama--resulting in a riveting film with provocative deliberations with reflection. As a cinematic experience, the film can be an undoubtedly punishing experience at times, given that U.S.-sanctioned torture figures prominently here, and has been flirting with controversy even before the film's release. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" reunites the Oscar winning team of director-producer Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) for the story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man.<br/><br/>Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA operative and her only objective is the unrelenting pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Maya is a lone wolf-- a CIA agent who sticks to her convictions that bin Laden is not hiding out in caves in Afghanistan, but is likely living in relatively open sight. Based on true events, and from firsthand accounts by the CIA agents involved, the movie sets itself up very much like a docudrama. Characterization is passed over and the viewer forced to merely follow along procedurally with the characters; namely, Jessica Chastain's Maya. She is the anchor of the entire film, the one person you are given to carry you through the story, but if you are looking for a background on her you won't find it here. There are no secondary story lines here, this is strictly how Maya and her colleagues working tirelessly and continuously to find Osama Bin Laden. <br/><br/>We watch her evolution from that first torture scene, from a smart-suited observer and wet around the ears, to several years later into her tenure in Pakistan, where she now leads the interrogation and taps a strong-arm to do the punching for her. The movie turns into the ultimate procedural, in which computer work, matching photographs, and one seeming irrelevancy after another in an old interrogation video lead Maya to a man known as Abu Ahmed, who, at regular intervals, drives a white S.U.V. from Peshawar to a house in Abbottabad. It's takes an half an hour before we first hear a name we recognize, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, the trusted bin Laden courier who will eventually lead the CIA to their mark. Though at this point in the film, victory is still years away. Over the course of a decade, Maya finds promising leads that turn into dead ends, and then unpromising little tidbits that turn into even better leads. It's imprecise work that requires meticulous attention to detail and not much of a private life.<br/><br/>Progress is slow in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" but the flow of information is fast and continuous, and the movie doesn't wait for you to catch up. There are more than 100 speaking parts--fellow analysts, CIA chiefs, national security advisers, and SEAL team members, many of them played by familiar faces. Characters enter for a scene or two, and just as quickly disappearing--sometimes before we have had a chance to register who they really are. Sometimes Bigelow don't even tell us the names, because she puts enough trust in the audience to assume we'll have a working knowledge of who the major players are. The coldness in tone changes drastically during the final act, when Bin Laden's compound is breached. Suddenly a wealth of emotions hits you, your gaze is unwavering, and the suspense is overwhelming. Even knowing how the story ends, it doesn't change the immense power of the final minutes. <br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a film that most Americans will no doubt embrace their patriotism enthusiastically, while others might have misgivings about the use of torture on detainees. But the film's depiction of such torture doesn't condone it; it's a record of it, as part of the narrative jigsaw drawn from those who were involved. Jessica Chastain delivers an Oscar worthy performance-powerfully and defiantly standing own her own, and never backing down despite years of exasperating obstacles. An absorbing richly textured portrayal of a dark, pivotal chapter in American history that forever changed our lives."

","If you a looking for a hardcore action movie about killing Osama Bin Laden you came to the WRONG place this movie has action scenes and bombings, and also the ending (killing Oasma Bin Laden which lasts about 30 min) but most of it is other things but I don't want to give to much away...... Even when there's not action it's not bad though, and when there is action it's great too. So either way it's great. The ending was the best part of the movie to me getting to see Oasma Bin Laden get shot in the head twice well....... Was awesome and it was a great scene. Overall it was an amazing movie and should be seen. But the torturing scene is a bit gruesome so...... Not everyone needs to see this"
"adamdegbailey","9","3","7","19 June 2013"," Bigelow allows access but not control
","Kathryn Bigelow's follow-up to 'The Hurt Locker' privileges the viewer to a glimpse into America's hunt for Osama bin Laden following the September 11 terrorist attacks. In 'Zero Dark Thirty', the unfolding events control the narrative, ensuring that the audience's expectations and emotions are of secondary importance, in contrast to the erratic narrative and visual styles which drive this film.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain's C.I.A operative 'Maya' underpins 'Zero Dark Thirty', her driven, cold pursuit of history's most wanted man the framework around which the story unfolds. This is a film of talking, tension, torture and talkinglots of talking. The action set-pieces leading up to the final assault on bin Laden's compound are shocking and effective. But this is no action film in the vein of 'Black Hawk Down'. The true drama on show here comes from the narrative dialogue, Mark Boal's taut scripting and the restrained casting, with no pandering to the audience's expectations, serving to emphasise the drawn out, frustrating hunt for bin Laden, and the complicated, foggy moral highway which the film and its subject matter has traversed.<br/><br/>Upon release, the film was engulfed in equal measure with critical adulation and moral outrage. Bigelow's film deserves the former, but it is the subject matter alone that merits the latter. The intense torture scenes depicted, and particularly, the controversial use of water-boarding provoked outrage. But this outrage should be directed away from Hollywood, eastwards towards Langley. 'Zero Dark Thirty' never guides, never judges, never glamorises; the cruelty on show is born from necessity and not pleasure. Above all, it makes its target audience – an intelligent cinematic and politically literate base – to emote, think and above all, ask the question of paramount importance: is the torture of sometimes innocent individuals, justifiable, in the potential saving of thousands more innocent lives? Don't expect Bigelow or Chastain to answer this question for you. Great cinema requires audience participation long after the end credits have rolled.<br/><br/>The acting in 'Zero Dark Thirty' is exceptional, as we're left with the feeling of watching real-life protagonists embroiled in real-world events, rather than Hollywood players peddling their wares to an expectant Academy. However, Jessica Chastain's portrayal of the driven, obsessed Maya, both reinforces and contradicts this trend. She is a woman in a man's domain; she is a beacon of beauty amidst a visually and morally ugly world; and she is clearly a Hollywood A-lister in a film that values education over entertainment. The film lives and breathes because of Maya. It also comes close to demise because of Chastain's (deserved) status as the latest addition to the top echelons of Hollywood's acting royalty. To her credit, she becomes Maya for the film's lengthy duration, but in the world of modern cinema, no film is an island, no movie theatre a vacuum.<br/><br/>The supporting cast offer stellar support. Jason Clarke excels as Dan and would be Maya's love interest in a more mainstream production. Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong give spot on performances, their suits and ties offering a telling contrast to the night vision goggles and heavy body armour of the Navy SEALS who finally storm bin Laden's compound. Modern warfare is as much about intelligence gleaned from scouring for hours over data and monitor screens, as it is about boots on the ground and high-powered weaponry. The cinematic peccadilloes of the film's audience therefore, will greatly dictate as to their appreciation of 'Zero Dark Thirty'.<br/><br/>One uncredited cast member contributes massively to the effectiveness of 'Zero Dark Thirty', and that's the look and style of the film. Greig Fraser's cinematography evokes handsome, gritty modern cinema; the editing reminds the audience that this is not an easy ride – pleasure can be derived from experiencing and appreciating a film, and not merely from enjoying it. For a work so heavily invested in moral ambiguity and shades of grey, Bigelow's opus gives us extreme visual contrasts. Despite opening with a black screen overplaying audio from the victims of the terrorist attacks of 2001, the film's primary environs are hot, arid desert settings and bustling, noisy streets. The climactic final forty minutes of the film are a masterwork of tension and technique. But viewing is also torrid; much of the screen is almost completely dark as the SEALs breach bin Laden's compound, before we are privileged a view through the night vision goggles of the intruders. This at times uncomfortable viewing continues to remind us that this is a movie despite of and not for, the audience. Bigelow wants us to experience 'Zero Dark Thirty' above all else. If we subsequently enjoy her work, then it's merely an added bonus. Cinema as art. Discuss.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow is a masterful proponent of action cinema. This is clearly on show throughout 'Zero Dark Thirty', but Bigelow's is not an action cinema born of explosions, stunts and larger than life heroes. Her brand of action is born out of the set-up: the drama of words and the almost unbearable tension of inactivity torn apart, as the game is at last, afoot. In a film of very few grace notes, the whispers of 'UsamaUsamaUsama' from the Navy SEAL during the fateful final confrontation, will live long in my cinematic memory.<br/><br/>'Zero Dark Thirty' is a masterful piece of modern cinema, and in my opinion, benefits from the apparent snub of the Academy voters. This is a film that doesn't ask to be liked. The viewer is at times placed in uncomfortable situations, both visually and morally. It is a film not to be watched, but to be experienced. But above all, like the very best of cinema, it asks questions, confuses and contradicts. It scars. In the film's final shot, the tear-stained Maya 'is' the audience: victorious, exhausted and left with a final question – what price victory, and above all, was it truly worth the struggle? The answer from this reviewer is a categorical yes."
"ckolet37","8","3","7","19 May 2013"," A gripping, suspenseful thriller
","Jessica Chastain's performance is worth the price of admission, just saying. Her performance makes me debate weather or not a CIA operative like her existed. She's just a great character to watch. The torture scene is the most controversial of the film, but in my opinion, the one in Casino Royale is worse. Jason Clarke gives a very underrated performance as the torturer. Even though i've seen worse, it is still a very tough scene to watch, surprisingly, he's the comic relief. The latter quarter of the film could just be it's own film (I won't tell you why, but you will think that too after it's done). Everyone else though, is very out of the way. Chastain's the star of course but even so, they all are pawns in her game against Bin Laden. To be honest, I kind of like that. But I digress, it is a very good film, with very good writing, and very good performances, despite most of them not leaving an impression. Go see it"

","If you do so, you may be able to enjoy the movie better.<br/><br/>Of course, not everything is accurate in the movie. Certain events seem to be over-dramatised. Sometimes, things happen in the movie that are actually very implausible in real life. And of course, a lot of facts or truths are incorporated into the story to lend credibility.<br/><br/>Stop imagining this as a documentary on the search and death of OBL. See it as a dramatisation of the real story that incorporates fiction because we suspect no one really knows the entire truth, due mainly to the scope.<br/><br/>You may not feel for many of the characters - the story isn't as character-driven as you may expect. But you may come feel that the characters all become insignificant in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>And no matter your views on torture, you will come to realise real life cannot be supported by idealism alone, and may start to question yourself how staunch your beliefs are, and whether they will stand up to application in real life. It is easy to sit back, in the comfort of our homes, and moralise. I like this movie because it can help one feel the visceral impact of our own morals, wherever we may stand on them."

","The movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" has won a lot of awards for its amazing job in capturing the events surrounding the killing of Osama Bin Laden. The search began in the year 2001 and continued through until 2011. It is based on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden due to his destruction of the World Trade Center. The Seal Team Six was the main group of people who physically took down Bin Laden and his group.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie takes place in Iraq. The main characters portrayed in this movie were Dan, Maya, Joseph Bradley, and Jessica. Since the Al- Qaeda terrorist organization took down the World Trade Center, the then President Bush, made it a huge priority to put an end to Bin Laden and his group for good. Through it took ten years to bring the terrorists to their knees, it was well worth it.<br/><br/>The real life person, and character in the movie, who is credited with actually finding Bin Laden is, Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. She was the one who ordered people to help find his compound. Maya did a great job in finding the compound. Jason Clarke, who played Dan, helped to get a lot of information out of the people who took part in 9/11.<br/><br/>What I like most about this movie is how it captured the feelings of the actors and actresses. They depicted the movie well. Also, they really made you feel for the characters. I remember one scene very vividly, after Seal Team Six took down Bin laden, Maya went to verify the body. She gave a slight nod, to indicate yes and then left the body, started packing, and went back to Washington D.C. When she had all of her belongings, she went on the plane, and started to cry. I would say that Maya was very happy that Osama Bin Laden was finally killed. She had just spent the last ten years of her career working to hunt down Bin Laden, and now it was over. This was probably very overwhelming her. I felt truly happy for what Maya had accomplished.<br/><br/>One of the lessons in this movie is perseverance and sticking to what you believe in. Maya stuck to what she believed in and her determination helped to bring down one of the most notorious terrorists. She played a huge role in the take down of Osama Bin Laden. Another lesson is, don't let someone in a higher position pull you down. You are all equal, no matter what position.<br/><br/>The main group of people who would enjoy this movie would be adults, or people who were there from the beginning with 9/11. Also, people who were or are a part of the military. Lastly, people who are interested in the history of this country would enjoy it."
"GLanoue","5","3","7","16 April 2013"," Boring and self-serving
","Imagine the Da Vince Code without two generations of conspiracy theorists nourishing our fears that things aren't what they seem to be, or imagine a WWII movie without the subtext of moral outrage at Pearl Harbour or Auschwitz. Without the desire for payback and closure for 9-11, this movie is shallow and conventional. It cheats by hitting all the right moral triggers: Evil Mastermind Osama Bin Laden, torture is bad but necessary to Protecting Our Freedoms (yes, in capitals; it's that kind of movie). But it's not a gung ho John Wayne's Green Beret style movie. We're way too cynical for that. Director Bigelow gives a knowing wink to the audience that we're beyond old fashioned and simple minded patriotism; we get gratuitous scenes in which women and high ranking officials like Leon Panetta/James Gandolfini swear like troopers, or women talk about sex as a relaxing distraction from the job, or the head torturer saying that he's had enough not because of moral doubts but because he's seen too many naked guys: We Edgy Now. Once everybody agrees that we're hip, cynical and patriotic, all we get is a conventional Cowboys and Indians movie: the bad guys are really bad, but we're still good because our doubts about our methods (waterboarding) prove we're still on the moral high ground. The fact is that this is a boring movie underneath the documentation of all the slick CIA procedures and technology: a maverick (Chastain) insists she is right all along, and convinces her superiors by sheer strength of will that Osama is hiding out in a city and not in the mountains. The movie highlights guts, intuition, determination, and even insight, but Maya/Chastain has no real facts on which to hang her case. So, we have a gung-ho, me against the world movie that is carried by cheap Hollywood contrivances: the loner, the maverick, the hunch-player, the High Plains Drifter, and a woman to boot, so her one dimensional obsession is morally unassailable in today's political climate. Here, the outraged Chastain/Maya had the advantage, because we all know she was right all along. All the buzz is about the use of torture, payback and closure for 9-11, and a voyeuristic fascination with the SEAL team that took down Osama. It's not about the movie, which didn't deserve its nominations, hype and ticket sales. I'm not taking a pro- or anti-US position here; all I want is a better movie."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","7","14 April 2013"," The story of the hunt for the most wanted man in the world
","The film is chronicle of the decade long hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in the eyes of young, intellectual, brazen CIA agent Maya (Jessica Chastain) In the book, 'No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden' written by the account of the Seal Operator and his book is based on the perspective of the female CIA Operator. She is referred to as ""Jen"", but her name matters not. What's important is her tough-minded, monomaniacal focus for almost 10 years, despite the numerous attempts by her superiors to ignore her theories. The movie would love to make it seems like she did all the work, but in my opinion, I think 'Jen' reference to a number of working agents. Maya is a pretty bland character as she sacrificed years of her life to the hunt for Osama bin Laden losing more and more of herself like Ahab searching for the White Whale. Having no life and being passive-aggressive does not make for an interesting character. She isn't so much robotic as inert. We know nothing about her, except that she was recruited to the CIA while in high school. We're never told what would draw the CIA to a high school student. Rather than reality, we are presented with a view of the world through the eyes of an angry childlike being. The film directed by Katherine Bigelow was at first was going to portray the long and unsuccessful hunt for bin Laden. Katherine was about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed and the story clearly had to rewritten. The movie opens up with emotional black screen that had 9/11 dialogue. It was very respectable to not to show those events in a Hollywood movie deem as entertainment. Still, hearing those real voices of the victims are chilling. We are follow with a scene of torture to terrorists in George W. Bush's America. Some people were mortified by the torture scenes but I'm sure the reality is much worse. I was very confused by what was the point of the movie's portrayal of torture. It was torture to see in the film, seeing people sitting around complaining that they have no intelligence because can't torture anyone once the Obama administration comes to power. The fact is that torture did not play any role in bringing Bin Laden to justice. It was very clear that torture is counterproductive and was a hindrance to our attempts to find Bin Laden. So why was the movie always showing torture help find him. Then there is the raid. The scene was so dark you could hardly see what anyone was doing. When the Seal Teams enter the compound of UBL it is very accurate according to the book; down to the 4 scope night inferred vision the operators where wearing. I believe the capturing of Bin Laden in the movie at the compound is based solely on Mr. Owens account. As far as the various forms of sleuthing the CIA used to find UBL can be debated, as in the book, the female CIA Operator does play an important role, she is the only operator that stayed on the UBL whereabouts as others were transferred in and out. I can't even fathom how the SEAL or the Agent felt during the mission. I do hope that the actual shooter wasn't one of the SEALs from the raid that were killed a few months later on that CH-47 that crashed. Loved the Weinstein Company Seal Team Six film for National Geographic Channel about the taking of Osama bin Laden. Now after watching Zero Dark Thirty, I have to say this is better. I love the fact that women are given prominent roles in the movie. It's rare to see women in government type roles. The supporting acting was great. I like James Gandolfini does such a great job of portraying the CIA direct, I almost thought he was Leon Panneta. Still there are some faults. Kathryn Bigelow's film is driven more by plot than by characters but it's a strong plot, clearly well-researched and told realistically while shrugging off any glamorizing or hero-making ambitions. None of the main characters are that likable, as they call portray using torture to gain information. Scenes also changed too many times so I couldn't figure out if the scene was in CIA headquarters in Virginia or in another country. Later in the movie after the bombing at the Marriott, Maya is invited out to eat and says ""I don't eat out, too dangerous."" Later, she is seen half intoxicated at a bar when a colleague delivers a rather important piece of intelligence equipment to her. Some people will think, the movie has this American propaganda and jingoism to it. I can see it, a bit. Plus, certain people will have their opinion on how the movie might be a bit partisanship due to the release. Some people will think makes Obama look good. It's greatest conspiracy ever, they might say. It didn't help that throwing Osama in the ocean was pretty stupid considering the conspiracy theories it has created. This movie needs closed captions as there is a lot of lingo talking and it is hard to understand what the actors talk because of the background noise. I kinda wish they research that Pakistan speaks Urdu, not Arabic. Bigelow and her writer Mark Boal went even deeper into research mode and now the film has instigated Congressional hearings in regards to some of the scenes due to allegations improper access to classified information. No matter what's happens. Zero Dark Thirty as Bigelow explained it, ""is a military term for 30 minutes after midnight, and it refers also to the darkness and secrecy that cloaked the entire decade-long mission."" In the end, this movie brings light to that."
"christophe92300","5","3","7","7 April 2013"," Disappointing
","The first hour is excessively heavy because the viewer is swamped by a mass of informations, not frankly interesting, such as names or events hard to put in order and organize logically.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie really ""starts"" when the team begins to track Abu Ahmed, about an 1h15 in. And still, it is far from an unbearable tension of a good thriller. Even the 30 minute final assault, supposedly the climax of the movie, turns out to be a bit disappointing, the outcome being known by everyone.<br/><br/>It is hard then to get enthusiastic about such an uneven and overlong movie. The script is weak because of a plot that is too linear, and rather shallow and bland characters. One could also question the level of faithfulness of the story to reality, some twists seeming a little easy.<br/><br/>After a rather enjoyable Hurt Locker, Bigelow missed the target with this Zero Dark Thirty, which will ultimately be soon forgotten."
"nicholas-daniel45","6","3","7","5 April 2013"," Mediocrity Defined
","Due to its receiving of academy attention and the generally positive light in which critics have viewed this movie I was expecting quite a bit from Zero Dark Thirty. Alas ZDT is just another movie in a series of over hyped movies released this year which i responded to with a resounding meh. Don't get me wrong this is not a bad film but I find it hard to say that is fantastic as many others have.<br/><br/>To begin I would like to say that this movie contains nothing strikingly original it is full of sequences ripped straight out of other modern military action movies, the best example being when Jessica's (Jennifer Ehle) meeting with an apparent informant. I don't want to spoil the result but the scene is full of tension building clique's that movie goers have seen so many times I just about understood its anatomy before it had even begun. <br/><br/>Can I add that casting actors who have been in cult TV series to play minor supporting roles in movies is never a good idea. Both the one true king of Westeros Stannis Baratheon, Thomas Jefferson and Henry Francis appear in this movie and it caused me to think and then say aloud 'wait a second isn't that the guy from Game of Thrones.' I become instantly aware that I'm watching a movie and it annoys the heck out of me. I'm not saying avoid TV actors all together (I think it would be a shame if Charles Dance never appeared in another Hollywood film) just cast them as major characters so that they become immersed in the role enough for me to forget that they were once the guy that Betty had an affair with in Mad Men. Just a suggestion.<br/><br/>Other then this the movie is nothing special, the climactic sequence in which the raid on Osama Bin Laden's complex is undeniably interesting and certainly lifted the movie but ultimately reminded me of playing Call of Duty. Yes the Zero Dark Thirty does contain an interesting true story (though I'm unsure how true it really is) but is directed with nearly no style and lacks any innovation. It is good action movie from a good director but an innovative and Oscar worthy film it certainly is not."
"runamokprods","9","3","7","21 March 2013"," Obviously this film divides viewers...
","...which, historically, a lot of the best films do.<br/><br/>For me, this film has two unusual qualities; <br/><br/>1) Its greatest weakness is also its greatest strength. It takes pains to keep its distance,, to stay neutral and unemotional. It refuses to assign easy labels, to people or issues, even (as has been much discussed) being ambiguous about the use of torture. It gives very little back-story, even of the lead character. It doesn't work to win you to a point of view, to make you want to cheer your approval,or shake your head in shame, or even like or dislike the characters. <br/><br/>For most of the film I found the effect (as one might expect) oddly alienating. I was gripped by the story, but I didn't feel emotions, or care about characters in the way a 'normal' film would have made me. And while watching the film this felt like a weakness. I felt distracted, disappointed, even bored at times, regardless of the dramatic nature of the story.<br/><br/>Yet that same quality led me to feeling powerfully haunted by the film when it was over -- to ponder violence and its effects on human beings, the thin lines between perseverance and obsession, the inability to ever have a clear morality in time of war. It forced me to think, uncomfortably, messily about a lot of things, for myself.<br/><br/>2) It's a film where, to a large degree the whole movie is redeemed by its final images,<br/><br/>Spoiler in next sentences!<br/><br/>In finally articulating the lost beyond words state of our lead character, suddenly all the emotion she never allowed herself and us is paid off in seeing that facade crack. <br/><br/>End spoiler alert<br/><br/>Ultimately a very brave, and very un-Hollywood film in pace, style and content. This is war, and people in war stripped of easy answers. <br/><br/>There are flaws (e.g. a lot of very pretty people who look more like actors than warriors), but these are minor compared to seeing an uncompromised and deeply challenging vision."

","A CIA analyst played by a pretty, pale-skinned actress, tracks a terrorist mastermind. She has an obscure theory that could crack the case but no one else seems to believe her. Her mentor is a more experienced analyst with a scruffy beard. No, I'm not describing the Showtime series, ""Homeland."" It's the new real-life thriller ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" about the hunt for Osama bin Laden.<br/><br/>Seldom before has there been a docudrama such as this that can be truly described as ""action-packed."" It's hard to believe a movie based on true events can have as many explosions as your average Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. But director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal demonstrate how ten years worth of chases, shoot-outs and bombings represented twists and turns on the path to finding the leader of al Qaeda. Every good action movie ends with the heroes storming the villain's lair. This one is no exception, but instead of a Death Star or a hollowed out volcano – it's a house in Abbottabad.<br/><br/>Bigelow stages the final assault on bin Laden's compound in near-real time. We all know the outcome and exactly how the scene will play out. But the fact Bigelow can still manage to make the sequence tense and riveting is a true testament to her skill as a filmmaker. The quiet precision of Seal Team Six is shot in large part with a ""night vision"" look. We feel like we're one of the soldiers on the ground. (The style also reminded me of the finale of ""Silence of the Lambs."" In the glowing, green dark -- bin Laden's compound is as scary a place as Buffalo Bill's house.) Boal and Bigelow take a detached, journalistic approach to dramatizing the events that lead up to the moment. The most controversial of those events, is the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" on a number of detainees. The movie doesn't hold back in showing the how these prisoners were treated. But it leaves it up to the audience to decide if that treatment was justifiable. Elsewhere in the movie, important information is divulged through normal interrogations of men who had been previously been forced to submit to those enhanced techniques. Do the men decide to talk in these circumstances because normal interrogations work better, or because they're afraid they'll be waterboarded again if they don't provide answers? This movie doesn't try to solve that puzzle – perhaps no one can.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a thoroughly researched, well-executed first draft of history that also happens to work completely as a Hollywood thriller. On September 11th, 2001 – many said that it felt like we were suddenly in a movie. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is that film, and now, we know how it ends. The question is, what comes next?"
"TheSquiss","9","3","7","23 February 2013"," A gritty reality beyond a filthy window we can't resist peeking through.
","That Zero Dark Thirty is a stunning, superb and at times deeply affecting film is common knowledge (if you keep even half and eye on the major award ceremonies) and to be expected, coming as it does from Kathryn Bigelow, the double Oscar-winning director of The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>For those living in a sack at the back of a cave who aren't aware of the events of 2 May 2011, Zero Dark Thirty depicts the elongated investigation, build up and execution of the events that led to the raid on Osama bin Laden's hideaway in Pakistan. How accurate it is may be open to some speculation but this is certainly no jingoistic propaganda flick in the vein of the god-awful Act of Valor. This is a brutal look at the impact America's stance had, and continues to have, on operatives, terrorists and suspects alike. It isn't always pleasant viewing and is, particularly at the beginning, nothing short of brutal.<br/><br/>Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a novice CIA operative whose first job is with the team interrogating prisoners resulting from the aftermath of the Al Qaeda attacks of 9/11. When she observes her first waterboarding session, led by Dan (Jason Clarke), she is shocked and sickened, barely able to watch the barbaric act performed on one human by several others. The discomfort we feel is matched by that which she portrays initially and, as we settle into the difficult viewing experience, she settles into her new existence as, if not perpetrator, then at least agreeing witness to the torture.<br/><br/>But this is where the audience seemed to separate into two camps. As the initial torture victim, Ammar (Reda Kateb in a harrowing performance), clutches a rare morsel of food and bottle of juice to his chest, fearful of losing it before he can down it, some seemed to shrug it off as deserved punishment and veered towards the impartiality that Maya displays. For some of us, though, Ammar's treatment was intolerable and his terror gnawed at our nerves while our heads filled with cries of contempt directed at America. The America that leads the fight against terror. At what cost perceived freedom? As Ammar is dragged around in a dog collar and leash, and examples of ever more extreme torture are further depicted, Dan repeats his mantra: ""When you lie to me I hurt you. "" No, Zero Dark Thirty should not be comfortable viewing. But while one camp in the audience squirmed, the other camp seemed to follow Maya's example as she watched, impotent and interested, as if learning. And that made for even more uncomfortable viewing.<br/><br/>Bin Laden's capture may be the subject of this film, but Zero Dark Thirty is about the impact not of a military exercise but on the people involved; 'civilized' people who fight terror with extreme methods and the effect it has on their minds, bodies and souls. Bombs and gunfire await them behind every door and every corner, nowhere is safe and the erosion of their security eats into their lives.<br/><br/>Dan is already damaged irreparably but even in him we see a flicker of humanity when that which he cares about is taken from him. In Maya, the soul destruction is almost too much to watch at times. She learns quickly, first dehumanizing herself then becoming confident in her work, but all the time her skin pales and she looks more drawn and lifeless. At the sharp end of her work, we realize her bosses have created a monster hardened beyond redemption and when the CIA director (James Gandolfini) barks ""Who are you?"", he is met with ""I'm the motherf****r that found this place, Sir."" It's almost humorous but the look upon her boss' face is not merely anger but resignation; another soul lost.<br/><br/>Chastain is a fine actress with an already impressive body of work that includes the unparalleled Take Shelter and the higher profiled The Help, but she has never been stronger than she is here. While Maya evokes anger and fear in her superiors and colleagues, Chastain causes our emotions to fray as our feelings towards Maya contort to follow her development. The character may not be easy to truly like in the end, but it is impossible not to regard the actress with the greatest admiration.<br/><br/>Bigelow has structured Zero Dark Thirty beautifully and, whilst we never truly relax, we become at ease with the tension and attuned to the mumbled voices and dark images. It is strikingly shot and bleakly etched, no inscribed, on our minds. This is the dirty side of war where the battlefield has no boundaries and the rulebook has long been dispensed with.<br/><br/>There is rarely any sense of mere drama, rather a gritty reality beyond a filth-streaked window through which we should not be peering but cannot resist. Mark Boal is a very serious contender for this week's Best Original Screenplay Oscar and it is no wonder. Never is the dialogue contrived. It is variously bitter and desperate; two adjectives that perhaps best describe the film as a whole.<br/><br/>That some viewers emerge from the cinema celebrating the greatness of America and proclaiming how much they enjoy Zero Dark Thirty is disturbing. Certainly this is a film to celebrate but is it really an event to cause joy? Isn't that missing the point? Certainly the man needed to be captured, absolutely terrorism must be fought and extremists on every side of the fence must be dissuaded from heinous acts of violence, but our reaction to Zero Dark Thirty should be tempered with thoughts of whether the end always justifies the means. How can a film depicting torture and execution be enjoyed? However, my heartbeat increased when the go ahead was eventually given for the mission. Was that excitement?

"pareshm","8","3","7","19 February 2013"," Worth a watch; even after some apparent drawbacks
","The biggest problem with this thriller was that the 'thrill' was no secret. The whole world knows the broad outlines of the greatest manhunt in the history. So the challenge in front of the filmmakers was to make it gripping and investigative (much more details are expected than those we already know from TV channels/newspaper articles).<br/><br/>Overall the film is worth a watch, but the lead character - Maya - played by Chastain is poorly written and developed. She does not seem knowledgeable about Al-Queda, Afghanistan, Pakistan or anything related to that geography. We are just supposed to take her word for it! Like when she scolds her senior for not knowing Al Queda. Nowhere in this film we feel that Maya is anything more than a desk analyst! On the contrary, the character of Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Danes) in the TV show Homeland is much closer to what the real life Maya (if such person actually exist/ed at all) should have been.<br/><br/>Anyway, the talk about torture scenes is more hype than anything else. The scenes were not so gory at all; much more gory details are shown on American Television! Too many goof-ups in geographical details are a constant turn off. But only the Indians and Pakistanis will find or mind these goof-ups; most Western (or non-Asians) will not notice them. <br/><br/>The last 20 minutes or so are superb and the real highlight of this film. Notice how quickly the 'target' is eliminated without much drama. <br/><br/>Overall, a decent film that could have been very good if the cared to develop the lead character rather than presenting a documentary."

","The film is very intense. I had high hopes for this film as it fits my preferred genre. The film reminds me of a murder mystery rather than a man-hunt and isn't right for you if you are looking for an action packed war film. Towards the end when the investigation comes together, you heart begins to pump with the characters as they approach the compound.<br/><br/>I found parts of the film quite disturbing when the characters are interrogating suspected members of al-qaeda, however towards the end, you begin to realised that the interrogation just adds to the effect and makes the man-hunt far more intense.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to people, however don't be expecting a action packed thriller unless you start watching from about three quarters of the way in."
"kunalkhandwala","8","3","7","5 February 2013"," Tense, gripping and satisfying end...
","The controversy surrounding Kathryn Bigelow's latest manhunt saga may pertain to the depiction of inhuman interrogation techniques employed by C.I.A in its pursuit of Al Qaeda operatives but what might really worry the Agency, is Hollywood's persistent depiction of its scandals, cover-ups and failures overseas. While the 'Green Zone' blew CIA's cover on the pursuit of WMD in Iraq, its credibility was at stake in a decade long hunt for Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty' enlightens us about one agent's single-minded, relentless pursuit of that leader for almost a decade, through various leads, targets and disappointments. Her challenges are not only within the immediate environment in the region but also the bureaucratic nature of the Agency and Pentagon's contrarian directives back home. Bigelow takes quite some time to go through the decade of investigations and frustrations but soars in the last 30 mins as the film arrives with the navy seals in Abbottabad, Pakistan.<br/><br/>As Maya (Jessica Chastain) joins the CIA on field in Pakistan, she quickly learns that truth arrives only after intimidation. The detainees offer some vital leads about suspected leaders of Al Qaeda but Maya's tireless efforts in pursuing each one often leads straight into a wall. The world's most dreaded militant organization isn't such an easy nut to crack and therefore, through the years following various attacks across the world by the militants, the CIA is yet unable to obtain any clue about the leadership's whereabouts. This leads to Pentagon questioning the billions spent in Afghanistan and initiating troops withdrawal with the lack of success in finding Bin Laden. But in 2011, it all turns a sharp corner when there is conclusive evidence about Abu Ahmed's movements. Maya has long pursued this close aid of Bin Laden who was either believed dead or impossible to find, owing to his critical role as the leader's trustworthy messenger. Ahmed's car is followed to this compound that might have the jackpot that America has been on the hunt for a decade. It is now up to Maya to convince the Agency's heads to deploy a team to apprehend those hidden in there, based on her intuition, knowledge and experience in the pursuit of Osama Bin Laden. Thus, a US Navy Seal team is sent on a quick, discreet mission to Abbottabad, near the Pakistan Military Academy.<br/><br/>The failures and frustrations confronted by Maya are similar to those faced by Mariane Pearl, played by Angelina Jolie in 'A Mighty Heart'. In both cases, leads were hard to find and most findings led to a disappointing end. The complexity of working in a foreign land that can occasionally turn hostile on its tourists, is also well depicted in both these movies but there is one distinction; Jessica Chastain lacks the credibility that was portrayed by Angelina Jolie. Indeed the characters are completely different but drawing parallels between them does put the Oscar hype around Chastain into some doubt. With just one main character in the entire story, we needed a more dominating performance to really feel the complexity, the intricacy, the dedication, the frustration and the closure. Chastain has a couple of strong moments, such as her defense against her superior and in the decision room before the climax but are they enough to justify her trophy against many worthy contenders? <br/><br/>Through the film's patient, dedicated pursuit of several leads, hurdles and set backs, we arrive at the crux of its subject matter in the last half hour when it gathers an all new momentum. Suddenly, this docu-drama turns into a 'Black Hawk Down' action showdown and leaves us satisfied in the end because we had known it all along. Kathryn Bigelow's treatment of the story is similar to her Oscar winning 'The Hurt Locker'. She keeps the grip tight with some excellent narrative, which compensates for the lack of stronger characters and brings in the action at the right times, aligned well with their real time occurrence in recent history. The final 30 mins are simply brilliant with the Navy Seals preparing for their mission, flying through the Hindu kush ranges and eventually engaging in a tense raid of the compound at 12:30am. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow deserves the respect and appreciation that she has garnered with her two most recent films and while 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a gripping dramatization of the real events leading to the end of Osama Bin Laden, the CIA on the other hand, will be glad that their hunt for the weapons of mass destruction wasn't futile. They simply had the wrong country and it was just 'a weapon' that caused mass destruction. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.25 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

They cut off at least four fingers from this terrorist sympathizer before whacking him. To get Bin Laden, you would think that just four fingers would a child's play compared to what the detainees actually would be willing to give up before they spilled the beans. But in ZERO DARK THIRTY, all the HELP lady needs to do is have one of her buddies pour a little water into this guy's mouth, and he's blabbing away like a brook! Golly, this is a desert, for crying out loud! Guys would be saying ""thank you"" for a little extra water in real life. So just what was all the hullabaloo about?

","I walked out of Zero Dark Thirty with quite a headache. This is definitely what the film was aiming for, tension that racks up your nerves, increases your heart rate, and leaves you with your teeth continuously clenching. The movie will leave you breathless and numb, much like your better wartime movies like Saving Private Ryan. But all this comes with a catch---this movie is quite cold, and the timing of this movie gives it an emotionally manipulating tint.<br/><br/>It is manipulating because it's the premise and not the cast of characters that sells this movie or keeps it afloat. It is the story that truly drives the movie, not the interactions amongst everyone involved. There is no character development, there are no catharsis moments, and nothing changes except for the progress towards the ultimate goal of killing Bin Laden. It is indeed an entertaining and a thrilling ride, but one wonders just how much mainstream and critical investment would be placed in the movie if it had not been so soon since the actual event.<br/><br/>The plot is simple; a massive manhunt begins immediately after 9/11 for Bin Laden and the leaders of Al-Qaeda. The movie follows mostly the feisty and hardworking CIA officer Maya, as she scrambles, gambles, and fights her way through the government ranks into ensuring that the man behind the awful terrorist attacks gets his justice. Throughout the two-and-a-half hours we see major step after major step as well as setbacks delivered through misinformation, more attacks, and bad surprises. Written by Mark Boal, his script here is full of intensity, drama, and everlasting anxiety.<br/><br/>On a technical and mostly artistic standpoint, the movie fires and hits on all cylinders. The performances were amazing, the technical direction by Kathryn Bigelow was superb, and the cinematography is among the best from any movie in 2012. That being said, the entire movie is extremely one-sided to a point that it almost runs as American propaganda.<br/><br/>We know all about the whos and the whats and the wheres, but we never ever get a glimpse of the whys. In movies like The Kingdom and Three Kings we are presented with the motives, thoughts, and mannerisms of the Middle East enemy. But in Zero Dark Thirty it pulls a Hurt Locker and doesn't give us any insight whatsoever into the mind of the enemy of the Americans—they are faceless, nameless, and the audience is offered no chance whatsoever at sympathy. Which is borderline ironic because the movie itself offers minimal emotion, with the first hint of emotion coming from.a scene involving a suspect finally getting something to drink after nearly starving to death.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a well-shot film with many curious decisions, ranging from the timing of the film (waiting a few more years could have given the third act more details), to the sheer bitter and cold mood of the entire production hampering it and preventing it from becoming a modern war classic. Much like The Hurt Locker, it lacks the heart required to add the necessary layer of substance and depth into the movie. Despite this, it is a very tense ride full of exhilarating performances and gritty realism that gives Zero Dark the edge over your average drama."

","I can not, of course, know what is true and what is not regarding the torture in the beginning of the film, but to call it ""torture propaganda"" as some of the comments claim, I just think is incorrect. I don't think anyone who saw the film thought the depiction of the waterboarding, for example, was anything but horrible, and I even started feeling sorry for the guy having to endure such a treatment.. <br/><br/>And to trash the ENTIRE film based on ones opinion on torture is just silly. You can't neglect all the qualities it holds: the acting is as good as flawless and the sense of realism during every scene is incredible.

"Bruce722","8","3","7","1 February 2013"," A bit overrated but still a good movie.
","Zero Dark Thirty was not the movie I expected. I went in expecting more of an international thriller involving the capture of Osama Bin Laden but the movie has much more of a crime drama feel to it. It's very slow and has almost no action whatsoever. That's not necessarily a bad thing it's just not what I expected based on the trailers for the film. I will also say this: The critics have highly overrated this film. Now don't get me wrong, I do not mean to make this review sound negative because I thought it was a really well made movie. The acting, especially by Jessica Chastain was superb. She's truly one of the best female actresses out there and I expect her to have many more leading roles in the near future. I also thought that the way the movie focused on her struggles to fight for her stance was well done. Lastly, I loved how the film ignored any political bias whatsoever. I was worried that there would be a slight liberal slant in the film and I didn't think there was any. With the way media is today, that was refreshing. The only negatives I had were that the ending wasn't done as well as it could've been and didn't feel like it fit with the tone of the movie. Also, the director decided to break up the movie into chapters for some reason and that was a terrible decision. The film flowed just fine without it but that added an episodic element that made a long movie feel even longer. Nonetheless, it was a good movie that was enjoyable, albeit long, to watch."
"zofos","6","3","7","30 January 2013"," Redhead In The Heart Of Darkness
","Not even two years after the event, the movie about the decade-long pursuit and killing of Al Qaeda terrorist leader and 9/11 plotter Osama Bin Laden comes to the big screen. It's been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, so I was expecting something incredible.<br/><br/>It reminded me a little of The French Connection with the hero obsessed with catching the bearded bad guy leading to a downbeat, make-up-your-own-mind conclusion. It also reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs with the female protagonist up against a sexist, bureaucratic male brick wall as she tries to put an end to an evil man's killing spree.<br/><br/>While Zero Dark Thirty is fascinating on a technical front and very good on the methods used to hunt Bin Laden, it falls down on the most important front: characterisation. The lead character is called simply Maya (we never find out her surname, not even a fictitious one). We only find out two personal things about her; she was recruited to the CIA from high school and she has no friends (remember how we were made to care about Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs with all the childhood memories about the death of her cop father?). So we know almost nothing about Maya and therefore we don't really care about her. It's hard to care about a character you've seen torturing suspects anyway, even if they are allegedly guilty. Maya is also charmless and humourless and there is no comic relief in a film of two and a half hours. I don't believe Maya would be allowed to harass her superior by writing on his window in red ink every day or that she would describe herself as a ""motherf***er"" to the head of the CIA without some sort of reprimand.<br/><br/>Reviewers have been raving about Jessica Chastain's performance and I have to wonder why. She was okay in it. I can't really see anything great about her performance mostly because her part is underwritten as such a one-note character. Only in the final scene does she do anything impressive with some very convincing tears but up until then, it was an average performance.<br/><br/>Also, Seal Team Six, the team that eventually killed Bin Laden, are portrayed as a bunch of bored jocks goofing off in the desert. They even get put down by Maya and just stand there like dummies. Again, I didn't believe that an elite unit of extremely tough men like them would take that from anyone. It really downplays Seal Team Six's significance in the whole thing and gives Maya credit for everything. This is a female director making a feminist point and I do believe she has taken a lot of creative licence to get that point across and the film suffers for it.<br/><br/>As virtually every reviewer has remarked, the last half hour with the assault on Bin Laden's compound is the best part of the film with director Kathryn Bigelow in her element. No more torture, no more talking, no more feminist point-scoring, it is pure action and suspense. You finally start to feel something. Even though we all know the outcome, the stakes are enormous. It's like a mini-film within a film like the stoned helicopter sequence in Goodfellas. With Tomahawk missiles, Apache helicopters and Bin Laden's codename Geronimo, it seems the Indian Wars are still ongoing at least in the American psyche. Geronimo is defeated once more and his body flown out where it is formally identified by the all-powerful Maya.<br/><br/>The film ends ambiguously with the line: ""Where do you want to go?"" as Maya sits alone in a huge plane crying. Is Kathryn Bigelow desperate to re-establish the character's femininity in the last scene after stomping through the film with a ruthless, robotic persona? Is Maya crying for herself or for what she's done in the movie? Is she crying because her 10-year obsession Bin Laden is dead and her life is essentially pointless now? Is it Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or PMT? Your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>As I was leaving the cinema, I overheard some middle-aged people debating the film. This woman said she believed that Bin Laden is still alive and that the movie was only saying he was dead for propaganda purposes. It seems the mysterious, invincible aura of Osama Bin Laden still exists for some people. For me, he is dead. I mourn not his passing but at what we have become in the fight against him."

But the story was able to keep great tension in the movie when it was about the CIA and it's efforts to hunt down UBL.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain does a great job in the lead role of this movie, probably will her career role IMO. Just as impressive but not given as much attention is the performance of Jason Clarke in what is the #2 lead of the film.<br/><br/>Whether the movie is realistic which I believe it is as realistic as they feel to reveal.

I was really excited to see this film too. <br/><br/>Then I watched it, and wow, I must say, this is up there with one of the most boring, poorly acted films I've ever seen. There's no depth to any of the characters, the script is weak with more holes than a tea bag, it might as well been an episode of Scooby Doo!!<br/><br/>It's so bad I can't even be bothered to write a proper review.<br/><br/>I loved the Hurt Locker but this film is just lazy on so many levels. Including the Oscar nomination, this film only got one because of the subject matter<br/><br/>This had the potential to be a superb film full of intrigue and suspense, instead we got Scrappy Doo goes to Pakistan.<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs."
"MadEden","9","3","7","21 January 2013"," Too much drama for history, and too much history for drama
","This is a peculiar film. And an important one. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thrity is one of those films that has to be done. If Kathryn Bigelow hadn't done it, someone will. There will be many ways to tell this story - or shall we call it history? It can be easily imagined that there be a documentary about it, and just as easily imagined a big patriotic Hollywood action picture about it. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is neither. And for the atmosphere and mood created by this film, we should feel much grateful to Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal. Most of the time the film possesses a quiet, reserved attitude. In the opening sequence about 9/11 - which is perhaps bound to be another classic scene in film history - all we could hear is screaming and yelling and reporting and talking; there was no image, for the entire scene. In the final take-down sequence, there was no triumphant and emotional music; there was, in fact, almost no sign of victory at all. There was only the dark (or green) images, running after, with, and alongside soldiers. In the end, there wasn't even one frontal shot of Osama Bin Laden's face. We could not feel triumph. We weren't supposed to.<br/><br/>In this aspect, Zero Dark Thirty is quite similar to Lincoln. Both are made by master filmmakers, both tell stories that are more or less known by everyone, and both succeeded in not looking cheesy by exhibiting exceptional reservation.<br/><br/>Both the camera and the music were masterfully handled. The cinematography is still hand-held documentary style, but this time it's well done. Where The Hurt Locker had overdone it to such a degree that the cinematography just distracted and annoyed, Zero Dark Thirty did just right.<br/><br/>Music was also reserved and appropriate. At the supposedly most exciting moments, there were, however, no music underlining the triumphant emotions. When it requires it, as in the helicopter scenes before the final operation, it is there.<br/><br/>Sadly, although the filmmaking of Zero is splendid, the film is not. <br/><br/>Zero is not exactly a film; it is too restrained by history. What ended up on the screen is not really a story, but mere segments of history told in chronological order. Compiling a film with segments instead of one whole story is nothing wrong in itself: Wong Kar Wai always does that, from Days of Being Wild to The Grandmaster. Quentin did that. But between these segments there must be connection: they may be connected by theme, by character, by parallel stories, by something.<br/><br/>In Zero Dark Thirty that connection is history and character. But the history connection is weak, the character connection weaker. Zero's story is Hunting for Bin Laden. And it did that, recounting events from 2001 to 2011. But what exactly does that offer? What depth does the film go into except that of a history textbook?<br/><br/>Of course, criticism on a film must consider the film's intention. If all Zero aspired to be is a history textbook, then we need not question its depth of story. However, it is evident that Zero is not history. As has been criticized by only too many, Zero has put all its focus and almost all the credits onto one woman, Maya. For history, Zero is too personal,<br/><br/>Yet it is not personal enough. Despite all the focus and all her screen time, Maya, as a character, makes us feel no more intimate or connected to her at the end than we did at the beginning of the film. We did not see a development through the story. We didn't really care. All we saw was a persistent hero. Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal has made up quite a bit of non-historic drama, but they didn't nearly make enough. <br/><br/>So I can't help but ask myself, again and again: What exactly is the point of this film? You might answer: there is no point, and it's just history. But for that there is too much drama. And if it's trying to make a point as a drama - well, can't see any."
"bobzmcishl","8","7","23","8 January 2013"," Tense from start to finish
","Jessica Chastain as Maya the lead character in the film does a thoroughly professional job as a CIA operative obsessed with the tracking down of the most wanted man in the world and willing to break a few eggs to make an omelet as the saying goes. The film relies heavily on actual terrorists incidents to move the story along, starting with the communications traffic that occurred in real time as 9/11 was occurring and then abruptly moving to secret off-site locations where the CIA interrogated captured terrorists suspected of being involved in 9/11. The torture scenes are not for the faint of heart and are of course the most controversial part of the movie. The movie makes the premise that torture does indeed work and that in fact it did occur, as reported by actual CIA personnel. Whether you agree with torture as a tactic or not, the scenes are hard to watch and uncomfortable. It is difficult to reconcile the horror of 9/11 with the horror that the United States of America will resort to torture to get the information it desperately wants. From the opening torture scenes the movie moves along to other major terrorist incidents that were world-wide headlines including the bus and train attacks in London, the bombing of the Marriott in Islamabad, and the attack on CIA agents at a base in Afghanistan. Parallel to the real events depicted in the movie are the use of electronic snooping to look for leads as to the whereabouts of BinLaden. The movie does a good job of showing the painstaking process of getting leads and piecing them together to provide a larger narrative. Finally as we all know they found the location of OBL and the last fourth of the movie covers that actual mission by the Navy Seals. The screenplay was excellent overall with the exception of some silly dialog related to potential boyfriends and there may have been some exaggeration of the dialog for dramatic effect but it makes the movie enjoyable and at certain points funny. This is one of the best movies of the year and a must see. Jessica Chastain adds to her already impressive resume."
"shahriyar-ovi","8","7","23","8 January 2013"," Another big blow from the dynamic duo
","The story spans from the tragic 911 incident to the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. Jessica Chastain, stiffly, plays the protagonist's role as a young CIA Agent Maya whose deep determination and an eight-year endless efforts lead her to the trace of bin Laden for hunt. Through slow detailed process, the plot grows to its peak gradually and engulfs enough tension during the Operation Neptune Spear to spear bin Laden. The dynamic duo--Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal--once again deal with a powerful, complicated plot to generate an extra-ordinary creation.

"mjpetro-smtp","8","6","19","9 January 2013"," A Ripping Good Yarn
","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a ripping good yarn. And that's the problem with it.<br/><br/>A word about the torture sequences that begin the saga: I've noticed a somewhat lively debate over whether or not the film ""condones"" torture, and I find it a silly argument in this case. This film does not present torture to exploit the fantasies of reptilian machismo in the repetitive and adolescent way of Fox's mostly Bush-era ""24"" (and as, frankly, most cinematic and televised drama cartoons it.) It simply *presents* it to the viewer.<br/><br/>I would say that critics on both sides of this ""debate"" are merely projecting their own feelings on the matter. Reality, once again, as Rorschach inkblot. I was repelled by what I saw, and I felt as much sympathy for the haplessness and moral ambiguity of the torturers as I did for their victim. But I see no reason to indict the filmmakers for reaching for the steady gaze of realism (perhaps they did not adequately present the extent of such brutality, but I ask: Is that even possible? In a *film?* I think we sometimes ask too much of the silver screen.) As I said, a ripping good yarn. Fantastic story arc. Protagonist angst and doubt, failure, triumph, a wonderfully silent reflection at the end that lets the viewer decide just what made those tears fall. Not to mention the mastery of suspense in a movie where the viewer already knows the outcome.<br/><br/>Or did I know the outcome? And does this fictional representation of history really reveal that outcome? Look, the body of Bin Laden is famously alleged to have been dumped into the - sorry, ""buried at"" - sea. Allegedly Bin Laden, allegedly dumped. Perhaps the dramatic narrative would have been adversely interrupted by expositing on this ""factoid"" - I am no director - but this is inarguably some serious history here. In any case, the film leaves me no satisfaction on an undoubtedly Executive action that was unnecessarily confusing to the public... or at least, to me.<br/><br/>This omission calls into question the factuality of the rest of the narrative, as realistic as it, truthfully told, come across.<br/><br/>I wear my tinfoil-hat with pride, but it's an ambiguous pride. Conspiracy ""theories"" are flimsy boats in treacherous waters, captained by exploitive (Alex Jones) and gregarious (Jesse Ventura) characters, and efforts to find True North are actively thwarted by the impish shenanigans of intelligence leadership (often mutinously abetted by their own captains - I'm looking at *you*, Jones.) But these theories persist because there is indeed so much that is hidden from us - in the name of national security, CYA, or for simple darned *whimsy* as far as I know or can tell. And so I try to be ""reasonable"" and avoid full-naked-Truther body slams into the froth, but there are questions to which answers are actively refused.<br/><br/>There are those who think that the film (and the book on which it is based) are vetted creations of the CIA. This is a reasonable suspicion. There is, after all, a Senate panel investigating this. And where goeth the CIA, the truth does not easily go.<br/><br/>I enjoy a good yarn as much as the next guy, but thumbs down on this story on its display of glib ignorance of its historical import.<br/><br/>That said - I give it ""8"" out of the customary 10 stars."

","""I'm not your friend. I'm not gonna help you. I'm gonna break you."" <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best directed films of this year. Kathryn Bigelow managed to orchestrate a film that transcends it's own cultural relevance delving deeper into the true depravity of human nature. Bigelow shows the extent American citizens went to capture Osama Bin Laden and the pathos of each individual who had to give up their lives, families, and even morals to capture an immoral man. <br/><br/>Jason Clarke (lawless, 2011) plays Dan, a CIA employee, PHD recipient, and ruthless interrogator. Clarke opens the film truly frightening, ""When you lie to me I hurt you."" He says every line in this film with such conviction that you cannot help but feel unnerved by his presence. This in not to say Clarke does not draw sympathy, he later becomes the perfect foil and at some points mirror image of Maya (Jessica Chastain). Clarke really surprised me in this film by showing his range as an actor, his ability to draw many different emotions from a complex character who could have been played off as a solider of fortune rather than a patriotic man who has reached him limits. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastian once again shows her range in this film as Maya, a CIA researcher compelled to find Osama Bin Laden. The obsession and dedication present in a man hunt is executed perfectly by Chastain, who really understands the depravity present in the ever changing character. Chastain is able to show the strength and innocence both present in Maya, and how these two characteristics juxtapose each other truly reflecting realistic person; who struggles to maintain herself in extreme circumstances. <br/><br/>One thing this film really shows is the idea that in order to understand a character you must first understand the historical influence which effects them. This film perfectly crafts the loss of morals required in a man hunt against an immoral man. As each character struggles to maintain a standard. that same feeling is present in everyday life. To witness horrors and vow to never be a part of them, only to be the facilitator the next minute. Zero Dark Thirty shows the capability in humans for evil. <br/><br/>The set design was fantastic in this film. They were able to perfectly re-create Osama Bin Laden's safe house. Also the helicopters and mission sequence felt very authentic through the use use of appropriate steady cam (unlike The Hunger Games) and the use of night vision. <br/><br/>The pace of the film is excellent, with a balance of suspense from a thriller and knowledge from a documentary. Bigelow manages to make the film seem less overwhelming by balancing the names, dates, facts, and information with human pathos. the 25 minute mission sequence is a bit lagging as I found myself waiting for emotional reward. This also shows the power of Bigelow's directing, even though I knew the conclusion I still felt an overwhelming suspense for the unknown. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is one of the most emotionally resonant films of the year, but also one of the best. Check it out while it's in theatres."

","The problem with this film is simply the lack of information. People in pakistan don't speak arabic wearing 18th century clothes. They could have at least googled the national language of pak. Plus why is this film all about the girl? She is just a coward who is yelling and cursing her boss while sitting behind a desktop(which somehow forces the agency to raid bin laden's compound).
Another major problem was the potrayal of pakistani people. They are not savages living in the middle of a desert raising camels. Also, this film shows clearly that the director/actors give no respect to one's religion or theor beliefs. There is a scene in which the lead actress wakes up all frustrated just because of the morning azaan or call to prayer. She sighs and rubs her hands against her forehead as if the world has ended. The sound of azaan is not that loud plus it lasts for hardly 2 mins. Be realistic."

"Leofwine_draca","5","4","11","20 August 2015"," Tough thriller with no heart
","An epic-length film chronicling the complex, confusing, and sheer frustrating decade-long hunt for terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, ZERO DARK THIRTY is directed Kathryn Bigelow's follow up to the masterful THE HURT LOCKER. Unfortunately this turns out to be a middling production that's just not in the same league as its predecessor.<br/><br/>The nature of the problem seems to lie in the script, which struggles to make a decent storyline out of lots of chaotic and seemingly disconnected events. The nature of the hunt is a long and ultra-slow one, and it doesn't help that the viewer has no characters to connect with. Jessica Chastain won all the plaudits for her role in the lead as the woman who simply refuses to give up the hunt for what might well be a bogeyman, but her acting consists of blank-faced staring for much of the running time and I didn't warm to her at all.<br/><br/>What ZERO DARK THIRTY becomes is a string of loosely-connected set-pieces, some of which are fantastic, others less so. The torture stuff seems rather interminable and too heavy-handed in its efforts to make a political point; on the other hand, the scenes with Jennifer Ehle are handled very well. The movie as a whole is technically proficient but it lacks bite and heart; there's no suspense or excitement here, even at the climax, which should be palm-sweatingly tense. The male characters are reduced to macho posturing (Chris Pratt, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke, Mark Strong) and Bigelow seems to focus more on providing distracting cameos (Scott Adkins, Edgar Ramirez, James Gandolfini, Stephen Dillane, John Barrowman) than making a truly remarkable film."
"normandorais","1","4","11","28 March 2015"," How bad can bad be?
","I had to give one star to this movie mainly because of the sound track. There is way to much torture for my taste. The depiction of the events were certainly approved by the white house and I suppose a large part of the budget for this lame movie surely comes from the same place. Kathryn Bigelow's scheme to aim at getting an Oscar by courting the establishment fails lamentably. The half documentary and half thriller formula leaves the audience bored to death. Casting Jessica Chastain as a trump card to avoid making a strictly guy flick is not very convincing either. After reading ten pages of comments, I could not help noticing that the word propaganda appears so many times that I cannot understand why the producers were not able to make it less obvious. Anyway at least the sound track was well composed and richly orchestrated. How bad is bad? Very Bad."

"tbmforclasstsar","10","9","33","5 January 2013"," a powerful, thrilling, and perfectly executed look into one of the greatest manhunts in history
","In February 2009, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal took down the likes of  James Cameron's Avatar, The Coen Brothers' A Serious Man, Tarantino's  Inglorious Basterds, and Jason Reitman's Up in the Air when their $15  million film about a bomb squad in Iraq called The Hurt Locker won Best  Picture at the Academy Awards. A powerful and thrilling look into the  war in Iraq, Bigelow and Boal were commended for making a modern day  war film that brought audiences into the drama of a political war that  Americans didn't fully understand or fathom.  Four years later, Bigelow and Boal have teamed up again for a modern  day war tale that gives us the story of one of the greatest manhunts of  all-time. Following the tale of a C.I.A. agent named Maya (Jessica  Chastain) hunting down Osama bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty is a heart-  pounding, realistic thriller that gives us an inside look at one of the  most memorable events of the last decade.  At first, it seems like Zero Dark Thirty may be an overly political  drama. The film begins with a black screen and a series of 911 calls on  the morning of September 11, 2001. The calls are heart-breaking and  place you right into the mindset of America at the time of this  tragedy. Many lives were lost, people were hurt nationwide, and justice  was sought for the pain we all felt.  Bring in Maya and a cast of characters (highlighted by Jason Clarke,  Kyle Chandler, and Jennifer Ehle) seeking information on the location  of Osama bin Laden some three years after 9/11. With brutal torture  methods, countless hours of questioning, and a search that seems like  it will have no end, their search is an arduous and painful one that is  not without sleepless nights, deadly threats, and tragic loss. One of  the many highlights of this film is how Bigelow and Boal take us into  the life of Maya and the crew searching down bin Laden. A strenuous  fight to find a man who seems like he is gone forever that we invest in  ourselves. With a two hour and forty minute runtime, we feel the  frustrations of these C.I.A. agents as leads end in loss and the search  seems to continuously go one step forward and three steps back.  This search is highlighted by the acting of Chastain, Clarke, Chandler,  and Ehle and the amazing script by Mark Boal. Engaging the audience  from beginning to end is always a tough task for any screenwriter, but  with a lengthy runtime full of frustrations and setbacks for the  characters and audience alike, the screenplay must be sound to keep an  audience invested in the story all the way through."

","I see people fall into one of two camps when watching this film.<br/><br/>Having been at the Pentagon on 9/11 and the days and weeks that followed. Having seen what was left of fellow human beings as their remains were carried out in chunks and pieces. 
I fell into the first camp - I am glad there are brave men and women doing the hard and messy jobs to keep us safe, and eliminate those who have no problem committing the most evil atrocities imaginable against their fellow humans.
I felt sorry not for the terrorists being water boarded, but for the innocent people murdered on 9/11 and in the various bombings committed. People who in one moment were a waiter, working to provide for their families, a human being with hopes and dreams, and the next instant were dead or gravely wounded by a terrorists bomb.<br/><br/>Then there is the second camp - who shrug their shoulders in apathy at all of that, but gnash their teeth at water boarding, or the US military. 
The rattle their keyboards in virtue signaling as if they are more moral than the rest of us for not caring about terrorist victims, but only caring about the poor terrorists that are captured.<br/><br/>If Ms. Bigelow truly wanted this to be a propaganda piece she would have come down a lot harder on the bombing scenes. Letting the camera linger on the carnage, allowing us to see the dying as real people and not just extras in her film.<br/><br/>I thought she did a good job all in all, and found it to be a good, but slightly flawed film.

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a 2012 political thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow starring Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre in 2001 are on of the most tragic events in the history of the United States of America, if not in the history of mankind in general. Whether you are American or not, this bloodcurdling day is still etched in the minds of the people. On this day only, terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda, with Osama Bin Laden leading the way, has taken the life of almost three thousand innocent Americans, and to this day, this tragedy in the beginning of the new millennium remains a day of remembrance. Shortly after these devastating happenings, every intelligence in the USA was ordered to track down and kill Bin Laden, to let him pay for what he has done. After he seemed to have vanished for multiple years, the CIA was able to eventually chase down the notorious leader of the terror network and take him out, after more than a decade-long search. This tragic story and especially how they started out with nothing are exactly what director Bigelow re-enacted with this stunning film. Beforehand, I knew that it was tough material and that it was going to be a Herculean task to depict the full vehemence of this true story, but I was sure that the director would be capable of doing it justice. Earlier this month I watched one of her earlier works, ""Point Break"", and two years ago I have already seen here first collaboration with Mark Boal, ""The Hurt Locker"" and that was enough for me to be persuaded that it is going to be as packing as the previously mentioned titles. Funnily enough, this film and I share a past, even though I have never seen it before. Around the time I have watched her award winning, Jeremy Renner fronted war thriller in 2018, I also had purchased this film here, but had kicked it down the road ever since. I always wanted to give it a spin in summer season, but in both 2018 and 2019, fall has come before I was able to check it out. I am not quite sure why, whether it was the long runtime or the subject matter that requires the viewer to be in a certain mood, but I never got around doing it. Only after I heard so much good things about it and it was directly recommended to me recently, I finally settled the score and gave it a watch. Oh boy, I kind of hate myself for not having watched it earlier. As I expected, Bigelow and Boal in fact made a cinematic achievement that is unlike many others. Aside from the fact that she again assembled a star-studded cast for her project, she was also able to enact the sheer intensity and complexity of the story and makes it look like the easiest task in the world. What impressed me the most to see though, that it wasn't only the glorification of probably the biggest revenge campaign in the history of the USA, but also shone a light on the shady side of this infamous operation and tackled all kinds of emotions one could feel in this context. Aside from real voice recordings, telephone calls and voice overs of news from that very day that turned out to have been used without permission, the film also depicts delicate details the US government probably didn't want to surface. As if the first minutes of black screen haven't hit me deeply enough, the sequences were detainees were tortured by CIA agents in order to receive information from them were gut-wrenching as well. I mean, who doesn't cringe at someone who is illegally waterboarded? Anyways, from there on I knew I was in for an uncompromising political thriller that doesn't mince matters in the slightest, because those two mentioned sequences were only approximately ten minutes of this two and a half hours behemoth. To be honest, my biggest fear that this film would be lengthy at times fortunately turned out to be false. Any minute less would have been insulting, as this film knows to grab its audience and not bore it out. Jessica Chastain is flat-out magnificent as the protagonist, the determined CIA operative Maya who eventually is responsible for the success of this whole operation. Her impressive performance leads the viewer through this well constructed battlefield of a plot, and with this film (that should have granted her the well-deserved Academy Award) she once again reminded me why she is one of my favourite actresses in the business (the scene she confronts Kyle Chandler's character? Boy, love her so much!). Speaking of plot, it is by far one of the most outstanding scripts I have ever seen in my entire reviewing career. It deals with an undeniably complex subject matter and still made it both, sophisticated and yet easily comprehensible. I am probably not the only one who doesn't have a notion about those kind of secret intelligence operations and researches, hence it was terrific to see that they managed to make it clear for a mainstream audience, and on top of that, extremely intriguing to follow. It is outstandingly paced and built up and calls a spade a spade. In everything it depicts, it is realistically merciless and doesn't hesitate to even tackle the hardest parts of this undoubtedly intense story. To the smallest detail, the viewer gets to witness everything, the successes, and the failure, until it peaks in the final act that is easily the most sensational sequence of the already outstandingly crafted movie. In the last roughly half and hour, Bigelow depicts the storming of Bin Laden's compound, also known as ""Operation Neptune's Spear"", and enacts it so powerfully that it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The way the film captures the whole operation, it didn't feel like I was watching a work of fiction and sat in my own room, it rather felt like I was in the situation myself. Like it has been the case in this film already all the time, this was only possible thanks to three key factors: cinematography, sound, and direction. DOP Greg Freiser knows to handle the camera and enable it to capture the rawest form of vehemence that underlies every single scene. The same applies to the stunning editing and sound score that know to support this emotion as well. All of that wouldn't be as marvellous as it is without the phenomenal direction of Kathryn Bigelow who coordinates all those elements and weaves it together like it was the easiest task on earth. Oh, and the end is also worth the mention for what emotions it has caused in me. Even though I was of course aware that Bin Laden has been successfully killed in this operation, it was alleviating to see that they indeed tracked down the right man. I am not even American, but this short but significant scene made me patriotic for a country I don't have the slightest connection with. As if that satisfaction wasn't already enough, we also get another scene that wraps up the role of our beloved protagonist Maya. After identifying the body as her main target, she is flown out back to the states, as she then has no task anymore. That was indeed a heart-breaking sequence, as she breaks out in tears, for she has spent most of her life on this one man and hence feels like she has no purpose anymore. I don't know if that was really important to the plot, but it unexpectedly touched me. All in all, this outstanding political thriller combines everything it needs to do this real story justice and treat it with respect. It doesn't omit a detail and narrates this story in a powerful manner and is also near perfect in terms of cinematic qualities. Lead by a brilliant Chastain, the star-studded cast knows to make the merciless story come to life in all its facets and still extremely enjoyable, nevertheless. It is complex, complicated, and yet, easy to follow, and most importantly, magnificently build up, well-paced and using its indeed long runtime superbly. All this is the work of outstanding director Kathryn Bigelow who seems to be the Hollywood counterpart of King Midas, as everything she touches turns to gold. An outstanding film, a phenomenal political thriller, and a title that everyone should have seen at least once, as it is film making par excellence. I am literally in awe for this cinematic achievement and wish I had seen it earlier. Don't make the same mistake I did and go watch it now if you haven't already. Simply Marvellous cinema."

"senor_spielbergo123","Null","0","0","18 May 2020"," How the US killed Osama bin Laden - warts and all
","Let's look at the controversy surrounding the ""enhanced interrogation"" scenes first. Bigelow claimed she wanted to include torture scenes because it really happened and not doing so would be whitewashing - a decision that I can only applaud.
Some critics (who may even believe torture was a justified means to an end) apparently took it as an attack on the CIA's success just by including their dirty methods. However, Bigelow's stylistic approach (not only in these scenes but the movie as a whole) feels like a reportage.
Therefore, other critics claimed she didn't condemn torture at all. Granted, we don't see any of the CIA agents show any form of objection to these methods or any regret. In fact, the only harsh words against torture came from Barrack Obama on the TV news.
However, if you payed attention, it is revealed the important cluetdfinfutihnuegfuu
 was in the CIA's archives all along and the torture had been unnecessary for finding Osama Bin Laden after all.
The audience's reaction to the torture is somewhat ""primed"" by the opening of the movie where you can hear the desperate emergency calls of victims on September 11th 2001. Of course, not putting the movie in the direct context of 9/11 would have been a poor directoral choice but here it is done in a slightly manipulative way. It makes the audience feel a bit more comfortable with the waterboarding etc. that was about to follow.<br/><br/>Other than torturing there was plenty of other ""detective work"". I didn't expect the movie to dumb things down but maybe it could have been a bit clearer about who's who and what's going on.
Needless to say, some parts are heavily fictionalized. Especially the part where 'Maya' wrote on an office window, how many days have passed without results. Although the character played by Jessica Chestain (whose performance is flawless) is inspired by a real CIA agent, it was not the success of a single person's work.
It is the one Hollywood clichÃ© in the movie that had me roll my eyes: The over-motivated, hot-headed young maverick who solves the case against all odds and against their resistent colleagues. Paradoxically, the movie would have been more feministic by focusing less on one single woman and showing that in reality there were more women sitting in important meetings than just 'Maya'.
Credit goes to the direction for the ""showdown"" where SEALs infiltrate Osama's fortress. It was very suspenseful to watch despite the audience already knowing the outcome.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to focus on the ending, which elevated the movie and you can interpret it in many ways. I didn't take Maya's tears on the plane as tears of joy. She is finally overcome by the realization that she hit her goal that she was working towards for many years. As alluded to in some scenes it has become her personal obsessions taking over her life and has become her ""jihad"". And now that the enemy is dead, now what?
It is also interesting that the real life 'Maya' - who's identity is unkown - did actually have signs of maladjustment after Bin Laden's death. According to former CIA member there were some incidents, e.g. she sent out email replies to her colleagues, claiming she deserved more credit than the rest of her team. This makes me hold on to my interpretation. She could be seen as a personification for the United States as a whole. A decade was characterized by a war on terrorism and a revengeful hunt for Osama bin Laden. Everything you worked for was motivated by killing an enemy who is now dead, leaving oyu without a direction. Yet, most of your problems (some were created along the way) are not gone."

"mistarkus","8","7","25","7 January 2013"," Contemporary War Movie
","Appealing to delve into the freshness of portraying this most contemporary of wars. This is a war movie and it is one of the first Hollywood ones dealing with the War against Al-Qaeda. Similar to how the climax of WWII culminated in D-day this is the first big movie showcasing the climax of the war against al-Qaeda (dropping the elite 6 over Ben-Laden's house) and like the many portrayals of D-Day in the history of cinema there will likely be other portrayals of the elite six coming down and getting Ben-Laden. <br/><br/>A war not so much about troops or arms or traditional battles of armies but rather a clandestine war consisting of sly CIA operatives and fanatical terrorist leaders hiding from the world. Victories and defeats not won or lost by traditional army battles but by achievements in intelligence or thwarted efforts to gain knowledge, continued concealment leading to more acts of terrorism. The beginning shows one of the battles of this contemporary war as an American operative tries to gain information through use of torture. Interestingly exposed is the strategy to gain information through the mechanism of torture. It shows how we did it and raises questions as to the morality of it. The movie did not leave the morality open for the audience but provided its biased interpretation of the situation. <br/><br/>Innovative to make a detailed account of this contemporary war however this innovation might be giving this film more accolade than it deserves and although a very good movie not the best one of the year. More sterile historical lesson than cinematic experience as the step-by-step detailed process in getting Ben-Laden moving through the scattered military bases seemed well researched yet long, not completely thrilling and at times a bit confusing. The protagonist was the driving soul of this movie slowly becoming more and more driven, obsessed? with her goal of getting Ben Laden this was to the detriment of anything else in her life especially human interaction. She had vulnerability but a mere couple of minutes was devoted to making a real character thus the sterile feel was not only in how the story was told but was also infused into the main character. She ultimately became more symbol than human being. <br/><br/>I do not know if one person was behind all this intelligence gathering it is hard to believe that all these years it could be one person yet the movie made it seem that it was all on this woman's shoulders. This gave Zero Dark Thirty a feminist quality by having this woman becoming the symbol and visual connotation of the CIAs secretive war against Al-Qaeda. The men either couldn't hack the intensity of the tortures and wanted to go back home, were far less committed and driven or were mere subservient foot soldiers for the female protagonists. The male soldiers were literally her arms as in a scene she touches one of them on command so that he would punch the victim being tortured. Even the elite 6 felt like extensions of this female protagonist. It was interesting to give this movie this feminist quality but it didn't seem realistic, not because it was female but because it seemed like there was only one person trying to get Ben-Laden.<br/><br/>It was immersive, there were some nice scenes transporting us to the middle east as we see the desert towns and hear the call to prayer. A well researched, well made, immersive movie about this freshly portrayed contemporary war."
"Stewball","10","10","41","4 January 2013"," What a Story
","What a story. And what a storyteller! Katheryn Bigelow is now among my top 5 working directors. Who'd have thought you could balance sensitivity with brutality in one movie and in one actress, Jessica Chastain, who's Maya is the feminine version of Jeremy Renner's William James in ""The Hurt Locker"". Casting couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>Bigelow probably had a feminist (as opposed to feminazi) agenda for doing this, a motivation well placed in this case, what with the focus on Maya who is the heart of the story in the eye of the storm, and the prime mover behind keeping the CIA in the hunt. The story takes your from phone recordings on 9-11, through the 10 intervening years and the near real-time portrayal of the operation, to the perfect ending with Maya in the C-130. For me, this closes the book on the 9-11 event (some would say closure), while at the same time helping us never to forget what the whole thing was about and that Al Quaeda is still out there--re: Benghazi. This ought to shore up the fears so many directors have of sticking to the history, using research to fill out the story and the characters instead of fabrications which usually end up being disappointing.<br/><br/>The political accusations from both sides prior to its release are near nil after they moved the wide release to Jan 11. I saw one pro and one con element and they were both muted. It's showing now in only one theater in metro Phoenix, and the two screens showing it had the parking lot overflowing by 2-3 times what I'd ever seen there before at night, much less mid-afternoon. My ONLY negative is the absent or nearly unnoticeable music. I'm giving it a 10/10, but if they'd have let me pick the music to play over the credits (""Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue""), I'd be giving it an 11.<br/><br/>For me this closes out 2012 for any award considerations, leaving this in contention with my other 10, ""Life of Pi"". It's a tossup, art vs. grit."

I'm not on the terrorist Muslim side at all but after seeing this horrible movie I now more than ever understands their hatred towards America. How can this film even be made after the Bush era? I thought America and Americans had moved on from their little flirtation with fascism after electing Obama for president. Zero Dark Thirty is out of touch in so many ways and is the only movie I can think of that should be banned from public viewing. Yes, it is a well made movie in many ways.

"rokkitt88","10","4","12","26 February 2013"," A great movie about the war, where the war is the star
","This is an excellent, gripping, fast moving film about America's war on terror. It's not a movie where the characters are large and the war is some kind of exotic backdrop for their adventures and feelings and romances.<br/><br/>This is not a WWII movie, with the street wise Italian, the Jewish intellectual, the Iowa farm boy, etc. We don't know anything about these fighters; we just watch how they struggle and fight.<br/><br/>It's a film about devotion to duty and endless work, not because the characters tell us so in tearful phone calls home, but because we watch them work, and watch the work lead nowhere or fall apart or blow up in their faces and how they (or their survivors) pick themselves up and start again, in the face of enormous odds against them, in a madrassa-educated country (Pakistan,in this case) that seems to hate them (and the rest of us) about as much as the declared jihadis do, and against pressure from higher-ups in their chain of command and Congressional oversight committees.<br/><br/>This is especially a movie for those who follow the news, read the books (The Looming Tower, Ghost Wars, etc.). We know who the ISI is, we know about the USS Cole, Khobar Towers; we remember Daniel Pearl, we even remember the episode with the Jordanian doctor.<br/><br/>We know the neighborhood; we know how incredibly cruel EVERYBODY is in this area, and to think that some want these bloodthirsty madmen to lawyer up, and further think that if we just stroll along like little Bo Peep, holding high a copy of the US Constitution, and keep our skirts clean, that thereby we'll win friends and influence people... is the saddest laugh of this benighted century so far.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of this story is true, but assuming a lot of it is, I'm enormously proud of these people who can only look forward to an anonymous star on a wall in Virginia. <br/><br/>They give us what security we have everyday as a gift, one that we unconsciously take for granted, which is often bought at the highest cost to these warriors' anonymous lives."

","I'm not going to lie: I always thought The Hurt Locker was overrated. It's a good movie, I can't deny that. I also love Jeremy Renner's performance. It's also original, but I just never really found anything that special in it. There isn't a whole lot of story. But Kathryn Bigelow scored big with it, and she won two Oscars. Now, three years later, she has brought us another journey into the danger zone, and this one is a true story. And it's a lot better.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is her new movie, and she is the perfect director have reigns of this baby. Zero Dark Thirty is a thriller that is even thrilling when it's not. I had absolutely no fingernails left by the time this was over. I'm not exactly sure of the accuracies of it all, but I don't really care. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain deserved her Oscar nomination and possible win as Maya, a C.I.A. agent who probably doesn't sleep. You can tell. Maya isn't an actual person. There was someone like her involved in the operation, but Maya is based off of her. The films tells of the decade long manhunt for Osama Bin Laden, basically. <br/><br/>What I like about a movie like Zero Dark Thirty is that we already know the ending, we just can't wait to see how we got there. The movie isn't as action packed as you might expect. A lot of it takes place within the C.I.A. headquarters, but each one of those scenes is expertly written by Hurt Locker writer Mark Boal. ZDT really cooks in the last half hour. What am I saying? The whole thing is a white knuckler.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that Jessica Chastain was brought into Hollywood.She's an excellent actress and I always look forward to what she has in the future. She could go home with an Oscar on the big night. As for the movie itself, it's momentum has sort of died out, considering the fact that it only has five nominations. One of them is not best director.<br/><br/>Why wouldn't they nominate her? I understand the nominations for Steven Spielberg, and Michael Haneke. But I would have easily put her over Benh Zeitlin, Ang Lee, and David O'Russell, no disrespect to either of those directors.

In fact, I would speculate that they were deliberately downplayed so as not to emphasise (or glorify) what we already knew (the US engaged in torture - period).<br/><br/>The helicopters taking off were a blessed relief but if the hoodwinked viewer was expecting a rapturous firefight to finish proceedings, with a startled Osama lookalike's face frozen in the semi-darkness then even that was to be denied.<br/><br/>If this was to dramatise the events leading up to UBL's (shouldn't that be OBL?) demise, how come there's no high-fives from the White House bunker?<br/><br/>This could have (and should have) been so much more insightful, instead it falls woefully short on substance.<br/><br/>As for Oscar nominated status?

There was no interesting aspect of the story line that kept me interested in the movie in any way. I found all of the characters shallow and felt that, despite the directors focus on Maya at the end of the movie, it was never about her, but about the hunt for Osama.<br/><br/>I feel that, to qualify something with this much hype as a movie, it must have some semblance of compelling story line existing throughout the movie. I mean, sure, make the climax of the story the death of Bin Laden, but add more depth to the characters, include a side story that reveals some aspect of any of the main characters and keeps the audience interested.

","Perhaps this film came out too soon. With the issues of torture and the lingering questions our country is debating on the ""war on terror"", this film was bound to provide a soapbox for both the left and right side of the debate. I would advise you not to worry too much about what this movie says or doesn't say about torture, and just go see if for yourself. <br/><br/>Why? Because the film provides an engaging, well scripted depiction of the uninteresting, boring, tedious and often unproductive nature of the CIA's tracking down of OBL. I thought this film was going to be like Black Hawk Down in terms of the time line it would follow. I was wrong. The story arc begins with 9/11 and is largely set in Pakistan where you watch a young CIA analyst (Jessica Chastain) slowly obsess over and piece together the leads that get her to OBL. <br/><br/>There are weaknesses in the writing and some poorly developed characters. Yet, over all I preferred the plot which stuck completely to the CIA's base in Pakistan rather than mix and match the DC politics with the ground game analysis. Of course the DC bureaucrats need their say, and the film gets you to DC during the final stages before the strike. In total, this is not a ""24"" type of film. Its not about the ticking bomb and torturing someone to get them to talk. Its a thoughtful depiction of a very difficult intelligence mission that does not make the mistake of intentionally trumping up any political ideologies nor does it advocate torture. It just gives an admittedly dumbed down view into the post-9/11 intelligence issues this country faced, which include as you will see some pretty brutal methods of culling information from sources."

They're all what they do for a living and nothing more, there's practically no depth to any of them. And by the time Laden's ugly looking hideout is raided, and his super hi-tec 1990's computers and video cassettes are gathered together, I'd more or less had my fill of US style manufactured history. But at least they were honest about the helicopter that the super trained team managed to crash into thin air before killing the unarmed suspect, that's at least something.

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very funny film. This is because the far Hollywood left condemned it for condoning torture and the far right (and CIA) condemned it because it seemed to indicate torture was often used when it wasn't--and odd case where both extremes seemed, in an odd way, to be in agreement! As for me, I wanted to see it simply because Asner and others DIDN'T want me to see the film and the more they complained, the more I felt it would be worth while. That, and the fact that it was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar guaranteed that sooner or later I'd see ""Zero Dark Thirty"". Despite this, however, I really wasn't all that anxious to watch the picture and didn't love watching it. Why? Because I know in general what happened and none of it really came as a surprise--and so it was all very anticlimactic.<br/><br/>Despite not adoring the film, it was pretty much what I expected from director Kathryn Bigelow--a very competently made film that seems almost documentary-like and with many lesser-known actors. She did a great job with ""Hurt Locker"" and once again she did a fine job with this movie. I would say more but frankly by this time (well after the Oscars), there have already been a bazillion reviews and I doubt if I would add more.<br/><br/>By the way, did any of you feel a bit odd seeing Chris Pratt (Andy from ""Parks and Recreation"") in the film? After seeing him in this other role, seeing him with the Seal Team was odd to say the least!"

","Zero Dark Thirty (2012)<br/><br/>An amazing movie for what it says and for what it doesn't. And a brilliantly well constructed movie--the camera-work, editing, and writing are all in synch here. The acting is excellent in a purposeful way, too--some of the best performances come not from the leads, who are restrained professionals looking at computer screens and going to meetings, but from the people in the action. This includes soldiers and spies, but also victims and those who underwent torture.<br/><br/>Torture, depicted one way or another, is a key element and famously controversial part of what happened, and it's shown here with quite a bit of brutality, untempered. You might guess it was even worse than this, or that it was unfairly brutal in the film--we're sure never going to know which. But it's an unfriendly part of the movie and I had a hard time watching it. (I would have edited to a shorter awful sample and then shift to allusions to torture in order to avoid torturing the audience.)<br/><br/>But there are other elements that you come to admire and wonder about accuracy in the best way because it seems so true. Like just how did the events in the final capture and kill take place? And what kind of process did the CIA have then (and still have now) with operatives and clashes with white collar diplomats? The CIA operative here, centering around the unusually perceptive and tireless Jessica Chastain, is convincing. In fact, the whole movie is convincing, which is why questions of truthfulness matter.<br/><br/>And which brings up the other point about all movies based on fact like this--there was no real surprise in the big sense. We know the end. We know the climax. This is almost an illustration of recent history, a ""dramatization"" to use a belittling term. And so it depends a whole lot on doing a bang up perfect job. Which it nearly does. It's a powerful and interesting movie, as well an exciting action drama. And there are implications that lurk after it's done that need some sorting out. For those who care.<br/><br/>See it, for sure. It's an interesting pairing with ""Argo"" even though decades apart in setting. I found Katheryn Bigelow's previous film, ""The Hurt Locker,"" to be more interesting and surprising in many ways, a better film I suppose. But this is equal to it in some ways, and so if you liked that one you ought to be in good shape here."
"maximkong","5","3","8","6 April 2013"," Heavily Technically Flawed! Again!
","I had reservations when I saw the name of the director who was responsible for the disastrous Hurt Locker (which I can only rate 4/10 stars, titled Heavily Technically Flawed! Well, looks like I am tempted to recycle this title again. Although the delivery looks better than Hurt Locker, the problem with this film came haunting back as technical flaws and wrong cultural perceptions again. Recreating real life stories (even if you have to adjust for some scenes for the sake of commercial appeal) is not that hard to do given the competitive movie-making talent nowadays - the real challenge to me is making sure the key details (even if they do not contribute to the plot) stays intact.<br/><br/>There were enough critic articles out there that were disappointed in how inaccurate the film is depicting the situation and the lifestyle in Pakistan, such prejudice that are available in so many sources that I wont comment here. Argo was also victim of this flaw, by the way.<br/><br/>For this movie, I would like to borrow from Esquire's interview of the shooter of bin Laden himself, his thoughts on the film seemed to show that he was turned off by the technical flaws as well, but commended on the film's portrayal of the CIA female analyst Maya:- <br/><br/>""They torture people in this movie, don't they? Everyone is chained to something."" <br/><br/>The Shooter is sitting next to me (the interviewer) at a local movie theater in January, watching Zero Dark Thirty for the first time. He laughs at the beginning of the film about the bin Laden hunt when the screen reads, ""Based on firsthand accounts of actual events."" His uncle, who is also with us, along with the mentor and the Shooter's wife, had asked him earlier whether he'd seen the film already.<br/><br/>""I saw the original,"" the Shooter said. As the action moves toward the mission itself, I ask the Shooter whether his heart is beating faster. ""No,"". But when a SEAL Team 6 movie character yells, ""Breacher!"" for someone to blow one of the doors of the Abbottabad compound, the Shooter says loudly, ""Are you kidding me? Shut up!"" He explains afterward that no one would ever yell, ""Breacher!"" during an assault. Deadly silence is standard practice, a fist to the helmet sufficient signal for a SEAL with explosive packets to go to work.<br/><br/>During the shooting sequence, which passes, like the real one, in a flash, his fingers form a steeple under his chin and his focus is intense.<br/><br/>But his criticisms at dinner afterward are minor.<br/><br/>""The tattoo scene was horrible,"" he says about a moment in the film when the ST6 assault group is lounging in Afghanistan waiting to go. ""Those guys had little skulls or something instead of having some real ink that goes up to here."" He points to his shoulder blade.<br/><br/>""It was fun to watch. There was just little stuff. The helos turned the wrong way toward the target, and they talked way, way too much during the assault itself. If someone was waiting for you, they could track your movements that way."" The tactics on the screen ""were bad,"" he says, and ""the mission in the movie took way too long"" compared with the actual event. The stairs inside bin Laden's building were configured inaccurately. A dog in the film was a German shepherd; the real one was a Belgian Malinois who'd previously been shot in the chest and survived. And there's no talking on the choppers in real life.<br/><br/>There was also no whispered calling out of bin Laden as the SEALs stared up the third-floor stairwell toward his bedroom. ""When Osama went down, it was chaos, people screaming. No one called his name."" ""They Hollywooded it up some."" The portrayal of the chief CIA human bloodhound, ""Maya,"" based on a real woman whose iron-willed assurance about the compound and its residents moved a government to action, was ""awesome"" says the Shooter. ""They made her a tough woman, which she is."" The Shooter and the mentor joke with each other about the latest thermal/night-vision eyewear used in the movie, which didn't exist when the older man was a SEAL.<br/><br/>""Dude, How come I never got my four-eye goggles?"" ""We have those."" ""Are you kidding me?"" ""SEAL Team 6, baby."" They laugh, at themselves as much as at each other.<br/><br/>The Shooter seems smoothed out, untroubled, as relaxed as I've seen him.<br/><br/>But the conversation turns dark when they discuss the portrayal of the other CIA operative, Jennifer Matthews, who was among seven people killed in 2009 when a suicide bomber was allowed into one of their black-ops stations in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>They both knew at least one of the paramilitary contractors who perished with her.<br/><br/>The supper table is suddenly flooded with the surge of strong emotions. Anguish, really, though they both hide it well. This is not a movie. It's real life, where death is final and threats last forever."

","I was amazed by the film critics score of 95, and thought that it should be a really good movie to get such high marks from the critics.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I feel the rating is undeserved. The movie is episodic and at the end it comes across as pure dumb luck that that they got a lead on UBL. It seems a cross between a documentary and an action movie which nevertheless is not satisfactory at either level.<br/><br/>Some events in the movie are surprisingly action movie like basically you have to check out your brains to believe them, like a car being attacked right at the exit of a compound With a guard. At the end you are left wondering where the facts end and fiction begins."
"DJRMewzique","7","3","8","22 January 2013"," Potentially the Most Overrated Film of the Year
","There is much to be said about ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Kathryn Bigelow's cinematic retelling of the hunt and killing of Osama bin Laden, but the most apt term that comes to mind is ""overrated."" Plot-wise, we all know how it goes and how it ends. War, hunting, research, torture, invasion, death. It covers a very long span in two hours and forty-five minutes and gives a somewhat choppy rendition of the ""actual"" events that lead to the discovery of where the world's most infamous terrorist was hiding.<br/><br/>I put the term ""actual"" in quotes because there is much debate as to how much of the film is true. Having seen it with a friend who knows more than the average person when it comes to American military manoeuvres, in my humble opinion, the all so-called ""controversy"" of the details of the film being somewhat untrue were created to mislead the public into thinking the truth was actually potentially fictitious.<br/><br/>Smart move, US military. Smart move.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is quite entertaining and really enlightening on many aspects of a hunt for a man that took almost a decade to find. Knowing the film was already in production prior to the actual killing of bin Laden, forcing Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal to backtrack and rewrite the entire ending to the film, lends much gravitas to the information being shared. Knowing some military officials' careers were put in jeopardy for revealing too much intel to Boal lends even more weight. That and the fact that I, myself, had my own intel that some details shared were thought to still be deemed ""classified."" However, the only reason this film is getting so much attention during Awards Season is mainly because it deals with such a climactic moment in American history and not because the film itself is actually any more worthy of an Oscar than any other military/action-like film like, say, ""The Avengers."" To not nominate it might be seen as ""un-American."" There is a reason why Bigelow did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Director: the film is simply not even close to being worthy of such a distinction. That being said, Jessica Chastain's highly-lauded performance as the CIA agent simply known as ""Maya"" who is believed to have been the mastermind behind the discovery of bin Laden's hideout is even more overrated than the film itself. Yet somehow, she is the front-runner for the Academy Award for Best Actress.<br/><br/>Usually an extraordinary talent (most deserving for her nomination for ""The Help""), Chastain's cardboard performance is utterly one-dimensional. Her lack of emotion or personality throughout the film made me think the role could have as easily been played by even the most dynamic of actresses, Kristen Stewart (read: sarcasm). As much as I was swept up in learning so much about the efforts that were made to capture this horrific individual, Chastain's performance from beginning to end left me wondering why exactly she would even be considered for an Oscar, never mind being a front-runner.<br/><br/>And alas, there is a good chance the Golden Guy will go to the second-least-deserving of the lot when three of the other performances nominated were actually nothing less than exceptional.<br/><br/>Technical nominations aside, the only truly deserving nominee of the bunch is Mark Boal, whose screenplay is based on intel collected by clearly rigorous research.<br/><br/>Many will be enthralled by this film. However, I highly doubt it will be because of the production value and more so for the information contained in its details. Thankfully, Bigelow has no chance of stealing an Oscar away from a far more deserving nominee for a second time. However, this time, that distinction has a good chance of falling in the hands of Chastain."
"herbqedi","8","3","8","15 January 2013"," Cohesive narrative with terrific acting a bit long and episodic but mostly worth it
","Jessica Chastain gives a magnificent and unforgettable performance as the obsessed CIA Agent Maya. As a rule, I do not care for long movies and I found Bigelow's Hurt Locker slow and unsatisfying even though much shorter than ZDT. However, even though this is more character study than action, I only looked at my watch once, The tale is told in rather episodic fashion but the episodes are gripping - especially the two surrounding Jenifer Ehle who was terrific. The length of the film seems paced to make us feel the frustration and endless desperation ans single-mindedness experienced by Maya. Kyle Chandler is well cast as her bureaucratic boss who is done in by her over-zealous maneuvers. The movie depicts Maya as a flawed heroine. It also shows the rather brutal assault on the Bin Laden house where the wives are fair game to be shot at blindly - the end of getting Bin Laden justifying the means. <br/><br/>An aside, I was as against the wars then as I am now and my feelings about the techniques used NOT being justified by 9/11 are the polar opposite of Maya's. But in telling her story, I don't believe this movie chronicling her exhausting and obsessive pursuit of Bin Laden glorifies the American war efforts. I think it tells the story objectively showing why the Americans were so unpopular and accurately depicting the intelligence-in-the field process. In now way do I see this as the propaganda movie others here reported - not at all. I just experienced a well-told and well-acted series of failed operations ultimately resulting in the successful killing of Bin Laden but at considerable costs of lives, money, and international goodwill. The mix of emotions depicted at the end underscores the ambiguity."

","After watching ""Zero Dark Thirty"" you and I can respect the CIA and Navy seals and U.S. military for all they do it's one dangerous job. And every American knows of the harrowing real life story of the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden a decade long one that when finally the man was destroyed relieved everyone. This picture directed by Kathryn Bigelow(""The Hurt Locker"") is long and a drawn out telling of the journey and years of CIA work from 2001 till 2011 when Osama was brought down. And somewhat raw and grueling is the interrogation scenes of torture techniques used as this picture displayed them in a brutal manner. It's one lead, one tip, one statement after another combined with the best camera and military survey equipment that the federal government has that leads slowly, but surely to the downfall of the evil radical. This film is one massive behind the scenes journey of top notch secretive work it's suspenseful and nerve binding. And shining thru it all is the bright little lady working undercover with the CIA it's Maya(in a very blunt and fearless performance from Jessica Chastain). Overall ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is one film that pays tribute to the unsung people as it highlights the little behind the scenes things are important as all of it leads to freedom and justice for all Americans."

","Zero Dark Thirty follows a C.I.A. operative's ten year man hunt of Osama bin Laden, former leader of the terrorist organization al-Qaeda, and how his death at the hands of Navy S.E.A.L. team six came into fruition.<br/><br/>The film is told in chapters in which there is a heavy amount of dialogue that is all building up to the eventual assembly of one of the biggest moments in American Military history. For the first hour and forty five minutes of the film, the pace is very well maintained, incorporating a lot of dialogue with several small action scenes mixed in to keep the audience on the edge of your seat. However, the story really begins to slow down as the film reaches its climax and this may be the films biggest downfall. Similar to Django Unchained and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the film could probably be cut down by at least ten to fifteen minutes.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty also features a terrific cast, highlighted by Jessica Chastain's performance as Maya, for which she won a Golden Globe award this past Sunday. The film also includes performances by Jason Clarke, Mark Strong, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, James Gandolfini, and Kyle Chandler. All the film's performances are outstanding and people should go and check out the film just for the acting alone.<br/><br/>With a good story and excellent performances, Zero Dark Thirty is another great film being released just in time for the Academy Awards season.

","Zero Dark Thirty is another addition to the historical movie genre. This time Bigelow has decided to glorify America by focusing on the hunt for the greatest manhunt of all time, the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. While the realism and constant evolution of the quest are impressive, this film still has some pace and balance issues to sort out to be almost three hours long. While some of the meeting scenes were interesting to me, there is only so much political bickering and repetitive complaints one can take. Despite this though, Bigelow and company did a nice job integrating the driving motives of the manhunt within the planning stages, bringing one into the CIA's world.

","I cannot possibly write a spoiler as if everyone does not know the outcome of this film then they have been hiding under a rock. Still I will make my comments general. Probably I should have given this docudrama a 10. I did not because the film has been criticized by some especially on the left who are much more knowledgeable than I am about the details of the operation.<br/><br/>In view of that I will give my high review a caveat. That caveat is that I wonder if the details of the film are absolutely accurate. Did the US use torture which includes water-boarding and SO much more? If so did that use of torture lead to revealing the details about bin Laden's courier leading directly to him. These two questions are pivotal.<br/><br/>STILL no matter what the veracity is concerning my two questions, the technological expertise of this film is a thing to behold. I am amazed on two levels. The first is that the film maker took such pains I believe to get the details correct AND I am awestruck by the nerves of steel of those who were involved in the planning of it and the US military who had nerves of steel conducting it. Ultimately, though, it needed the all systems go from the president. He gave it although the film showed nothing of the president but one knows in the final analysis of the mission if it failed he would have been blamed entirely! I suspect the filmmakers did not want to make this a political pro Obama statement. I thank the US military, the president's advisers and the president himself for their incredible pursuit and acquisition of intel to capture the world's most wanted man!"

It just seems that Hollywood is afraid to give any spin to their movies, if the matter is someway controversial.

They love actors and actresses who can't enunciate one word, and who speak with words so garbled together that it is impossible to understand what they say.<br/><br/>Next, expect the usual Nazi propaganda, in which it is imperative to show that only dark haired women are killed, and blond women have a super power that keeps them alive. This is something that helps keep the women interested, as most women are jealous of brunettes, and identify with blonds, no matter who they are.<br/><br/>It's so contrived in this way that one may not even notice it's contrived in every way.

It was also great that the film credits the unrelenting, life-threatening grunt work it really takes to hunt down and kill these cold-blooded Muslim terrorists.

I enjoyed the movie same as I did the last movie of this duo, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal. Kathryn Bigelow as a director has done splendid work to connect every piece together and create a great movie that keeps the audience to stay on their seat till the end. It was also a great work of Mark Boal in screenplay. Cast is full with great performances. Jessica Chastain's work is impressive as CIA agent Maya.

","The movie was high quality no doubt, but I give it a low overall mark because of the way the director chose to tell the story, which is through the eyes of the CIA operative and not much more. I expect she thought this was the main reason to make the movie, highlighting the dogged persistence shown by the woman. However this resulted in many very relevant and important things being left out of the plot. Little or no Seal Team training for the mission is shown, and there would have been a lot of it. There would have been lots of discussion about whether to involve the Pakistanis in the raid - this is not even mentioned. Pakistani F-16's are scrambled when they use a Blackhawk - mentioned once but not (as far as I could detect) mentioned again. There were many facets to this story, and Bigelow's tunnel-vision has resulted in a movie that is good, but not great, and about 45 minutes too long. Jessica Chastain is up for Best Actress at the Oscars for her role, and I do not believe it is worthy. Her acting was solid - but nothing remarkable; the best scene is where she chews out her boss in the corridor. 6/10."

","Not bad, but I'm really at a loss to explain critics tripping over their own feet trying to exalt it. The story is interesting, but, of course, this being a movie, you have to take its history of events with a grain of salt, which makes it kind of worthless in that respect. Cinematically, the raid sequence is by far the highlight, and definitely one of the best sequences of the year (I didn't time it but it had to run for 30 or 40 minutes), but after that it's fairly pedestrian. And I've gone from a waffling Jessica Chastain skeptic to full-on Jessica Chastain denier. She's very mediocre in this film, having little presence and delivering her big lines with no conviction (""I'm the m.f.er who found this"" had my eyes rolling hard). Since most of the story revolves around her, I didn't find anything in particular to attach to. I wasn't bored, per se, but I wasn't much interested, either. The character doesn't even do much. Her big break comes straight from someone else's hands. The best you can say about her is that she's the one who insisted upon it. The Jennifer Ehle subplot is so embarrassing you hope like Hell it never really happened, and, as far as the filmmaking is concerned, it's one of the worst sequences of the year, at least in a major film, so telegraphed and drawn out that if I was watching it on DVD I probably would have just skipped to the next chapter. There aren't any standout performances in the film, but I was happy to see Harold Perrineau, Mark Duplass and Chris Pratt show up. All in all, it is definitely worth seeing, but don't expect much."

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronicles the events that lead to the hunt of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the film runs like a full feature documentary that overlooks dramatization and becomes digressive most of the times, but by the end, the film is rewarding in terms that it remains truthful and is based on the first hand information (as the film claims). Perhaps it wasn't easy to chronicle the decade long hunt of Al Qaeda leader; so the film and the tactics in the beginning was a bit confusing and clumsy. The beginning shows few inhumanely tortures done on the detainees following terrorists attacks of 9/11. (We have the whole documentary ""Taxi to the Dark Side"" on this) But the final half an hour raid filmed is perhaps one of the best shots I've ever seen in movies and brings the essence of the film as zero dark thirty which stands for the military mission carried half past the midnight. In terms of historical importance, the film garners a lot of momentum and would be remembered much for the role of Jessica Chastain, as a CBI officer, who firmly pursues her hunt for Bin Laden after her reluctance in the beginning. The role doesn't parallel Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich or Jodie Foster from The Silence of the Lambs, but she carries the film in the end with a feeling of gratitude for her contribution to nation and its peace. Perhaps the film might be overwritten for its documentary feel, but personally, I feel it was the second best film nominated for Oscars this year after 'Argo.""<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
"Turfseer","5","2","5","22 September 2013"," Critics and liberal public seduced by overrated journalism exercise masquerading as compelling drama
","Emboldened by her big Oscar win for ""Hurt Locker,""' Director Kathryn Bigelow was determined to fry some bigger fish, by taking on the herculean task of chronicling the 10 year manhunt for America's most wanted man: Osama bin Laden. Initially, Bigelow partnered with screenwriter Mark Boal, to write about the failed attempt to catch Bin Laden at Tora Bora. Everything changed when bin Laden was caught and disposed of, so Boal scrapped the Tora Bora script and hashed out a new one rather quickly, featuring the now famous mission that resulted in bin Laden's demise.<br/><br/>Bigelow's strategy was to create a composite character based on the exploits of numerous CIA agents who were involved in tracking down and eventually uncovering bin Laden's infamous lair. She ended up creating 'Maya' (Jessica Chastain), after hearing about one particular female CIA agent involved in bin Laden's capture. As Rex Reed correctly notes in ""'The Observer,"" there was no evidence that the hunt for bin Laden was the exclusive province of one woman. In Reed's opinion, Bigelow's desire to create a ""Wonder Woman"" character backfires, as it ends up that ""Ms. Chastain's stoic, textbook approach to the role does nothing to illuminate or enlighten.""<br/><br/>The bigger problem with 'Zero Dark Thirty' is that it's inherently undramatic. Maya is never pitted against a concrete antagonist, whom she must butt heads with. In its place are a coterie of both individual terrorists whom we get to know for only a short time (Ammar Al-Baluchi, who's water boarded due to his 9/11 connections, or faceless terrorists, such as the ones whom attempt to assassinate Maya, when she attempts to drive out of the US Embassy in Pakistan). Bigelow ends up connecting her fictional Maya through sleight of hand: suddenly she just happens to be eating dinner at the Islamabad Hotel, when it's blown up in 2008 or her good CIA friend Jessica, is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. It's all good journalism, but Maya's individual drama, feels forced. When Maya does butt heads, it's merely with one of her CIA bosses, who's slow to act on her intelligence, due to orders from above (the new Obama administration certainly is proceeding too slowly for the veteran analyst's tastes).<br/><br/>After a series of drawn out CIA torture scenes, as well as the aforementioned historical scenes straight from the CNN breaking news play book, Bigelow's and Boal's journalistic ""research,"" pays some dividends when we're made privy to the way in which the CIA (Maya) tracks down bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed, who eventually leads them to bin Laden himself. Perhaps the most interesting scene in the film, is the way in which Ahmed is tracked down while driving his SUV (he's located through his cell phone signals).<br/><br/>While I would argue Bigelow is way overrated in the script department, she does know how to use a camera. The final scene, where the crack team of Navy Seals invades bin Laden's compound, and finishes him off, is expertly choreographed and actually somewhat nail biting (even though everyone knows the outcome).<br/><br/>Still, I'll argue Ms. Bigelow is a vastly overrated director, another Hollywood ""flavor of the month"" (usually ""flavors of the month,"" can last a good number of years, before they lose their taste). It's understandable, given the fact that there have been few female directors singled out as significant by the Hollywood powers that be, that suddenly Bigelow finds herself in the spotlight. In Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow and Boal mistakenly assumed that by merely clipping a few newspaper articles and conducting a few interviews with people connected to the CIA and then inserting a composite character into the action, that's enough to create a compelling story. Their 'mistake' still paid dividends: the overwhelming body of critics as well as a liberal general public, overjoyed by the liberal Obama administration's ""win,"" rubber stamped an ordinary film, as a masterpiece!"

Now that was involving and entertaining. Bigelow? Who cares, it's all technical. I wasn't really bored but I was looking at my watch a lot. Does Jessica Chastain really have much to do as an actor here? It must be great to get in an important movie but there is really little character to establish.

"GrowMagicBeans","7","2","5","31 January 2013"," Discussing the Enhanced Interrogation Aspects
","Because the plot revolves around information gathered from detainees subjected to so called 'enhanced interrogation methods' which, according to the movie, contributed in locating Osama Bin Laden, many critics have gone so far as to condemn this movie, claiming it to be pro-torture in essence. I myself felt a little ill at ease immediately after viewing the movie as I tried to process what exactly it was attempting to say. There is no doubt that if, like me, you abhor the disregard to basic human dignity of any individual, this movie will, at best, be challenging. However, I believe 'challenging' can be a good thing!<br/><br/>The director, Kathryn Bigelow, maintains she was simply making a historical representation of the events leading up to locating Osama Bin Laden. However, it has been argued that the importance of critical information supposedly obtained from detainees, was either non-existent or has been greatly exaggerated or by the movie. This feature then raises the age old question of whether or not the film maker has a responsibility in the stories he/she tells, especially in a historical context, and if so, where do these responsibilities lie? Was it irresponsible to depict that the inhumane treatment of individuals can lead to a positive net effect? Yet, taking the hypothetical assumption that the interrogation methods did yield critical information in real life, might it not have been a greater crime then, to simply fluff over aspects of history in an attempt to exude political correctness? That is, if the torture scenes were left out and their context not assimilated into a truth that was, would we not then, whether by good or bad intension, be rewriting history with a glossy coat?<br/><br/>I can understand perfectly well why some anti-torture organisations are angered by this movie, but I would argue that sometimes groups pushing an agenda --even where it be a socially positive one-- often fall into the trap of assuming that the greater audience will simply act like a sponge and 'soak up' what is fed to them in a rudimentary fashion. And so, without wanting to fall into the trap of assuming what others will take out of the movie, I decided to adopt the introspective approach and see if it changed my views in any way. Just say torture did lead to finding Osama Bin Laden, did that then change my view in the use of enhanced interrogation methods? Indeed, I remember living through those years and hearing very technical debates on the precise definition of torture: Of whether 'water boarding' could be considered torture? Was torture defined by bodily harm? Was it defined by death? And if so, without the result of even bruising, could sleep deprivation really be considered torture? ...and so forth. By focusing these debates on individual aspects of enhanced interrogation, they perhaps had a diminishing effect upon the issue as a whole. Whereas ZDT delivers a brutal and vivid representation, liberated perhaps from the limits of minimising definition. We, as the audience, whether we condoned or condemned such techniques, are forced to watch what that reality surmounts to.<br/><br/>By not overtly condemning such methods, or at least by seemingly standing on the fence on such issues, the movie avoids preaching to, or patronising its audience, but instead leaves us to shift through some unsettling contradictions and draw our own conclusions. I believe its true voice is therefore both subtle and subversive. Even the main characters are quite contentious and provocative. Dan (played by Jason Clarke) seems to take near sadistic pleasure --or at least pride-- in his methods of interrogation. Right from the opening shot, we are left with an unsettling feeling as we see one of the detainees stung up, too weak to stand, yet, due to his restraints, unable to lie down. Maya, the main character (Jessica Chastain), is obviously disturbed, but still, whether through a sense of duty or patriotism, not only watches without protest, but later, through the actions in her own interrogations, seems to have come to condone such practices. Where then does that leave us as the audience? Can we sympathise with such characters? And yet, as we watch their stresses and strains; the emotional exhaustion and the mental anguish, we are only but compelled to be at least a little sympathetic towards the conditioning and dehumanising factor of their job. Does that then make us somewhat complicit? Are we drawn into their world of 'us versus them'? At every corner, at every consideration, the movie challenges our sense of justice, of patriotism, of righteousness. Perhaps there may well be those who watch this and immediately conclude that the ends do justify the means, but this is a movie with many layers and it has a residual effect that continues to nag, to pluck, and question our ideologies well after the movie is over. As part of the wider western word, we are only now beginning to pick up the pieces from a decade long War on Terror, and now we must try to reconcile, rather than flinch away, from a history that has as many dark corners as it had a hunger to seek out and find justice. This movie, without shame and without quivering, lifts the rock on as many ugly truths and makes us look inward at ourselves, as much as it closes the book on potentially the greatest manhunt in human history."
"ganeshsubramanian","7","2","5","30 January 2013"," A highly charged political thriller, very good portrayal!!
","Kathryn Bigelow (Oscar winning director of 'The Hurt Locker') brings us a very good portrayal of the events that lead up to the assassination of Osama Bin Laden (OBL). She has aptly collaborated with writer Mark Boal (a journalist himself) in order to nicely bring out those moments on screen. Jessica Chastain (as Maya) delivers a fine yet subdued performance in her Analyst role that actually leads up to OBL's hideout in Pakistan. We get to witness many torture methods on detainees (especially water-boarding) that makes the movie a bit controversial. Yet, the Production Design and the Cinematography combines well with the Screenplay and provides the viewers a glimpse of the events as it unfolded at that time.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in the movie was quite good as well. Jason Clarke as Dan, Kyle Chandler as Station Chief Joe Bradley and James Gandolfini making a brief appearance as CIA Director Leon Panetta were impressive in their performances. It looks like most of the movie had been shot in India (adjoining Pakistan, in order to depict Pakistan-like environment). Although the movie starts off in a slow note, it really picks up pace at the halfway point and goes on to deliver from there. The scenes involving the Navy SEAL raid in the night environment stands out as impressive. The movie strikes a right chord all along the narration with the audience.<br/><br/>The movie kept me gripped for a while at the start, became engrossing in the middle and was getting towards predictability at the end. Mark Boal aptly deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay for his research and writing of the events for the screen (although some of the facts as mentioned in the movie are questionable and was aptly pointed out by other reviewers in this forum). My overall rating would be a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Regards, Ganesh."
"callejaiglesias","7","2","5","28 January 2013"," More interesting than i thought
","I think it is compulsory to watch this movie in order to know what ""they"" want us to know about what happened with Osama Bin Laden. <br/><br/>First of all I have to say that I personally don't believe any concrete explanation around 9/11, we will never know what really happened, but once i've said this, I think it is interesting to know all perspectives in order to have a general picture, and this movie gives us a very interesting one.<br/><br/>This movie begins with the words ""based on true events"". After that they ""reveal"" us part of the investigation since 2001 to find Al-Qaeda members and Bin Laden. Kathryn Bigelow have a decent casting to develop all the characters involved in the story with a little exception, Jessica Chastain, too beautiful, sexy and actress to be the stubborn agent behind desks who, supposedly, was the key person of the whole investigation. I don't know if this fact is kind of a subtle provocation or just a blockbuster inevitable ingredient, but in my opinion it makes the film less believable somehow. Anyway, I must admit the film has a very good rhythm and excellent work of locations, keeping up the tension and the sense of reality all the time.<br/><br/>Spoiler: what surprises me more is the end, I thought a film about this topic would be more ""black and white"" for the big public, but there is a lot of grey here, which is good. In my opinion they let us to think the third man in the house in Abbottabad could not be the one they were looking for, even despite of the not too clear sequences where they confirm the identity. The other great point is how this movie shows through the investigation how everyone is controlled and the capital weight of mobile phones nowadays and specially in this story.<br/><br/>Apart from the ""historic"" events, this film can also being watched and enjoyed as a very decent action, thriller and investigation movie."
"ChooseyAMovie","6","2","5","27 January 2013"," Overrated, but still OK.
","Zero Dark Thirty follows the extensive 10-year search for Osama Bin Laden by a persuasive CIA agent called Maya played by Jessica Chastain.<br/><br/>I had pre conceived notions that this film was going to be good. I had read reviews before hand and the main complaints were that it was slow and boring at the beginning and it picked up incredibly fast and became great at the end. For me it was the other way around. I loved the first half, however overplayed it was, and didn't enjoy the second half as much. I personally found this film to be very overrated and it's failed attempts at tension just didn't fit. And supposedly everything in this film is more truer to life than any other based on real events films, which is ironic because I didn't like Argo due to it's dramatized ending.<br/><br/>I wasn't the biggest fan of The Hurt Locker, I tend to disapprove of shaky camera-work and just didn't find any the characters intriguing. That wasn't necessarily the case here, as I found Maya to be interesting, and then when it drifted away from her struggle for about 30 minutes the whole film seemed like it went downhill fast. And, to be honest, Jessica Chastain was great and all, but she wasn't as fantastic as everyone claims. Also, in my head, the climactic scene played out a lot better but when I saw it, I felt no climax. The climactic, finishing scene in my opinion was very anti-climactic.<br/><br/>I wanted so much to enjoy this film, but unfortunately I didn't. It was prolonged and lacked any emotion it so desperately attempted to attain. It has it's good points, but the bad outweigh the good ten fold, and that is why I think it deserves a low 6."
"Parks","7","2","5","27 January 2013"," Taxi To The Revisionist Side
","So let's deal with the torture first, because that seems to be what everyone is talking about. The scenes depicted in this movie should not be shocking to anyone who has been watching the news for the past 8 years. If anything they are quite mild compared to what you might see in an average episode of ""Criminal Minds"". What some have found shocking is the claim that it was torture that ""found"" Osama. Again, this has been in the news for over a year now - but there are things to consider - <br/><br/>a) Kathryn Bigelow's movie is based upon the CIA version of events so take from that what you like. b) The US has been more successful in taking out al Qaeda targets after torture was removed as an option than it was under Bush/Cheney. (Google it if you don't believe me). c) We see a successful interrogation at Bagram. We don't see any interrogations of innocent dudes who also ended up tied to the ceiling there (see documentary ""Taxi To The Dark Side"").<br/><br/>So my feeling is, if you go in accepting the movie as unexpurgated truth, you're a bit daft. But then I'd say that about all movies anyway. Moving on.<br/><br/>As drama, it is semi-successful. The issue here is that the subject matter is pretty dry for the first 3/4 of the story. People mostly sit in rooms discussing leads, politics and techniques. In an attempt to humanise the story and draw us in, we are given the character of Maya to follow. She's a young CIA agent who becomes obsessed with finding Abu Ahmed, Bin Laden's courier. But is he still alive? Does he even exist? He's so shadowy her superiors think not and we follow her frustration over the years as other leads are followed to no avail.<br/><br/>I think the reason this part of the movie felt a bit dry to me was that essentially it was covering documentary territory and the character of Maya is so one-note (driven and dedicated) that it's hard to find an emotional foothold in the film. <br/><br/>Compare it to the more emotive ""Argo"" and it's nowhere near as compelling. But then we reach the last act. The assault on Osama's compound. It's brilliantly staged and, given that we know how it ends, incredibly tense. The whole audience was holding their breath the whole way.<br/><br/>So I was glad I saw ""Zero Dark Thirty"". It is a good film and worth seeing. Is it ""Best Film Oscar"" material? I think so - but for me ""Argo"" & ""The Sessions"" are much more satisfying films."
"BeneCumb","7","2","5","24 January 2013"," Seems realistic, but too protracted and too focused on a single character
","Although the plot covers the events over a decade, the ones picked for showing could have been much shorter - 2,5 hours is too long for a movie where interrogations, surveillances and mappings prevail. Thus, the movie is often arid, although there are sudden twists; well, the first is really sudden, then you start to expect a frames before shocking events are rather similarly depicted. The ending is trivial as well.<br/><br/>The casting is decent: Jessica Chastain is brilliant and deserves her Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination, but she is too much on screen, at times one might think that this was her operation, being the chief coordinator or so. All others are supporting actors and not really catchy, with the exception of James Gandolfini and Mark Strong - but they were too briefly on screen. So it is all like a solo story, there is no even cast to follow and enjoy.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is above average, but 5 Academy Award nominations?! Too much, I think. Mrs Bigelow has directed far better movies; by the way, Hurt Locker did not impress me either, too static and the events too ""far"" from me and not attractive. Both these movies are OK to watch once, but hardly more."
"LloydBayer","7","2","5","24 January 2013"," Good but flawed
","Over and above the retrospective narration on 'the greatest manhunt in history', ZERO DARK THIRTY is either a finely crafted espionage drama, or a controversial piece of political propaganda, or a little bit of both. As a cinematic experience, the entertainment quotation varies depending on what you might have grown to expect from this film. And depending on that expectation, this film will either appeal to you, or turn you away in indifference.<br/><br/>The title is military jargon for 'half past midnight'. It also refers to the time stamped go-order issued by the Pentagon, to raid a compound in Pakistan said to be housing Al-Qaeda terrorist and chief Osama bin Laden. As of 2nd May 2011, we are told that bin Laden was Allegedly eliminated by the US Navy SEALS. This film is all about the ""deductive reasoning"" as one CIA official puts it, in tracking down bin Laden before he was shot to death. The film opens with a blacked out screen stating that it is based on ""first hand"" accounts of actual events. In total darkness, we listen for two minutes where American citizens cry out in horror and chaos as the World Trade Centre succumbs to terrorist attacks on 11th September, 2001. Two years later, the CIA has detained Ammar, a suspect linked to Al-Qaeda terrorists in Saudi Arabia. Held at a CIA black site (a location disavowed by the US government) in Pakistan, Ammar is interrogated, tortured and humiliated until he gives CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) a name – a person said to be bin Laden's courier and confidant. Working with probability on one hand and informed guesses on the other, Maya must now convince the male dominated corridors of power that the courier will lead them to bin Laden.<br/><br/>At the time of reviewing this film, ZERO DARK THIRTY has been nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year. I concur that this is an important film and perfectly timed as such. Over 3000 people lost their lives on the ill-fated and historically infamous 9/11 2001. Add to that hundreds of thousands more on the so called ""war on terror"" and over a trillion US dollars in defense spending. But what has all this amounted to cinematically? Sure, various other films have tried to throw light on what America has done to avenge the loss of innocent lives since 9/11, but what makes this film so special? Try Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal – the production team that got 2008's similarly themed THE HURT LOCKER six Academy Awards including Best Picture. Bigelow returns as director, co-producing with returning screen writer Boal. It is fairly evident that Bigelow and Boal have pulled out all the stops in delivering a top-notch film. That said, I am still not convinced that this is the best film of 2012. My problem lies in the murky prologue and an indistinct epilogue. It is almost as if the director and the writer expected the whole world to be tuned in since 9/11. This downplays the narrative in as much as saying ""Meanwhile, in a CIA black site in Pakistan"" The ending is even more annoying. Bin Laden gets his duly deserved double-tap (standard engagement procedure, none less), then what? Is the world safe from terrorism? Do the surviving dependents of thousands of slain victims find closure? Does Maya become a hero? Will the CIA recruit more women? Sadly, none of these questions are answered, and by not answering these questions, where lies the point of this film, less its making?<br/><br/>Then there exists the controversy that becomes a thin line between fact and fiction. By claiming to have the film based on reliable sources, we are given to believe that the US government endorses torture as an enhanced interrogation technique. This part of the narrative could be over hyped if associated as the political propaganda that aided President Obama's re-election. But given that Bigelow made THE HURT LOCKER without propaganda, I am content in accepting this film as an espionage drama rather than a trigger-happy depiction vindicating the US government's trillion dollar deficit. <br/><br/>ZERO DARK THIRTY also manages a cut above the rest if perceived for its other cinematic qualities – engaging and fast paced narrative, nail biting suspense that leads to startling moments of terror, and some fine acting chops. Jessica Chastain delivers a tour de force achievement transforming Maya into a fiery CIA officer with conviction. There is one particular scene that reminds me of a younger Meryl Streep. Ironically, bin Laden is said to have loathed women in office. By the looks of it, Chastain and Bigelow may have just sent bin Laden a whirling undercurrent to upset his watery grave. Also worth mentioning are a plethora of supporting roles. Most notable are Jason Clarke as Maya's colleague and interrogation officer, Mark Strong in a fierce pep-talk speech, and some amusing sarcasm from James Gandolfini as former CIA director Leon Panetta. The actual raid is left for the last but best thirty minutes of the film. This is also when I was pleasantly surprised with the use of some military hardware, the likes of which have remained a top secret like the elusive 'Area 51'. At least till now."
"howard.schumann","8","4","14","12 January 2013"," A paean to American exceptionalism
","Torturing detainees is depicted as ""day-to-day tradecraft"" in Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Zero Dark Thirty, a controversial account of the ten-year campaign to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden, whom it is widely agreed was responsible for the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. Jessica Chastain stars as Maya, a strong and self-assured young CIA agent who has dedicated her professional life to the capture of bin Laden. Maya has no back story and is basically a cipher but is depicted as a goal-oriented, independent woman not defined by any romantic relationship but only by her single-minded purpose.<br/><br/>Like Argo, the film is a paean to American exceptionalism and the U.S. intelligence agencies are the heroes. As director Kathryn Bigelow has stated, the movie is about ""the unsung heroes of the intelligence community, those who work in the shadows."" According to Canadian investigative journalist, William Marsden, to obtain information, ""the White House, the CIA and the U.S. Defense Department all worked closely with the filmmakers by granting them unprecedented access to classified information so that they could come out with an authentic film."" Unsurprisingly, Ms. Bigelow stands by her screenwriter Mark Boal's interviews with CIA operatives, saying that ""I feel very confident with his reporting, very confident with my handling of his reporting."" <br/><br/>It is the CIA, of course, that has stood by the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques,"" a euphemism for torture. According to the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, ""The CIA did not first learn about the existence or the identity of the Osama Bin Laden courier from CIA detainees subject to coercive interrogation techniques, but through means unrelated to the CIA detention and interrogation program."" In reply, Boal has stated that the information in question was garnered not during an interrogation but calmly over lunch after the torture had stopped, a response that can only be called disingenuous. <br/><br/>The film begins with a blank screen as we hear the voices and the cries of those trapped in the World Trade Center on 9/11. The scene then shifts to a CIA ""black site"" in Pakistan where CIA agent Dan (Jason Clarke) is subjecting an al Qaeda operative Ammar (Reda Kateb) to humiliating techniques designed to break him and give Dan the information he needs. What is disturbing about the sequence is not only the ugliness of the techniques that fail to extract information, but the fact that the film celebrates the kind of by-the-book professionalism that goes about doing the dirty jobs without any recognizable human emotion. <br/><br/>Tied to the ceiling with ropes, compelled to wear a dog collar and crawl around on all fours, deprived of sleep by an onslaught of rock music, waterboarded, and locked in a wooden crate, the prisoner is told by the interrogator that ""This is what defeat looks like."" Fighting organization inertia, Maya tries to convince agency officials that bin Laden can be found by discovering the courier who helps deliver his messages to al Qaeda. The search to find the mystery courier is an eight-year project that involves enhanced interrogation techniques, surveillance, and ""boots-on-the-ground"" detective work. <br/><br/>The determination of the courier's identity eventually leads Maya to discover a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where she is one hundred percent convinced bin Laden is hiding, though her colleagues require much convincing. In a riveting concluding sequence done with extraordinary realism, the film dramatizes the operation known as Neptune's Spear conducted that took place on the night of May 1, 2011 in which a Navy SEAL team perfectly executes a raid on bin Laden's compound and kills the number one al Qaeda leader.<br/><br/>The raid begins in eerie silence as Black hawk helicopters cross the mountains from Afghanistan to Pakistan in the middle of the night. Bigelow not only shows the ""Geronimo"" moment but takes us through a room-by-room killing field. While questions have been raised about what really unfolded that night, no questions are asked in the film and the subject of whether capture was ever an option is not considered. <br/><br/>To the director's credit, there is no American triumphalism at the end, only one of the characters sitting alone in tears, perhaps lamenting for all of us whether in the process of killing bin Laden or the use of drones to assassinate American citizens suspected of terrorism, we may have undermined the most important moral and legal values of our society, the same ones that Islamic Fundamentalists have fought against for years, the determination of guilt or innocence in a court of law. If Zero Dark Thirty can remind people of this basic incongruity, it will have served a very useful purpose."

Maya has no back story, no idea of the future, just the present and her hunger for the quest. Chastain was a good choice for the role, with her spare, ascetic look reinforcing the characters single-minded, compulsive desire to hunt down Bin Laden.<br/><br/>The film is crammed with sharp performances from the large, ensemble cast. James Gandolfini as the CIA Director and Joel Edgerton as the leader of the DEVGRU (Seal Tim Six) raiding team were very convincing, but I was particularly taken by the always fantastic Mark Strong as George, a senior CIA official, and by Jason Clarke's portrayal of Dan, Maya's boss in the field and the CIA's blunt instrument - torturing captives for information.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the point that has created a maelstrom of controversy around the movie: its supposed depiction of torture as a successful intelligence-gathering strategy in the hunt for Bin Laden. I believe the film's point is somewhat more subtle - the actual torture scenes are brutal - there is also the recognition within the torturer's mind that it is dehumanizing and corrosive. Most telling is Dan's admission that he just wants to go back and ""do something normal"". Also, the political minefield surrounding ""enhanced interrogation"" is well-depicted: ""you don't want to be the one holding the dog collar when the oversight committee descends..."".<br/><br/>A final word on depiction of the actual raid which took place at Zero Dark Thirty (half past midnight, hence the name): it has a breathless, edge-of-your-seat quality, accentuated by the fact that a significant portion of the action is shown through a night-vision filter, giving it an eerie, other-worldly feel. And, despite our conditioning by the movies to expect fast-paced, kinetic, large-sound, jump-cut edited action sequences in such scenarios, the raid is absolutely absorbing, compelling even, moving at an almost leisurely pace - a triumph of editing and cinematography."

","Maybe it's because I'm not American, but I found this film to be quite ungripping. In style it's very like The Hurt Locker; hand-held, unproduced look etc. The cinematography is okay, the acting a bit flat, some unrealistic scenes, and an oddly empty journey.<br/><br/>I found the beginning of the film to be a bit confusing with regards to the leads that the CIA were trying to follow, but maybe I just wasn't paying attention. The torture scenes appeared to be quite realistic (to someone who has never tortured anyone).<br/><br/>It's a very pared down narrative. The story follows a single lead (with very little backstory), and doesn't give much info outside that. This isn't a bad way to tell the story, but it does present some limitations.<br/><br/>In terms of telling a story, there's really only about 10 minutes worth (film time) in terms of useful information gathered on the part of the CIA. They're looking for a guy, can't find him, luck turns up an old report, they track a possible suspect, find he goes to a house, they suspect Bin Laden is there, storm the house and kill Bin Laden.<br/><br/>This leave long stretches where nothing really happens, and there's nothing to fill in the time.<br/><br/>The film really never gets out of a well-recreated narrative documentary feel. The reason why I think this causes an issue is that because there is zero character development, all you have is the threadbare story to follow. Character development doesn't mean building a fictional character with a journey arch; it means providing depth and insight into why a person does what they do. If you knew nothing about Osama Bin Laden, you'd spend most of the film wondering what was going on. Because the narrative is so sparse, all we have is the lead character, but there's nothing to connect with. Who is the Maya? Why is she so dedicated? Why wasn't she a crying wreck after getting shot at by gunmen outside her home? What drives her and why is it so important to her? Scenes are just sort of dumped on screen with minimal segues. The film skips years with no bother to tell what happened in the intervening time. The lead, Jessica Chastain, then appears as if no time had passed at all. It gives it a very clinical, hollow feel and reeks of a lack of substance on the part of the filmmakers. Terrorist attacks occur randomly with no relevance to the plot except perhaps to inform the viewer that the CIA work is worthwhile because the terrorist threat is still present.<br/><br/>So, the film appears to just provide the facts that led to the raid. That immediately makes it a dry, drawn-out affair that lacks tension and heart. The film doesn't address the issues of the morality of torture, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Viewers can make their own minds up on that. I was at least pleased that it didn't descend into cheesy flag-waving Americanisms at the end.<br/><br/>It didn't need to be an over-produced Hollywood flick, but there's also nothing to engage with. In terms of story-telling, it has largely failed. The end result is a ""based on real events"" recreation documentary without any of the detail of a documentary. It's not a bad angle to take, but doesn't deliver the emotion that a film (and not a documentary) about the hunt for the 9/11 mastermind deserves."

","The film is about the events which lead to the dispatching of terrorist Bin Laden.

Much more low key and slow. <br/><br/>But why? We as the audience aren't really pulled into this and held captive. We aren't caught in the grip. We are watching from a distance. Which is too bad.

","I meditate while watching most films, simple mindful attention to breath. I do this while cooking or walking the dog, it isn't a big thing. Anyway, a recurring notion is that things are both there and relative, it's nothing new but you actually feel it happen and go away, the nagging mind as it complicates the story of what is plainly there.<br/><br/>So I am open to films that paint a relative truth, or in some way the mind at work. I like to think I'd be a fan of this film as originally intended, or at least until news of Abbottabad. We have a woman who obsesses for years over what she wants to be true, at the cost of having a life. We see her living inside a maze of labyrinthine, ambiguous information, framed small in front of gigantic satellite screens.<br/><br/>Looking, searching, waiting. <br/><br/>Creating in your mind the story that you want to see, a cinematic subject. Ostensibly to high purpose, but in actuality?<br/><br/>I'd like to think that was the film as originally intended. Then, on May 2nd, Bin Laden was reported dead. So now the filmmakers had to have closure. In cinematic terms, it had to be revamped from a Blowup of sorts to All President's Men, from open-ended examination of perception to a procedural where intuitive logic wins.<br/><br/>To Bigelow's credit, she masterfully handles the Abbottabad raid, with silence (bar a few shouted orders which wouldn't happen if you know the Seals), terrified loss in the children and wives, mute astonishment in the killer, and fleeting glimpses of the killing and body. She frames in the most poignant scene of the film, the CIA heroine lost and empty now that's all done.<br/><br/>Unlike the simple-minded Argo, there is no sense of patriotic triumph, or even much relief in any of this, and the way we experience the fight, foggy as the ensuing White House reports of it, and see the dead Osama mirrors in a way our understanding of the situationâ€”we haven't seen the body, but we're told it's him. That's the published story.<br/><br/>So you'll decide what use you have for it.<br/><br/>Pondering on this for a few days, I've decided I frankly have none. It isn't a bad film, no. Strictly as procedural, it's well made but uninteresting, even silly in spots and it lacks the cinematic space I seek in the best films. However, as a broader study on relative truths? It is both interesting and complicated.<br/><br/>But it isn't complicated because the art is, Bigelow is generally a straight-forward gal. It is ethically and politically so, starting with the simple fact that we got the staged images before public disclosure of the real ones.<br/><br/>It's still a story at this point, issued to Bigelow by an agency whose very purpose is to complicate truths. I am implying nothing beyond this simple fact, but as it is, served as 'real', it only exploits the fact that we don't know, masterfully so. So the filmmaker sets up questions, that she can dodge by alternating between 'journalism' (that we can't verify anyway) and artistic license.<br/><br/>It feels sneaky to me, no real use for it."

","Usama bin Ladin dies at the end.<br/><br/>Picked up a high quality bootleg DVD awards screener down at the local bazaar today. If you take a few minutes to skim the reviews you see the range of emotion, political bias, and interpretations this movie has brought out. That in and of itself should tell you the subtle power of this film. From a business perspective, the amount of media attention this film has received for ""inaccuracies"" and the torture controversy, very little money invested in promotion was needed. You can't buy advertising like that. <br/><br/>Overall, an excellent collaboration. Jessica Chastain gives an Oscar worthy performance. She is the main vehicle for the narrative and the only character developed with a complete arc. A good decision by writer Mark Boal. Jason Clarke's character was a great contrast to Maya as well. Any other character development was unnecessary and not practical within a feature length movie on this topic. Two performance highlights for me from an extremely large cast; Mark Strong's scene after a disastrous attack on CIA agents in the field and James Gandolfini as CIA Director Leon Panetta. Lots of fresh faces and lessor known actors anchored by familiar ones. The expansive cast also helps to convey the amount of people who contributed to the largest manhunt in history.<br/><br/>Production Design was spot on and a little spooky at times. The Forward Operating Bases and locations in Afghanistan were very realistic. They even have Hesco barriers. The Cinematography of the actual raid was masterful. The POV style and night vision effects draws you into the climatic raid. The editing on the macro, scene to scene scale during the I and II Acts did seem a bit choppy at times due to the almost 10 year time frame covered. The III Act and the essentially real time raid more than make up for this. The tension and pacing builds slowly to a very satisfying emotional climax and was amazing considering everybody in the world with access to any form of media knows how the movie ends. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a less than two hour long patriotic action shoot'em up devoid of any intellectual stimulation or shades of gray moral ambiguity this is not the movie for you. This topic could have easily filled a 10 hour long HBO mini-series. The fact they were able to tell this story as they did in a two and a half hour feature length movie speaks volumes for the writer, director, and editor. And lets keep this in perspective, its a MOVIE people. Its not a book, its not journalism, and unless you were a participant in the raid or have the proper clearance and a need to know you do not know how accurate or factual it is. It took 9 years of painstaking, slow, boring, and methodical investigative work by many parties to find and kill this guy. The site exploitation (SE) of the computer room at the compound was emphasized. They found the mother lode of Al Queda intelligence on that compound in addition to the most wanted man in the world. <br/><br/>The only political references that I noticed on first viewing were a few references to the Iraq/WMD fabrication and a short TV clip in the background of one scene where President Obama is being interviewed about torture. If you come away from this movie thinking the director intended to show torture was necessary to find UBL you should learn more about film making and then need to watch the movie again. It does depict water boarding, sleep deprivation, stress positions, and other controversial interrogation methods in some very intense scenes, but in now way justifies them or makes a moral judgment. That is left for the viewer to decide."

"tabuno","8","1","2","17 January 2019"," A Brilliant Ending But Uneven Beginning
","23 February 2013. The very beginning black screen of the movie with only the audio 911 calls seemed to be, understandably chaotic, but in the directorial use of such audio chaos, it also provoked unnecessary confusion and detachment from the more reflective emotional aftershock of the event. Oddly enough the physical violence of the interrogation scenes were tame compared to the fictional violence of most action, adventure thrillers such as Daniel Craig's brutal beating in Skyfall (2012) and even such actions as urinating on the detainees which was widely reported by the news media at the time were omitted. Jessica Chastain's character was also uncharacteristically stereotypical during the early torture scenes with the requisite facial expressions of supposedly suppressed disgust. Her character throughout the movie was underdeveloped with no backstory, not significant revelation of her attitude, motivation except implicit hatred and revenge. There is the bus explosion which is also oddly inconsistently muted and only indirectly shot. All these minor flaws only contribute to any uneven flow and tempo of most the movie until the final insurgent sequences. By the end, there are two shots, one an editing flow problem where one moment the American insurgent team or on the ground and then suddenly in the air and finally Chastain's character is asked where she'd like to go with no response and no shot of the airman who asked the question before the fade out.<br/><br/>Comparatively speaking, the ending and climax of the movie is technically similar to the amazing, ground breaking beginning sequence of Saving Private Ryan (1998) and has some of the visceral compelling intensity of Black Hawk Down (2001). Yet in some ways, most of the the cinematography isn't quite as densely raw and rich as United 93 (2006), Body of Lies (2008), or Munich (2005). As discussed, the movie is also missing the rich depth of the humanity of the characters as portrayed in Breach (2007), Jarhead (2005), Manhunter (1986), and even Apocalypse Now (1979) or the balanced depiction of the characters on both sides of this military conflicts as better presented in Green Zone (2010) which also had several strong military action scenes. As for Argo (2012), Zero Dark Thirty's contemporary movie, Argo was more consistent, more emotionally riveting, and had more connective depth. If only Kathryn Bigelow as a director has been able to learn from director Sidney Lumet's fine black and white gripping and tense focus in Fail-Safe (1964) what could have this movie become."
"chindit-34966","8","1","2","7 January 2019"," Working Within Limits of Reality
","Disclaimer: Bigelow had to work within certain limits, as Pakistan was not about to allow her to film the tale in Pesh, Rawalpindi, Islamabad or Abbottabad. Thus, one hears a lot more Arabic than Urdu. Poetic license.<br/><br/>The movie, about the hunt for and killing of Osama bin Laden, is fairly accurate in both telling the tale and conveying the manner in which intel work is carried out. Yes, it can be boring to an outsider or a movie-goer more accustomed to exploding vehicles and infallible superheroes. Real intel work often requires building on tiny bits and pieces of information, drawn from many sources, and often difficult to collate. Perhaps trying to depict that reality does not make for exciting film, but it is pretty darn close to reality.<br/><br/>Some critics argue that 'Maya', the main character, was one dimensional and never fully allowed to develop. Ironically, that is EXACTLY what the real 'Maya' was like, and by the way, she looks nothing like Jessica Chastain. There is some befuddlement that in the film (SPOILER?) she claims she 'was recruited out of high school'. She wasn't recruited, she joined. She was not an ops officer, which is what most people would consider the typical spy. She was a Targeter, which is an updated version of an employee who used to be called an 'IA' or Intel Assistant. Her function was to do name traces, provide support, and try to pull pieces together, which she would then feed to the ops officers who go out and recruit/meet clandestine assets.<br/><br/>Maya was obsessed, as the movie shows her to be. She was demanding, and to this day likes to think she alone got ObL, when as the movie shows to some extent, many people and many Directorates were involved over a period of years.<br/><br/>For those who might take a second look at the movie, look to the characters played by Jason Clarke as a pretty good representation of an ops officer, Kyle Chandler ('Bradley') as one kind of Chief of Station, and Edgar Ramirez ('Larry') as a good rep of a Ground Branch type in the Special Activities Center of the DDO.<br/><br/>Many may not find this the most exciting film, but if anyone is looking for insight into how real intel work is actually done, it's a good place to start."

I can understand that. Nevertheless, the director Kathryn Bigelow focuses more on Maya (Jessica Chastain), a CIA agent completely determined and solemnly focused on finding and capturing/killing Bin Laden. She was amazing in that role, I really enjoyed watching her in this movie.<br/><br/>Even though the movie has 2 hours and 37 minutes, there were sometimes I was wondering the year, or month, of some scenes.

","For what it is, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a solid recap of the events that ultimately led to the death of Osama Bin Laden. However, the story is told in such a clinical tone that it fails to be a true classic.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie begins shortly after 9/11, when Maya (Jessica Chastain), a government agent, is put on the Bin Laden hunt. After briefly teaming with interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke), Maya branches out on her own and begins an almost decade-long hunt for the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. The movie culminates with the raid on the compound in which Bin Laden was hiding.<br/><br/>There are indeed many ""positive"" experiences to take from this movie. It isn't over-the-top, which can always be a bit of a concern when dealing with such ""real"" topics, and I believe it strives to portray the events as close as possible to how they actually occurred. As such, there are controversial scenes of torture, as well as an incredibly suspense final campaign to root out Bin Laden from his fortress-like compound. It is just a very gritty film very similar to director Kathryn Bigelow's earlier work ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>However, this film is severely missing the ""human touch"" that any film needs in order to truly be great. This is a very clinical, stoic re-telling of the hunt for Bin Laden, almost completely devoid of any derived dramatic component. While, like I said earlier, this is usually a positive trait in films, this time I believe it was taken a bit too far. In order for me to truly rank a film at the top of the heap, I need to be able to emotionally identify with the characters and their circumstances. In this case, that just didn't happen, and as such I dock it one star.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a taut, intense tale of great historical significance. Though missing some key emotional components, I have to give credit to Bigelow for tackling such tough issues and still managing to produce a viable film that isn't hackneyed or pandering to politics."
"lbresnahan1","7","1","2","16 October 2013"," Zero Dark Thrirty Film Review
","Zero Dark Thirty is a drama about the ten year search for Osama Bin Laden. Jessica Chastain plays the main character of Maya who is a CIA agent. Alongside her are, Joel Edgerton who plays Patrick, the lead squad man, and Jason Clarke who plays Dan and works for the government. There is no specific setting for the movie; it bounces around between Pakistan, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Iraq, and many more countries. The movie takes place within all of these countries starting in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. The motive is to find and capture Osama Bin Laden because he and Al-Qaeda are threats to our nation.<br/><br/>In the opening of the movie viewers get a glimpse of 9/11. There is a black screen and the viewer can hear actual 911 calls the day of the attack; a chilling start to a movie. From there, the viewer's get a glimpse into what detainees went through. There is a torture scene where Dan is water boarding a man in order to get him to spill information. Once the team has received tips, a few go out to meet with someone who claims will give them information. It turns out to be a suicide bombing and many of the team members die. Years later Maya catches a break by getting more information on a man who detainees say is close to Bin Laden. As they follow him they end up finding a hideaway where Bin Laden has been staying for years. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain does an incredible job playing Maya. Maya is a very confident and strong woman. She is one of the only women in the movie but Chastain makes it work. Maya can seem rough because of her swearing but she is a hard working CIA agent. She is one of the few women placed on this assignment and she rocks it. Maya never gives up even when they are completely out of resources. It seems as if her co- workers are not paying attention to her and the leads she gains. It seems as if it is because she is a woman. When they follow her lead and find Bin Laden's hideaway she is ecstatic. However, they do not proceed when finding his whereabouts. This makes Maya angry so every day she writes the number of days since they have found his hiding place and they have done nothing about it. She writes the number with an Expo marker on her boss's window. Maya is not just showcasing her determination but also the determination of women. Not all women back down from a fight. Women are just as confident as men are and have the same abilities as men. Chastain does a great job of not only portraying Maya in a man's world doing a man's job but she also shows how competent women are. <br/><br/>The camera shots show a great deal throughout the movie. Many of the camera shots are over the shoulder shots. Some of the shots are while interviewing detainees and it makes the viewer feel as if they are the character who is interviewing the people. Whenever Maya is talking to a man it is usually a low angle shot showing that the man has power. In these shots it looks as if the man is looking down upon Maya. Close- ups were used sparingly during the movie and when they were used it was in order to convey emotion, such as the close-up of Maya's face when she sees Bin Laden is dead. <br/><br/>These types of movies are not my first choice. However, I took a chance and decided to watch Zero Dark Thirty. I was surprised as to how much I actually liked it. I think Chastain does such a good job that you have to finish the movie to see how she pans out because he character is so addicting. There are of course some dry parts within the movie. A lot of the detainee scenes get boring as well as the logistics. However, I also think the movie is educational. It shows us a look into our government and what goes on. It is an eye opener especially because we think us as Americans are these good people that would never torture anyone else; well, think again. With that being said, overall the movie is well worth watching even though it is two and a half hours. Just bear with the dry parts and it pays off."
"ClaytonDavis","10","7","40","5 January 2013"," Boal and Bigelow do it again, now adding Chastain in their brilliance!
","Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and Oscar-winning screenwriter Mark Boal take their newest effort, Zero Dark Thirty, to places I couldn't have imagined. Based on the events leading up to the killing of Osama bin Laden, the two display an impressive amount of control in the way the film is told and showcases some brilliant moments in filmmaking. Zero Dark Thirty hooks you from minute one and just DOESN'T. LET. GO. It's one of the best pictures of the year!<br/><br/>Starring Jessica Chastain as the beautiful and insightful Maya, she smoothly yet fiercely pulls you through the film delivering her best performance of her career so far. The film begins and ends with her and in the final scene, the Oscar mouths will be drooling. Chastain inhabits and constructs a character from scratch, inserting ticks and beats that only sweetens the execution. It's one of the year's best performances. Point blank.<br/><br/>Accompanying her is the talented Jason Clarke, who's scene-stealing and at times comedic turn level out a very emotionally and demanding film. Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong make strong impressions in their minimal screen time and give even more evidence that Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best cast ensembles this year.<br/><br/>The true star of the film is Mark Boal whose research, detail, and magnetic dialogue stands as the writer's finest work. The film creates such inner, moral dilemma and this is coming from someone who saw the World Trade Center fall at the tender age of 17. I witnessed evil that day and even with that, the film makes me ashamed to be an American. Revenge can run deep but what we witness in the film, is not revenge. You can't fight fire with fire. It's a dilemma Boal puts forth and one that will follow the viewer long after the film's end. It's pulse- pounding filmmaking and first-rate writing that should be studied for years to come. Bigelow's signature style doesn't come into full effect until the final thirty minutes but it will blow your socks off. The raid on the compound showcases heavenly camera work from Greig Fraser and commanding and sharp editing from Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg, two near sure-fire nominees for the Academy Awards. A well- placed Alexandre Desplat score only adds to the marvel of those final moments.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is the best political thriller this decade. Mark my words. Oscar, your move!"

","This movie might be more realistic I am not quite sure but ""The Hurt Locker"" is a better movie in my opinion. I know Kathryn Bigelow wanted to go in a realistic direction when it comes down to taking down one of the world's biggest terrorist. But despite few moments overall it just wasn't all that entertaining or thrilling. It's kinda cool to see the lead protagonist grow more professional as the movie progresses since the story tries to cover 8 or 9 yrs. But most of it is just constant discussions on how to execute certain things from well thought out intuition and paper work. I didn't really feel much intensity from this flick. I can appreciate that they tried to make it realistic as possible without things constantly shoot outs or things constantly blowing up. But the movie just felt a bit dull. If you want those special tactics, tactical espionage or black ops type of movie this one really isn't it. Since a lot of people already know the news of what happened, it takes away from the anticipation as well. Since the build up isn't all that great. But the the take down at the end had quite a bit of thrills and intensity going for it. But overall this is a watchable but kinda mundane movie.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","Let me just say, the technical aspects of this movie are great; the cinematography is top- notch, and I'm almost positive that ZDT is taking home the Oscar for sound editing. Not to mention that the acting is pretty top-notch, especially the leading lady herself, Jessica Chastain. <br/><br/>That being said, the script itself disappoints. All in all, the message of the story is simple, and there's no need to even have a spoiler alert, as the entire story ended just last year: a woman thinks that Osama's hiding somewhere, and she's right. Other than lead Maya's undying passion and certainty carrying us through the film (which, admittedly, they do well), the screenplay lacks depth. The entire story is just the top half of a double-layer cake, and you want more out of it. <br/><br/>While the screenwriter does try to cloud this fact with a lot of military jargon and vocab- word-laden sentences, that only serves to make the viewer feel confused at what they just saw; there were more than a few points where I spaced out for two or three seconds, and when I made myself focus on the current scene, I was completely lost. Cinematic intelligence comes from being smart, not sounding smart, and that can be done without needing to go too fast for the audience. <br/><br/>I guess the large-scale problem with the screenplay is that there are so many essential events that the writer has jammed into it that even with the two-and-a-half-hour runtime, it still feels like they're struggling to get this suitcase to shut. <br/><br/>With all this confusion going on, it allows you to step back and see what's really going on: this film is an ego-stroke for America. With us being demoted to a AA nation, Hollywood decided we need some self-esteem, and what better way to get it than for them to tell us, ""Hey, remember when you guys killed that super infamous terrorist? You do? Well, now you can remember on the big screen."" In the end, it just felt like an attempt to beat Team America: World Police for most patriotic film, but only managing to beat Argo (which I liked a lot more than Zero Dark Thirty). <br/><br/>All in all, Zero Dark Thirty is a film that rewards multiple viewings, only with what should've been rewarded the first time around. But, at the same time, the behind the scenes work really does make this movie worth seeing. A lot of the smaller moments were suspenseful, and even though the final reel is very much expected, it is put together so well that you can't help but be a little excited. I never saw director Kathryn Bigelow's previous film, The Hurt Locker, but if this is any indication of her usual talents, then I'm excited to see what she has in store for us in the years to come. <br/><br/>Let's just hope it's something other than a military film this time.."
"dario_malic","5","2","7","21 January 2013"," The price of success
","On May 2nd 2011, SEAL Team Six of U.S. Special Forces killed Osama bin Laden. That messed up plans of director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal who were working on a film about a years-long and unsuccessful hunt for the man. They of course changed the story and reportedly scrapped all of their previous work to start anew. The result is ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (a term marking time between midnight and dawn), one of the most lauded films of the year with five Oscar nominations but also one of the most controversial with its depiction of torture at CIA black sites.<br/><br/>The torture scenes caused a lot of fuss in USA with many taking them as a sign of approval of the methods and politicians from both sides of the spectrum condemning the movie, claiming that no piece of information which lead to the murder of Osama bin Laden came from torture. But are that scenes really that problematic? It is widely known that US military utilized torture in interrogation and it's fair to assume that was so in those first few years of the hunt for bin Laden when the emotions were running high. Not to mention that in the film the torturing really doesn't prove all that useful. It gives Maya, a CIA operative and main character, a name which she never heard of before yet she decides to pursue it relentlessly only to find out that everyone else know of that name, which makes us wonder how she never heard of it in the first place. What's more interesting is that, although both politicians and the authors of the film claim that the whole operation was a product of hard and dedicated work by a group of extraordinary individuals, the film shows it just as a combination of one person's hunch and persistence and pure luck. Now, an idea of US intelligence services functioning just on hunch and luck, that's something really controversial, but to my surprise no one seems to have noticed that.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is in its essence a classic underdog story. A young, unexperienced, but talented operative has everything going against her but in the end prevails. Although the end is not a happy one for her as she realises that she has no life outside the just completed mission. The main problem with the story is a lack of emotions it provides. We never find out what is it that's driving Maya, making her disregard everything else in favor of her job. The only thing I can assume is that it's a desire to prove she is equally capable as the rest of her colleagues (if not more so) and to make a name for herself amongst them. That adds the subject of male-female (in)equality to the film, parallels with director Bigelow being more than obvious. However, the fact she succeeded more due to a coincidence than to hard work and especially the characterization of the other female operative don't do it justice.<br/><br/>As with any other work based on a true event there is a conversation on how closely does it follow the truth, but, as always, it's completely misplaced. It's not a documentary and its goals should lie elsewhere, namely in making a compelling and tense middle part because we all know how it begins and how it ends. But it's right there where the film fails. After learning of Abu Ahmed's existence and of his connection to bin Laden as his personal courier the investigation reaches a dead end. It becomes more and more obvious that they really can't find the guy but then a file which no one knew existed miraculously appears and Abu Ahmed's true identity is revealed. It still doesn't help much though. Maya and her colleagues narrow the search to two cities in Pakistan from which he's calling home, but he always calls from a different public phone and they simply don't have enough men to cover all of them. Another situation with no way out requires another miracle. This time the courier buys a cell-phone and they get his number. Why would a man so careful to cover all of his tracks suddenly buy a cell-phone thus allowing the CIA operatives to track him down is beyond my comprehension. But even after that the film doesn't pick up pace. It took around half a year of surveillance to get permission to invade the residence of Abu Ahmed, and the film makes sure we get that. For most of the time the characters do nothing but show their powerlessness and all the scenes that could leave some impact on the viewer are brought down in advance by suggestive filmmaking which make us foresee the outcome. When in the final half an hour came the much anticipated raid scene, my attention was in spite my best efforts much lower than in the beginning and I found the way it is filmed pretty messy and unclear. While my low attention no doubt helped it feel that way, it's a fact that Bigelow didn't care much for the clarity on that one. I can imagine that lack of clarity would easily be the case if I were to look at a real operation, still I feel that in the film the viewer should know who's where doing what.<br/><br/>Read the complete review at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/"

","A movie spun on torture scenes and most likely based on half truths the US government would like you to believe. However, for a movie pretending to be real... it's not too bad, Good actors, great director but parts of this movie are a bit dragged out and repetitive. I was expecting to see more of Osama Bin Laden than the split second that I did see him. One major annoyance was the 1 minute or so of black screen at the beginning, this is lazy film making! Zero dark thirty had all the potential to be a masterpiece but failed to become one due to the made up set of events. Osama Bin Laden is a fictional story in which the US Government were spinning to steal 20 years supply of oil for America. Do not believe what the Bush administration tells you.

"Hitchcoc","6","2","8","25 July 2013"," Those Puffy Sounding Body Shots
","Hollywood has the ability to create incredible effects and adapt its talents to whatever has gone on. Like Argo, we are left wondering just how accurate these efforts can be. The film begins with torture and sheer brutality. A prisoner has things done to him that make us sit back and cringe. Are the people doing this supposed to be heroic in some way? Are there results really effective. After about fifteen minutes of this, we get to see the dogged, monomaniacal Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, use her anger and frustration with the slow acting military to get her way. I'm fully aware of the atrocities that had been committed and the role of Osama bin Laden, but was it worth any more than a publicity stunt to put the kind of effort into getting this guy. There is some very good intrigue and I am willing to bet that the movie is pretty accurate in its portrayal. My worry is that this kind of movie glamorizes the ""anything goes"" mentality that has filtered into the minds of people. We have always prided ourselves on being better than this. In the movie, when things go bad, it's because of inadequate security and indecisive authority. This, of course, ultimately leads to the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan and the raid that took the guy out. Once launched, we are treated to a feast of violence. Those second and third shots into an already dead body have a puffy little sound. These men will be seen as heroes, but they also will be seen as people have been trained to kill first and ask questions later. This mission was successful, but did it require a total disregard for the rights of humanity. Bin Laden was the target, but the bodies piled up all over the place and little children were terrorized."
"jack_critchley","10","2","8","28 March 2013"," The Best Film of 2012
","I can think of only a select few films that have affected me the way Zero Dark Thirty has. I was but a young lad when 9/11 took the world. I still remember the image of a plane flying into the tower and collapsing in great detail. I remember when they found Osama bin Laden, back on May 2, 2012. I didn't know what to the think say or do. And now he we are just over a year from his death and a film about it has been made. When I first heard of this film I thought it was total political propaganda, created to boost Obama during the election, but those thoughts disappeared when I looked to see who was directing it and who was writing it.<br/><br/>The movie opens to a black screen with the title September 11, 2001. All you can hear are scream, panicking and phone calls. These are the voices of 9/11. The film stars Jessica Chastain as our main character Maya, who is as firey as her hair. One could argue that she is the true ""hero,"" of the film, but I found myself asking myself at the end of the film; ""What is a hero? And is this movie about them? Or something else?""<br/><br/>Bigelow and Boal made the genius choice to not push for any political or social ideas. Merely presenting the story unbiased and completely objective. The result left me with some thoughts that still haunt my mind.<br/><br/>On the subject of poilitical views, it would have been better if the U.S. had captured bin Laden rather then kill him. But history is written by the victor.<br/><br/>Controversy is the word of day and this film can't escape it. To say that this film endorses torture is a complete misunderstanding of the film. Yes their are torture scenes, two in fact. One that sits about fifteen minutes long and the other a mere minute or so. Interestingly enough information is both gained and not gained in both scenes, it is not until they treat the first torture victim to a civilized lunch gets him to talk.<br/><br/>The standout performance is Jessica Chastain, who deserved that Oscar a thousand times more than Jennifer Lawrence but who am I to say who should and shouldn't win. Second to Chastain is the great Australian Jason Clarke who plays Dan, a rough vetraned CIA agent who has seen at least a hundred naked men for torturing them alone.<br/><br/>The final raid on bin Laden's compound is some of the most intense minutes of my life. The best part is that there is no efficese on the SEALs or bin Laden. A particular line I remember; ""I shot the third floor guy.""<br/><br/>The very ending is what hit the most."
"Desertman84","10","2","8","25 March 2013"," The Film About The Pursuit Of Osama Bin Laden
","Zero Dark Thirty is a dramatization of the United States operation that found and killed Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda. It stars Jessica Chastain, Jason Clarke, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Jennifer Ehle, Mark Strong, Kyle Chandler, and Édgar Ramírez. It was directed by Katherine Bigelow.<br/><br/>Maya, a young CIA officer in 2003, has spent her entire brief career since graduating from high school focused solely on gathering intelligence related to Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda, following the terrorist organization's September 11 attacks in the United States. She has just been reassigned to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan to work with a fellow officer, Dan. During the first months of her assignment, Maya often accompanies Dan to a black site for his continuing interrogation of Ammar al-Baluchi, a detainee with suspected links to several of the 9/11 hijackers. Dan subjects the detainee to torture, including water boarding, and humiliation. He and Maya eventually trick Ammar into divulging that an old acquaintance, who is using the alias Abu Ahmed, is working as a personal courier for bin Laden. Other detainees corroborate this, with some claiming Abu Ahmed delivers messages between bin Laden and a man referred to as Abu Faraj. <br/><br/>Maya continues to sift through masses of data and information, using a variety of technology, hunches and sharing insights. Displaying the zeal and frustrations of a ""single-tasker"", she concentrates on finding Abu Ahmed, determined to use him to find bin Laden. During a span of five years, she survives the 2008 Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing as well as being shot at in her car by armed men. Dan, departing on re-assignment, warns Maya about a possible change in politics, suggesting that the new administration may prosecute those officers who had been involved in torture. Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. A Jordanian detainee claims the man previously identified, as Abu Ahmed, from a photograph, is a man he personally buried in 2001. Several CIA officers – Maya's seniors – conclude the target who could be Abu Ahmed is long dead, and that they have searched a false trail for nine years.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the President's National Security Adviser tasks the CIA with producing a plan to capture or kill bin Laden if it can be confirmed that he is in the compound. An agency team devises a plan to use two top-secret stealth helicopters flown by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to secretly enter Pakistan and insert a U.S. Navy SEAL team to raid the compound. Before briefing the President of the United States, the CIA Director holds a meeting of his top officials, who assess only a 60–80% chance that bin Laden is living in the compound, rather than another high-value target. Maya, also in attendance, insists the chances are 95–100%.<br/><br/>The raid is approved. Although execution is complicated by one of the helicopters crashing, the SEALs kill a number of people within the compound, among them a man on the compound's top floor who is revealed to be bin Laden. They bring bin Laden's body back to a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where Maya visually confirms the identity of the corpse. <br/><br/>Gripping, suspenseful, and brilliantly crafted, Zero Dark Thirty dramatizes the hunt for Osama bin Laden with intelligence and an eye for detail. From the very first scenes, director Kathryn Bigelow demonstrates why she is such a formidable filmmaker, as adept with human emotion as with visceral, pulse-quickening action. She tells the story very well, very efficiently, but doesn't really say much about it, which is ironic given the response to the film in some quarters. It is just awful that Bigelow robbed of an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>We know the ending as most are familiar with the story,yet remain mesmerized by familiar details, filmed with a harrowing sense of urgency. It's as close to being in the White House situation room that night, watching a closed-circuit broadcast, as anyone could expect.It surely should have been given the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Acting was also commendable especially Jessica Chastain,who played the hyper-focused Maya with intensity and passion.I definitely believed that she should have won the Oscar instead of Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Obviously, the film wasn't free from controversy considering that it presents graphic torture scenes used by US military men in extracting information from terrorists.It has also been described by some as a misleading portrayal of torture as critical to the United States' success in gaining information on bin Laden's associates and location. In addition, some politicians suggested that the filmmakers were given improper access to classified materials, which they denied.It is viewed by some as propaganda for torture. This could have probably dismayed some people from Washington especially those who formulated the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) which supports ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" such as the use of torture and indefinite detention.Also,the final scene as Maya is last seen boarding a military transport to return to the U.S. and sitting in its vast interior as its only passenger as she begins to weep quietly.This have given the audience the impression of the on-going bin Laden conspiracies that the terrorist is probably still alive or he is long dead before the raid was conducted. <br/><br/>Knowing Hollywood, it definitely feared from giving those one great film too much acclaim as due to its theme being political in nature such not giving it the Best Picture for this film was definitely better than Argo,the Bigelow snub and the Chastain robbery.But nevertheless, it film that should not be missed especially by lovers of great movies."

I feel sure that this was Bigelow's intention, and she got the performance she wanted from Jessica Chastain, but this did not make this a film in which I had any emotional investment whatsoever. And I really should have had, you know, considering what the events spring from.<br/><br/>It is also a very long film, a film from which at least half an hour could (and should) have been cut, possibly even as much as an hour - this could have been done without sacrificing any essential narrative information.<br/><br/>The sound design is, at times, spectacularly good, at other times spectacularly fumbled, with garbled dialogue so that you don't know what's going on. The last half hour, the mission, is done well, and is very suspenseful even though you know what is going to happen.<br/><br/>What of the torture? I didn't care.

This compelling story shows the grisly side in the early days of the war, which has been widely put out in the press if it's right or wrong to do these acts to find out necessary information to stop further attacks. The film to me felt as if it asked the questions of what is right and wrong without putting its self as an anti-war film or 24 like where you should be able to do anything if it will protect your country no matter the moral consequences. At the heart of this film is an outstanding performance from Jessica Chastain who has been deservedly getting award admiration for her role but I found Jason Clarkes performance to be the standout subtly showing the toils his actions are having on him.

The criticizing of the torture scenes is not necessary as they give a greater sense of reality to the film as it not a typical glamorous and polished Hollywood film.

I was expecting nonstop torture and everyone saying how great torture is. That's not the case, and I'm not sure how many have come to that conclusion about this film. There were very few scenes of actual torture, and it's almost just like you saw in Safe House, except a little more graphic. After that, you don't see anyone really justifying the torture. The movie isn't even about torture, it's about the chase for intel that led us to UBL. As a veteran of Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, this obviously was close to home for me, as it was why all those have served were over there.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie was very good, and I did see a ton of real world tactics being used, which you don't see every day in military genre films. The bad reviews on this film are astounding. Astounding in the fact that the people writing the reviews seemed to be going into this film thinking it's going to be an intense action film or somehow the film is being expected to go into the political aspect of the hunt or the political aspect of torture. I strongly recommend anyone go watch this film, but understand it isn't all about action or torture, or even killing.

She's a ""10"" in beauty and a ""10"" in persistence.<br/><br/>The soldiers are likable and loyal. They are heroes and all of this action will attract more recruits to the Army.

I watched a one dimensional story with a already known ending. Another dimension could have been portrayed with the (false) story of some lovers. This heroine does not have any friends the movie says. Think of ""Titanic"", an action/drama movie that had a 2nd dimension regarding some lovers tucked into the story. Here we only have persistence and action.<br/><br/>I wonder how Muslims view this movie.<br/><br/>To be sure, Karen Bigelow is a master crafts-women of action movies. But movie of the year? ""Lincoln"" gave me time to reflect on moral issues, law, the character of Lincoln and other historical facts. This movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" seems to try to gain something by showing us ""how to torture"". Take the towel, take the water, pour it on the towel. We've learned how to torture.<br/><br/>In Lincoln, on the other hand, we saw the manner in which moral gray areas were decided upon. Here in Zero Dark, we see there is a procedure to torturing somebody. Step 1, 2, 3. Pretend to be their friend, then torture them if they don't tell the truth. I think this movie could have had more depth if the moral issue of torture were attended to.<br/><br/>I cannot agree that this is movie of the year. It never hit my ""revenge button"" because this is old history. I liked how well it was paced with no slop. It is a well crafted one dimensional action movie that uses a heroine who is too beautiful to be believable. Please, Hollywood, please stop using these gorgeous women to always take our attention away. In this case, it disallowed me to focus on the revenge motive. It glamorized the heroine for her persistence; yet it was the soldiers who were the heroes.<br/><br/>I felt that ""The Impossible"" was a more painful movie to watch.

It was supposed to show us what really happened behind what it calls the ""greatest manhunt in history""-- that of Usama Bin Laden (who the movie called UBL).<br/><br/>We follow a character named Maya (Jessica Chastain) whom we know or learn nothing about, except that her whole career after college was devoted to the search for UBL. Too bad we never really knew anything more about her background for us to root for her obsession. She was not really the ""cool"" person we expect these CIA operatives to be. There were several scenes where Maya seemed very unprofessional in her behavior. Maya discussed confidential matters publicly in a restaurant. She screamed and threatened her superior in a corridor. She writes numbers on the glass pane of her boss' office to countdown the days of inaction. They may be good for cinematic drama, but these were very unrealistic for a film that was supposedly factual. <br/><br/>Watching this film could be an ordeal as the story was told in a VERY slow burn. This is a 2 and a half hour film, mind you, for a story with an ending we already know. The first hour we see how CIA torture suspects from 911, and witness various suicide bombings. The second hour we see Maya act on a random tip about a courier who could be working for UBL. We then wait 130 days with her for the higher-ups to approve a raid on a compound in Pakistan where she was 100% sure UBL was located based on circumstantial evidence, with no direct visualization.

","Kathryn Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty' is A Riveting Film! A Tense, Nail-Biting & Disturbing true-story of the greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man. Its an unforgettable film in all respects. <br/><br/>'Zero Dark Thirty' chronicles the decade-long hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.<br/><br/>'Zero Dark Thirty' is about patriots. Its also about courage & payback. Mark Boal's Screenplay is hard-hitting, disturbing & ferocious. There is not a single dull moment in the narrative. Bigelow's Direction is par-excellence. She has outdone herself with this historical-drama. Greig Fraser's Cinematography is realistic. Editing is perfect. Art Design is fabulous.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Jessica Chastain delivers a sincere performance. Chastain has emerged into a very fine performer, proving her mettle with every film. Jason Clarke is terrific, he stands on his own. Jennifer Ehle, Mark Strong & Kyle Chandler are highly effective. Joel Edgerton does well. James Gandolfini is fantastic in a brief role. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a must see."
"DubhDoo","9","2","9","17 February 2013"," Absolutely brilliant
","Films like this can be a tricky thing to nail; portray events in too gung-ho a manner, you run the risk of being accused of over-patriotism, conversely, if you depict things in an opposing light, you could be criticised of condemnation. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a film which walks a narrow tightrope, but manages to do so with expertise so well-handled that it appears effortless. Similarly the film never feels like a documentary, an impressive feat considering that it could easily become a wearying succession of facts. One of the best things about it is that personalises the hunt for bin Laden by focusing on the central character of Maya, played by Jessica Chastain and makes her pursuit to find him an intense and gripping obsession. <br/><br/>We first meet Maya in 2003, in a 'black site' as she watches fellow CIA officer Dan (Jason Clarke) interrogate a detainee over suspicion that he has links to Saudi terrorists. As he subjects the prisoner to waterboarding and tortuous humiliation, we see Maya flinch in the corner at the very sight of it, but by the time the credits roll she is a completely different character. 'History's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man' as the poster put, changes her deeply, as she goes from being a young woman uncertain how to act in the situation she's landed in to being a strong-willed officer passionately and unhealthily driven by her desire to find this man. Significantly, she is not your conventional movie heroine; there is no speech concerned with fighting for your country and little backstory to suggest she has a personal connection to 9/11 or the terrorist attacks, a la the death of a loved one, all we get is ""a lot of my friends have died for this; I believe I was spared to finish the job."" The cloaked-in-secrecy stance with which director Kathryn Bigelow and writer/producer Mark Boal approach the film's characters works in its favour, helping to firmly ground them in reality.<br/><br/>The first act or so of 'Zero Dark Thirty' is rather murky and unclear; people talk about other people who may or may not have information concerning the matters at hand. Yet, this was probably a conscious decision because as the story develops, it becomes increasingly clearer and more focused as it hurtles towards a quite literally breathtaking finale. Bigelow is a filmmaker who has become renowned (and also dismissed by some female critics) for her skillful handle of action scenes and the eventual raid that unfolds in the film's final act is nothing short of incredible. It is a taut and properly white knuckle sequence that combines third-person combat with the first-person view from the infrared night vision; but don't think that it plays out like a video game, instead it feels brilliantly cinematic. However, the best thing about this climax (and possibly the entire film) is that you are always captivated, as one reviewer so rightly said: ""The sign of a good movie is one that keeps you gripped even when you already know the outcome.""<br/><br/>This is aided by a consistently strong cast. Jessica Chastain who has had major roles in twelve films in the past two years, has delivered what I feel is her strongest performance yet. It is a superb piece of acting that is exemplified by her character's fascinating arc from idealism to cold emptiness. Chastain is notably supported by an impressive Jason Clarke, an actor with a great screen presence and a natural Jennifer Ehle as a fellow officer and friend of Maya's; while Mark Strong leaves a firm impact upon the viewer during his first scene where erupts in a CIA meeting.<br/><br/>'Zero Dark Thirty' is not a warm film and this may prove problematic for some; it is cold and none of its characters could said to be likable, but despite the fact that you don't exactly for root for Maya, you are still engrossed in her journey. There are moments of character, but effectively reflecting its central figure, this is a film primarily concerned with one objective. The good guys aren't really 'good' in the truest sense; they're morally ambiguous people engaged in complicated and ultimately dirty work. And as for all the ongoing controversy surrounding, amongst other aspects, the torture scenes, I believe that the film takes neither a pro- nor an anti-torture stance, instead questioning the effectiveness of such an action.<br/><br/>This film blew me away. I wasn't the biggest fan of 'The Hurt Locker', finding it to be quite good, but no masterwork. The same cannot be said for Bigelow's latest, as this an expertly orchestrated and incredibly tense piece of work that requires one hundred percent of your attention one hundred of the time and rewards you for doing so. Kathryn Bigelow, snubbed by the Academy this year, is one of the most talented directors around today and with 'Zero Dark Thirty' she has delivered an astounding, exceptional piece of cinema."
"CelluloidRamblings","10","2","9","3 February 2013"," The best film of 2012 so far...
","A sign of a good film is if it can put you on the edge of your seat, nervously awaiting what happens next. A sign of a great film is when it can do all of those things even though you know the outcome. Unless you've been living in a cave (or a small country mansion in Pakistan) you're probably aware that Osama Bin Laden, the effective 'poster boy' of international terrorism and the al-Qaeda, was found and killed by a group of US Navy SEALs almost two years ago. Zero Dark Thirty documents the hunt over a 10 year period, beginning with a sound collage of phone calls during the 9/11 terrorist attack. This opening pretty much sets you up for the kind of film this is; dark, menacing and uncomfortable. <br/><br/>I was a little skeptical going into this film, fairly certain that it would patriotically wave the flag for the USA and shove down our throats how 'great' they are as a nation. However, it's surprising how unpatriotic the movie is. Maya, portrayed astoundingly by Jessica Chastain, is almost a CIA-prodigy who becomes obsessive about the capture of OBL. She starts out as a fresh-faced new recruit in the US Embassy in Pakistan, initially overwhelmed by the brutality of torture, and gradually morphs into a reclusive and obsessive key-player in the manhunt. Chastain is incredible, being both cold and unlikeable while at the same time being human enough for the audience to still invest in her character. It is a remarkable performance matched by the stellar supporting cast. However, this is very much Maya's show, sometimes feeling more like a study of a workaholic than a docu-drama.<br/><br/>Conversely, when the big guns come out, they certainly come out. For the majority of its two and a half hour running time, most of the action comes from the offices and workspaces of the US Embassy or the CIA, that is not to say that there aren't isolated scenes of explosive action, but they are certainly secondary to the drama. However, this being a picture about a manhunt, the final 30-40 minutes is some of the most gripping and exciting cinema that I've seen in a while. Again, it's a credit to the filmmakers for taking a story we know well and making it into something that still takes us by surprise. <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest snub of the Academy Awards this year was the lack of a nomination for Kathryn Bigelow, which probably has something to do with the difficult politics and subsequent controversy surrounding the picture. Her nomination would have been one of the most deserving, as the film's power and effect is almost single-handedly down to her direction. <br/><br/>In turns thoughtful, exciting and shocking, Zero Dark Thirty is the best film I've seen so far this year. Phenomenal.<br/><br/>My Blog: CelluloidRamblings . blogspot. co . uk"
"Rahmath","10","2","9","2 February 2013"," I don't know why people hated this movie ! !
","To me it was a pure piece of entertainment movie. I liked it so much. And the suspense was really appreciable. Writer did a very good job. But making could be more better. <br/><br/>People will want to compare this movie to the hurt locker, which is fair in the way that it locks you into scenes and is a war movie. The hurt locker was more of a pure war movie, whereas Zero Dark Thirty uses more dramatizations and has a more coherent direction, while still being an incredibly suspenseful movie.<br/><br/>Some people might criticize this movie for a lack of character development, but they are really missing the point of this movie. It's not your typical Hollywood movie that introduces a protagonist and develops him/her until the conflict is resolved. This movie is about tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden, and the way they used the main character as a metaphor for America as a whole was really impressive, even while refraining from your typical, often boring character developing scenes."
"The_Film_Cricket","3","2","9","14 January 2013"," The raid on bin Laden is amazing, but the preceding two hours are dull, dull, dull
","A century from now, barring anything major happening in the next seven years, the hunt and assassination of Osama bin Laden may ultimately prove to be the most studied and celebrated event of this decade. The man responsible for so much evil in the world perished more or less the way Americans wanted him to, dragged out of bed in the middle of the night and killed by a Navy S.E.A.L. Team who showed him no mercy. No fuss. No muss. No soldiers were harmed in the killing of this terrorist. John Wayne couldn't have done it better.<br/><br/>The details of the mission to assassinate bin Laden are fascinating, not least because it went off without a major incident, save for an experimental helicopter that never made it home. Those details make up the best parts of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" which tries to be a thriller despite the fact that we know how it ends. She stages the assault on bin Laden's compound with technical skill and it makes for some great cinema. Those scenes occupy the last thirty minutes of the movie, but the preceding story of how the government got their information is not as compelling.<br/><br/>That story, which makes up about 80% of the film is a long haul, taking place over 8 years and following the dogged trail of a CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) who has spent the bulk of her career trying to find the al Qaeda leader, tracking down leads and standing by as suspects were beaten and given the water torture. Always acting on a hunch, she follows cell phone signals and fragments of information that lead her to the next contact.<br/><br/>The portrait of Maya is not very compelling. Jessica Chastain is a life-force as an actress - look her up sometime as the angelic mother in ""The Tree of Life"" or as the ditzy housewife in ""The Help"" or as the voice of reason to a mentally ill husband in the brilliant, little-seen ""Take Shelter."" Yet, here she isn't given anything to work with. Maya never comes off as much of a character. Her whole life is dedicated to finding bin Laden but there isn't a person there, only a job. Chastain was recently nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress and won the Golden Globe, but you can't help feeling that this is a performance that any actress could have given. There really isn't anything special here.<br/><br/>The problem with the story is that the journey getting to bin Laden is not very interesting. The contacts all look more or less the same. They have names that you can't remember and faces that, after a while, all look alike. Some suspects are hauled in and tortured while a few others simply blow themselves up. The investigation itself doesn't have any energy or urgency. We know that this man is evil to the core and must be stopped but the story moves at an achingly slow pace as Maya stares at photographs and computer screens, then sits in meetings where government officials lay the blame at her door that bin Laden hasn't been found yet. After a while this becomes routine, not to mention dull.<br/><br/>The reward for sitting through the muddy plot is a final scene at the house in Abbottabad, which Bigelow and her technical team pull off with energy and skill. As drama it works perfectly. As action it isn't flashy or overwrought. In a briefing we know how many people are present and are shown a layout of the compound so we have an orientation of where everyone is on the grounds. We follow close behind the team as they move from room to room, floor to floor. Is the next man they encounter carrying a gun? Is he strapped to a bomb? Finally the moment of truth arrives and Bigelow resists the temptation to celebrate it visually. We barely see bin Laden, but we know it is him and there is a sense of relief when he is finally put down.<br/><br/>Those scenes will stay with you; the rest of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is easily forgotten. Kathryn Bigelow, who made the Best Picture winner ""The Hurt Locker"" three years ago, about a member of the bomb disposal unit who becomes addicted to his job, made that film about a specific person. This film is about the murder of a man whose death could light the fuse of revenge for years to come. Maybe the story should have focused on that angle instead.<br/><br/>**1/2"
"paul-lloydburrell","7","2","9","10 January 2013"," Not that bad
","I myself don't find this movie was that bad at all. I don't quite understand why people are so against torture of these terrorists. These guys would not show us any mercy when delivering their attacks, and if we want to get relevant info from them we need to use any means necessary to do so. That's only my opinion. I thought the movie was pretty good, mostly because it's based on real events, and the object is to find Bin Laden who I've been told is the man we need to get. I would agree with another reviewer, that a lot of the names thrown out during interrogations could've had more character development, mainly cause it was hard to follow who was who. I got the gist of it, but that was a complaint that I had while watching. Overall a decent Hollywood make of a real event. I'm sure there are plenty of holes, and embellishments, but I'm just a regular movie watcher not a critic in any way other than, was it entertaining or not. I enjoyed it, was engaged, although I initially didn't want to watch it cause of the negative reviews. It felt like watching a movie and not a documentary, which is what I wanted, with factual events."
"mustardman29","8","3","17","6 January 2013"," If you liked Blackhawk Down you will probably like this movie
","The 2.5ish hours went by fast. The magic of this movie for me was the rhythm of it. It's a slow but steady pace but the intensity keeps building. In the last 30 minutes it still feels like the same pace but it is very intense and I was totally engaged at that point. Afterwards I felt drained. Escapism at its best which is what movies are all about.<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about the Chastain character. I am not sure if it was great acting by not overdoing it, great directing trying to make her look very human and flawed, great script. Maybe all of the above or maybe that's just the way it came together and the acting and directing were not all that outstanding. I don't know but it worked for me. I never really got to like the Chastain character but perhaps that was the point. She helps carry the plot through it's twists and turns but doesn't get in the way of it. Like one of the lines in the movie, they are not there to be your friend. <br/><br/>Like many others I am not happy that the movie slants towards suggesting torture produced actionable intelligence because all information we have to date says it didn't. However, I didn't let it get in the way of my experience with this movie. To be quite honest it made the movie better than it would have been without that piece of fiction. Also, from what I have read beyond the 3rd party rumours from more credible sources, there never was a real Chastain character. She is more of a composite character comprising many many people who came and went on this including multiple CIA directors. That is how you turn reality into a compelling movie. Create composite characters, combine events, and bend facts or create your own when necessary to improve the story. If you want reality go watch a documentary."

","We are all familiar with Osama bin Laden and the story of his decade-long evasion from justice but few will have known the details of the painstaking hunt that lead to his capture and killing. 'Zero Dark Thirty' tells that story and does it with great realism and attention to detail - it is fascinating to watch, especially if you aren't familiar with the events in this film beforehand.<br/><br/>The film does a good job at remaining informative and realistic while never losing sight of the fact that it is a movie with the purpose of entertaining. It does have its flaws though and my main criticism would be the running time. I understand the need to tell the story as it happened and not cut corners, but at over two-and-a-half hours the film is too long and, despite the fascinating topic at hand, the pacing means you really do feel it.<br/><br/>'Zero Dark Thirty' is a informative and necessary film that gives us a detailed insight into the decade-long hunt for the world's most wanted man.

","The story of how Bin Laden was killed is told very very well. To put it simply this film is extremely accurate and well documents the 10 or so years leading up to his death in 2011.
The Problem i have with Zero Dark Thirty is the unnessesary bits, and some necessary bits that were left out. The acting is a solid 9/10 and the direction just as good. It is just too drawn out and could be condensed to give a more exciting experience.

","By far, this movie has the most gripping and riveting story among all political thrillers I've seen so far. I can't believe that I was so invested watching a movie from one of my least favorite genres. That's largely due to Boal and Bigelow's intelligent script that offers a knotted, nuanced, realistic, and somewhat honest look into a real story about war on terror. Each small detail that leads to another is more convincing than the last. And however the plot is very intricate, I never felt that it was so convoluted that can be difficult to follow.<br/><br/>Of course, we get a one-sided look into the real events, but the movie didn't try to be patriotic at all. There are quite a lot of torture scenes at the beginning that are really intense and brutal.<br/><br/>The use of hand-held camera Kathryn Bigelow famous for did more harm than good in Zero Dark Thirty. Aside from that I often find the documentary style so distracting and also so obtrusive, Bigelow's reliance on this style deprived Zero Dark Thirty from being one of the best-looking movies of the decade. For Greig Fraser, the director of photography, did an amazing job capturing some of the most stunning images I've seen recently.
That being said, this very documentary style gave the movie a somewhat realistic look that only paid off in two situations; the interrogation and torture scenes, and a couple of surprising sequences that are truly heart-pounding. The thing that reminded me a little bit of Villeneuve's Sicario.<br/><br/>Speaking of Sicario, this movie suffers from the same issue I had with Sicario. Which is giving so much attention, nay , priority to the moral aspect of the protagonist. But the major issue is that, Maya, our main character, is an entirely flawed and poorly-written character. Without delving into details, there are central changes happened to the character that are as clichéd as they are contradictory, and very very hard to swallow. Putting the blame on Chastain is a crime I won't commit. As she gave one of her best performances in her career. An Oscar-nominated performance that could have been Oscar-worthy unless it was dedicated to an otherwise terribly-written role that made Chastain herself confused as much as I was.<br/><br/>The editing in general is pretty elegant and masterful. But the sound editing is what stand out for me. This movie has one of the best uses of the J-cut ever!<br/><br/>Nail-biting, nuanced, and thoroughly captivating, Zero Dark Thirty sees Kathryn Bigelow delivering one of the most interesting based-on-true-story movies that is, sadly, lacks a well-wrought, and relatable protagonist.<br/><br/>(7.5/10)"
"amrikbiswas","7","1","3","28 September 2018"," Surprisingly Realistic
","I think this film receives a lot more hate than it deserves because people say it's extremely dull and boring. But I certainly am rating this higher than it deserves, but let me say I think it's about a 7.6/10.<br/><br/>Thing is, they aren't smart enough to understand that you're job as a CIA spy is not going to dramatic or action packed like most people think it'd be. It's careful intelligence gathering and analysis. The director got this spot on. <br/><br/>He was able to show how the United States secret corps actually function and he did it quite finely. Then what's the big problem? He did it excessively to the point where it was starting to get boring. There wasn't enough psychology in the film and much character depiction lacked. This movie should've been a psychological journey of the spy instead of how she tracked down Bin Laden. The movie misses several key elements such as why she spent twelve years trying to find Bin Laden and is still persevering. What caused her to go after Bin Laden? How does her stubborn attitude and perseverance affect those around her? <br/><br/>The movie misses these several key points to the point where it feels less like a movie and more like a cinematic documentary. This movie could've easily passed for a documentary. Take out Jessica Chastain's dialogue, put a voice over of some random dude. There you go, a documentary on the hunt for Bin Laden. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film has to be it's technicality. The film is shot beautifully and this showed the technical awareness of the director. He purposely breaks certain rules while film making to give a sense of reality especially in the DEVGRU operation scene (which is easily the highlight of the film). Coming to the Neptune Spear operation scene, I have to say. It is easily the best shot modern military scene. Chris Pratt was just outstanding as a DEVGRU operator and not once was I reminded that he was Chris Pratt. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie certainly has it's flaws but it's not a bad movie. It's good , but not great. Hence I rate it 7.6/10 due to my high liking for military movies.

","From what I had heard about the movie, the main problem was that the movie tells the story from a strongly pro-American side. Though this is largely true, I think the actual problem is that the characters weren't particularly likable. Jason Clarke is charismatic and you start getting involved, but then he largely disappears; Jessica Chastain has her moments, but also largely fell flat, especially in scenes where the obvious implication was ""this is a heavy emotional scene"", I wasn't feeling it. Really, none of the characters, with the exception of Reda Kateb and Jason Clarke's short tenures, are particularly compelling. There was surprisingly little drama, action, or thrills to help ease the burden of poor character development and dialog. The story is fine (a little slow, but I suppose that could have been intentional due to the way the plot plays out), and I didn't mind the viewpoint, but I came away unimpressed."

","Maybe my expectations were too high or I REALLY wanted another ""Hurt Locker"". It is also likely that it was just too soon to make this movie. The real events are so current and well known for a feature film. Looking back on it now, I'm not surprised they ended up with something resembling bad TV documentary. Just like some TV shows, I remember thinking all though the film, ""something interesting is going to happen"". Nothing ever did and in the end I was offended more than anything else. If this story is trying to be faithful to actual events, then there really wasn't enough material for them to begin with. Which is why I suspect writers REALLY had to try and insert some drama and human interest into this script. It all came off as forced and unbelievable to me. By the time the actual raid was presented it was massively anticlimactic for me (and I suspect for most viewers. I mean unless you live on the moon, you pretty much know everything that is going to happen in the last few minutes of the film don't you)? So... I would recommend you skip this unless maybe you're stuck in a hospital bed for the evening and you've already seen every other show that is available.

","Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a very gripping and suspenseful account of the raid authorized by former President Barack Obama to take out Osama bin Laden the man who was responsible for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and after that event happened he was under the radar for almost 10 years until May 1, 2011 until he was shot and killed by members of SEAL team 6. The movie stars Jessica Chastain in an Oscar nominated performance as Maya a CIA agent who in the movie came up with the original plan to take out Bin Laden. The movie isn't as suspenseful as her previous movie which was 2009's ""The Hurt Locker"" which was a total flawless masterpiece and one of the best war movies ever made. Then Maya tells her colleagues at the CIA as well as then director Leon Panetta (James Gandolfini) her plan to take him out while most of them agreed with it. Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal are probably the greatest modern director-screenwriter duo currently working which Boal wrote the Oscar winning screenplay for ""The Hurt Locker"". Even though this film wasn't as good as ""The Hurt Locker"" the scenes where the mission to take out Bin Laden were so intense that I didn't know what was going to happen next. My cousin's best friend told me that the movie was bad because it was inaccurate before I even saw the movie even though I was still looking forward to watching it and the movie totally worked for me, and now that I think about it the movie could be ranked among the best military movies ever made even though it isn't really a war movie. Because of experiences like this one and ""The Hurt Locker"" I am totally looking forward to seeing what movie that Bigelow and Boal do next, because this is one of the best movies of 2012."

","Zero Dark Thirty is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's very intriguing, revolving around a bittersweet true story that will surely be of interest to anyone, Jessica Chastain was given a very serious job when she was cast in the lead role of such a heavy film, but she does a fantastic job, she's the highlight and holds the whole film together, her emotion is real and a sense of tragedy and hurt is always evident in her face and voice. I didn't like this movie as much as most people did, and that's mainly because it was too interested in its story, though it was definitely very interesting true events, it should have focused on its characters much more, there is a lot we don't find out about the main cast, the main thing I wanted to know more about was Maya and Dan's past, they are all left as blank canvas towards the end, which despite the victorious finale, still feels significantly anti-climatic. The big moment of the whole movie is a disappointment, once the soldiers finally go to pursue Osama bin Laden, it could have been much more intense and it should have been longer, this was the scene everyone was waiting for, and it sadly comes and goes quite fast and holds back on being as thrilling and exciting as it could have been, it should have been at least an hour long. While it definitely has its flaws and is unfulfilling, Zero Dark Thirty boasts terrific performances and an intriguing story, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama if you ever see it on television or Netflix. <br/><br/>An intelligence officer's intuition and hard work helps the U.S. to track down Osama bin Laden. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jessica Chastain Worst Performance: Édgar Ramírez"

","After the horrible attacks which happened on September 11, 2001, one man became the most wanted man on the Planet by every law enforcement authorities in the world: Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty recalls the decade long search for OBL by the CIA and in particularly by one woman, Maya, who dedicated his life and friends to bring him to justice.<br/><br/>Maya is very obsessed with OBL. She doesn't focus on any other objective than the capture or kill of the most wanted man on the planet, the brain behind 9/11 and the murderer of thousands of people. She is a very dark character who doesn't show much her emotion and who doesn't flinch. Most of all she is resilient and while everyone around him lost hope to find Bin Laden she was the only one to carry on and finally successfully tracking him down leading to the Seal Team Six operation which ultimately ended his life.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is very convincing in her interpretation of Maya as a cold CIA analyst. Such an intense character requires a certain resilience especially while shooting the torture scenes which are quite hard to see.<br/><br/>I can't talk about this movie without evoking the torture scenes. They are certainly crude and really hard to witness but you can't deny that those enhanced interrogation techniques were widely used by the interrogators to get information from their prisoners. On that movie we are directly introduced to them at the very first scene, a sign that everything will be disclosed even the harshest truth about how intelligence was obtained. So yes those scenes are terrible but necessary. Ignoring them would be ignoring the true reality.<br/><br/>Now lets finally talk about the assault of the Abbottabad Compound which sheltered Osama Bin Laden. I have to say that I was amazed by the high attention of details brought to the construction of the set. It is looking so real I had the impression it was shot on site while the real one was demolished soon after the raid. This is really an amazing job from the construction crew. The attack is also very well shot and intense without any exaggeration from the scriptwriters and actors.<br/><br/>So here it is I give it a 8 out of ten. The story is captivating and well shot. The performance of the casting is convincing especially Jessica Chastain's. But this movie is not for everyone. It is a violent movie at the image of what the reality looks like. The torture scenes requires to have a solid stomach. But it's a great movie which is probably not to the taste of everyone but it deserves its Oscar."

One just thinks the USA is evil and therefore dumps on this successful campaign.<br/><br/>The others seem to think the characters ""need more development,"" as though this would have been better had they left out some of the dust and added a romantic liaison and the flash of a boob or two. Better yet, a lesbian situation! Wow! Wouldn't that have been cool!<br/><br/>In other words, many critics wanted a Hollywood movie with Hollywood sensibilities and Hollywood politics. I am profoundly glad this movie escaped that treatment. If you want a Hollywood movie that got the official White House imprimatur (complete with Obama in a voice-over at the end!), there's another movie for that.

"rmax304823","7","1","3","22 July 2014"," Killing Him Hardly.
","Above average semi-documentary, semi-fictionalized, story of the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden. Jessica Chastain, the principal figure, is the young agent who plunges heedlessly ahead in the search, despite criticism from her superiors who, by this time, ten years after the 9/11 attacks, are willing to let him fade into the mists of antiquity -- probably dead or holed up alone in Torah Borah. PS: The CIA, via the Navy Seals, gets him along with arm loads of documents and hard drives.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is pale, pink, pretty, and distinguished by a long, sloping, leptorhhine schnozz with a little outward bump on the tip. She looks so frail and fair that one might be afraid to pick her up, worried that one of her long bones might snap.<br/><br/>We have to assume that the story sticks reasonably close to historical fact although, as usual, some of the dialog and incidents are certainly fictional. I didn't know CIA agents cursed so much. I never realized that women CIA agents curse as foully as the men. I doubt that her colleagues in suits referred to her as ""the girl.""<br/><br/>I don't know exactly how an audience is expected to respond to some of the elements. Chastain's fierce determination in the face of so much male hostility sounds a little feminist. The torture and waterboarding didn't work in the scenes I watched, contrary to the claims of some of the politicians who still think it was a splendid and fruitful idea. The president (in 2011) is referred to as ""a thoughtful and deliberate guy,"" and I can imagine whole sectors of social space erupting in outrage at the use of descriptors usually defined as ""good"" applied to a man whom some Americans think of as innately evil. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow, the director, has a kind of mixed record. ""Blue Steel"" was hilarious trash but executed with éclat. Her talent seems to have matured. ""The Hurt Locker"" had its dimmer moments but was still distinctive, and so is ""Zero Dark Thirty."" I missed the first twenty minutes or so and was more or less confused throughout. The climactic raid on bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan is shot sometimes in darkness as profound as the nastiness it conceals.<br/><br/>No mention of such legal and ethical junk as flying a bunch of armed men into the city of a friendly sovereign nation and wiping out a couple of families before zipping back across the border. The history books are written -- and the movies made -- by the winners. No movies yet about the disastrous attempt in the 1970s to rescue the hostages in Teheran or a similar failed helicopter attack on a North Vietnamese prison camp.<br/><br/>Chastain and most of the others are locked into their roles but there are some subtle moments. As the raid is being considered, Chastain is grinning as a dozen Seals are playing grabass nearby. She receives the call that the raid is on for that night, and then turns back to the gamboling men and stares open-mouthed at them, realizing for the first time that she may be the principal agent in their deaths.<br/><br/>Nice job."
"bowmanblue","8","1","3","19 June 2014"," A reasonable portrayal of modern day espionage
","In case you don't know... Zero Dark Thirty is about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden, after the 9/11 attacks on America. Maybe, over the years, we've been spoiled by James Bond into thinking that all spying involves gadgets and car chases. However, in reality, most spying is done from behind desks and listening. And, yes, that's certainly a bit boring in some people's eyes.<br/><br/>However, that could be seen - by some - as a failing of the film. It's about two and a half hours long and a lot of it is spent in offices watching people in suits arguing about budgets and how to spend them (hardly what we'd expect from superspies!). So, maybe if you're intending watching this, you should know that it's not 'all action.' Plus there is a fair bit of human torture during the first half, so, if you don't have a strong stomach, you may not want to see how interrogations are taking place.<br/><br/>But, it does chronicle the hunt for the world's most wanted man pretty well. Even though (assuming you've watched the news) you probably know then ending, the final showdown is extremely tense and well filmed.<br/><br/>Plus there should be a special mention to Jessica Chastain who completely owns every scene that she's in. In fact... her performance is so strong that she effectively eclipses every other actor in this film, leaving everyone who isn't her as little more than an extra! So, if you're interested in the subject matter, then this really is the film to watch on the hunt for Bin Laden - certainly worth a watch (although expect a 'slow burner').<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"axel-koch","8","1","3","16 May 2014"," Giving further insight and intensity to what we've seen on the news
","Kathryn Bigelow is arguably one of the best war film directors of all time and with Zero Dark Thirty, her cinematic synopsis of the decade- long hunt on Osama bin Laden, she has realised yet another mesmerising portrayal of real-live events.<br/><br/>The film captures a timespan of almost ten years, beginning with actual recordings of the September 11 attacks over a black screen and ending with the killing of the Al-Qaeda leader and as such, it is understandably long – more than two and a half hours long to be precise. From a realistic perspective, this seems only reasonable if Bigelow wants to authentically recreate the many years of failure and despair in the famous manhunt through almost every shot lingering on for a couple of seconds and an immense lot of bureaucracy. From a filmmaking perspective however, trimming or excluding some parts and omitting at least a handful of the estimated 200 characters would have been very helpful. This didn't happen and therefore the result is nerve-rackingly boring at times, but Bigelow mostly manages to overcome this with a brilliant acting cast, several of them getting a chance to prove all their dramatic talent, and a phenomenal Jessica Chastain in the leading role.<br/><br/>What's additionally beneficial for Zero Dark Thirty is its way of handling the controversial source material: the inhumane ""enhanced interrogation methods"" by the CIA are fittingly dreadful to watch, as long as you aren't an uber-patriotic racist, you won't find solace or even joy in the ending, and none of the characters of both parties are likable. And then there is the action. Going out on a limb, I'd say that the raid on bin Laden's hide-out will become one of the most iconic pieces of filmmaking of the 21st century, as it is just so masterfully crafted. The sequence goes on for about as long as it did in reality, which is some twenty minutes, and Bigelow really makes you feel as if you were there. The downright perfect sound, editing, and cinematography create a mood that has its audience sitting on the edge of their seat, even though they all know only too well how it's about to end, which is one of the biggest cinematic feats a director can achieve.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a highly important film – one that suffers from its length and sloppy exposition that doesn't always make clear what has just happened, but one that gives further insight and intensity to what we've seen on the news."

","Zero Dark Thirty is a retelling of events that ultimately lead to demise of America's number one enemy: Osama Bin Laden. Lead by CIA operative Maya (Chastain), the mission takes about 8 years to be completed, as both sides play their tactics of deception in what appears to be a dead- end confrontation. Kathryn Bigelow directs this Mark Boal script in the fashion that she wants. In a neutral role, Bigelow presents us with what happened in a period stretching from 2003 to 2011, as the US intelligence worked extensively to apprehend the most ruthless terrorist on earth. Jessica Chastain is once again brilliant as her character conveys determination, but also fear and uncertainty as leads come and go. By the end she is the one pushes the most to see her 8 year work be rewarded with the ultimate goal being achieved. As for technical aspects, the sound is used to great extent to support the visuals. Overall the film does tend to drag at points, and the constant documentary-like look on the story adds a little to the toughness i had connecting with it. I applaud it's virtues in filmmaking and the wonderful performance by Chastain, but in the near future i won't look to this movie to impress me."
"videorama-759-859391","9","1","3","7 January 2014"," A must watch
","Here's Bigelow's best work here, though I haven't seen The Hurt Locker. She's outdone herself, and she should be proud, of this fine achievement. I love Bigelow's films, yes even Near Dark and the cop thriller surprise, Blue Steel, though admittedly Point Break's my favourite, closely followed by Strange Days. What we have here, is an interestingly told story, that chronicles the crucially important bits of information that finally led to the capture of the most wanted man in the world. We recount a couple of dates of other tragic events in the space of that near ten years, including the London Bombings in July of 2005, plus a couple of other bombings, one I never saw coming, that took the life of a woman CIA operative, funnily enough, the day after David Hick's release. I must say Chastain's performance bloody impressed the hell out of me. She stole the show, yet I liked Jason Clarke, a master of the American accent (hard to believe he's a true blue Aussie) as an anti terrorist extractor, who in the first powerful twenty minutes or so, beats an Alkida figure, using a couple of torture tactics on him, while Chastain uncomfortably watches him. When alone when the prisoner, she gives him a simple piece of advice. I would of like to see more of Clarke in this film, as he comes in and out a few times later. The middle east is a truly scary place, and to have this wary environment, a truly uncomfortable atmosphere for and an over two a half hour drama, I'll take off my hat to Bigelow for being brave. Even the setting of the Marriott restaurant, just before it's rubble, or that car shop in Kuwait- they actually have a city, makes you uneasy. And this is a bravely made made. Then comes that date May, 1, 2011. The whole exercise, where they suited up, boarded the helicopter, and assailed that fortress, scouring the place before finally hitting that particular room, and exterminating the number one enemy, was unrushed and told in meticulous detail. A ten out of ten job. A truly hairy part of the film. When they hit Bin Laden, I must of missed something, cause then it was all over, the deceased taken back in a body bag for absolute confirmation, unless it was the shot of a guy who looked younger though. I just missed something. Just don't miss this."

","Kathryn Bigelow is a goddess at making suspenseful war thrillers. And Zero Dark Thirty is no exception. The story itself is relatively straightforward, it follows the 10 years of events that led from 9/11 to the capturing and killing of Osama Bin Laden. And it's done beautifully.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent. The camera-work is amazing. The suspense never lets up for one second. Bigelow makes every scene so captivatingly realistic that you wont know whether it's a documentary or a thriller. She always manages to create the perfect atmosphere be it suffocatingly tense, or upliftingly relieving. And while predictable(it's technically a history movie after all) it still manages to make you cling to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal, Jessica Chastain knocks it out of the park, and the rest of the cast supports her incredibly well. It's no small wonder she got an Oscar nom.<br/><br/>The writing is great. The characters are very well developed(for a movie not focused on the characters rather than the plot). The pacing is just right. The plot manages to keep you nailed to the screen despite being relatively well known overall, and being not at all surprising.<br/><br/>The problems lie with Kathryn Bigelow's greatest strength being her greatest weakness. It's that damn obvious, and borderline obnoxious, American war propaganda, The Hurt Locker had the same problem, and was lessened by it. Cant you just make the story speak for itself rather than force feeding us the message that ""yeah America is awesome at catching bad guys"" or at least make it a little more subtle? <br/><br/>Thankfully every other aspect of the film is simply brilliant, so i managed to look past it, and i can see that Bigelow is improving, since she didn't have the cheesy ending The Hurt Locker did, but made an actually powerful scene for the last one. But it's a strong warning to anyone planning to watch this. Be prepared, you may not like the American propaganda."

","If you were thinking that two years is a bit soon to be making a film about the assassination of Osama Bin Laden, I have news for you: the film has actually been in production since 2009, two years before Bin Laden was killed.<br/><br/>Mark Boal won many accolades for the accuracy he brought to the screenplay of The Hurt Locker, and after he and director Kathryn Bigelow scored big wins at the 2009 Oscars they planned to work together on a follow up. At that time, Boal, through his military contacts, was following a Navy SEAL team's operations. As luck would have it that SEAL team ended up being involved on the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden. Within two days of the assassination, Bigelow announced they were re-working Boal's Black Ops script into the film that is now Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>So, how does a ""based on true events"" story turn out when the events and the film production ran parallel? Actually, quite well. The film, which is up for 5 Oscars including Best Picture, is a string of events filmed in the still-popular hand-held fashion that the Jason Bourne series used to excess. It is one third torture and interrogation, one third spy bureaucracy, and one third Call of Duty.<br/><br/>Central to the CIA investigation is Maya (Jessica Chastain) and her evolution from naive young agent to heavily-disguised operative. If this film wins anything at the February 24 ceremony it will be for Chastain's performance. She has given several great performances in ensembles over the last few years with The Help being a standout, but in Zero Dark Thirty she stands above a cast that includes a dozen recognizable faces including James Gandolfini. As the investigation drags on, her patience thins, and Chastain turns into the female equivalent of Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. To put it simply, she is the strongest female lead Hollywood has put out in a long time.<br/><br/>As the story progresses through the many terrorist attacks that have occurred in the past decade the tension continues to mount, and Bigelow succeeds in the same way Ben Affleck did in Argo, or Ron Howard did in Apollo 13. Even though everyone knows how the story ends, tension and suspense build out of the relationship that is built between the audience and the characters. It is a terrific feat of visual storytelling and performance that makes this a highly recommended film.

To this day, in the mind's of many, it's still incomprehensible that the American military, with all it's might, couldn't find a guy living in a cave, and that it took so long, and so much man power. I suppose it is one of those things where you'd think to yourself what a great movie it would have made. After making an account of the first consequence of the 9/11 attacks, in the shape of war drama The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow here invests a lot of time and energy in to this account of the hunt for bin Laden, an epic saga that fundamentally holds your attention, but not, necessarily, for nearly three hours.<br/><br/>We open with CIA interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke) putting a captured suspect through his paces, setting an uneasy opening demonstrating the uncompromising American resolve for answers. Enter our main character Maya (Jessica Chastain), recruited straight out of high school, observing these methods for her training, and agreeing with their effectiveness as a means to an ends. From here, she sticks with the program through thick and thin, gaining experience and intelligence, using her new found skills to help eliminate terrorist cells and capture suspects, before setting her sights on the biggest test of all- capturing Osama bin Laden, the big daddy of Al Qaeda.<br/><br/>The film takes a gamble by casting two relative unknowns in the lead roles, while sidelining more prominent acting talent, such as Mark Strong and the late James Gandolfini in basically cameos. With this in mind, it's certainly a blessing that it elicits a strong performance from Chastain as the driven, no nonsense under graduate who becomes even more fierce, wanting bin Laden's blood rather than merely his capture, after losing a friend to a suicide bombing. The performances certainly not being a problem, the trouble is the film's over reliance on the current trend of constantly skipping back/forward in time and outlining it on the screen, as well as giving titles to each new chapter. Somehow, it makes an already complex and very demanding story even more laborious , especially so with it's length in mind.<br/><br/>It's a story that demanded to be told, which the movie going public and anyone interested in world affairs would have a natural interest in, and Bigelow has probably done as good a job as could be hoped with this story. You're just left wondering what it would have took to have managed a perfect adaptation. ***"

","Maintain suspense when everyone knows what happened. That was Bigelow's job. She did this, I think, by concentrating on the intelligence chase that led to the location of Bin Laden. The actual shooting of Bin Laden (not a spoiler unless you've been living in a cave) was almost anticlimactic. Thank you, Bigelow, for not doing it in multiple angles in slow motion. Gimmicks would have detracted from the film. The real suspense was also in the chase, and more than a few people died in gathering the intelligence. The torture scenes are brutal. There is little gore but plenty of violence. Bigelow does a good job of making the raid suspenseful despite us knowing the ending. The middle of the film seemed to drag a bit though the beginning and end moved along nicely. The movie crew built stealth helicopters from scratch based on conjecture. They looked very plausible. The DVD has an extra feature called ""Geared Up"" that is quite interesting.<br/><br/>The cast was top notch. Chastain took on her role completely. She becomes a portrait of obsession, singularly dedicated to getting Bin Laden. Jason Clarke is also a stand-out as Chastain's fellow spook. Joel Edgerton (""The Thing"" prequel--yay) leads the Seal Team that ended the long quest for payback."
"ygdrasl","8","1","3","24 August 2013"," worth thinking about
","This is the true story of how a young CIA agent worked tirelessly to hunt down Osama Bin Laden, persuading her colleagues and finally getting her man.<br/><br/>Well, not exactly.<br/><br/>This is the story of how our intelligence agencies sifted through mountains of data to find Bin Laden's associates, and then track him down. In the process some people- bad people- were tortured.<br/><br/>Well, sort of.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a very smart movie about the hunt for Bin Laden. It features a lovely young redhead named Maya standing in for the faceless agents who did the actual job. Some of it, or all of it, or none of it, is based on actual events. <br/><br/>For most media reviewers, ZDT raised issues about torture- or, as the CIA calls it, enhanced interrogation. There's no denying torture is an integral part of the story here. <br/><br/>Maya's first appearance in Pakistan coincides with the interrogation of Amar, who may be a member of Al Qaida. The interrogator, Dan, tells her 'there's no shame' in watching the torture on a monitor, but she wants to take an active role. As she works with Dan to interview prisoners and follow up leads, she gets a better feel for what's going on in Pakistan and what this assignment will entail.<br/><br/>She catches on quickly. Imbued with an incredible sense of mission, she pushes her more reluctant superiors along Bin Laden's trail. Finally, years of work pay off when a member of her team follows a man to a walled compound that may be the actual hideout. The navy Seals stage a dramatic nighttime attack. One of the casualties is OBL himself.<br/><br/>So, in this version of the story, we tortured the people we had to in order to find Bin Laden.<br/><br/>This is a seductive piece of film making. It doesn't glamorize the tedium of intelligence gathering: trailing suspects, tapping phone calls, reviewing endless blurry videos. There are no cute relationships, no romances; no cartoon violence or action sequences. <br/><br/>It's suspenseful. It pulls out all the stops to create tension in the audience and sympathy for its heroine, who could be blown up at any moment. We're on her side. We want her to succeed in her quest.<br/><br/>And if she uses torture to succeed, are we still with her? We see her doing it; we cheer her on because she doesn't back down, she's as good as the guys.<br/><br/>And it's not like it's really BAD torture. Sure, some Arab guys are beaten, starved, water-boarded, put in a box- but we've all seen more violence in movies.<br/><br/>But these are the good guys we're rooting for. Good guys torture their prisoners?? Are we saying that in a good cause, it's okay?<br/><br/>Are we even claiming it worked? Because half the world is p'd off at us, and it's doubtful that anything of value was learned under torture. One guy even confessed that Sadam Hussein and Bin Laden were plotting together. And we all know how that piece of information worked out.<br/><br/>This is an extremely well-crafted movie. I give it 7 points, plus one more for the portrait of us it leaves to the future. If the rest of the world wants to know how we feel about torturing our enemies, it's all there."

","Kudos to Kathryn Bigelow and the entire crew of ZDT for making such a sticky and sensitive film. Though I happen to watch the movie only recently. And I watched it several times because it gave so many visual depiction of incidents which we have only heard so far.<br/><br/>Sticky, because it has depicted a fragment of different operations conducted by US intelligentsia (read CIA) for over a decade. Sensitive, because, as the so called closest ally of US to fight against terrorism, Pakistan have double-crossed all along.<br/><br/>Cinematically, I found the movie lived up to the expectation. I have read several adverse and annoyed comments against the film. I was amused to read those.<br/><br/>Few of the reasons for their comments are; 1. those who diabolically hate US, 2. those who belong to the same 'Ummah' of OBL, 3. those who do not know anything about the religion of this sect, 4, and lastly, those who do not know how the act of terrorism came in to being since early 7th century AD. And still people wonder, why Maya weeped in the end!"

","6.5/10 In sum: first 3/4 boring, final quarter is interesting; not worth it, but has good production effects<br/><br/>I thought the Hurt Locker was boring, so I figured this might be along the same lines. It took me 3 weeks of the BluRay sitting by the player to actually force myself to sit down and watch it. So possibly I went into it and it became a self fulfilling prophecy with it being boring.<br/><br/>TBH I feel like the movie did a disservice to the story and it made it all so painfully boring. If you're going to watch this movie, skip to the 2 hr in mark. That's when everything is finally interesting.<br/><br/>I get the slowness of the movie in illustrating Actress Jessica Chastain's character's difficulty in sleuthing and convincing.

"jdkraus","5","1","3","31 July 2013"," Subject matter over character and plot
","Bin Laden. Dead. Killed by the US government. Celebrated all over in the Western nations. Why not make a movie about it? So soon too. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is the answer, at least according to director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal. The subject matter is enticing and ambitious, enough for the US critics to give it an automatic 95/100 score on MetaCritic.com. That is a higher rating than ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."" Is this movie really that good? After having just finished the movie not long ago, I cannot but help think what is the fuss all about. Sure, the concept is neat, however, that does not guarantee a spectacular film. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a much better film, but I don't hear as much praise for it. <br/><br/>The problem with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is that it is a very daunting film. This is not shocking since this 157-minute movie tries to cover an 8 year timeline leading up to Bin Laden's assassination. The first 90 minutes alone are dedicated to how the CIA found the compound that Bin Laden hid out in. Much of this time is full of failed government plans, gratuitous torture scenes, and technical babel. While this set up is important for the sake of the movie, it is very uninspiring and at times confusing for the viewer. The movie itself feels more like a documentary than an actual movie. The style of hand-held camera throughout the film's duration helps attest to this. It is as if writer and director were more interested in trying to show the behind-the-scenes of a great manhunt rather than telling a good story with memorable characters. <br/><br/>Very little character development is formed, especially with the lead CIA analyst Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. While she delivers as a determined, even obsessed worker, her character shows minimal emotion like a robot, except for the instances where she flips out over the government's incompetence (which is frequent). It is not until the very last moment of the movie where we finally get to see some reaction other than anger from her. Her character is not well developed or written. With the material she had though, Chastain made it her own. The way she talks back at the dimwitted government officials is amusing (I just hope there are more people like her working in the US agencies). It almost becomes a running gag in which seems to be the only one who is taking her job seriously.<br/><br/>The whole famous raiding the compound sequence is a mild disappointment. Shot with bad lighting and unpleasant cuts between night vision and darkness replaces tension and excitement with perplexing confusion. If the entire scene was filled with just the night vision goggles, it would have made it easier to see and know what the hell is going on. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" really is all not that great. I don't think it is awful either. I feel people like this movie just because of its topic and not its delivery. In all honesty, I can't help but wonder if Kathryn Bigelow pounced on this project just so she can win two more Oscars. Thankfully, it did not win any big awards. Paul J.N. Ottosson's sound editing was at least a very good win. <br/><br/>On a final note, it grew very vexatious to see how stupid the US government employees (at least in this movie) were in terms of their decisions. The words ""Pearl Harbor"" ring to mind."
"moviedump","7","1","3","28 July 2013"," How Hollywood navigates black ops, geopolitical espionage and covert vested interests
","How should Hollywood approach real world stories about black ops, geopolitical espionage and covert vested interests, around which whirl clouds of doubt and conspiracy? According to Zero Dark Thirty, you tell something close to the official story and let it stand or fall on its own merits.<br/><br/>Events seem, at least initially, to be barely evaluated and leave much interpretation up to the viewer. But then, what to include and what not to include? While being taken to task for suggesting that information gained via torture was effective in revealing Bin Laden's whereabouts, all Zero Dark Thirty really does is show that it occurred behind the USA's delusions of moral ascendancy, regardless of the intelligence outcomes.<br/><br/>The potential for a heroic narrative is allowed to unravel somewhat. The film's authors lend a hand by portraying the hunt for Bin Laden as a bitter obsession that hollowed out the life of its female protagonist (in truth a melange of several female agents who drove the long quest for retribution and closure).<br/><br/>More at moviedump.org"

","A lot has been made of this movie. Some say it is not as realistic, some criticize it for being either pro or Anti Obama. But that is not what Bigelow went out to make. She was fascinated by everything about OBL. If and how accurate her depiction is, of how exactly that came to happen is another story. But she does not pull any stops and she does not tell people how to feel about certain things. Right from the get go, we get a scene of torture (which made some people leave cinemas around the world, I guess because they didn't expect a depiction like that), which shows us that she wants to keep it real.<br/><br/>Of course I can understand that some are not happy with Chastains character. She is driven without apparent motivation. But that is how some people work. They let their work consume their lives. There are not really characters you can cling onto, another thing I can understand as criticism. What you can't fault the movie with though, is not caring or not being professional. The big theme is OBL, that doesn't mean that other things will be left out, but it does mean, that it is the goal it works forward to. If you're willing to accept that, you might be able to watch it and not be disappointed"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","3","26 June 2013"," An insight into an event without any insight into the event. A dull, hollow misfire.
","The Hurt Locker is still one of those films I can't believe has won Best Picture at the Oscars. Not that it's undeserving, it's just that it came from nowhere. I remember it as a festival favourite in 2008 and I saw it via a screener in the Summer of 2009. I enjoyed it a lot but I don't have any particular affection for it, besides Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie's performances. It lacks something cinematic which I crave from Oscar movies even if I dislike them, although I do kinda resent it for Mark Boal beating Quentin Tarantino for Original Screenplay, which seems like it'll happen again. I was never interested in Zero Dark Thirty and I only watched it out of awards obligation, but I was a little intrigued after a lot of critics loved it. However, I was swiftly disappointed. The script is so dry and procedural that all potential for emotional investment and tension are lost. Although it attempts to have some, it lacks a very essential human and society element to give the film more purpose as common knowledge of the event isn't enough.<br/><br/>While most of the film is a slow adventure to Osama Bin Laden's hiding place as characters mention details lost on the casual viewer, all the explosive scenes beforehand feel like their beats were taken straight from Homeland so none of them or the consequences were surprises. Unfortunately Jessica Chastain isn't given enough consistent material to be truly great, and while she has a few decent scenes there's nothing coherent enough to what her character deserves. Jason Clarke is great in a side role, a real highlight of the first act, and a real shame when he has to leave. The film is overlong, disjointed and void of momentum but there's nothing particularly bad here besides the average approach to the topic. The only irritating aspect is the cinematography with its constant wobbling in every shot. It provides a really bland and dull atmosphere. Zero Dark Thirty is an insight into an event without any insight in the event. With films like this, Zodiac and Argo, I don't think saying ""this is what really happened"" is good enough to justify them being good when they underwhelm as a film. I don't think there's enough in Zero Dark Thirty to justify it being a film, maybe a book or a magazine article, as long as it's not written by Mark Boal.<br/><br/>6/10"
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","3","19 June 2013"," Thorough and intelligent
","The title Zero Dark Thirty, referring in military-speak to the 12:30 am time in which American forces broke into a compound in Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, is suitably apt for a film that puts procedural above all else. It's the lack of emotion and absence of any real identifiable character development that makes Kathryn Bigelow's thriller all the more absorbing, rushing from shouty suits in offices to dusty interrogation rooms, refusing to skip any details that led to the death of America's greatest ever enemy. Unless you've been locked in a basement for the past two or so years, you will be well aware of what happens at the climax, but it's what led to the news story that is so interesting, given that the events have been relatively hidden or unknown to the public.<br/><br/>Young, green CIA officer Maya (Jessica Chastain) arrives in Pakistan, assigned to work with fellow officer Dan (Jason Clarke), who is in the middle of an interrogation with Ammar al-Baluchi, a suspect in the 9/11 attacks. After days (possibly weeks) of waterboarding and humiliation, al-Baluchi gives up the name of Abu Ahmed, who he identifies as bin Laden's personal courier. When Dan is reassigned and with the practise of torture becoming political taboo, Maya finds herself working on hunches and scraps trying to track down the mysterious Abu Ahmed, who many claim to be dead. But after a fellow analyst finds new information, Maya is led to a large compound in Pakistan, and prepares for a Navy SEAL-led infiltration.<br/><br/>For such a cold film, there is always the danger of losing the audience in the sheer frankness of it all. The saving grace is undoubtedly Chastain, Oscar-nominated for her steely portrayal of a woman whose obsession borders on dangerous. She shows relatively little emotion, even when exposed to Dan's brutal torture routines, and the film rarely shows her out of her work-place. There is no man in her life, thankfully, and will gladly step over someone if she thought it would bring her closer to her target. But, like Jeremy Renner's William James in The Hurt Locker (2009), she is the perfect tool for the job. Not necessarily likable, but fit for her purpose. She is a modern action hero, using words and persistence over machine guns and body paint.<br/><br/>Like the work of Paul Greengrass, Bigelow manages to make an action thriller routed in reality, making as much out of a phone call as a gun fight. And it's the interactions of the hierarchy and the political manoeuvring that keep the film moving, highlighting the possible repercussions, politically, socially and ethically, of every minute decision. But when the real action does come, it doesn't disappoint, as a team of grunts (amongst them Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt) storm bin Laden's compound in almost permanent night-vision mode. It's captured in all it's confusion, as unsuspecting heads pop out of doors and bullets are fired at unseen targets. The film could have been a sickening exercise in puffy-chested patriotism, but in Bigelow's - and screenwriter Mark Boal's - hands, it is thorough and intelligent, harking back to the 1970's when topical film-making was still important.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"rachelandfilms","7","1","3","17 June 2013"," An intense and cathartic history-thriller...
","If there is one event in human history which can draw fear and tears it is the events of 9/11, which witnessed the death of over 3000 people and the destruction of a sense of safety in western civilisation. With that event came an age of war and terror that is associated with the man who orchestrated the terrible events of September 11, 2001. Given that the age of terror in which we live began on this date it seems appropriate that Zero Dark Thirty begins our tale for the manhunt of Osama Bin Laden at this point. Director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, The Hurt Locker) takes us back to this day with a simple yet hauntingly effective montage of real-life phone calls from the twin towers from people desperately yet fruitlessly calling for help. Bigelow begins the film in this way perhaps to set the tone for the rest of the movie, which is a sobering and mind-boggling dramatization of the 10 year effort to capture Bin Laden. <br/><br/>When we think back to the day that our TV's were barraged with the news that Bin Laden was captured we remember the images of smiling faces celebrating his death and we especially remember the moment that Barack Obama was broadcast across the world to confirm this death. On every newspaper we read that Obama had captured Bin Laden. Zero Dark Thirty, however, offers us the true story which is of special CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) and her on-going and arduous battle to overcome the many obstacles in the way of such an operation. Given that this manhunt lasted for 10 years and that many attacks and terrorist operations happened in between this period it would be easy for ZDT to be bogged down by the facts and seem more like a documentary than a gripping yet faithful-to-the-events film. Bigelow and the writer behind this film, Mark Boal, manage to avoid this trap however and offer a gripping narrative which is separated by specific events that not only show the personal efforts of Maya, but also emphasise the network of people that helped bring down Bin Laden. <br/><br/>The film is a searing and at points uncomfortable biopic of the effort that went into gathering information and building up a profile of key people within al-Qaeda. Bigelow does not shy away from offering the audience the hard truth and this is intensely evident when at the beginning of ZDT we witness the torture of an al-Qaeda member who may or may not have vital information of terrorist activity. This makes for rather uncomfortable viewing and the fact that it was done in the effort of gaining information is a hard fact to bear, reminding the viewer that Bin Laden was not merely a man but rather an institution of fear and terror from which many drew inspiration, and whom many died to protect. The fact that torture was an oft-used instrument in gaining the necessary information speaks volumes of the personal character of Maya, who at the beginning of the film seems too vulnerable and feminine to be able to withstand such acts. But as the film progresses this vulnerability turns to hardness and her humanity and character all become fixed on one goal – to capture Bin Laden at any cost. <br/><br/>If you would like to read the rest of my thoughts concerning this film then you can visit this site...

","I'm very surprised by all the horrible reviews (1 star?!), as I thought it was well made, interesting and entertaining. It's certainly no Hurt Locker, but it's far from bad in my opinion. One of the few things that really bugged me were the horrible American accents. I kept trying to figure out whether the character of Dan was supposed to be from the US or not. Seemed weird for him not to be, but he sure didn't sound like he was. And the National Security head (Stephen Dillane) didn't even try to sound American. Can someone in that post be British?! A strangely big and distracting detail for Bigelow to miss. But I thought all else was good to very good, especially Chastain."
"dharmendrasingh","6","1","3","19 February 2013"," So that's why it took ten years
","Originally meant to show the unsuccessful 10-year hunt for Osama bin Laden, Katherine Bigelow's film was hastily rewritten to include his execution. The rationale for this film, so soon after the event, was to explore the effects that history's greatest manhunt had on the woman who led the chase. That's what we were told. After watching two-thirds, you realise that actually this is – and I don't necessarily have a problem with it – a celebration of bin Laden's death. <br/><br/>That said, there's no overt triumphalism in the dramatisation. A good thing, too. This unique story in America's history has inherent significance, which any trace of Hollywood jingoism would cheapen. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain assumes the daunting lead character Maya, the CIA op who pursued 'UBL' (the US gives cool nicknames even to its enemies) when everyone else lost faith. There are dangers in being too true to your character. It's a very reserved performance. I didn't notice much acting, and I suspect it is the character, not the characterisation, which is drawing attention.<br/><br/>ZDT deals with the same subject matter as Bigelow's directly previous film, The Hurt Locker. But whilst THL took place in the field, where Jeremy Renner was intrepidly disabling bombs as we prayed for him not to explode, ZDT takes place mostly in CIA 'black site' locations, makeshift offices and soulless boardrooms. <br/><br/>Flashing through key milestones in the hunt – meetings, interrogations, suicide bombings – the one insight you come away with is why it took the most advanced military nation in history 10 years to do the job. This mission wasn't a priority. Perhaps that's why there was such a small team with inadequate financing. Maya suggested dropping a bomb on the Pakistani compound despite their uncertainty that UBL was there, but the powers that be demurred due to changing politics. <br/><br/>The torture scenes – the big talking point – are underwhelming. The guy committing the waterboarding, played by Jason Clarke, is a hip young Doctor, uncomfortable in meting out pain but only does so as a last resort. 'If you lie, I hurt you' he tells a suspect, in a pleading not pleasure-seeking tone. The suggestion that showing them somehow condones the practice is absurd. These scenes are necessary for drama and realism.<br/><br/>Despite my overall disappointment, I felt the last half hour, a step-by-step re-enactment of the 12:30 a.m. attack, was the most palpably tense and suspenseful sequence I saw last year. And the sound was absolutely deafening. I'll be buying the DVD for that part alone. <br/><br/>Although never boring, ZDT is often draining. It is over-hyped and overrated, securing its box office success solely on the premise. But the award ceremonies, the ultimate judge, are giving the film the lukewarm reception it actually deserves."

"ghost_dog86","8","2","11","7 January 2013"," 10 Years in the Making
","Mimicking what more than likely every other critic has already said, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" will undoubtedly be a heavy favorite to receive an Oscar for Best Picture of the year; especially considering the Academy's past love affair with director Kathryn Bigelow's overrated film ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>With a haunting opening scene (which may be hard for some to listen to) and an exceptionally handled final shot (actually, final 30 minutes), ""Zero Dark Thirty"" brings to life the decade-long search for Osama bin Laden by the CIA, after 9/11. OK, so even though I went in (like most American's) with an understanding of the gravity of the subject matter, as well as the importance of what a movie like this should mean to an American audience, at times (especially during the first 90 minutes) I consciously didn't feel like I was as invested in the story as much as Bigelow wanted me to be. And what that equates to is simply, if you aren't that interested in seeing a movie about the manhunt for Osama bin Laden, then ""Zero Dark Thirty"", while may hold your attention, may also not come off as the masterpiece many are hailing it to be. Aside from that, aesthetically speaking, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is very well directed and constructed. The sectioned out chapters Bigelow inserts throughout, work quite well as brief exposition amidst a somewhat complex timeline, and while (as an audience member) you are sure to feel the length of this movie (coming in at 157 minutes) that is probably intentional, if only to add to the atmosphere of the entire piece; as a movie about a grueling 10 year manhunt shouldn't speed by in 90 minutes.<br/><br/>In saying all of that, there are a few stand-out aspects that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" brings to the table, which are alone worth the price of admission. First off, the ability of Jessica Chastain to steal the show should finally be acknowledged here. After getting some past awards season love for her stand-out performances in both ""The Tree of Life"" and ""The Help"", Chastain as the protagonist Maya, a CIA operative who spearheaded the attempt to kill bin Laden, gives the best performance of her (still blossoming) career. This tremendously layered character that Mark Boal has written could have easily been overdramatized and turned into an Erin Brockovich (girls can do it too) performance, but Chastain plays it with just the right amount of tempered command, giving Maya a sense of reliability. Her performance is so interesting, that ""Zero Dark Thirty"" eventually turns into a compelling character study as well as historical drama. In fact, the latter part of this film is way more entertaining than the initial hour because of Chastain's award worthy performance. Simply stated: the more this evolves into the Jessica Chastain show, the more watchable ""Zero Dark Thirty"" becomes.<br/><br/>Secondly (and maybe most importantly) Bigelow does something quite gutsy here. While not giving audiences a sympathetic look at members of al-Qaeda, Bigelow does make it a point to show how intelligent the enemy was. This differs from the American cinema norm of making the American's constantly the smartest ones in the room, instead creating a more accurate depiction of a big and powerful America versus a small but elusive and very tactically aware enemy. Furthermore, Bigelow's ""atmosphere of realism"" throughout (especially in the final act, when SEAL Team 6 kills OsamaSpoiler Alert, I guess) will be what ultimately solidifies ""Zero Dark Thirty"" as a memorable film for most. In all actuality, this same sense of realism is the most interesting thing to come out of the initial hour, occurring during sequences which are sure to be seen as highly controversial, where supposed terrorist are TORTURED by members of the CIA, with the intent of obtaining intelligence. Though these scenes are not unique to this film, in fact ""waterboarding"" is a tactic that has been used a multitude of times by bad guys (or brown people) in many generic American action movies set abroad, what Bigelow does here is use the similar waterboarding sequence and suffocates it with her own unique style of gritty realism; in turn, creating sequences American audiences would have been unfazed by in any other film, and making them quite hard to watch (and rightfully so). Also, by making the only TORTURING done in this film be executed by members of the CIA (an agency well respected in American cinema) she makes these same scenes strangely alluring.<br/><br/>Final Thought: As heavy as the premise and the Aaron Sorkin-esque dialogue is, Bigelow does interject a few scenes of suspense amidst it all, which shows her understanding of historical entertainment (though this is not as entertaining as ""Argo"", but hey). So, because of Bigelow's direction, her the lack of punches pulled and Chastain's performance, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is definitely a film to take strong notice of this awards season. Plus, considering the amount of high praise this movie is getting (by others) the least that can be said about ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is that this is Kathryn Bigelow finally solidifying herself as the best director in the ""War in Afghanistan based drama"" genre.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

",""" The bin Laden operation was a landmark achievement by our country, by our military, by our Intelligence Community, and by our Agency, "" - Acting Director of the CIA, Michael Morell <br/><br/>Films that claim to be based on a true story have a tendency to be hyperbolic and are usually far from the truth they claim to purport. Zero Dark Thirty has gained that infamous reputation in some circles. After rave reviews from critics and winning its share of awards, there has suddenly been a backlash of sorts against this film since its wider release throughout the country this month. Some governmental officials and lawmakers are demanding an inquiry into the facts leading to this docudrama about the subsequent manhunt for Osama bin Ladin. Kathryn Bigalow's controversial film has certainly struck a nerve with this emotional topic and America's methods to eradicate its number one enemy. In trying to connect the facts of this historic mission, Bigalow has also created a cinematic masterpiece, a thought-provoking and thrilling insider's look into the exhausting investigation that brought about this terrorist's death and, with it, some initial closure to the 9/11 tragedy. Revenge is said to be sweet, but this film shows the bitter aftertaste of freedom as well. And as for victory, at what cost?<br/><br/>After 10 years from the collapse of the World Trade Center and the senseless loss of human lives, questions still need to be asked: Are we too close to this political mass murder to create an objective analysis of this event? Do we, as a country, fear the truth about our actions and those of our enemies? Can this or any film be therapeutic to our national healing, or is it all too soon? If not, then when? Zero Dark Thirty dares to explore these inquiries and shed some light on the actual mission. <br/><br/>The title Zero Dark Thirty means an unspecific time between midnight and dawn, which were the estimated military time of the raid on bin Laden's secret headquarters. The film begins with a black screen. The sounds of that fateful Tuesday in September over a decade ago are heard. The pain, the chaos, and the cries of those innocent victims resonates. Without any visual support, the frightening images are fully realized, scarred in our memory. It is a devastating beginning that will lead to the film's devastating end. ( Kudos to Paul N.J. Ottosson's for his remarkable sound editing work. )<br/><br/>The film uses fictitious characters to tell its tale, but is remarkable in its honest and detailed approach to its subject. The CIA agents are shown to be dedicated workers trying to piece together any clue to bin Laden's whereabouts, particularly one female agent named Maya ( the talented Jessica Chastain in another excellent performance ). Her obsession and tenaciousness bring her closer to solving this mystery. But it is this woman working in a man's world that helps to make the film even more complex and riveting, as she tries to excise anything in the way of her pursuit.<br/><br/>It is apparent that Zero Dark Thirty was heavily researched and Mark Boal's compelling screenplay is a remarkable piece of concise writing mixed with factual data. The time-line of events compresses years of investigative fact-finding by the CIA with other al-Qaeda terrorist attacks globally. While initially the film takes its time to build and connect these story lines, causing the film to seem slow-moving, Boal then shrewdly focuses more on the historic events and less on the individual characters, except for our heroine who serves as the emotional center. This gives a more natural and realistic undercurrent, a gritty and raw sense of foreboding.<br/><br/>Bigalow's direction is flawless. The film is concise and gripping throughout. The action sequences build tension so well and lay the groundwork for the film's memorable Navy Seals' climactic invasion, done in all of its green night vision glory. ( The editing by Dylan Tichenor and William Goldenberg and the photography by Greig Fraser in this set piece are exceptional. ) <br/><br/>But perhaps the most controversial element of the film is in the beginning section of the film ( the Bush years ) when Bigalow doesn't shy away from the darker side of the investigation. Her ability to include the torture and the humiliation of prisoners as just one means to gain information for bin Laden's capture is on full display ( and probably was much worse than depicted on the screen ). It was an undeniable part of the logistics that led to bin Laden's demise. Still, these sessions are relentless and make for uncomfortable but necessary viewing for all serious moviegoers. ( And it is in these horrific scenes that our government leaders doth protest too much. Like it or not, violent interrogation methods played a pivotal role to the success of this mission, contrary to American government claims that the U.S. does not sanctioned such immoral tactics as water-boarding. ) Yes, war is hell and you are caught in all of its ugliness and horror. That is what makes Zero Dark Thirty such an important and courageous example of superior filmmaking.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty recounts the hunt for an extremist, but it also probes the ethics of war and all of the innocent and guilty casualties it leaves in its wake. From its opening sounds of horror to its concluding blood-soaked images, this important film comes full circle. This is a film not to be missed. GRADE: A-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com <br/><br/>NOTE: There remain conspiracy theories that bin Laden died of natural causes in December, 2001. Some also believe that the execution of this terrorist leader in May of 2011 never happened and was orchestrated by the American government as a cover-up. This leads to yet another question: Whose truth is it anyway? And at what cost?"
"kdnor2011","8","2","12","10 January 2013"," Suspesful, well made thriller
","So I originally thought that this movie would at least have a chance at best picture, but since Bigellow didn't get a nomination for best director, it seems it's chances are slim. So Zero Dark Thirty is directed by Kathryn Bigellow and written by Mark Boal, the same people who made the Hurt Locker, and if you read my review you know that I wasn't a fan of that movie, I actually think it's one of the most overrated movies ever made. And well Zero Dark Thirty is not perfect, it definitely makes up for The Hurt Locker.<br/><br/>This movie is two and a half hours long, and it feels like it, some scenes go by way too slowly, and of all the characters, I remember one name, literally one name. The shaky cam and fast editing isn't nearly as bad as it was in Hurt Locker, but it still is present and while it sometimes is used well sometimes it's just used for the sake of using it. And I don't think I'm spoiling anything, but at the end when they finally get bin Laden, it goes by so fast, it seems very anti climatic.<br/><br/>But the main character Maya is very likable, she seems believable that she would want to hunt this guy down. The suspenseful scenes are very suspenseful and don't just feel like padding to make the movie longer. It has some funny moments, the production value is great, it pretty much just fixes most of the problems I had with Hurt Locker. Some scenes can get very hard to watch, and I'm not exactly sure how much of this is true, but it seems to be pretty facutal.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a very good film with great suspense, well done action scenes, a likable lead, great acting, high production design, and some really awesome explosions that I honestly didn't see coming. It definitely is better than the writer and director's last movie, and while I won't be rushing out to get it on DVD, I may watch this again in the future."

"sandnair87","9","1","4","6 May 2015"," Kathryn Bigelow Adapts Modern History's Greatest Manhunt Into A Crackerjack Thriller!
","Never before has the war-on-terror been shot with such a cold dose of reality. As entertainment, Kathryn Bigelow's engrossing and symbolically astute Zero Dark Thirty is a great accomplishment - a somber, black-winged benediction for what we might count as a lost decade. It depicts the long-lasting struggle of terrorism with immense veracity - the greatest manhunt in modern history playing catalyst to a gripping tale of obsession both dark and dangerous. <br/><br/>With Zero Dark Thirty, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal present a different kind of espionage environment - one that follows a fictionalized CIA operative Maya (Jessica Chastain) recruited specifically to ferret out the architect of the 9/11 attacks – Osama Bin Laden. It's one filled with paper work, meetings, and sifting through a never ending stream of intelligence. But it's also one where the stakes are always high, danger is found at every turn, where a hunch can lead to a breakthrough and misinformation can lead to wasted years of chasing ghosts. Through Maya we share the successes and frustrations of tracking down the head of a snake so twisted and slippery it's of no wonder that it took over a decade to get a strangle hold on him. Yet Maya represents more than the CIA, she is America herself: wounded, driven and in conflict on how to move on after killing the bogeyman that haunted their nightmares for too long.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow takes the procedural model and brushes away every unnecessary detail - rarely glorifying and never dumbing down or 'Hollywoodizing' important tidbits of the plot to get a rise out of the audience – leaving behind a potent film that never feels bogged down by its own complexity. Even though the outcome is common public knowledge, we are enthralled by the way the story is spooled out. Even at a runtime of three hours, Bigelow displays an uncanny sense of pacing and rhythm, tightly cutting back and forth between Maya's exhausting hunt for bin Laden and her constant inner-struggle to never give up, even when faced with a complete dead end that promises her nothing. All this leads up to the film's most audacious set-piece, an almost unbearably tense, moment by-moment re-creation of the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. But Bigelow is careful not to exploit the cathartic potential of the raid, and the movie ends on a note that's wonderfully dissonant with the expectations of an action movie crowd.<br/><br/>Maya is a tough cookie, but by casting the pale, red-haired, rather waifish Jessica Chastain, the director makes the unstressed point that strong women sometimes come in deceptively frail packages. She plays Maya with stone-cold intensity, fuelled by anger directed towards a target so elusive that he is more a phantom than a terrorist leader. Zero Dark Thirty rests on Chastain's shoulders, but she's always interacting with strong talent and that only helps to keep the film level and never without a pulse.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty remains an immaculately put together work of art that deserves all the attention it was given."
"raulfaust","9","1","4","20 April 2015"," B.y.o.b.
","Before I started watching ""Zero Dark Thirty"", I thought it was going to be one of those never ending thrillers filled with American propaganda. However, I had to see it myself to be able to state: it is not. From the get go, this film tells us the circumstances behind Bin Laden's capture (or murder?), and that's what makes this movie so impressive. Also, writers are smart enough to create some over-realistic characters that fit very precisely in a movie. In my opinion, Maya is too indestructible to be real, and she is written like a superhero character who everybody cares about. However, the actress Jessica Chastain indeed STEALS the show with such performance, bringing life to her character. In fact, that's one of the strongest characters I've seen in years, and it feels refreshing to see that Hollywood has finally given such duty to a woman. Furthermore, the directing is very present and tries everything to entertain the spectator, which never fails; scene after scene, I was just wondering why I took so long so give it a chance. People are free to say whatever they want to about the United States' actions and it's politician vision, but I doubt they are able to bash the technical elements in this picture, since they are nearly perfect."

We had no idea how those acts would look like, but we knew something was going to happen. I almost went to Australia, since ex Yugoslavia was at war, and I could not go back there. I wish I did go to Australia. Here I sit in my apartment in Sarajevo and think of the madness and pain AlQayida has put us all thru. If there is hell I wish they all end up in there!

","one would expect to see on the Discovery or History channel. I just didn't think this story made a great movie, it seemed more appropriate for cable TV. The film tells the story of a made up character, Maya, whom guesses right on intelligence as to the location of Osama Bin Ladan. Problem is we know how it ends; so the ending with the special arms forces leading a raid at night was not suspenseful. There was nothing to hold your attention since you already know what they found in the compound. Then you have the made up ending of Maya looking over the body and then getting to go home, just cheesy.<br/><br/>And I don't see why Jessica Chastain got such recognition for the role.

"ypomoni13","3","1","4","7 July 2013"," maybe a TV mini series?
","Oh, no....there is so much at fault with this movie, I don't know where to begin! Let's start with the lead character, Maya. In the beginning of the film she can barely watch a violent interrogation. As the film progresses the attempt that is made to show her character has evolved is done with her swearing at her bosses and basically acting hysterical towards them, which is obviously how CIA agents keep their jobs, right? I mean it works in Homeland, so why not here? But Maya is not always like that. No. When Maya is not belittling her superiors, she is blank, completely void of emotion. References to how ""exhausted"" and ""worn-down"" she was could not make me care about this empty character, and believe me, the references were constant and plentiful. In fact, the only character that I found mildly interesting was that of Dan, the CIA interrogator. When he didn't get his way he would be brutal making you feel kinda feel sorry for anyone he was interrogating (even though you knew they were a terrorist). This was an everyday guy doing his job, as if it was nothing. At some point he states he is going back home to get some normalcy and balance back, almost as if he were talking about going on a vacation to recharge before going back to work. The film decides to open with Dan at work, an ingenious move seeing as these scenes are probably the most powerful and disturbing of the whole film. It's all downhill afterwards....<br/><br/>As for the other characters, why oh why are there so many? I get it, this was a big operation, it involved many people and organisations operating together - that doesn't mean we have to be introduced to each and everyone of them in one film! But it doesn't stop there, oh no. There is no time to develop these characters not only because there are too many of them, but because the film is filled with long, boring dialogue of no consequence with mainly secondary characters. I found myself nodding off more than once... <br/><br/>The plot! Oh wow! I read the other reviews and couldn't stop laughing with how many plot holes people found! Things like: *spoilers ahead* Pakistanis don't speak Arabic, but Urdu, or Maya in a restaurant talking to a colleague, mentioning - in public! - the name of a suspect. In fact, from what I gathered, a lot of what goes on in this film is fiction. Bending of the truth, bad acting, poor writing, choppy and amateur camera-work, are not the only things that bothered me about this film. The fact that the film implies that UBL is caught and killed mostly due to Maya's 12-year sole dedication to get him, well, no. <br/><br/>This felt more like it should of been a 3-part fictional TV series, a Homeland rip-off. Don't waste your time on this...."
"kellsjunk5","3","1","4","30 June 2013"," Nothing to rave about...
","I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the previews and reading some of the nominations it was receiving. However, the movie itself was dull for the first 3/4 of the film. The story revolved around a single person working on finding OBL which made it very boring. It's funny because I've also seen the movie ""Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden"" which is a lower budget film than this one yet had much more explanation as to how they found Osama and how they knew it was him. Not to mention, a better side story and more action. Despite being the bigger box office film, I would suggest watching the Seal Team Six film over this one anyday."
"Far-Sky","3","1","4","28 June 2013"," Terrible dreck with an amazing sequence
","It's simultaneously a blessing and a curse that I often wind up seeing films post-theatrical release. Even though I don't intentionally seek out spoilers (OK, I do, but I'm getting better about it), I do still read reviews of films. The best reviews convey two things: 1) what the author thought of the film in question, and 2) enough information to give the reader an informed opinion as to whether or not said reader will enjoy the film, regardless of the author's response.<br/><br/>Those reviews, coupled with the near-unanimous praise the film has received from all quarters caused me to believe that I would fall in love with this film, becoming swept up in its high-tension, immaculately-crafted story of the hunt for, and eventual assassination of, master terrorist Osama bin Laden.<br/><br/>I was so very, very wrong.<br/><br/>It starts well enough: under a black screen, a restrained opening plays audio (I do not know if it was real or dramatized) of phone calls placed on September 11, 2001 as the terrorist attacks that brought down the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were occurring. The film then introduces us to Maya (Jessica Chastain), one of many CIA workers tasked with finding the man responsible for those terrorist attacks. We follow Maya over the next twelve years, seeing small glimpses of her as she grows from determined but unsure interrogator to a woman whose sole reason in life is the location and capture of Osama bin Laden.<br/><br/>The film was in production for a long time, and the ending had to be hastily rewritten to account for the real-life assault on the bin Laden compound, which resulted in his death. What a boon this became for the film (to say nothing of the country as a whole), as the thirty- minute compound assault that serves as the film's final act is a breathtaking, tour-de-force whirlwind, following Seal Team Six into the dark den of the most notorious terrorist in American history and emerging victorious.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the two hours preceding that astonishing climax is unforgivably dull, lacking almost completely in character development and good writing, and structured with the worst possible way in which to tell this epic and (potentially) fascinating story.<br/><br/>Chastain, one of the best actresses of her generation, vacillates between being utterly terrific (attempting to convince her superiors of her lead, her final scene) and sadly miscast. Chastain is an actress of uncommon grace and beauty, and trying to put her in the role of an embittered federal agent simply doesn't work. The rest of the cast is serviceable, but the script (more on that in a moment) simply gives them nothing to do. At least the SEALs fare slightly better, with Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt (from TV's 'Parks & Recreation') crafting positive impressions from their slivers of dialogue.<br/><br/>Oh, that script. Written by journalist Mark Boal (Oscar-winning screenwriter of Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker'), it is a cacophony of crap. The dialogue is inane (""Bin Laden is there. And you're going to kill him for me.""), the characters are flat, lifeless, and uninteresting, and most unforgivably, it takes what should have been a massively satisfying story (the hard-won retribution visited upon the monster that killed 3,000 innocent Americans), and trivialized it to nothing than the personal investment of a single person spurred by the death of a couple of coworkers during the twelve-year-long search. I understand that the search for bin Laden was over a decade of boredom and legwork, punctuated only by intermittent threats (most of which felt cooked up specifically for the film, despite those setpieces paling to what I can only imagine the real scenarios must have been like). But Bigelow's insistence on conveying that to the viewers by boring them to tears as well is not an effective recipe for drama.<br/><br/>In a way, it's the inverse of Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. 'Ryan' is a not a good film (the screenplay is utter dreck), but the skill, inventiveness, and sheer directorial talent on display in that phenomenal opening sequence catapult it to being on the greatest scenes in cinema history. Here, Bigelow stages her own version at the end of her film, and the results are equally gripping and visceral. On the basis of that one scene alone, Bigelow (much like Spielberg) deserved inclusion in the Academy's nominees for Best Director. Outside of that, however, I find the critical acclaim of the film to be completely mystifying. The movie as a whole is rotten to its poorly-written core, a waste of money, and a diminishment of one of the best real-life stories of modern times. If you can, pop in for the last reel, but spend the other two hours watching something better."

Probably this was on purpose, in order to not distract the audience from the central plot, which was how they got to track Bin Laden.<br/><br/>Leaving any political view aside (since we all know how massive were the result of this successful operation, in the counter-terrorism efforts), I feel the plot gets a bit boring at the beginning, the pace was quite slow, and since they do not get you involved with any of the characters, you have nothing to keep your attention 100 % (and I was not expecting, an action packed movie by the way).<br/><br/>What I liked: - That last scene was beautifully filmed, and probably very realistic in my opinion.

","This is a long movie at almost 2 1/2 hours, but it didn't seem long to me, all of it was interesting. It starts with a hint of remembrance of the 9/11 attacks, which started the hunt for Bin Laden. It ends with the raid that resulted in the death of Bin Laden. That is the title reference, 'Zero Dark Thirty' literally means 30 minutes after midnight, but can also be a general reference to doing a mission in the dead of night.<br/><br/>The script and ultimate movie is an interesting story in itself. It started out being one thing, because after so many years it did not look like Bin Laden would be found and caught. But when he was, the last part of the script had to be re-written, to reflect a whole different arc.<br/><br/>There are many fine actors involved, and I don't want to diminish any of them, but the critical role is Jessica Chastain as Maya , who had been hired on out of high school and her first assignment, which lasted 12 years, was the hunt for Bin Laden. There wasn't a real Maya, but in fact she was a composite of several female agents who were mainly responsible for finding Bin Laden.<br/><br/>Ex-CIA Director Michael Hayden revealed that the top bin Laden hunter in the movie appropriately symbolizes a ""band of sisters"" responsible for finding the terrorist, clearly the character in the movie is a composite. ""Most of the people who briefed me on Osama bin Laden were women officers of the CIA. But Maya is a composite."" He added: ""I think it does a masterful job at suggesting that in the real world, there are no right angles and there are no easy answers to very difficult situations. And that to me was a great service."" <br/><br/>Most of the first 2 hours' running time is the build-up to the capture. It shows interrogation techniques, use of foreign intelligence contacts, tapping of phones, tracing and tracking down the messenger, because for security there were no electronic connections from the Bin Laden compound to the rest of the world. But with persistence and good detective work they tracked him down.<br/><br/>The raid and its aftermath, including the identification by Maya that the body indeed was that of Bin Laden back at the base took only about 25 minutes of the movie's running time. That raid sequence was done very realistically, in a set that was built to duplicate, as accurately as they knew how, Bin Laden's compound.<br/><br/>All in all an excellent movie. And the BD has a set of interesting extras on different facets of the ""making of"" the movie."
"michaelRokeefe","7","1","4","9 March 2013"," Cold, calculating and crucial.
","This heavily hyped movie is intensely directed by the much acclaimed Kathryn Bigelow, who some claim is presenting a skewed version of recent history. Credit Mark Boal for the screenplay showing the diligent hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Nearly ten years after the Twin Towers went down justice finally prevails as the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 brings an end to the Al-Qaeda leader. The movie finds Maya(Jessica Chastain),a CIA intelligence expert in the middle of uncovering the whereabouts of bin Laden. Make no mistake, Bigelow's Maya is actually a composite of many different analysts and field agents. Graphic depictions of U.S. interrogation techniques ruffle critics, who focus on torture. The last 30 minutes of the movie depicts the raid on bin Laden's compound in May 2011; thus proving Bigelow to be one of the finest of current action sequence directors. Frustration, fear, vengeance and pride of victory can be found in this 157 minute drama deserving much applause. Take it or leave it, ZERO DARK THIRTY is a must see film. Among other cast members: Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Jeremy Strong, Jennifer Ehle, Reda Kateb and Chris Pratt."

Most of the critics seem to want to pan the film because of the torture scenes but I actually think this is a strong point in the movie. There is no bleeding hearted Liberal stepping up to say its wrong as there were none doing it at the time then and there. There is no concession to the moral outrage and nor should there be. This is a ""warts and all"" film about how they killed Bin Laden and in that it is better then most Hollywood movie about war. We see enough condemnation about what is supposedly right and wrong when a nation is fighting a war but in reality war is cruel. So all those bleeding hearted Liberals who condemn the film for its portrayal of torture without the moral outrage I say its about time we got more movies like it... and I am one of those bleeding hearted Liberals. The problem is that the movie is too long, to short on story, overbalanced with an extended battle sequence at the end and overbalanced also with torture scenes. Having watched the movie I left the theatre with no moral outrage, a so-so attitude and wondering whats on next week."

","I came to this movie without the political baggage so commonly seen on these boards-- and with the pragmatic viewpoint that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, and both sides couldn't care less about causing collateral damage. As a neutral, I really enjoyed it...an under-played, no frills, no flag-waving account of how they got their man. I try not to prejudge, but sometimes the evidence is so overwhelming I can't resist. As a story based on actual events, this is streets ahead of Argo, which I'm yet to see but which seems to have fraud written all over it. It's also superior to The Hurt Locker, probably because it gave Bigelow meatier material to work with."
"m-trzcinski","6","1","4","23 February 2013"," Fine, but not worth the hype
","The opening scene of Zero Dark Thirty is absolutely brilliant. The screen flashes the words ""September 11, 2001,"" and then fades to black. All we hear are audio clips from that infamous day: firefighters, screams, panic. All of the pain, anger, and sadness of 9/11 comes back at you full force without any images. Sadly, the rest of the film doesn't live up to the first thirty seconds. Zero Dark Thirty is director Kathryn Bigelow's account of the U.S. government's efforts to kill Osama bin Laden. The first act is pretty audacious, with its unflinching portrayal of the torturing of captured Al-Queda members. The last forty minutes is interesting as well, when we finally get to see American soldiers invade bin Laden's secret compound. But the second act manages to bring the film to a screeching halt as it shows us, in extreme details, the paperwork and governmental procedures involved in taking bin Laden down. I understand that these scenes are all for the sake of accuracy, but that doesn't make them any more compelling. To be honest, the film might have been more enjoyable if the second act was downright fabricated. As a wise man named Jimmy Stewart once said ""If the legend is better than the truth, print the legend!"" I suppose Zero Dark Thirty's real virtue is that despite having a very political story, it never takes sides, so to speak. The film's makers never condone or condemn the killing of Osama bin Laden They simply tell us the facts. Today, that kind of unbiased reporting is unheard of in journalism, much less in the movies. Zero Dark Thirty is currently up for a slew of Oscars none of which it really deserves, especially when compared to contenders, like Argo, Lincoln or Django Unchained. On its own merits, its a decent film but we can only hope that a better film will someday be made about the subject matter. Rating *** out of *****."
"davidgee","8","1","4","8 February 2013"," Documentary flavour - deserves to win awards
","Considering we already know how this story will end, it's amazing how suspenseful Kathryn Bigelow makes it. The assault by US Navy SEALs on the bin Laden compound in the final half-hour is nerve-shredding. This scene - indeed, most of the movie - is shot like a documentary; you feel as if you are eavesdropping on the CIA in 'real time'. None of the characters is given a back story: we are only interested in their role in the war against al-Qaeda.<br/><br/>Apart from some off-duty drinking with her colleagues we only ever see Maya sitting in uncomfortably on interrogations or doggedly sifting through photos and intelligence snippets. But Jessica Chastain is as every bit as mesmerising as Claire Danes in HOMELAND without any of Carrie Matthison's emotional and psychiatric baggage. Chastain - and Bigelow - definitely deserve the awards they've been nominated for.<br/><br/>A few familiar faces from both sides of the Atlantic turn up in supporting roles. Jennifer Ehle is excellent as one of Maya's colleagues. James Gandolfini (looking like J. Edgar Hoover) plays the CIA Director with a PA played by Britain's TV favourite John Barrowman.<br/><br/>2013 has got off to a strong start, cinematically speaking. ZERO DARK THIRTY is the pick of the bunch so far."

","The title is a military term, it means thirty minutes past zero hour i.e. midnight, and it also refers to the darkness and secrecy that shadowed the entire mission that lasted ten years, and I was definitely interested in a dramatisation of what was momentous news, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, The Hurt Locker). Basically the film opens with the sound of the tragic events of 9/11 (11th September 2001), when the Twin Towers were hit by two hijacked planes, and this ignited the search for the most dangerous man in the world, leader of al-Qaeda who orchestrated the terrorist attacks, Osama Bin Laden. In 2003 the search started when young CIA targeting officer Maya (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Jessica Chastain) accompanied fellow officer Dan (Jason Clarke) to numerous interrogations of detainee Ammar (Reda Kateb) who may have links with the Saudi terrorists, and they use torturous methods to get the answers that they want, but he does not give in. Eventually though Ammar is tricked into giving the name ""Abu Ahmed"", the alias of the personal courier for Bin Laden, and other detainees confirm that this man may be passing messages between the leader and Abu Faraj al-Libbi (Yoav Levi), who is captured in mid-2005, sometime after the attacks on London, he too is tortured for answers, his refusal to cooperate implies the importance to conceal the Abu Ahmed. Maya concentrates on trying to find Abu Ahmed, using the various masses of data and information gathered, and forms of technology, hunches and sharing insights, she hopes to use these to capture Bin Laden, this spans through the next five years, and she is in the middle of the 2008 Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing and an attempted car shooting but survives. Dan is reassigned and she warns him that officers who carried out the interrogations may be prosecuted for using torture, and after he has left the 2009 Camp Chapman attack occurs killing her friend and fellow officer Jessica (Jennifer Ehle), and worse comes when the trail may have run cold, with Jordanian detainee claiming he identified Abu Ahmed and buried his body in 2001. Researching Moroccan intelligence archives a fellow analyst suggests to Maya that the real identity of Abu Ahmed is ""Ibrahim Sayeed"", and agreeing this theory she gets in touch with Dan at CIT headquarters, and they find Habib was a brother of Sayeed and had a striking resemblance to Ibrahim and was killed in Afghanistan. Using CIA funding Dan purchases a Lamborghini to persuade a Kuwaiti prince to give him the telephone number for Sayeed's mother, and calling they trace the call, and there is a lot of mention of trade experience and they conclude that Abu Ahmed is the caller, and under Maya's directive with support from supervisors a number of operatives from the CIA are deployed to find Abu Ahmed, and following him in his vehicle they track him to a large urban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The compound is put under heavy surveillance, but there is no proof that Bin Laden is inside, so several months pass until they can confirm this, all the CIA can do is plan to capture or kill the leader when their hunch is proved right. A plan is devised by the team to enter Pakistan using two to secret stealth helicopters flown by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and a U.S. Navy SEAL squad will raid the place, a meeting is held by the CIA Director (James Gandolfini) to assess the 60-80% chance Bin Laden is living there, Maya is there asserting that it is a 100% chance. So on May 2nd 2011, thirty minutes after midnight, the raid is approved, the helicopters proceed to the neighbourhood and land in the compound, there is a complication with one of the helicopters crashing, but no-one is hurt, and as they spread out they kill numerous people within, until eventually they enter the main building and reach the top floor. Among the armed men they kill a particular, and (although we never see his face) and after taking a photograph he may in fact be Osama Bin Laden, his body is taken to the U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan where Maya and the other CIA officers are waiting, and when the body arrives she confirms visually that indeed the corpse is Bin Laden, and in the end she leaves as the only passenger of a military transport, and she is seen quietly weeping. Also starring Joel Edgerton as Patrick - Squadron Team Leader, Mark Strong as George, Kyle Chandler as Joseph Bradley, Édgar Ramírez as Larry from Ground Branch (as Edgar Ramirez), Lost's Harold Perrineau as Jack, Stephen Dillane as National Security Adviser, John Barrowman as Jeremy, Scott Adkins as John, Mark Duplass as Steve and Daniel Lapaine as Tim - Station Chief. Chastain gives a determined performance as the woman who would stop at nothing to capture or on her orders kill the most wanted man, the other members of the cast are good as well, the direction by Bigelow is well paced in the events leading up to the death of the terrorist leader, the torture scenes are a little hard to watch but important to the story, and it is interesting to see how the ending came about, a terrific action thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing (tied with Skyfall), and it was nominated the for Best Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Editing and Original Screenplay, it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"dr-cheyno","6","1","5","2 August 2013"," How accurate is this i wonder?
","I rate this 6 out 10, due to the fact that the movie was pretty well done. The acting was fairly decent and the story was imaginative.<br/><br/>This movie will keep you interested from the very start,right up until the credits. <br/><br/>To be honest thou. I found Zeitgeist the movie to be both more informative and probably accurate. Osama Bin Laden, biggest scapegoat in human history.<br/><br/>Whilst the movie itself is perfect for all the sheep out there. It shows some finality in the fact that the worlds so called biggest ""Terrorist"" is actually dead. After years of hunting him down. <br/><br/>Good fiction movie, worth the watch. But i don't buy into this war for a second. Bush is a crook, just like his old man. The buildings of the world trade center were designed to withstand the impact of up to 5 707's, possibly more.. 3 of the towers were basically demolished. It just so happened to be on the same as the U.S government was participating in a training exercise designed to help them deal with the exact same imminent threat. Making it perfect cover for the so called ""Terrorist planes"" <br/><br/>Sorry, bit off topic here. But, whenever i watch movies like this it just makes me think of the actual facts even more. <br/><br/>Remember, if you want facts & facts only. Watch Zeitgeist the movie. This war has been nothing but a hoax in many of the smartest peoples minds.<br/><br/>Also remember George Bush himself, directly after September 11, he is giving a public speech. Discussing ""The terror & The terrorists"" He says something along the lines of ""Sadam Hussein, I mean.. Osama Bin Laden has no where to hide""<br/><br/>Showing, he always had the thought of invading Iraq before Osama. George Bush junior has to be the worst President/ruler since Hitler.<br/><br/>Fact.<br/><br/>Anyways, watch this movie it has some great action scenes and story, even for a made up one. Nothing against the U.S people, but i honestly believe the nation was hood winked. <br/><br/>Thank god for presidents like Obama."
"lasttimeisaw","8","1","5","13 March 2013"," Unsung Heroes is Bigelow and Boal!
","A tit-for-tat vengeance it ostensibly acclaims, ZERO DARK THIRTY is a gritty, hard-boiled account of our anti-heroine Maya's relentless pursuit of Usama Bin Laden, and the most precious calibre of Kathryn Bigelow's latest film (after her precedent Oscar champion THE HURT LOCKER 2008, 8/10) is it soberly obviates any hyperbole which is attendant with its sensational thematic source. <br/><br/>The film centers closely on Maya's perspective (excludes the last 30-minutes of re-enactment of the actual raid), the camera prowls around her, sifts meticulously her reflexes towards the mires she is engulfed with, meanwhile, Kathryn adopts a much daring path to categorically circumvents Maya's personal life and background foils, which inevitably will cause some unbecoming distance towards its core audience, but it does enhance a tincture of ceremonial sacrifice in her devotion, a fatalism glory in her trials and tribulations which can empathize in any other individual's own track of life. <br/><br/>Standing firmly as an apolitical film fanatic, I could stay unruffled with its vexing ""torture"" controversy because as it is mentioned in the film, ""it is just biology"", the truth lies unscathed here and there no matter how we try to whitewash it, and it is extremely feasible to exert the extreme action under the extreme circumstances, the film really has some guts in not hedge the issue and instead, it emboldens us to question ourselves to face the darkest side of our humanity, Maya's gradual stolidness towards torture could be applied to anyone if facing a similar situation (there are profuse nefarious activities happening everyday everywhere). So a film should not be punished to reveal the "" inconvenient truth"" which slams the hypocrisy of the ruling class, it is foreseeable that not everyone would be happy with the film, but what is the most quintessential conviction is that this sort of film should own its voice and place in the market and earn its appeal. <br/><br/>Kathryn recruited most of her THE HURT LOCKER crew in this film, so the dusty texture, erratic camera-work, superb sound effect and visual blast are viscerally cogent. Jessica Chastain, whose excellency I may not repeat here, but her flair of arresting attention is inscrutably immense, even as plain as simple contemplation, she would blow you away. Her illustrious future is clearly beckoning and Meryl Streep can feel a sense of relief since finally there is someone who can suit her shoes, interestingly, it is the very much underused and under-appreciated actress Jennifer Ehle who resembles a staggering young Meryl Streep countenance in the film, and among a dozen of male ancillary roles, Jason Clarke should be honorably mentioned albeit his screen-time diminution in the latter half of the film does leave his Oscar-chance awry. <br/><br/>The film altogether is more like a phlegmatic rumination of a persistence of what we believe than a panegyric for unsung heroes, it establishes its unyielding stance out of a presumed HOMELAND-esque political thriller pattern, personally it is that kind of film I admire more than I enjoy, and Ms. Bigelow and the screenwriter Mark Boal are the unsung heroes here."
"philhodgman","9","1","5","17 February 2013"," A brilliant documentary style narrative
","I'm mystified by the criticisms of this movie. It's not a movie about ""relationships"" and hence not subject to a lot of character development. Nor is it a fictional action movie, where every plot twist has to be exciting and dramatic. It is a documentary style narrative - with some poetic license - outlining the main events which led to locating and killing Bin Laden.<br/><br/>I found the movie both realistic and compelling. Though I suspect the main character, Maya, played flawlessly by Jessica Chastain, is a composite of a number of characters, revolving the main plot sequences around her brings a sense of unity to the movie as well as putting a human face on it. And there is in fact subtle character development, mostly in Maya's developing relationships with her CIA chief, and with her cohorts, Dan and Jessica. Without giving the plot away, the story line involving Jessica has a particular and lasting impact on Maya.<br/><br/>The raid scene is so realistic, I still don't know how they did it. Obviously, there are actual shots from the air of the compound mixed in with an incredibly authentic set. The raid takes longer than one would think, with the time line shorter, increasing the sense of dramatic urgency.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie where, at the end, you feel like kissing both Maya and the American soil, while chanting U.S.A."
"jtindahouse","8","1","5","16 February 2013"," Fascinating insight
","Zero Dark Thirty was originally supposed to be about the unsuccessful decade-long manhunt for Osama Bin Laden. That would've been OK. But on May 2 2011, when the world was celebrating, I can guarantee the filmmakers of Zero Dark Thirty were celebrating twice as hard. They'd just had their film completely rewritten in the space of half an hour. Now with a much more satisfying synopsis and a subject the world would be fascinated to see a re-enactment of, they were onto something special. The film is basically a two hour build-up to the main event, the assassination of Osama Bin Laden. But it's also more than that. There's some intriguing insight given into what went down over the course of ten years and it has caused a lot of controversy, but no one can deny that it's a very well made film.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow is making a big name for herself in Hollywood these days. Her last film was 2008's Academy Award's Best Picture winner 'The Hurt Locker' and now she's followed it up with another Best Picture nominated film. There's nothing feminine about her directing style. It's just as hard-hitting, and at times brutal, as any male director in Hollywood and occasionally even more so. The torture scenes in Zero Dark Thirty, while not taken too far, are realistic and effective. They serve their purpose well. If Bigelow can follow this up with a third success in a row then her name might just start to be mentioned alongside the greats. I'm sure a lot of people will be keeping a close eye on what she chooses to explore next.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain has been nominated for another Best Actress award this year at the Oscars for Zero Dark Thirty and is even in contention to win the award. I didn't think she was anything on the likes of Emmanuelle Riva personally, but I do think she's in golden form at the moment (much like Bigelow) and it won't be long before she wins herself a much deserved Oscar. As far as liking the film goes I'd suggest it's about as simple as this: if the concept of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden interests you, you'll like the film. If it doesn't, you won't. It was a touch long for my liking and I feel it could've had 15 minutes shaved off it to appeal to an ever wider audience who might not have the patience of others. Overall though an effective, engaging and fascinating piece of cinema."

The opening torture scene, the interrogation scene , bomb blast during dinner at the hotel , the suicide bombing and the climax scene where they finally hunt down Laden will surely have profound affect shocking you instantly.

"sacrosanct84","9","1","5","16 February 2013"," A masterpiece by a perfectionist!!
","Sometimes a movie should be watched without too much emphasis on the authenticity of the facts. Zero Dark Thirty is an attempt to showcase (even though it may not be entirely true) the biggest manhunt in history. Director Bigelow does more than justice to a impeccable script by keeping it as close to reality as she can. Maya (Chastain) has been spectacular in the entire movie, be it the initial timid looking fresh recruit or the bold and dynamic agent taking on superiors in making decisions that are though to have a consensus upon. The rest of the star cast have been outstanding too. Some may complain that the movie is slow or could have been shorter, but I believe, the scenes have been so meticulously shot that one can feel the plethora of emotions each character is going through. The movie's editing is perfect and the background score adds on to its intensity. Overall, Zero Dark Thirty is masterpiece and a perfect follow up to The Hurt Locker. Well done Bigelow!!!"
"goultar1","8","1","5","2 February 2013"," Who is this Jessica Chastain, anyway!?
","Any movie about killing Bin Laden has got to be a very good movie, and this one did not disappoint. Great technical work, great dialog. When the character Dan said ""Let me be honest with you.

I have never seen or heard a better actress. She is not great-- she is elite. Put her in the same category as Anthony Hopkins and Charlton Heston. I have never HEARD anyone deliver a line better or be more believable. I have seen her now in two roles, and she aced both of them. An Oscar guarantee, and I would say the best actress EVER.

"rparham","7","1","5","29 January 2013"," A strong fact-based thriller
","With the success of 2008's Iraq war drama The Hurt Locker under their belts, it shouldn't have been tremendously surprising that director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal would chose to make a film chronicling the decade long search for Osama Bin Laden that culminated in his death at the hands of Navy Seals in May of 2011. The resulting production, Zero Dark Thirty, is a strong, at times involving, story of obsession and the, at times, monotonous and detail oriented search for Bin Laden that largely revolves around a single, dedicated individual.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty begins with audio clips of the assault on the Twin Towers of September 11, 2001 and then jumps forward a few years later, where we see the rough interrogation techniques being applied by the CIA to Al Qaeda members to attempt to glean the location of Bin Laden. The early scenes largely focus on fresh CIA analyst Maya (Jessica Chastain) and Dan (Jason Clarke) a more grizzled veteran of relentless torture of the various detainees. The two of them, overseen by the Pakistan chief Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler), utilize a wide variety of approaches to break the men down, getting various references to a shadowy courier of information for Bin Laden, Abu Ahmed. As the years stretch on, various incidents of bombings, including one in London, another in Pakistan, and a devastating attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan, lead the various CIA superiors to begin questioning the search for Bin Laden, but Maya, who has devoted her every waking moment to the hunt, refuses to give in. When a happenstance of information crosses her attention, she is able to eventually determine, with the help of a military operative, Larry (Edgar Ramirez), what she believes is the location of Bin Laden at a heavily fortified compound in Pakistan. She must then convince the CIA that Bin Laden is there so they can move forward with a plan to take him out.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a film that is driven almost exclusively by plot, recounting the various major events of the years since 2001 to the eventual raid on Bin Laden's compound in 2011. Various characters come and go in the course of the story, but few are given much of an opportunity to grow beyond the technical dialogue they are given to recite. The exception, for the most part, is Jessica Chastain's Maya. We still learn very little about her beyond a few details here and there, but some of that is one of the film's central points: Maya has allowed herself to be all consumed by the search for Bin Laden that she has let it subsume the rest of her life. In one scene, a co-worker of Maya asks her about her friends and a boyfriend, and she cannot respond in the positive to either question. What character driven aspects there are to Zero Dark Thirty are almost exclusively derived from Maya's story.<br/><br/>The early scenes of Zero Dark Thirty can prove a bit disorienting to watch at times. The filmmakers throw a lot of acronyms, technical jargon and half explained dialogue at the audience, and it is up to us to try and see if we can keep up. On the one hand, I appreciate the filmmaker's willingness to not dumb down the material to keep it extra accessible for the general movie-going public, but on the other hand, by constantly trying to scratch out some semblance of what is going on, the film does lose of some of it's draw. Eventually, the details begin to coalesce into a story you can generally follow, but at times it feels like we are one step behind the details being unspooled on the screen. <br/><br/>Some have criticized Zero Dark Thirty's depiction of torture by the CIA operatives on the various Al Qaeda members, and it even seems to take a neutral stance on the use of those techniques. Many of the torture scenes are harrowing to watch, as human beings are treated as animals by the agents trying to glean information from their prisoners. Zero Dark Thirty isn't a meditation on the ethics and morality of the use of torture, however, it is simply telling a story of what happened, and the filmmakers choose not to shy away from the darker aspects of that hunt.<br/><br/>Bigelow and Boal do an exceptional job of building suspense at key moments in the film. More than once, the film will jump to a specific moment in time to correspond to a particular event that occurred over the course of the last 10 years, and the build of tension until a seemingly unavoidable moment of violence unfolds is effective and palpable. Other moments are without warning, as the films forward momentum is suddenly punctuated by an unexpected jolt. Both techniques work well and keep you riveted and involved in the film. The only time this fails to deliver is a late action scene involving Maya outside her home in Pakistan as the film careens towards a rather expected development. It doesn't rob it of power, but it still seems more and more certain before it arrives.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty's cornerstone is the final raid on the Bin Laden compound. It unfolds without music, in a very matter of fact fashion, lacking the sensationalism of most thrillers or action films. Zero Dark Thirty lives up to its perception of being true to events as they happened. Nevertheless, this sequence provides an at times moving climax as the events of the previous two hours finally lead to a resolution.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty isn't perfect, its early scenes can prove disorienting, and the film's lack of emotional depth can keep us at arm's lengths to the proceedings on the screen at times, but nonetheless, it is an effective thriller that delivers an at times powerful tale of one woman's unwavering dedication to complete her mission, moving all obstacles in her path."
"caseymoviemania","9","1","5","26 January 2013"," Casey's Movie Mania: ZERO DARK THIRTY (2012)
","Back in 2009, director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal made a low-budget Iraqi War thriller about military bomb squad called THE HURT LOCKER -- a little movie that nobody would have thought that it subsequently gained a lot of critics' attention and eventually surprised its way to the Oscar to win the Best Picture and Best Director awards. No doubt the movie was technically well-made, with a breakout performance by then-unknown Jeremy Renner. But personally, I thought the overall movie was overrated and didn't exactly deserved all the big awards recognition. Three years later, Bigelow and Boal returns for another military-themed drama, and this time they worked with a bigger canvas called ZERO DARK THIRTY -- an intense procedural drama about the decade-long manhunt of Osama bin Laden, the notorious al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 9/11 attack. This is a meticulously-detailed motion picture unlike anything Bigelow has done before -- meaning her signature trademark of slow-motion montage is nowhere to be seen. It's a radical departure from her usual filmmaking style, which might alienated her die-hard fans but rest assured that ZERO DARK THIRTY is a mesmerizing and near-perfect cinematic experience ever made for a movie that is heavy on dialogue and light on action.<br/><br/>Before a single image is shown, the movie opens with a brief, yet chilling prologue where actual voice recordings are heard from 9/11 victims seeking help while stranded in the World Trade Center. Then the movie jumps two years later at an undisclosed Black Site and we are introduced to a young CIA analyst Maya (Jessica Chastain) who is experiencing her first military interrogation between no-nonsense partner Dan (Jason Clarke) and an al-Qaeda member (Reda Kateb). Throughout the interrogation process, Dan threatened, humiliated and waterboarded the al-Qaeda member in hope to obtain vital information. It took Dan and his fellow officers several times to torture him in various ways possible until he finally gives in and mention out a name -- Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. As it turns out, the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti is a so-called courier working for Osama bin Laden. Using him as the next jumping point to further out for the investigation, Maya and her team goes all out to locate his whereabouts on a decade-long wild goose chase filled with false leads, near-death experience, dangerous setbacks and eventually -- an unexpected breakthrough where bin Laden's secret compound is found and then raided on May 2, 2011.<br/><br/>At the time of this writing, ZERO DARK THIRTY had recently won Jessica Chastain the Best Actress Golden Globe award and secured 5 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Screenplay (until now, I still couldn't get over the fact that Bigelow herself got snubbed for Best Director nomination). The movie is also not without its fair share of controversy -- acting CIA director Michael Morell has issued a statement that the movie ""is a dramatization and is not historically accurate"" and clarified that the torture method used in the movie is said to be false.<br/><br/>Whether the movie is historically accurate or not, one couldn't deny the fact that ZERO DARK THIRTY remains a compelling piece of work. Bigelow's direction is particularly masterful, while Boal's well-calculated screenplay is top-notch that the movie's 157-minute running time feels like a breeze. That kind of achievements are worth noting for, considering Bigelow is mostly known for her visual rather than narrative style. And yet, she manages to defy all odds to accomplish something different so well from her usual norm.<br/><br/>The acting ensemble are first-rate, but it was Jessica Chastain who truly steals the show. As the relentless CIA analyst Maya who refuses to quit in order to track down bin Laden's hideout, she certainly gives a ferociously enthusiastic performance here. This is her finest role so far. Supporting roles, including Jason Clarke and especially Jennifer Ehle who plays Maya's colleague, Jessica -- are all equally captivating as well.<br/><br/>No doubt Bigelow and her team has succeeded on keeping the viewers glued to their seats with one engaging scenario after another, while clever enough not to leave any excess baggage for subplots or unnecessary characters acted as fillers.<br/><br/>And then comes the crucial third-act in the final raid scene. Technically speaking, the re-construction of the raid on bin Laden's compound is meticulously researched while Bigelow's choice of hand-held camera, naturalistic lighting and impeccable sound design truly evokes ""you-are-there""-kind of cinematic realism. However, the supposedly exciting raid scene turns out to be strangely anticlimactic. Perhaps it's that slight misguided direction by Bigelow who made the scene rather too clinical for its own good.<br/><br/>The final scene is what preventing the movie from achieving a five-star rating. Minor flaw aside, ZERO DARK THIRTY is one of the best movies ever made in 2012."
"sptmaster","7","1","5","25 January 2013"," The Manhunt for UBL with a Feminist twist...
","First off, I'd like to state that I saw this movie with no expectations.. When I saw the Hurt Locker I didn't really think much of it considering I had high expectations for a movie that won best picture (looking back, its really not a bad movie).<br/><br/>Anyways to the point. The film almost entirely focuses on Maya from start to finish -- with the exception of the 45 minute raid on UBL compound. The first half of the movie focuses a lot on the detainees, whom Maya and Jason Clarke's character spend a lot of time interrogating. In the beginning Clarke's character takes the lead on the interrogations, but for reasons unexplained they cut him out, so his female counterpart can take the lead. Now the torture itself wasn't very realistic -- none of the torture that they portrayed on screen (or even off screen), seemed believable. You hardly even see the CIA hit any of the detainees. I've seen more real and believable torture scenes out of PG13 movies. I'm not saying its enjoyable to watch, because even if they're terrorists I don't see how anyone could truly enjoy watching it, but it has to be believable if you're looking for the film to hold credibility.<br/><br/>One other thing that hurt this film's believability was Jennifer Ehle's character Jessica. Midway through the movie they think that they got ""lucky"" with a Jordanian doctor, and that hes going to spill inside secrets to them. Jessica forces the base commander to let their suspicious vehicle all the way inside the base without being checked at the checkpoints. Meanwhile she and Maya are IMing each other back and forth on their phones about the meeting like giggly teenagers. Oh yep, totally believable. After Jessica's character gets blown to bits, all I could think was, ""Good riddance."" Anyways on to the GOOD. The 45 minute UBL Compound raid was definitely the highlight of the movie. Very well shot (the lighting was phenomenal), and it definitely has you on the edge of your seat. The interactions with the troops and the civilians of the compound seemed very realistic, and having watched the History Channel special on the raid, they did not deviate from the actual events that occurred.<br/><br/>Overall it was an enjoyable movie, however I think they over-personified Maya to bring feminism into the movie. I think it would have been a lot better if they involved more people in the intelligence gathering/planning of the raid for this film, because by the end you feel like she is the only person in the CIA who actually works on this project, when in reality there was a VERY large team of people! 6/10"

","Phenomenal film about the CIA's hunt for 9-11 mastermind Bin Laden who murdered 3,000 innocent people in the World Trade Center attacks.<br/><br/>This movie is an absolute masterpiece.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012) is a truly amazing motion picture. From start till end, it's as good as movies can be. I won't lie, first time watching it i was a bit confused during the first part of the story. until they kinda found one particularly interesting house, and from that point, i was simply blown away. The second time i saw this movie couple of days later, to simply catch what i missed - i enjoyed this movie even more. The acting is amazing. Kathryn Bigelow once again did an incredible job of creating this real world, not overwritten, not overacted but as true as it is. I don't know how this film is true to events that really happened, but i believe they were mostly true to what is shown in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving 10/10 for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" - it's unforgettable motion picture, if you like these kind of pictures - it's surely not for everyone, but if you enjoy not popcorn movies - this gem if definitely for you."
"Mario64","10","1","6","28 December 2013"," Possibly the finest achievement of the decade.
","Three years after Kathryn Bigelow, after a relatively quiet few-decade-long film directing career, really showed what she was capable of with the Iraq war masterpiece The Hurt Locker, she comes with a movie far more ambitious, and also quite a bit more controversial, about the decade long search for Osama Bin Laden starting from 9/11, called Zero Dark Thirty. It absolutely lives up to, if not surpasses, her previous Oscar winning effort.<br/><br/>Bigelow's passion for this subject is in just about every shot, with immense detail, cold bluntness, and enough humanity to keep it from being too oppressing. Actually for a two and a half hour film it's quite efficient filmmaking, jam-packed with numerous interrogations and investigation tactics (the torture stuff that has garnered controversy is only a very small part of that) shaking real life terrorist attacks, and political wrangling, yet it's never confused or disjointed. Even towards the end with the recreations of the raid on the compound in Pakistan done very deliberately, the pacing is never betrayed, maintaining consistent movement and direction; it's a scene that plays out as much mystery as suspense as the seal team goes from room to room blowing out locked doors and not knowing for certain if the main target is there.<br/><br/>The movie's structure, with one main character, Maya a member of the CIA played brilliantly by Jessica Chastain, taking a part in virtually every aspect of this manhunt, with other people revolving in their various tasks around her, was the perfect choice. If one person really did have this much impact on the manhunt we'll probably never know for sure, but in this film it's played out believably and compellingly, and though no one can match her neither is anyone else insignificant to how it plays out. Characters with only a few scenes have noticeable impacts. But with Maya is the emotion, determination, the sassiness and intelligence of a woman who evolves in nuanced but never uninteresting ways.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is an incredible achievement, and in my mind candidate for best film made so far this decade. It has brought about an important debate, but more significantly it covers ten years of the war on terror in prime fashion. Bigelow plays for high realism but she also knows how to create great drama by stretching but never breaking those confines. Every scene belongs for a purpose and never does it feel like one is missing; that in itself is an incredible achievement. Credit her, the cast, and, not to forget, the great script by Mark Boal."

","Good movie for the clinical depiction of event but as usual with Hollywood, another terrible movie which defend torture and lawless actions as acts of bravery in the long scheme of events. <br/><br/>Hard to understand why torturing and cold clinical killing are signs of a civilized modern nation which often call itself the ""free world""... When you use the same dirty and above the laws tactics than you adversaries, you are not better than them, you become them! <br/><br/>Fact is killing OBL was a COWARDLY act, not an act of bravery. When you kill the suspect when you can easily take him alive in custody, it's murder, plain and simple. It's an act that shows the world that you are in fact what you hunt, nothing better than the terrorists themselves, and certainly not acivilized nation governed by fair laws. We all know why Obama and its advisers have chosen the cowboy's way: Because putting OBL alive on trial would have opened a terrible can of worms for the previous administration and the entire lawless system build upon 911 aftermath.<br/><br/>That is where bravery should have come from however. Taking the risk to bring him back alive and let us understand the man behind 911... a much better closure for the families who lost their beloved.<br/><br/>It was also funny how the US CIA guy in the movie is depicting the 3000 live lost when the USA killed more than hundred of thousands in retaliation during two illegal wars.

"estebangonzalez10","9","1","6","24 January 2013"," Bigelow and Boal know their War movies
","¨I'm going to smoke everyone involved in the op and then I'm going to kill Osama bin Laden.¨<br/><br/>The passion, determination, and single-minded pursuit of a female CIA operative to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden was the film that the Academy Award winning writer and director decided to pursue after their success in The Hurt Locker. Zero Dark Thirty is so intense and suspenseful that you just want Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal to continue working together forever. They make other modern war films look really bad when held up to the standards of their recent work together. Bigelow has developed such a craft and expertise as a filmmaker that during some moments of the film (especially the final 25 minute raid) you feel like you are watching a documentary of actual footage of the manhunt instead of a fictional film. She is as passionate about her work as her lead character is obsessed with hunting down this man. We can't argue that Bigelow benefits from Boal's extraordinary script, which manages to reduce a decade long hunt into 150 minutes of detailed procedural work without taking political sides or focusing on revenge nonsense. It just takes such a realist approach that you never feel manipulated by Bigelow which would have been easy to do considering the subject matter. This is in my opinion the best film dealing with pos 9-11 events thanks to Bigelow's ability to remain emotionally detached and focus on her craft. Under the weight of the heavy subject matter, she somehow manages to make this film more about a character study than an actual manhunt. There is really one main character in this film as the rest of characters come and go, and without delving into her past and focusing on the decade long pursuit of bin Laden the story centers around her, and it is a very interesting psychological study of what motivates her. Jessica Chastain is just so fascinating in this film, that she single handedly carries this movie and gives the best performance of her career.<br/><br/>The film opens in black with several voiceovers of calls from the World Trade center during the 9-11 attacks. It is a very emotional opening scene as we later are introduced to the main character, Maya (Jessica Chastain), who has been sent to Pakistan by the CIA to hunt down bin Laden. The first place we see her is in an interrogation room where her partner Dan (Jason Clarke) is torturing a terrorist prisoner in order to find information of the whereabouts of bin Laden. Maya isn't amused by the torture that is going on and doesn't participate, but she is willing to accept any means necessary in order to unlock the truth and hunt down the man she's obsessed with finding. Of all the prisoners they have interrogated there seems to be one man that is mentioned by everyone: Abu Ahmed. Maya is convinced that this man is bin Laden's personal courier and that if she can locate him then she will locate his leader. Her boss, Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler) isn't convinced about this theory, but Maya is determined to pursue this lead. The entire film is a very detailed procedural drama of how Maya follows one lead after another (with several false and disappointing leads along the way) until she is able to locate the whereabouts of bin Laden. Her next mission is to convince the authorities that bin Laden is actually hidden in that complex without having definite proof, but her certainty ends up convincing the leaders to send the US Navy SEALS team led by Patrick (Joel Edgerton) to attack the compound and kill bin Laden.<br/><br/>There were a great amount of talented actors cast in this film such as James Gandolfini, Mark Strong, Edgar Ramirez, Mark Duplass, Frank Grillo, and Chris Platt, but they had very few scenes and the entire film centered on Jessica Chastain. She deserves an Oscar for her performance here, and Mark Boal deserves one for Best Screenplay. The entire film is a character study on Maya as her entire life revolves around catching this man. We see it in her eyes from the very opening scene to the very end where instead of experiencing joy for the success she had, all we can see is a sigh of relief. What comes next for Maya? She doesn't even know as she was so focused and determined on one thing only. I love Bigelow's style and how she downsizes the entire war and centers everything on one central character. Just like she did in The Hurt Locker where the focus is on Renner's character and how the adrenaline of war has become an addiction for him; now the focus is on Chastain who is very driven and obsessed with accomplishing her goal. There is not anything else on her mind; it's as if she lives for one specific purpose. In the end you don't know if you should cheer for her or feel sorry that her work is done. In a way I felt Bigelow's approach to the events that led to bin Laden's death to be very powerful; and it has raised a lot of discussions about torture, but that is exactly what a great film should do: bring up conversations and make us question things at times. After a decade long manhunt, was it really a triumph to kill bin Laden? Was it worth a celebration? Does the end justify the means? Without taking sides Bigelow makes us think about these issues and that is what good movies do for the viewers. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"smcbrides","6","1","6","22 January 2013"," it could have been so much better.
","Zero Dark Thirty is a film that has too much of a political feel to it. It has all the right players and some very revealing information, but its not a masterpiece by any means. Kathryn Bigelow is a fine director, but it seems she gets away from just making a movie about heroes and instead turns it into a movie that makes you leave with questions about our government and conspiracy, left wing versus right wing politics, which if that is what she intended, she did a very good job. Zero Dark Thirty could've been so much better than it is, but I give Bigelow and Boal credit for diving into this project and taking a chance. I like this film, but its not a Best Picture winner. There has been talk of a prequel, and if that is the case then lets just hope that it moves away from politics like her previous film (The Hurt Locker) and focuses more on the characters."
"mjr5215","5","1","6","18 January 2013"," Poorly Portrayed by the TV Trailer
","This is not an action movie. The trailer that you saw on TV was so deceiving that I actually checked my ticket in the theater just to make sure I was in the correct movie. Think office scenes, meetings, and one action scene that you have already seen in the trailer. This is almost as bad as Drive with Ryan Gosling. If you have seen Drive, go back and watch the official TV trailer. You'll basically see every single action scene throughout the entire movie, then all of the slow parts will be cut out. I'm not saying that Zero Dark is a bad movie, I'm simply saying that it should not have been represented by the trailer as it was. They made it look like an action movie about the team that took out Bin Laden, and they literally only have a few minutes about them in there. Even in the trailer that I just saw before writing this review on this page, they show the team prepping to go on the mission. Simply very poor representation of the movie that you are about to see."
"stephenrtod","6","1","6","14 January 2013"," Not a True Believer
","Jessica Chastain is an excellent actress, but she is not a True Believer, which is what Maya must be, in reality. In ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" Chastain gives the role her best shot. During the course of the movie, she does manage to work herself up to an obsessive-compulsive fury for the cause of pursuing and killing Osama bin Laden, but it is almost like watching Tiger Woods miss a putt.<br/><br/>The willingness to die for her cause, blind faith and total allegiance, held together by the glue of hatred - these qualities propel the woman of words, the woman of action and the fanatic together. That combination is probably not very entertaining. It is probably very ugly, very off-putting to the judges at Cannes, the Golden Globe, the Academy Awards. To portray the real Maya, Chastain would have had to capture and project the sort of maniacal fury that her acting counterpart in ""Coriolanus,"" Ralphe Finnes, projected. That wasn't pretty because it was raw ruthlessness, pure savagery, what the CIA calls termination with extreme prejudice.<br/><br/>I thought the first two hours of this film did a good job of depicting in almost mind-numbing detail, the realities of the bureaucratic labyrinth: the carping and the back-biting, the colliding egos and the rampant ambition, the governmental anti-terror organization operatives continually bumping into each other in an effort to reconcile political correctness with justice or retribution. I almost walked out of the theater several times, but I made myself stay put and watch, because I had to know how the entire movie unfolded.<br/><br/>Mark Savage and James Gandalfini projected far more knowing weariness, stamina, cynicism, real-world wariness and Machiavellian caginess than the other actors; and the movie began to interest me about the last 45 minutes of the film. That is where it began for me.<br/><br/>The rest of this movie was not taut, not gripping, not shocking, not convincing. There was way too much slack in the movie. I would have edited it so that it held the audience's interest like a Wallenda high over Niagara Falls on a slender wire.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I didn't learn anything new either about the pursuit, capture and assassination of bin Laden. Feelings are not facts, but the latter are important especially on the stage and screen. Actors are professional pretenders, and Gandolfini and Strong do more acting, grabbing my attention more than the other performers, with their eyes, their facial expressions, with gestures, commanding the very space about them, and the silence and the stillness. Such gifted performers do not even require language in order to act. I saw some of that power in Chastain when she began using her erasable marker on the window of her boss's office, but I never saw the person who would give up 12 years of her life to pursue, doggedly, irrationally, like some sort of female Inspector Javert, that illusive target.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, but I expected more tension, more suspense, more intense character development. I was disappointed."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","7","14 January 2013"," A tense and gritty procedural telling of the world's greatest manhunt
","As Americans, we had never been so fixated on killing a single individual as we were Osama bin Laden, the brain behind Al Qaeda and dubbed architect of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" the story of this 10-year manhunt, leaves out that social and political narrative, opting instead to capture the CIA's operation to find and kill bin Laden from a purely procedural perspective.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's tense yet human-focused style translates right over from their Oscar-winning effort ""The Hurt Locker"" to this film, which could find itself with a similar amount of accolades — if it doesn't drown in controversy first.<br/><br/>Its depiction of torture scenes toward the beginning aside, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" conveys the CIA and main character Maya's (Jessica Chastain) fixation on doing whatever it took to find bin Laden. It never stops to ask why, opting to use its opening minutes to play 9-1-1 calls from Sep. 11 over a black screen and get at our emotions rather than our rationale. It's an effective technique, though the engrossing espionage plot blots out any emotional elements to the film until the very end.<br/><br/>The factually ambiguous Maya is an intriguing creation. She evolves very gradually over the film's lengthy run time from a woman whom we presume to be in over her head to the only person with the stones to do what it takes to succeed. It's as though Boal and Bigelow wanted to play with our assumptions about what a pretty redhead is or isn't capable of and then ratchet her character up into this fiercely strong female character who can't be labeled a dominatrix. Chastain brilliantly plays it very cool for much of the film and only turns up the dial in rhythm with the height of the stakes.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" puts you in the trenches with the CIA in the way that Boal writes his script, as compared to ""Argo,"" which plays a tad more to the audience by explaining scenarios clearer and being especially wry. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" offers a handful of laughs, but it's grittier and much more procedural in nature. Unlike fictional thrillers involving the CIA and other secret operations, it does not glamorize any part of the process and the script refuses to wedge exciting action sequences into the film to break up the pacing to appease viewers with shorter attention spans.<br/><br/>We don't get a whole lot more than plot, so Chastain and actors Jason Clarke, Jennifer Ehle, Joel Edgerton, Kyle Chandler and Chris Pratt have to find openings to deliver character-telling moments to keep everyone human. Chastain puts on a straight face, but you sense her emotional roller coaster throughout. The others don't get as many opportunities, but Bigelow has this incredible gift to turn them into more than guys wearing suits or military fatigues.<br/><br/>Bigelow constantly keeps her movie interesting and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" boasts exceptional editing. It's easy to tell when something bad is going to happen because the tone of the film shifts so drastically, but the payoff of these climactic moments is always satisfying. The final scene, the raid on the compound where bin Laden was found is completely silent and utterly captivating, proving the how is as much if not more important than the end result (considering we all know what it is).<br/><br/>Much has been made about the film's stance on torture, namely it depicts enhanced interrogation techniques and pivotal to the discovery of the information that ultimately led to bin Laden's location. The graphic nature of these scenes will definitely be a matter of taste, but as to whether the movie glorifies torture — that's stickier territory. It definitely suggests a certain degree of necessity in using harsh tactics in order for the CIA to get the information it needed, which is an issue of fact vs. Hollywood dramatization, but it doesn't by any means milk the torture scenes for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>If I had to guess, Boal and Bigelow wanted to convey how even the most horrific tactics were utilized to achieve the end goal of finding bin Laden, that there was a certain desperation and not much consideration for the ethics. The film takes nary a moment to consider the moral question of interrogation techniques, predominantly because it's not a film about whether torture in this situation is ethical. It doesn't depict characters relishing in torture, but characters who feel as though they have no other choice.<br/><br/>""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a black ops thriller without the glitz of fancy technology, chase sequences in exotic locations and highly skilled super spies. It captures the steadfast effort of the CIA and the chances it took in order to even be in the position to attempt an operation on the bin Laden compound. It takes dramatic liberties to be sure, but it relies on just great filmmaking technique to rivet and captivate.<br/><br/>With such a timely subject and being the center of so much controversy (beyond the torture and also into how much the government cooperates with Hollywood), ""Zero Dark Thirty"" opts not to make any statements, political, thematic or otherwise. It consequently lacks the other facets we attribute to great movies, but what it does well it executes in consummate fashion.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","If not for Jessica Chastain's character ""Maya"", this film could easily qualify as a documentary. Chastain's character, reportedly an amalgam of a number of individuals who worked the Bin Laden file at the CIA over the 10 years since the 11 September 2001 attacks, provides the narrative focus for the film. She is the eyes through which we see Bush's ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and the dubious manner in which they supply information to the Forces of Light. We see one interrogator's tenuous ties with humanity, which finally wins out (though his monkeys, no less). We see the chronology of al Quada's attacks on the west and the way in which they affect Maya and the CIA (and remind us of the effects on US!).<br/><br/>Much has been made of the torture depicted in this film. People should see it dramatized realistically, as this ""enhanced interrogation"" were the techniques employed by Americans' own government, with complicit help from many Western countries, including my Canada (Google Mayar Ahrar). This is our 'moral' legacy of 10 (now 12) years of war against the 'evil doers'. It is also testament to what Obama changed when he came to the White House, and the change of focus and methodology that the CIA ultimately brought to bear to finally locate Bin Laden. <br/><br/>Indeed, many documentary films and TV programmes utilize re-enacted vignettes to dramatize the history they proport to tell. Kathryn Bigelow reshot the ending to this film after Bin Laden's death at the hands of SEAL Team 6 on 1 May 2011. I wonder what the original ending looks like? Unlike many so-called 'dramas', which are nothing more the overacted 'gun plays' (the new name for a genre?), this is history as it should be dramatized: believable characters believably acted, real events, and an absolutely wonderful recreation of the Abottabad raid. <br/><br/>While the climax raid is graphic, it is remarkably sanitized compared to something like ""Django Unchained"". Consequently, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" reminds us of what real violence, in any form looks like, and the terror it invokes upon the givers and receivers of such violence. It is worth remembering the number if women and children who were present in Bin Laden's compound when the raid took place. It was nice to see the degree of care the SEALs took to ensure minimal ""collateral damage"" during the raid. <br/><br/>It is also nice to see the maturity and growth that Katheryn Bigelow has experienced since her years between directing ""Point Break"", ""Strange Days"", and this film. The only other comparator that comes to my mind is Spielberg's ""Munich""- Bigelow is the superior director in the historical realism stakes, as she knows that in portraying real people, ""less"" is certainly more...... <br/><br/>I can't recommend this film enough."
"thegreatshonen","8","1","7","14 January 2013"," Intense war thriller
","My title sucks for this review but I've got not much else to title this. Zero Dark Thirty is probably the best war film since full metal jacket. It's a realistic view on how America achieved its greatest military victory in years by killing Bin Ladin. <br/><br/>Oh Yeah Spoiler Alert: They Kill Bin Ladin. If you haven't heard that then you've been living under the earths core because it was said 20 million times around the political season. This film is pretty intense from the start. It starts with a torture sequence of a suspected terrorist in Pakistan. A lot of things have been said about the scenes but I'll say this. It's how it happened people. Whether you like it or not, America tortured terrorist for information and is film accurately portrays it. Same with the scenes showing the actual mission. it's incredibly realistic. It's leads the film to have a climatic/anti-climatic feel while feeling satisfying to you. Jessica Chastain puts up an awesome performance but before the approval of the mission can be kind of annoying but nevertheless memorable. The cinematography was also excellent to the film and reminds me of the mid 80's war film in the style and realism while still feeling like a modern day way such as her previous film, The Hurt Locker(2009). The score was nothing impressive at all but its not suppose to be. probably why the left out the music for the final scenes. Spoiler: The ending of the film maybe the best moment when you see her sitting in the military plane alone, crying, and from what I gather that her life has no more purpose as this was what she was dedicated to doing for maybe over 8 years. <br/><br/>I feel this is the best film of the year in a year of movies above any in recent memory. If I could give this an 8.75 I would. It's incredibly close to being a masterpiece and something to be inconsideration with the Great War films like Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line and the Deer Hunter. Sadly it lacked something in it to put it below these other films whether its artistic vision, stylist realism, memorable lines or characters. I still feel its good movie and accurately depicts the modern day terrorism war, much like Traffic (2000) depicted the US war on Drugs. Overall great movie but short of being in my opinion a masterpiece (most of the films I call masterpieces are films rated 9/10 and above, 10/10 being almost perfection with maybe 1 very small flaw.). <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"drew_atreides","7","1","7","14 January 2013"," Good film, not a great. Yet I can't stop thinking about it....
","So i must confess that I feel the same way about ""Zero Dark Thirty"" as i did about ""THE HURT LOCKER"". <br/><br/>Both are good films that are competently made, but they both seem to be lacking that character-investment factor that REALLY elevates a good movie to a great one. Outside of Jessica Chastain's character (which, you can't deny, is a terrific performance and a great role-model for independent women!) there is NO one else in this movie that you can connect with. No other character is developed in any way. Like when the Seal Team shows up. They show up and you are almost immediately thrown into an action sequence where we are expected to care about these people, but we have NO connection to them whatsoever. <br/><br/>All that being said, my initial reaction to the film was underwhelming. Not surprised, really, as after her previous film i went into this one expecting to be underwhelmed, and Ms. Bigelow didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>And yet.....I find that 3 days after i saw the movie i am still thinking about it. I am still coming on these boards and discussing it. <br/><br/>So maybe its' a better movie then i give it credit for.<br/><br/>There are some silly moments, to be sure (one attack in particular is presented with some very glaring issues of stupidity), but overall it is a good film. <br/><br/>Not the best of the year by any stretch, but it is pretty good."
"StevePulaski","7","1","7","13 January 2013"," Important, yet heavy, meandering, and somewhat vacuous
","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty derives its title from clever spy language meaning half past an unspecified time after midnight, or the time when Seal Team Six finally killed known terrorist and Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. The film she has made only devotes about twenty-five minutes to that time period, which is a wise choice from her standpoint and screenwriter Mark Boal's. The remaining two hours leading up to that shows how the CIA finally got there, after numerous leads, little evidence, and a brave woman who went against their original ideas.<br/><br/>A large majority of the CIA believed that Osama Bin Laden was hiding in a remote cave, some miles away from the cities of Pakistan, and was sick and ailing. After a ten year manhunt, we finally found him, hiding in a large, heavily-walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not far away from a military college. And now we have a film glorifying and boasting our efforts. I was off-put by this idea, despite my positivity towards Bigelow and Boal's previous effort, The Hurt Locker. The whole concept seemed to be rather narcissistic and overly patriotic on the United States' part.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film actually has a brain in its head and substance in mind. The story's shell is kept simple, yet the interworkings are much to complex and to keep things safe, I'll do some oversimplifying. We open with a collection of 911 calls from that faithful day twelve years ago that, I believe, needs no introduction. We cut to scenes set at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, where Maya, played by the wonderful Jessica Chastain, accompanies Dan (Jason Clarke) during ""enhanced interrogations,"" basically meaning that they involve tortuous methods. All the torture and endless questions are attempting to lead up to the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, and as the film goes on, we see how Maya climbs the social ladder of the CIA, to even going boldly against the word of the top representatives (Joel Edgerton) about where exactly he is hiding. After spotting a shady, plain white compound in the middle of Pakistan, with black windows and no third male living in a house with various females, Maya is 100% convinced that Bin Laden is residing in that large area, while the CIA clings to their idea that he is out in some cave in the middle of nowhere. They pragmatically believe that if not Bin Laden living there it is someone who clearly is evading the law, like a drug dealer.<br/><br/>The film works around this plot for about one-hundred and twenty five minutes, leaving the last act to center around the raid of the compound that has the outcome everyone is aware of. Bigelow still maintains the ability to surprise her audience in some sequences, mainly the Marriott Hotel bombing and the Camp Chapman attack. She concocts this very uncertain atmosphere in many of the instances when two characters meet to discuss a detail or an operation that works in the film's favor. The CIA dialog we are presented with is hit and miss. Some scenes, involving Maya talking with the analyst Steve (Mark Duplass, one of my favorite actors working today) are captured with the driest of wit, while others, show Maya desperately convincing several people in the organization she is right through polite conversation or shouting matches, become a tad overbearing and plod along with heavy jargon and a meandering focus.<br/><br/>The the grand difference between Zero Dark Thirty and Bigelow's Oscar winning Hurt Locker is the unfocused narrative. The Hurt Locker was about the deteriorating sanity of an Iraqi war veteran shown in a deep, intimate character study through a sensitive lens, which won me and a lot of others over. Zero Dark Thirty bears more weight and spans the course of a decade, making for a lot more material and a lot more events that Bigelow and Boal clearly struggle to capture. This causes some events to be more interesting and others to be only mildly amusing.<br/><br/>Much has been made about the fact that this film depicts instances of torture from a seemingly slanted perspective The torture sequences aren't much to blow out of proportions but the fact that they are close to what really happens. I'm not sure this film is partisan in any regard, and while it subtly states the reason why we knew where Bin Laden was located was because of a message obtained through waterboarding, another scene shows its occasional ineffectiveness by having a man scream various days when asked about when a bombing will take placed. It's a very original, even-handed approach. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a film I'd still call important for its deep depiction of one of the largest manhunts in history, yet to call it a masterwork or even hold it up on a pedestal as one of the greatest espionage films of all time is strictly an overstatement. The film is tricky, informative, and occasionally entertaining, yet it's heavy, meandering, and shortchanging in the regards of characters. This can become a difficult thing to tolerate when the whole film is watching characters interact with others when morally just decisions are on the line or soon being proposed.<br/><br/>Read the more complete review at http://stevethemovieman.proboards.com"

","This is perhaps the first review I've written on IMDb for a movie. With all the controversy, people should understand that this movie is as important to movies of this decade as The Wire is to TV shows. I'm sure I will be re-watching The Wire 10 or 20 years from now. Similarly, I am sure that people will re-watch Zero Dark Thirty to understand the hunt for Bin Laden. This movie is better than The Wire in one important way because ZDT brings up many questions without giving clear answers (OTOH, Wire is obviously liberal leaning).<br/><br/>I thought the movie was appropriately paced. We get a good sense of the noise (and occasional personal danger) that the CIA analysts had to penetrate through and how difficult this task is. The opening shot forebodes this movie well: you see Maya flinch a little at the horror of what she's witnessing in the opening scene but she steels herself to continue on. In the midst of the hunt, no one stops to discuss morality. The final scene when Maya finally shows some human emotion, we feel compelled to ask, ""Was it worth it?"""

","It is hoped that all decent, moral, patriotic Americans will view this superb film. Boal and Bigelow have performed an important service to this nation. They accurately depict the cowardly, lice-ridden terrorists viciously perpetrating the mass slaughter of innocent, helpless human beings in the name of their despicable pagan idol al'la. And they show the only sensible way to deal with such subhuman vermin, succinctly encapsulated in the warning, ""You lie to me; I hurt you."" The film is long, 157 minutes, but anyone who loves America would have gladly sat for another hour or two watching the unclean, feral Muslim beasts getting the treatment they and their kind deserve from America's stalwart national security officials. A minor flaw was the implication that our nation's funds are spent too freely for intelligence purposes. Example: a black-ops agent spends $240,000 of U.S. taxpayers' hard-earned money to bribe a vile terrorist for information he could readily have obtained merely by ice-picking one of the nasty, diseased beast's eyes. Nevertheless, a genuinely worthwhile creative motion picture."

","As the hunt for Osama bin Laden wore on President George W Bush was prompted in frustration to say that he didn't know where bin Laden was and he didn't give him much thought anymore. Far from Washington press conferences CIA agents were still thinking about the al Qaeda leader and engaged in the day to day drudgery that dominates intelligence work. ZERO DARK THIRTY is the story of one such agent, Maya (Jessica Chastain)a woman of dogged determination who's prone to butt heads with higher-ups inclined to weigh the politics of every decision. When we first see Maya she is functioning within an interrogation unit trying to extract information from suspected terrorists. These scenes shot in Jordanian prisons are intensely realistic and the source of most of the criticism the film has received. Director Kathryn Bigelow is not an advocate for torture. She is simply painting the picture as it occurred. Her approach is documentarian and she and screenwriter Mark Boal meticulously and clinically depict the events of one of history's greatest manhunts. Chastain exhibits great strength and vulnerability in her role. She is a warrior on the front lines in this 21st century war. Political and ethical questions are for another day, her task is clear. I love the way ZERO DARK THIRTY doesn't' try to be Rambo, in fact it's the anti-Rambo which may be disturbing to moviegoers who want to see some heroic national crusade portrayed gloriously with all flags flying. There's a sadness here, a sense that we have made a trade-off one which diminishes us all. As a movie Bigelow, Boal and Chastain have created an unceasingly suspenseful film as historical document which held me in its grip."

","A chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.<br/><br/>If you look through the message boards on IMDb, you will find accusations of ""jingoism"" and ""American propaganda"" concerning this film. Now, I did not read through the arguments made by these individuals, so maybe they had some valid points. But nowhere in the film did I think this was a propaganda attempt to make America look great. Few people are as critical of American foreign policy as I am (at least in this country), and what I saw was a general presentation of the facts. Agree or disagree with the tactics and methods, but this was probably more or less what actually happened.<br/><br/>This film was nominated by the Academy for Best Picture, Best Actress (Jessica Chastain) and Best Original Screenplay. Let us explore these nominations briefly.<br/><br/>As far as the Best Picture is concerned, I think the nomination is fair, as this is an epic film and well-made. This could easily made anyone's ""top ten of 2012"" list, so I will not argue against the nomination. However, I find it highly unlikely it will win. (Actually, I am still unclear how ""Hurt Locker"" won.) The picture is great, but not flawless. My biggest issue is actually a personal complaint -- the casting of Chris Pratt. Seeing him only as Andy from ""Parks and Recreation"", I found it hard to take him seriously as the leader of Seal Team Six.<br/><br/>Moving on to Jessica Chastain, it pains me to say that she does not deserve this nomination. Chastain is an exceptional actress and has made a name for herself over the last few years, going from unknown to A-list in record time thanks to roles in ""Tree of Life"" and ""Take Shelter"", among others. But this was not an ideal role for her. Every time she cussed, I cringed inside. Some people cuss naturally and some do not -- Chastain does not, and it made it hard for me to believe she was this person. In general, she hardly seemed the part. An intelligent spy, sure... but she seemed so out of place during the ""heavy"" scenes.<br/><br/>Now that I have been critical, I feel ready to heap some praise. And that comes with the Best Original Screenplay. Not only was this clearly deserving of the nomination, but it probably has a solid chance of winning. The script was dense, detailed, covered a wide range of places and people. The research that went into such a script is immeasurable. This attention to detail allows the film to work on two levels, too. The general audience (ignorant of world affairs) can see it as a hunt for bin Laden. Those who are more aware of the situation will be able to take in terms like ISI, KSM and various other factoids that the characters spout in reckless abandon. There really is a narrative here, despite the film being called plot less by many (including the Great Ebert).<br/><br/>This is not a feel good movie, and it is not the kind of film that I will probably watch a second time. And heck, it might give the false impression that killing Osama bin Laden actually stops terror, which is a terrible mistake. Yet, it is a well-made picture and worth seeing. I fully endorse it."

","This film is a fictionalized account of the ten-year hunt to kill Osama bin Laden.<br/><br/>This film has a strong edge to it. Much of its grit is in the deliberate deglamourization of the settings. They often look bleak yet considering the real-life locales, it would have been superficial to make them more attractive as is often done in similar films.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow does a great job in doing the nearly impossible - something Ben Affleck also did with ""Argo"" - that is to create a feeling of tension and suspense even when the audience already knows the final outcome. As the film is more than two and a half hours, this is not an easy task.<br/><br/>The film begins to lag a bit in the midway point. However, during the last half hour, the grand event shows the build-up was well worth it. The darkness of the photography in the night-time operation creates a very unique impact.

The background score adds power to the seriousness and covertness to the entire operation. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is simply splendid, just like her previous academy award-winning venture 'Hurt Locker'. Jessica Chastain carries out the role of the CIA operative with the right mix of subtleness and conviction to nail her target, an enemy who has been elusive to the world for more than a decade. The climax operation in the dark was the high point of the entire buildup and the suspense doesn't disappoint even a bit even when one is aware of the eventual end.<br/><br/>A highly recommended movie as a patient-watch, with some pieces of good action here and there but brilliant cinematography & direction all throughout the film."

","Maya, a tenacious CIA agent (Jessica Chastain) searches for world's most wanted man: Osama Bin Laden, against the background of terrorist attacks against Western targets. Director Kathryn Bigelow does a masterful job of blending tension and action with the sometimes tedious processes of data analysis and surveillance (the film compresses eight years of searching for the 9-11 mastermind into 160 minutes). Chastain is excellent as the driven analyst and the film wisely wastes no time on her life outside the search (i.e. no gratuitous romance, personal affairs, etc). The rest of the cast is also quite good, especially Jennifer Ehle as Maya's colleague Jessica. The lengthy climatic set-piece, as the special-ops team move in on bin Laden's compound near Abbottabad, Pakistan is outstanding. The film was controversial for its depiction of torture (aka 'enhanced interrogation techniques') as an effective 'necessary evil' in the 'war on terrorism'. 'Ends vs. means' arguments aside, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a riveting adventure with some great action sequences, but I admit that I have a very non-PC love for films like this and that some people might find the film repugnant (especially the first half-hour)."

","I've generally liked Kathryn Bigelow's movies. 'Point Break' was exhilarating, 'Near Dark' refreshing in its edginess and originality, and 'The Hurt Locker' grippingly tense. I heard good things about 'Zero Dark Thirty' and was disappointed. The movie felt like a tired retread of Ridley Scott's 'Body of Lies'. Both are political thrillers that examine America's War on Terror and how the politicians, soldiers and special agents go too far, or have their hands tied when they should go farther. But whereas 'Body of Lies' was thrilling and had great characters, 'Zero Dark Thirty' was meandering and had weak characterization.<br/><br/>I have to say that I'm no expert on the subject of counter-terrorism and at points I had trouble following the plot, namely what was up with Kyle Chandler's character.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was probably the intense operation at bin Laden's house at night, but the sequence felt very disjointed from the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>By the end I was left wondering what the movie was trying to say - what was the point. Was Jessica Chastain's character relieved that it was over? Was she happy with herself? It seems that the movie might have benefited from waiting a couple years before making it, letting the subject matter cool down a bit so that the film-makers could've examined it with more freedom of expression."
"cdjh-81125","7","0","1","15 January 2017"," Solid But Some What Overrated
","Zero Dark Thirty was a film that I has heard quite a lot about, I'd heard people saying that it deserved Best Picture and was one of the greatest films of the century and I have to say that I agree with neither but still think this is still a solid film that offers real insight into the shocking methods taken to assassination Osmaa Bin Laden. Immediately my favourite thing about this movie was Jessica Chastain's performance, she was amazing in this film she started out as a real amateur who struggled with the methods she was forced to take in order to achieve her mission to a bold person willing to do anything to real her goal no matter the personal cost. Jason Clarke was really good in this film, he perfectly carried a few very disturbing scenes and really pulled off his experience and comfort in his methods. Another thing I really loved about this film was how realistic and gritty it was, there's no action in this film that feels like a film but more life like this is mostly due to Kathryn Bigelows direction. In her last film, The Hurt Locker, some of her techniques didn't work and pulled me out of the experience but she does away with a lot of that in this film and gives us real intensity, stakes and consequences. This film is hard to watch at times mainly due to the brutally disturbing torture scenes but it's admirable they chose to show the whole picture and not just make the Americans out as the good guys. The final sequence in this film which depicts the assassination of Bin Laden in technical terms was done perfectly, the lighting was fantastic as it made it feel more realistic, the action was gritty and intense, it was done really well and didn't feel out of place as it could have given as the actual events happened during the filming of the movie. However there are in my opinion so glaring issues with this film, mainly it's the massive lack of character development in the supporting characters, Chastian is developed perfectly and we understand her motivations but no one else gets that treatment so when terrible things happens to them the effects are lessened. Like I said technically the assassination is done perfectly but in some ways it wasn't particularly satisfying, his death is completely glossed over in a second and it actually took me a second to realise it has happened. <br/><br/>In my opinion, compared to Argo, that deserved Best Picture but despite the fact that I'll probably never go back and watch this film again I thought it was a really interesting watch, Jessica Chastain was amazing in the film, its very realistic and gritty, it offers some real insight into the steps taken to kill Bin Laden despite some character development issues I found this to be much better than The Hurt Locker and would recommend it to anyone interested in real life drama. <br/><br/>7.9/10: B+ (Solid)"

","This is the true story of the decade-long hunt for Al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L.s in May 2011. I am not a fan of this type of movie, and I regard Zero Dark Thirty is the same 'type' of movie as 'Argo'; both involve CIA sponsored special assignments in hostile territory, one involving a rescue and the other involving a capture. Unfortunately Argo succeeded, where Zero Dark Thirty fell utterly flat. By the time these gallant American forces were traipsing through Bin Laden's compound in almost total darkness, I for one had lost all interest in the eventual outcome – and in any case I already knew exactly what happened.<br/><br/>I can certainly see why the so-called 'establishment' and even the White House are not too happy about the amount torture scenes in the movie. I happen to be in the school of thought that just maybe in very extreme circumstances, a degree of psychological torture, which could include the use of water, may be justified. However, I was frankly shocked at the amount footage devoted to some pretty brutal torture scenes at the start of the movie. I have no idea how accurate this was, but to have something approaching 30 minutes of torture footage seemed to be overdoing it a bit, and it really wasn't very entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie then jumped somewhat disjointedly through the next decade, with our gallant heroine almost single-handedly and doggedly pursuing the trail to Bin laden with just about everyone else around her writing her off as a bit of a crackpot. Whether this is accurate or whether the writers used a degree of poetic licence to make the story more interesting, I couldn't say, and I don't really care. No matter how hard the filmmakers tried, I just couldn't invest any excitement in the whole process. We knew all knew where it would end and nothing happened to capture our interest or imagination in the meantime. Most, if not all the characters were 'one dimensional' caricatures; either Islamic terrorists or cynical, hard-bitten CIA operatives. I read somewhere that the popular TV terrorist series 'Homeland' was akin to a pathetic comic book when compared to the exciting action in Zero Dark Thirty. I beg to differ. Homeland is an exciting action movie with characters you can relate to and believe in. It is vastly to superior to Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>OK, Zero Dark Thirty is a true story, so that makes it more difficult to invent exciting plot twists, but that doesn't prevent the producers from doing much better with what they had – after all what could be a better story than the capture and killing of one of the most horrific and reviled terrorist leaders the world has ever known? As for character development – Zero dark zero. The writer would have done well to study the character of 'Carrie', the heroine in Homeland as a template for their fleshing out of Maya, the heroine of Zero Dark Thirty. Jessica Chastain did the best she could with the material available, but if sitting alone in a huge cargo plane after she had completed her assignment was supposed to move us all to tears, then she and director Bigelow had better think again. The only member of the cast who came shining though the dross was James Gandolfini in a cameo role as the CIA Director.<br/><br/>As the long movie plodded to its grim anti-climax, my wife went to watch the news on another TV. She was lucky - the closing scenes were the worst of all. It was so dark and shadowy that most of the time you couldn't work out what in God's name was going on. They kept running around the compound, mumbling inaudibly, occasionally blowing open doors and even more occasionally killing someone. We were given no clues as to part of the compound they were in or how far away they were from where Bin Laden was located, or who were the people being killed. After about ten minutes of all this confusing shooting and mumbling in the dark, we no longer cared.<br/><br/>We saw women screaming and kids being shepherded into bedrooms, but we didn't know who they were and we still didn't know where Bin Laden was. Finally a man whose face was off camera was somehow dragged to the ground and shot. We never saw his face, only the very bottom part of his beard and we never saw any of the real action that we know took place, as the Americans took great pride in telling it all to the world, immediately after they shot him. On the other hand we saw in the grimmest and most microscopic detail the torture of detained terrorists and also the blowing up and shooting of innocent people, including CIA operatives by the jihadists.<br/><br/>So we could see 'our side' being blown up and see all the wicked tortures in graphic detail but only dark, shadowy 'suggestions' of the last moments on Earth of Bin Laden. We didn't see his burial at sea and neither did we see Obama and his cabinet colleagues watching from the Whitehouse. I really hope they managed to get a better view of what took place than we the people did in this pathetic apology of a movie. I reiterate that I am not a particular fan of this type of movie genre, but even so, I thought that Director Kathryn Bigelow's 2008 movie 'Hurt Locker' was a good, highly watchable movie with well- drawn characters and deserved its best movie Oscar. In my humble opinion she really needs to go back to the drawing board and get her game together, as Zero Dark Thirty falls seriously short of what she previously achieved with Hurt Locker. I am aware that not many will agree with me."

We have learned from Seymour Hersh that the official story probably is a lie, but that was not known when the movie was made.<br/><br/>There are two major problems with the movie. First, it is much too long. It should be 30 or even 45 minutes shorter. It drags a lot. Second, the heroine is not believable. She is recruited into the CIA out of high school (ridiculous right there) and spends the next 10 years of her career trying to track bin Laden. She finds him! She, her limited range of experience, knows better than everyone else who is telling the truth and who isn't and what leads to follow. She has so much pluck that she yells at her superiors and gets away with it. Everyone is in awe of her. Come on. What's with Hollywood? The script writers seem to be lost in the 1960s mindset that young people are smarter, more knowledgeable, and wiser than their elders. They are the only ones who really know what is going on. And of course nowadays they often are women. At least they didn't make this one Hispanic (there are no other ethnic groups in the US, you know).<br/><br/>Despite the foregoing criticisms and others well explained by many negative reviewers, I found the show engaging and enjoyed watching it. The general story of how the CIA found bin Laden is interesting. Though it's not fully accurate (see Seymour Hersh, London Review of Books, 21 May 2015, for an alternate account with much supporting evidence), it is accurate enough to be interesting."
"Sylviastel","8","0","1","12 August 2015"," Based on Actual Events!
","Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow has delivered a great dramatic film. Based on actual events, the film shows the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Jessica Chastain is a perfect choice for Maya. Chastain is a brilliant actress and worth watching for. She reminds me of a young Katharine Hepburn with red hair. Bigelow does a great job in building for an exciting climax. I felt the ending was abrupt like what happened to everybody. The film can be slow at times especially the first hour. The film recreated the compound true to the actual one. I watched the film in French but understood it without subtitles. The supporting cast are first rate with James Gandolfini as the CIA director. Chastain's Maya is relentless and determined to find and kill Bin Laden known as UBL. It is nice to see a female character like Maya in a very masculine film. Jennifer Ehle plays Jessica, a fellow CIA agent. Maya and Jessica are strong, intelligent females equaled to their male agents. It is nice to see women not portrayed as vulnerable, weak and incomplete without a man and baby in their lives. The film is as truthful and faithful to the story."

","Kathryn Bigelow is certainly one of the most meticulous filmmakers in history ... and she does not take sides, but leaves judgment to the viewer ... this movies depicts that the CIA and Al Khaida in essence share exactly the same moral values - that is to say none at all Jessica Chastain is absolutely superb as the truly despicable fanatic CIA Agent desperate for success ... I find violence against women lower than low, but this Maya could actually make me change my mind ... the rest of the cast is on par as well .... the movie has some flaws as to the accuracy of the country settings, but all in all is certainly very recommendable"

","How's this for a great idea for a film ? It's a thriller but it's not any thriller . It's a true life thriller but it's not any true life thriller . It's a true life thriller featuring the hunt for Osama Bin Laden ! Wow what a great idea and the cherry on top is that it's written by an Oscar winning screenwriter and directed by an Oscar winning director . And yet despite all this ZERO DARK THIRTY is never the compelling true life thriller it could have been <br/><br/>The problem lies mainly in the directing . I guess Kathryn Bigelow is trying for a fly on the wall cinema verite type of style . We as the audience are put in to the action as spectators in much the same way as the CIA characters are spectators finding it more and more difficult to influence events and becoming frustrated by it . The detached manner does make for a strangely unengaging film despite the subject matter . It's also about an hour too long and would have made a much better movie if it clocked in almost two hours rather than three . I know it's not the fault of Mark Boal but when I heard the constant references of ""Bin Laden meeting Farage"" I had surreal visions of the leader of Al Qaeda popping down the pub having a few drinks with the leader of The United Kingdom Independence Party <br/><br/>Where the film does deserve some acclaim is that it doesn't sugar-coat the fact that the CIA isn't some group of happy clappy vicars and shows the moral ambiguity of having to break the law in order to stop international crime and to bring criminals to justice along with the suggestion that if someone is poor and they know something they get waterboarded while if they're rich and know something they get a new sports car ! I also liked that the fact we had a film directed by a woman with a female lead protagonist was tracking down the leader of an organisation who want to take humanity in general and the female half especially back to a medieval dark age . But despite this ZERO DARK THIRTY is never the heart pounding true life thriller it should have been"
"iKickstand","8","0","1","16 March 2015"," Great searching-for-someone thriller. Especially picks up during last hour
","I read that the original script was written about the decade long search and failed manhunt of Osama Bin Laden but was completely re- written months before filming began once American forces had found and killed him. In hindsight, this is really lucky because I felt the film really picked up pace once the Pakistan fortress was introduced and especially during the half hour long night raid. Jessica Chastain gives another great performance as the strong and smart CIA operative who's ten year work was the backbone of finally hunting down the worlds most wanted man. Other roles are played well enough but it really rests on Chastain's shoulders. The movie was released at the perfect time following the true events that took place. I'm glad that they didn't release this a year earlier or I feel it would have felt unfinished ala Zodiac."

","Spoiler policy doesn't apply here since we all know the basic story and how it is going to end... unless one has been hibernating for decades?<br/><br/>The merit of this movie is the way the story develops and the way the actors do their stuff. <br/><br/>Maya, (Jessica Chastain) is there from start to finish and becomes so real. We can feel her doubts, her frustrations and achievements. It is a fine performance.<br/><br/>They (US intelligence) are primarily going after Bin Laden. They have a wall covered with photos of his associates, but they all look much the same - Arabic features and big black beards. So, when a detainee (aka a prisoner held without trial) points to one photo and says ""he is dead and I helped bury him"", the trail seems to have been lost. But then we learn that he has brothers and their mother lives in Kuwait - a place where money can buy anything. For the price of a fancy car, her phone and the phone company is hacked. <br/><br/>Now the spooks can trace all incoming calls from her sons. But it takes some very fancy technology which may, or may not, be real - it doesn't really matter nor spoil the story. The son, who is known, or believed to be the primary courier for Bin Laden (who won't personally go near any phone nor any normal communication method) is also very careful, never uses fixed phones, always moves around a lot, and doesn't even speak to Mum often.<br/><br/>Maya reminds us of the time it is taking by noting the days as they pass on the window of the bosses office. Fortunately for the hunters, the quarry drives a very distinctive vehicle, so they hire dozens of locals to sit around in the streets and tell them when the vehicle passes. And so they see him going to a fortress. Is it Bin Laden's?<br/><br/>More fancy technology from satellites and drones help build a picture, but they are still not sure... possibly... probably? And then, should they simply bomb it flat? No, better to go in and make sure they really have got the right guy.<br/><br/>The actual raid is a bit hard to follow, well, it was dark (Zero Dark Thirty refers to the time of the raid, 0030). There is some green night-vision footage but it is a all a bit of a blur. Perhaps they could have shown us the Navy Seals doing a daytime rehearsal at Area 51 (which I'm sure did happen), but we get the general idea.<br/><br/>A realistic re-enactment of history. Well done Bigelow and all the cast and crew."
"cherold","7","0","1","21 February 2015"," engrossing, entertaining propaganda
","I saw this movie in a rather strange form. I watched the first hour, but by the end of that my girlfriend was so freaked out by all the very convincing torture scenes and general sense of gritty violence that she couldn't watch anymore. A year later, she decided it was time to watch the rest. Oddly enough, it turns out by the time she had stopped, the torture was over.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie has at least three distinct parts, an early section devoted to interrogation, then a section devoted to analysis and lobbying Washington, and then an infiltration section.<br/><br/>The first section is gritty and well done, but it's also where all the controversy lies. The movie takes the position that torture is how we got our actionable intelligence, something a later congressional report suggested was not true. The movie hues very closely to how the military wants this mission to be portrayed, from its effective interrogation to its brilliant analysis to its artful infiltration. <br/><br/>Of course, lots of movies portray torture as magically effective, even though historically, torture is anything but. The problem is, this movie claims historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's an interesting movie, especially the final section, which goes against pretty much everything you'll see in a typical war movie. The soldiers are methodical, gunplay is over almost before it begins, and the body count is kept to a minimum. It feels very realistic and completely devoid of Hollywood flash.<br/><br/>While well made and engrossing, I never found this movie as thrilling as the critics did. It is a good movie, but I wouldn't call it a must-see movie, even if I didn't have issues with its politics."
"AndyWakes","7","0","1","6 January 2015"," Competent and important, but not great
","While much has been made of the depictions of water-boarding in the film that supposedly ""condone torture,"" this film has no political agenda. Depicting torture unflinchingly certainly doesn't amount to an endorsement. However, the film is unevenly paced, overlong and lacking in character development. While I respect the choice to depict ""enhanced interrogation"" (torture) so viscerally, it takes up far too much screen time in the early going and is not great film making. The rest of the film boils down the hunt for Bin Laden to the persistence of one woman who works for the CIA (known simply as ""Maya""). What should have made the film more affecting and personal ultimately weakens it since we never can relate to this under- written character (or any others, really) despite a career best performance from Jessica Chastain. While the film has some terrific set pieces (the real time depiction of the raid itself justifies a viewing) and individual performances (the late great James Gandolfini also has a great role as former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta), the end result is a bit underwhelming considering all of the hype. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a competent and important film, but not a great one."
"vijitkothari1","8","0","2","22 December 2014"," Katherine Bigelow gives another masterpiece.
","Just awesome, awesome.....wonderful I can say for this movie. Katherine is a great and a fearless director who is not afraid to tread the path less trodden. The story in the movie has been amazingly told, trying to keep it as real as possible. Giving a real life experience is always difficult to be told in a captivating manner but we have got to say that Katherine knows this art. Some other movies of this kind according to me are K-19 by Katherine and Zodiac and these both were box office failures in spite of being great movies, the reason was just obvious the movies intended to show the story in as realistic way as possible and may be audience didn't find it interesting. It disappoints me to see that Zero Dark Thirty didn't garner much box office success but it does not take the respect for the movie away from me. Also its length it has been made on a very modest budget and it no where seems show that, instead appears to be a top class movie from every screen shot. Great acting by all actors, great direction. Though the plot is difficult to understand in the middle because there are too many names the characters exchanging without telling much about them and the audience starts wondering here and there often. But then again I would say that you are not used to watching such movies. They are to be watched in a different manner and require a little bit more of concentration and focus, which is what I think the audience might have refused to put for close to 3 hours. It is just that movies of this genre are made very less. These movies have intense plots are dialog driven and have strong characterization and have a lot of sub plots also. But for the movie buffs I would recommend this as a must watch. If you watch it with a little respect for the director, the movie and the genre you will like the movie a lot and will begin to ultimately like this genre."

","The name Osama Bin Laden didn't mean anything to most people before two hijacked aircraft brought down the twin towers of the World Trade Center on the Eleventh of September 2001; soon afterwards everybody knew his name and he was the most wanted man in the world: this is the story of how he was tracked down and ultimately killed.<br/><br/>We are introduced to protagonist Maya Lambert as she attends the brutal interrogation of a prisoner at a secret site in Pakistan. He doesn't talk during these sessions but is later tricked into giving the nom de guerre of the man working as a courier for Bin Laden. This name is corroborated by other sources and then the hunt is on to find out the man's true name and ultimately locate him. He is eventually found in a secure house in Pakistan. Surveillance indicates there are two other men there; one who never goes out, never talks to anybody who doesn't live in the house and never shows his face where it could be seen Maya is convinced that this third man is Bin Laden. Months pass before the raid is given the go-ahead and there can't be many people who don't know how it ended.<br/><br/>While most people will know how this story began and how it ends it is interesting to learn what happened in between. Director Kathryn Bigelow brings a no-nonsense approach to the film which actually serve to keep the tension high more than once moments of sudden dramatic action occur without and cues that something is going to happen. It also means that the film shows things in a surprisingly neutral manner; I suspect some people will see the opening scenes as showing people 'doing what had to be done' and others will see it as showing the evil of torture. At two and a half hours the film isn't rushed but at no time did I find myself growing bored. The whole cast put in a solid performance but it is Jessica Chastain, as Maya, who really stands out. Overall I found this to be a gripping thriller and certainly recommend watching it at least once."
"Clockwork_Orange55","9","0","3","8 July 2014"," ""Kathryn Bigelow has done it again.""
","Kathryn Bigelow has done it again. After giving us the top notch The Hurt Locker, she headed her way for Zero Dark Thirty. This picture follows a story on the organized search of 'The world's most dangerous man' - Osama bin Laden. Everyone knows on the outcome of the story, but Bigelow has made it complex and her touch for details is unquestionably excellent. Zero Dark Thirty is easily one of the finest movies of 2012, having received wide critical acclaim and was nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture.<br/><br/>The film stars Jessica Chastain as the young CIA officer, Maya. Chastain is utterly effective as Maya - her angelic skin and sharp features have made Maya to be one of the most memorable female characters in cinematic history and her work for the project have brought her performance up to be Oscar worthy and terrific.<br/><br/>Chastain is excellent, but I personally believe that the real star of the movie is Kathryn Bigelow. So much stories lie in her direction, a daunting effort that put the film to be tight and thoughtful, Bigelow's work is so focused and raw here, and the final thirty minutes of the movie is just as good as unforgettable.<br/><br/>Bigelow's interpretation for Maya is yet another story entirely. True that Chastain played Maya extremely well, but Bigelow is the person who is responsible for the greatness of the character. A young, wild and beautiful character is a product of her work, and Maya placed herself as a great 'character-study' product.<br/><br/>My final assertions for the film would be that the movie is superbly acted and well scripted. Zero Dark Thirty features a tight and gripping experience and Bigelow is not a filmmaker to be messed with.<br/><br/>Score: 3/4 (Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","1","6 June 2014"," 'Zero Dark Thirty' is non-fiction like you've never seen!
","When Osama Bin Laden was killed many people reacted with joy. That's the way I reacted after viewing this film. 'Zero Dark Thirty' takes you behind the real-life mission of the manhunt for Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, the man responsible for the tragic 9/11 attacks. Jessica Chastain plays Maya, a desk warrior who's life mission was finding Bin Laden. Chastain shows the mental torture Maya faces due to frustration, stress, and fear of finding this monster. She delivers a very good performance. What's interesting about Zero Dark Thirty is that Maya isn't the only character who is primarily shown. In the scene when Bin Laden is killed, we get lots of screen time before and during the attack with the navy seals who executed him. We see other terrorists being investigating, see other events that led to killing of Bin Laden, and see the damage he created. The films opens brilliantly with old 9/11 calls to remind the audience how evil Bin Laden was. Katherine Bigelow does a fine job of directing by capturing the stressful lead up of the mission and not just having the film focus on Osama's death. And boy when his death comes, you won't know what hit you. Even knowing what happens before the film, you will be completely shocked during his death scene. Bigelow shoots it in the eyes of the navy seals perfectly, adding infrared vision in the shot. This film was edited superbly to make the film extremely intense and provocative. The screenplay by Mark Boal was well-done due to showing the story in a detailed way and by giving the film a complex plot that wasn't all about killing Bin Laden. Many non-fiction films are good at just showing how it happened and doing it exactly as you think it happened. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is eye-opening, thrilling, exciting and shows you just how hard it was to protect the American people from a dangerous man, and to seek vengeance for those who lost their lives due to the war on terror."

","Zero Dark Thirty is an incredible piece of art that has the gift of very good storytelling. Whatever people may say, but this is not political propaganda. Sure this is a political story, but it's not propaganda. It's thrilling, intense, and very realistic. The film is set up in two parts and the first part is nearly perfect, but the second part, while still good, is a little murky and confusing.<br/><br/>Katheryn Bigelow, who directs her first film since the Hurt Locker, directs the film that is based off of actual events. Since 9/11, America has been on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. After all the hard work put in by a government operative named Maya, she believes they may have found Bin Laden at long last.<br/><br/>The acting is incredibly good. Jessica Chastain pulls of her role as Maya very well. She is reluctant when it comes to torture, but believes it is good for the common cause. Jason Clarke does a good job as Dan. I also wish there was more screen time for Joel Edgerton as he's a really good actor.<br/><br/>Overall, Zero Dark Thirty is an intense film that is made to entertain, to thrill. It has no political agenda on it's mind. This film is an big improvement on the Hurt Locker, which I'm relieved. This film has some incredible technical work at play such as the sound effects and such. Overall, a very good film thanks to the apt direction of Bigelow and a gifted actress in Chastain who uses her talent very well. I rate this film 9/10."
"infernalaffairs1980","9","0","2","5 May 2014"," Another Bigelow Triumph
","So, I realise I'm late to the party in regards to this film but better late than never, right?<br/><br/>On the surface of it, you can be forgiven for automatically comparing Zero Dark Thirty to Bigelow's other 'war' film, The Hurt Locker; you could be forgiven but you would be entirely wrong! The two films are completely different yet both are equally compelling, just for contrasting reasons.<br/><br/>The movie starts with audio only; calls between victims and the emergency services during the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. It's heartbreaking and horrifying without actually showing you anything. From here we jump two years and we are introduced to Jessica Chastain's character, Maya. Bigelow and writer, Mark Boal, give the audience a strong female character; a single minded woman who stops at nothing until she gets what she wants. Chastain's portrayal is a marvel; from her first 'interrogation' to the final moments, Maya's growth as a character, in strength and resolve, is utterly convincing. The only downside is that the audience never gets beneath the surface. Bigelow sacrifices who Maya is for what she does. However Jessica Chastain is so powerful in her role that the viewer will follow her story anyway without question.<br/><br/>The death of Bin Laden is almost always told as the story of the brave men who stormed his compound, yet we don't get to meet this group until two hours into the film. This film isn't about these people, it's about what went on behind the scenes to allow such a mission to take place; the many layers of bureaucracy and years of research Maya and company endure just to get a meeting with the Director of the C.I.A (played by James Gandolfini).<br/><br/>Some of the torture scenes make for uncomfortable viewing no matter what your opinion of it's usage. Bigelow pulls no punches in her direction and creates a visually beautiful film amid harsh environments. The final half hour of the film, the storming of Bin Laden's refuge which is shot almost in real time, is fascinating as the director switches between night vision goggles and the drab natural light of the compound, drawing the audience in and creating a tense final scene (despite the fact that we all know the ending of this story)."
"pfgpowell-1","3","0","4","23 March 2014"," Die Hard with a feisty CIA heroine - don't forget the popcorn and Coke
","Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty is very much like the food we see in ads, it looks the part, but that's about as close as it we comes to being food. In advertising food photography, white paint doubles up as double cream and dishes are lavished with dry ice to appear steamingly hot for the brief tenths of a second when the photo is taken. This film looks the part, but otherwise . . .<br/><br/>Some might think that 9/11 and the hunt for the baddie who was ultimately responsible is - I've heard it said - the most important event of the 21st century. Well, quite apart from the fact that the century still has another 76 years to go, chalk that up to US hooey. And, from where I stand, also chalk up to US hooey that they are 'the good guys' and that anyone who is not on their side and whistles the same patriotic tunes, is thus agin them and by definition 'a bad guy'.<br/><br/>To be fair in a nation of close on 300 million there are plenty of dissenting voices appalled and embarrassed by some of their administration's practices - and it doesn't matter whether that administration is Democrat or Republican. (I personally find it extremely hard to stomach the official Yankee line that the United States of America is the centre of the universe. As it happens the Romans, the Byzantines, the Ottomans and we British also once thought that, and look what happened to all their respective glory.) Bigelow seems - and I must stress seems, because there is so little real thought in her film that maybe she didn't even consider it - that as the US is 'the good guy', it ain't bad when it uses torture. In fact, given the US's self-defined role of saving the world from assorted 'bad guys', torture can, in fact, be a good thing. Again to be fair, when the film came out, the CIA were horrified and insisted it had never used torture and we must take it by its word.<br/><br/>That denial wouldn't, however, explain Abu Ghraib, waterboarding and the many admitted incidents of 'extraordinary rendition'. And isn't it odd, by the way, that when something unacceptable is done, there's a feeling that if we call it something else and use a euphemism, that something becomes half as bad. Then there's the central fact of this film which I shall call the murder of Osama Bin Laden, but which others claim can't be 'murder' because he was 'a bad guy'. But that's enough liberal ranting.<br/><br/>As for the film, well despite the subject matter, it is really nothing more than Die Hard Part 17, with artsy hand-held camera work. According to Bigelow (who prefaces her film with that weaselly giveaway that Zero Dark Thirty is based on 'first hand accounts of actual events' which actually means nothing whatsoever but gives the film a spurious sheen of 'truth') the capture of Bin Laden was all down to the sterling, tenacious work of one dedicated woman, a woman, furthermore, who was feisty enough to best the men who stood in her way and wouldn't take no for an answer. So far, so nauseatingly Hollywood.<br/><br/>As for characterisation, well there is none. which is a bit of a bummer for a film which comes in at over two and a half hours. In fact, there's really nothing much else except several hours of our feisty heroine being feisty (but human enough to shed a tear at the end of it all - aaahhh.) My advice: if you like Die Hard style films, stick to Die Hard because at least you're not expected to take it seriously."

","Well, although the movie is exciting one can summarize it very shortly - pure ideology. Zero Dark Thirty is what John Carpenters ""They Live"" trys to explain: They way ideology functions. In this way Zero Dark Thirty works as a narrative from Capitalis - warmachinerys point of view. Don't let yourself get illus ionized. Never the less 5 points for its drama, though the story isn't even fictional (plot twist: Maybe it is?). The plot is kinda simple: A selfmade hero fights against all other for worldpeace and discovers in this time her loneliness - the lonesome hero. She still wins and brings peace to earth. Ideology again shows how the viewer gets himself pulled into the role and finds himself trying to identify with heroism. I wont wonder if this movie got financed by US- military all through."

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" chronicles one of the greatest successful manhunts of all time - the one that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on May 1, 2011. With a screenplay by Mark Boal and direction by Kathryn Bigelow, the movie provides a methodical, step-by-step re- enactment of the decade-long hunt as seen through the eyes of Maya Lambert, a fictional CIA analyst who is actually a composite of several female analysts who played key roles in locating the ever-elusive al Qaeda leader. <br/><br/>Much has been made of the fact that the movie seemingly endorses the view that the use of torture led to the discovery of bin Laden's whereabouts. This assertion caused such a controversy at the time of the movie's release that many felt it ultimately hurt its chances of walking home with the Best Picture Oscar that year. In all fairness to the movie makers, however, the film actually doesn't seem to be making that case, since the scenes early on depicting torture all lead to eventual dead ends, while the piece of information that initially sets the investigators onto the right path clearly comes much later, after torture is no longer being used as a tactic. Yet, had the filmmakers NOT shown torture being used in the early stretches of the film - which take place not too long after 9/11 - they would not have been truthful to the times in which the story is set.<br/><br/>But it is as a drama that we must ultimately judge ""Zero Dark Thirty"" - and, in that respect, the news is mainly positive. The movie stays intensely focused on the matter at hand, not allowing itself to get distracted by side forays into too many irrelevant factors or overly- detailed character back stories. Yet, while this is generally a virtue, it does result in a certain weakness as well, mainly, a lack of depth in the characters, particularly the main one. One need only compare ""Zero Dark Thirty"" to something like Showtime's ""Homeland"" to see the advantages the long-form format has over the short-form when dealing with subjects as complex as this one. And one need only compare ZDT's Maya with ""Homeland""s Carrie (Claire Danes) to see how much more fully developed the latter is as a character. Maya is allowed to register fear, anger, frustration, determination, disappointment, etc., but we never feel that we really get to know her as a person. For one thing, we never see her in a single relationship with anyone other than her colleagues (or even hear of one mentioned, come to think of it), even though the movie spans nearly a decade. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie does convey, through Jessica Chastain's riveting performance, the very real toll exacted on individuals who dedicate their lives to a dogged pursuit of terrorists and who feel heavily the burden of heading off any attacks in the future. Perhaps the lack of any reference to Maya's personal life is an implicit acknowledgment of that fact. Regardless, Chastain provides so luminous a beacon for us to follow along the journey that we can't help but connect with the pursuit on a deeply human level.<br/><br/>Chastain gets strong support from Jason Clark, Kyle Chandler, Jennifer Ehle, James Gandolfini and Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Parks and Recreation"") in the atypical role (for him) of a heroic Navy Seal.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie's meticulous re-enactment of the Navy Seals' successful raid on the Abbottabad compound is alone worth the price of admission. It really does make us feel as if we were a part of history."

To portray it any other way would of been Hollywood nonsense. <br/><br/>The actors all gave intense portrayals of their characters, especially Jessica.

"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","0","1","29 January 2014"," An authentic look at the capture of the most infamous villain of all time.
","Zero Dark Thirty is a high stakes cat-and-mouse game that spans ten years and multiple countries. It turns out that the hunt for the world's most notorious killer doesn't only take place on the ground with soldiers, but also in rooms buzzing with computer monitors and crowded market places. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of the ten year manhunt for Osama Bin Laden. The story follows Maya, a CIA officer tasked with tracking down and capturing Bin Laden. Maya is played to perfection by Jessica Chastain. Chastain infuses Maya with a steely focus that is downright disturbing. Maya would do anything to bring Bin Laden to justice and you can literally see this desperation on every line of her face. <br/><br/>The film picks up two years after 9/11. We are thrust in the middle of a brutal interrogation. Maya is visibly disturbed by the torture going on before her. As the film goes on and the years slip away, Maya is no longer bothered by the act of torture. So much so that she is now giving the orders to torture a detainee. The futile attempt to find Bin Laden has hardened Maya. Her morals have been compromised, yet she never reflects on this, nor are we supposed to. The film portrays the torture scenes in a matter of fact manner. A shrug of the shoulders and a ""we did what we had to do"" response is implied. <br/><br/>Maya is the focal point of the film, the thread that ties the whole story together, but the movie never becomes about her. It toes that fine line expertly. We never see Maya's personal life, we never see her ""let her hair down"" and we never see any flirty scenes with a co-worker. This isn't that type of movie and it's all the better for it. When asked what else she has done for the CIA besides look for Bin Laden Maya replies, ""I've done nothing else."" Even when she is drinking a can of soda on the couch, she's channel surfing through news channels just looking for any nugget of information. She's constantly checking her phone for updates. The search for Bin Laden has literally consumed her life. <br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, Zero Dark Thirty is Chastain's movie. She has solidified herself as one of the top actresses working today. Her meteoric rise to fame is actually pretty amazing. She was virtually unknown before 2011. She then appeared in seven movies in 2011 nabbing an Oscar nomination for her role as the bubbly yet sad housewife in The Help. She also earned raves for her performance as a gentle, carefree mother in Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life. I'm not sure I've seen an actor burst upon the scene like Jessica Chastain has done. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty also doesn't pay a lot attention to the fact that Maya is a woman working in a male dominated environment. There are no confrontations with male co-workers or scenes where Maya has to prove herself to her male superiors. Again, it's not that type of movie. That being said, it's hard not to see the parallels between Maya and Kathryn Bigelow as a director. She too works in a male dominated profession. Especially since she isn't relegating herself to romantic comedies. <br/><br/>The climax of the film is one of the most tense, edge-of-your-seat sequences I've seen in a film in a long time. In a different movie, the soldiers would have raided the compound with guns blazing shooting anything that moved. Instead, Zero Dark Thirty gives us a textbook, methodical raid. Even though the whole sequence is slow paced, it builds the tension perfectly. You could literally hear a pin drop in the theater during the whole raid. We see most of the action through cameras mounted on the helmets of the soldiers. This gives the whole sequence a very authentic feel. <br/><br/>On the surface, Zero Dark Thirty seems somewhat clinical and lacks a lot of heart. Then again playful scenes or normal plot devices that we are used to seeing in a Hollywood film would have seemed out of place with the subject matter that ZDT is dealing with. Instead what we get is an all access, behind the scenes look at the people who worked a decade to find Bin Laden. The film doesn't pull any punches showing us some of the tactics used to get the job done. To tell the story any differently would have been a disservice. <br/><br/>The end of the film is very satisfying. To see Bin Laden taken down felt like closure to something that had been lingering for a very long time. To know that a woman played such an instrumental role in catching Osama Bin Laden makes it that much sweeter. Generations from now, when people are looking for a movie to tell the story of how Bin Laden was caught, they will find Zero Dark Thirty."

"maggiefrankel","10","0","5","19 December 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty Review
","The movie, Zero Dark Thirty, directed by Kathryn Bigelow, was one of the most compelling films I've ever seen. It tells the story of the steps the C.I.A. took to locate and execute Osama Bin Laden. Bigelow managed to fit 12 years of history into a mere two hours and thirty-something minutes, and well, in fact. <br/><br/>One of my favorite actresses, Jessica Chastain took up the role of Maya, the intelligent, yet aloof, C.I.A. agent. Chastain was definitely a wise choice for this role. I don't think I could have seen anyone else in her place. One of the greatest scenes involved Maya yelling at one of her bosses on the operation, in which she demands the team give her what she needs to complete her mission or she would bring him to court. You also see her desperation as she lays on her floor, crying, after her friend was killed in the midst of a suicidal bombing. <br/><br/>This movie is obviously not for everyone. There are some pretty gruesome scenes that involve torture. These scenes were necessary in my opinion, for the story to be told. This was not a fuzzy and feel-good movie, because it was not intended to be. <br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is definitely on my list of favorite movies. This riveting film leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat, even though they already know how it ends."
"Prismark10","6","0","2","10 November 2013"," The hunt is on. But first here are some torture scenes.
","Zero Dark Thirty prides itself on being based on documentary evidence but it becomes clear that this is a fictionalized account on the hunt and capture of Osama Bin Laden. The story might be based on true facts but to distill the story in 150 minutes the focus is on a lone wolf CIA operative who spent the best part of a decade hunting for clues and fighting her superiors for resources and support.<br/><br/>The film starts to pull your emotional heartstrings from the very beginning with voices of victims from recordings made in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The film-makers must be targeting the kids who might be unaware of the events September 11 2001 or more cynically softening us up for the next sequence of scenes.<br/><br/>Now if I was watching a film where some half naked women were being tortured, made to defecate in their underwear, have dog collars put on them, I would find the film under the Grindhouse section of the DVD store with an added commentary by Quentin Tarantino. However as this film features Arab men being tortured, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture is the order of the day.<br/><br/>The film gives you prolonged sequences of torture and of course the trendy water-boarding sequences are included. The film does not seem to condemn torture apart from a throwaway line later on in the film and seems to give the impression that torture has its uses.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of the films is looking for elusive clues that might lead to a breakthrough from all the mountains of information obtained over the years. As we moves on from the Bush regime to the Obama years, we have that breakthrough and move on to the capture of Bin Laden.<br/><br/>The central focus is on the Jessica Chastain character who I believe is a composite. She is very driven and carries the film well which does start out rather slowly as we deal with the fragments we offered that might develop into a strand. However Chastain is saddled with more than a few clunky lines.<br/><br/>The last third is very much for the Call of Duty generation as the armed forces head for the Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow who is the first female director to win an Oscar was working on a hunt for Bin Laden film but quickly reworked the premise when Bin Laden was killed and rush released it within 18 months of the events. I think the script needed more time to develop and the approach might have been different as the film-makers would had been able to have access more information regarding the factual accounts and have more time to mull over things, especially some of the lines given to the actors.<br/><br/>It is a good film although in trying to be neutral with the politics especially regarding torture looks like a mis-step. I think there is a better production regarding these events waiting to be told."

","A very good film but surprisingly unsatisfying even for a viewer who loves seeing commando types running around in combat gear, with throat mics and guns. The scene at the end, in the compound was the best bit - and very tense - but the rest was not ... something. A bit ""meh!"" I don't see what all the fuss was about in terms of awards. The Direction (Bigelow) was excellent, faultless really, but I think the screenplay had something lacking. It wasn't memorable or gripping enough generally. I think that the characters were too inhuman and too shallow, they didn't really relate to the viewer (or vice versa) and I didn't much care for anyone to particularly care what happened to them. Didn't want any of the ""goodies"" to die, wanted Bin Laden to be found but had seen the footage/reenactments in so many other programs that it was a bit old and unoriginal.<br/><br/>A good film, to be sure, but not brilliant, and somewhat empty and unsatisfying.

","If you want the REAL story of how Osama Bin Laden was tracked down and eventually killed by the Yanks... you're probably not going to find it here. Forgive me for saying this, but I always get very cynical when it comes to governmental accounts of their international deeds, particularly the USA who haven't got a great record for transparency. What this movie is though, is a gripping spectacle in it's own right, in a world which seems as far from peace as a game of Battleships.<br/><br/>If a woman existed with the talents of the agent played by Jessica Chastain, she'd be the first lady USA president, no sweat. She reminded me of Carrie from Homeland, in that her gut instinct was always proved right, and her professionalism stood out in stark contrast to her bumbling male colleagues. Is it THAT obvious the movie had a female director? Never mind, I guess it's nice to see a strong representation of the fairer sex in a war film, so credit where it's due.<br/><br/>The thing is though, has Bin Laden's death REALLY changed anything? The guy was stuck in the middle of nowhere, reduced to a bit part player in terrorist affairs. His moment in the sun had come and gone. The way people celebrated after his demise, you'd think they'd vanquished the devil himself. Alas, I suspect Osama ultimately died a mere figurehead, and someone else will simply step forward to carry on his 'work'... so all this planning and execution could be for naught. A regular ray of sunshine, ain't I?! 7/10"
"dromasca","6","0","1","13 September 2013"," soulless
","What is surprising for this two and a half hours film depicting the search after Bin Laden, the planning and the execution of the action that killed him is how superficial it is in its approach. It may be that the level of expectations was set too high by the previous film by Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar decorated The Hurt Locker one of the best if not the best film made up to now about the war in Iraq, about the men in uniform involved in it, about the moral and human impact of the war on the people who carry it. Zero Dark Thirty is a very well made film which also proves that making very well a film is not enough for the result to be a piece of great cinema.<br/><br/>The film follows a decade of mostly covered activity carried by the CIA in tracing Bin Laden and punishing him. The film tells the story of the searches, with the ups and down, the false tracks, the mistakes, the labyrinths of lies and the misunderstandings caused by the cultural differences. Good action, well told, well filmed. It is just that we are expecting to see something else - because it is a film by Bigelow, because in a film about tracing and punishing Bin Laden we should learn something that we do not know from the stories in the press about tracing and punishing Bin Laden.<br/><br/>It may be that the intention of the director was to provide the human interest by pointing to the character of the principal hero - the determined and fearless CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain. Too little, too schematic, I am afraid. Who is agent Maya? What makes her so obsessed with her mission? Where did she learn to fight and win her way in a world and a profession of males? There are a few moments where we are hinted to moral questions about the methods of interrogation, or when the agent mask trembles for a moment leaving room to human feelings, but none of these elements of 'softness' are pursued. All we are left is a character that despite spending two and a half hours on the big screen in front of us and despite good acting does not let us know more about her soul than a routine TV detective hero. Oh, yes - and the memory of a scene of confrontation with James Gandolfini (in the role of the Director of the CIA) little time before the great good-bye of the actor.<br/><br/>Much less than expected."
"nacho-iyaam","4","0","1","3 August 2013"," Interesting movie, yes. Good Movie, well that depends.
","I never got around to watching this movie when it got released. But after a few friends were discussing it I thought I'd catch up. The reviews here for this movie seem largely polarized. Considering the subject matter, I guess it is quite understandable.<br/><br/>I found it interesting. Not because of the events, because we all know the story. But because how it was presented. Basically as one woman's crusade or jihad (the word you use may depend on your religion or language), to find Osama Bin Laden. Why she was so driven was never explained. Nothing comes to mind except that making it a 'her against the world' story adds a bit of excitement to make up for the lacking plot. But I found it interesting because I thought it was more telling of how Americans would be willing to come to terms with everything that has been happening since September 2001.<br/><br/>As a documentary, it obviously wasn't entirely factual. As a movie, it didn't really work too well either, as in it was quite obvious when something big was going to happen, like an explosion or a key character being killed. It wasn't as bad as having a precursor as ""hey guys, this is my last gig. After this last mission I'm going home to marry my girl/guy"" but it was close. Also, the music designed to build up suspense when you know nothing is going to happen (if you've read/seen the news of the major events covered in the movie.)<br/><br/>So, should you watch this movie?<br/><br/>Well, if you're someone George Bush would describe as a patriot, then definitely do watch it. (You probably already have though, and have already rated it 10 out of 10).<br/><br/>Or, if you're from a country where there's been a lot of American Military work, then you probably should give it a wide berth.<br/><br/>Everyone else, if you're after an entertaining or enjoyable movie, you should probably leave it. Otherwise give it a go, but don't be taken by the ""based on true events"" message at the beginning. Expect a lot of Hollywood in it.<br/><br/>I gave it 4 out of 10 because it was interesting, but not really engaging, and it was also at times it was challenging my ability suspend my disbelief a little too much considering the ""based on true events"" message."

The entire movie is shot in a dry, matter-of-fact way. ""This is the way it happened, these are the facts"", the movie seems to be telling us, literally and stylistically.<br/><br/>But the movie is also fiction, and in interviews, the filmmakers talk about how they allowed themselves some creative freedom for narrative reasons.<br/><br/>But where is the line between fiction and journalism here? For example, the movies main character ""Maya"" does not exist in real life... but she's ""based on a real person"". Various real life events are depicted, but are they really connected to each-other the way the movie suggests? Are the filmmakers making changes to the story for narrative reasons alone, or are they manipulating us, with a political agenda in mind? While watching the movie, I found myself asking those questions. I felt uneasy, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>I think the movie lacks transparency when it comes to just how accurate it is. That wouldn't be a problem if it was a period piece, but I think it's a huge problem here, when dealing with very recent events that still have a lot of political weight. This movie has the power to sway public opinion on hot-button issues one way or the other, and to me, its murky mix of journalism and fiction seems downright immoral in that context."

","ZERO DARK THIRTY is a very well-made film; cleverly photographed, well told, with a stunning central performance from Jessica Chastain as a CIA operative possessing both the determination and the sheer persistence to fulfill her quest to catch Osama Bin Laden. The job is not always successful - along the way she loses colleagues and friends, the victims of terrorist bombs and/or unexpected attacks. Nor does she obtain full co-operation from her (mostly male) superiors, who seem more concerned with feathering their own reputational nests rather than accomplishing the job in hand. However, I do have to admit that the film's structure - the us-versus-them notion, with numerous sequences showing the CIA operatives tracking their prey, as well as spying on one another - is a familiar one, dating from the Cold War films of the Sixties and early Seventies. Only this time the enemies are not the Soviets, but those working for Al-Quaeda. Other clichÃ©s also prevail, including the passing of secrets in dark places, the use of extended long shots following characters walking along corridors, and the final sequence consisting of an extended raid on the Bin Laden lair. Nonetheless the film is quite entertaining, if somewhat lengthy."

The film is well put together by the director and it gives a deep insight on how they finally caught Bin Laden. The film could have been much shorter, but I think the director wanted to be true to the facts. The leading actress didn't really show enough emotion for such a deep subject matter, which could have made the movie much more enjoyable. It didn't seem like it was 2 and a half hours long because it was cleverly split with the investigation and the capture of Bin Laden, but I was expecting more after all of the hype surrounding the film. <br/><br/>Round-Up: I am still waiting for a movie that will show the aftermath of when they caught Bin Laden, but I think that the American Government will be keeping that under wraps for some time. There are loads of questions about what really happened which will never be answered. Once this information gets released, I think that Steven Spielberg should definitely take on the movie because everyone wants to know how the most wanted man in the world, got taken down.<br/><br/>Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $109million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who want a deep insight into how Bin Laden got killed. 5/10"

She really excels at capturing the perilous drama and intensely gripping emotions involved in wartime action dramas. Chastain is a force in the fast-track lane of establishing herself as one of the finest actresses of the 21st century, it is hard to believe that she has come so far in such a short career span (thus far at least) but I guess that is testament to how truly talented she really is.

No wonder she got an Academy Award nomination (though I'm glad Jennifer Lawrence won for Silver Linings Playbook).

","A decade and billions of dollars later the world's most intelligent people and military team get together and finally achieve the impossible. I just had the opportunity to watch the extraordinary film, Zero Dark Forty. It's directed and written by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal from the Hurt locker, an ""oscar winning team"". The movie is a ""story of history's greatest manhunt for the world's most dangerous man"". It's based on true first hand accounts but obviously a lot of drama added to make it a Hollywood movie. I would like to share my opinion on this outstanding film.<br/><br/>The plot consisted on how they were able to track down Osama Bin Laden. The movie narrates the life of this young CIA officer named Maya. Ever since 9/11, she has dedicated her entire life to this mission. This movie takes place in various settings. It starts out in the CIA headquarters in the United States. It then, moves to different 'black sites' in which they question prisoners about Ammar. This is who Maya suspects is closely linked to the whereabouts of Bin Laden. Later on Maya is able to survive the Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabed. Succeeding, Jessica, Maya's colleague, is killed by a suicide bomber in Camp Champman. Nevertheless, they continue the search which eventually leads them to finding of Bin Laden. He is murdered by the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Naval Special Warfare Development group. His body is brought to Jalalabad, Afghanistan where Maya identifies and confirms that they have successfully killed the world's worst terrorist. <br/><br/>The protagonist of this movie is a young women named Maya which is played by Jessica Chastain. She has this vigorous desire to capture Bin Laden and the audience is quickly engaged in what seems to be an impossible hunt. She makes it appear as if it were her life quest to capture this man and her persistence is what astonished me. I was driven by her passion on this mission. Therefor, it is adequate to say that I really liked the job she did. I found it interesting to compare her with the cast of actors of CSI Miami. They also play the role of forensic scientist. They're very similar to Maya. Both seem have an immense aspiration to solve these intricate challenges. I also can't help but also mention Jason Clarke. He played Dan, the CIA interrogator. This was also not an easy job at all. He was in charged of torturing and showing his frustration when the accused terrorist neglected to give up any sort of information. It was evident that Jason Clarke was very well prepared. I was not surprised when I found out that the actor admitted to have investigated a lot prior to the filming. He says it really helped him to be able to prepare both emotionally as well as physically for the harsh torture scenes. <br/><br/>I liked the vast majority of the film. Nevertheless, there is a small handful of scenes that I would have changed or removed. First of all, I think the major problem with the film is that it makes it appear as if beating is a successful method to get information out of criminals. This in fact, took no roll what so ever in the finding of Bin Laden. Another aspect that I disliked is how Maya is portrayed as a complete heroine. Of course there has to be drama added for it to be an interesting but she was way too exaggerated. Regardless, I still think this is a phenomenal film. <br/><br/>I think it is adequate to say this film teaches several lessons. It is not exactly designed just to teach one. The purpose of the film was not to leave the audience with an specific lesson. It's not one of those movies like the Bucket List where the motive is clear, which is to live life at the fullest Despite this, it does teach critical aspects in life. First off, it shows how justice is always served in the end. It also emphasizes how torture is not the solution. It affects the two sides. The criminal and the one torturing are both damaged. Most importantly, this film taught me is how vital not giving up. Even is in order to succeed. Maya was extremely consistent and not matter what, she did not give up in her ten year search. <br/><br/>According to the MPAA rating system this movie has been ranked as R. The movie contains a lot of violence, especially beatings. These are very brutal and at times include nudity. Inappropriate language is also very common throughout the entire movie. People are killed in cold blood which can be traumatizing to young audiences. Accordingly, I could not agree more with the movie being ranked as R. It is defiantly not for children. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in crime or action. Also, anyone who is like me. I'm completely intrigued by forensic science.

"sddavis63","5","0","4","13 May 2013"," Finding bin Laden
","Here's the thing. You wait for 2 hours before you get to the only part that 90% of people are really interested in - the night-time mission by American commandos that ended up with Osama bin Laden being killed. Really, isn't that what everyone's interested in? But for two hours, basically what we got was a not always engrossing account of the search for Osama bin Laden, spread over 10 years, so that at times the continuity seemed lacking and I was personally having trouble connecting all the dots - and so I guess I have some sympathy for the difficulties U.S. authorities had in finding the guy. It really, though, isn't that interesting to watch a meeting of CIA officials discuss (at length) the probability of bin Laden being in the house they finally identified.<br/><br/>The movie started out strongly, by using recordings (somewhat controversially from what I understand) of phone calls made from inside the Twin Towers of people calling their families while waiting in vain to be rescued after the planes had hit. It may have been controversial, but it was effective - especially because we simply heard the voices on the phone, with just a black background. No one needs to see the planes crash; we know all too well what that looks like. So that was a good decision by director Kathryn Bigelow. It led into a very graphic and realistic depiction of American torture (I mean - interrogation) techniques on those rounded up that was quite unsettling and it introduced us to Dan (Jason Clarke), who was in charge of the interrogations, and Maya (Jessica Chastain), who had just been assigned to assist him. Chastain was good in the role, and Maya was an interesting character - uncomfortable with what was going on at first, but gradually getting more and more at ease with her role, and developing an obsession with locating and killing bin Laden. It's Maya that the movie revolves around, so a good performance from Chastain was key - and she pulled it off!<br/><br/>And yet, beyond that opening and before the mission to take bin Laden out, I still found this movie to be rather hard going; difficult to follow and not all that interesting. I would say this is much over- rated, but all things considered it was probably a movie that had to be made - or at least one that was inevitably going to be made. (5/10)"

","After making the excellent ""Hurt Locker,"" Kathryn Bigelow could not be expected to have as much success with her next picture, but she does and how! These two movies prove without a doubt that she ranks with the top directors in the business.

""Strange Days"" was less successful, but she has improved steadily. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" had professionalism written all over it. The filming, especially the effective scenes in the dark and the excellent use of light, the perfect editing that made the exciting moments seem real and authentic, and the masterful direction of many secondary actors, proves that Bigelow has a clear vision and an exacting execution in the manner of a Scorsese or Milos Forman. Jessica Chastain does a fine job, as did Jeremy Renner in ""Hurt Locker,"" but Bigelow is the star of these movies because of the way she uses their talents to create authentic but subtle characters. No one brings such harsh realism to war conditions. ""Argo,"" a good film, pales in comparison and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" would have been a better choice for the 2012 Oscar."

I thought it was pretty good - but then I judged it for what it was - a fictional story based on some things that actually happened. It was not a documentary. I think the creators wanted to give the audience a ""feel"" for the long hunt for an elusive enemy and the dramatic conclusion. I thought it worked well on that level.<br/><br/>But there was something to annoy just about everyone who is easily annoyed. Some did not like that this was NOT a documentary and played loose with some plot elements. Some were upset at the depiction of US agents using torture - others were upset at the implication that the torture actually worked.

"Al_The_Strange","9","0","2","21 April 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty review
","This is as real as it gets, for a Hollywood picture anyway. This film chronicles the decade-long search for the notorious Osama Bin Laden, and his ultimate demise, thanks to the dedicated actions of U.S. intelligence and soldiers. Most of this film is built on a realistic portrayal of intel gathering and the actual operation; if such things interest you, then this film should be right up your alley. Most of it is a grim, brooding, realistic drama that emphasizes the danger, the political nuances, and the moral ambiguity of the entire operation. There is action toward the end, but it's a pretty straightforward affair. There are a few ugly scenes as well: the torture scenes in the film's beginning won't sit well with everybody, and it has caused some controversy. Whether you condone or condemn everything in the film, these are things that actually happened, and the film presents them without condoning or condemning.<br/><br/>All of this is shown through the vantage point of a character named Maya, who serves to fulfill multiple roles in multiple levels of the operation, allowing us to see the whole thing unfold from the bottom up. It's a bit of a stretch to believe that Maya could act in all the roles she's given, but as a composite character, she serves the narrative's purpose really well. What really helps will be the film's pathos; it's hard not to admire Maya as a character, who shows decent development, and proves to be a thrill to watch with her aggressive dedication and shrewdness. As far as the plot itself goes, it's a straightforward affair, but it seems to adhere to real-life events really well. Some specific scenes might deviate from reality (the actual raid was much shorter and quieter than what's on film).<br/><br/>This film uses some rough-around-the-edges photography. Editing is good; the way it manipulates sound recordings reminded me a lot of a George Lucas film. Acting is generally good, but Jessica Chastain steals the show throughout with her perfectly nuanced performance. Writing is okay. This production uses real-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is pretty moody.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"

"cisraelramos","8","0","2","15 April 2013"," Review of Zero Dark Thirty
","Review of Zero Dark Thirty<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty was a film about the events up to and the raid on Bin Laden's compound. The movie showed a re-creation of interrogations, training, and the raid on the compound. The film took many facts of the situations that it depicted and twisted them in ways that would over exaggerate it. Zero Dark Thirty's facts and legitimacy is scrutinized and compared to books such as Mark Owen's No Easy Day and Peter Bergen's Manhunt.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty's plot was greatly put together. The entire film followed many of the most important events leading up to the raid on Osama's compound. The film showed the interrogations and how they got information from some of the most important terrorist. The interrogations were graphic and had shown exactly how and actually interrogation would have gone. These scenes are what make the film great, how graphic it is, and the accuracy.<br/><br/>The movie exaggerates the facts compared to the other two books by a wide margin. In one case, during the raid ""Prince 51"" actually known as ""Chalk 1"" in the actual mission it crashes and is angled off the ground. In the movie, the helicopter is claimed to be 10 feet off the ground, as in No Easy Day the helicopter is 6 feet off the ground. The 4 feet may not seem like it makes much of a difference, but when you have to jump from the helicopter that 4 feet can make a difference of shattering a knee or landing and rolling.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty was a well written movie, with a great plot and storyline. Some of the scenes depicted in the movie were very accurate, while others were exaggerated. This film is a well written movie but since it takes facts and stretches them, this film would get 4.5 stars out of 5."

"pc95","7","0","3","13 April 2013"," Serious and Stoic
","By the numbers and in the vein of her former Oscar winner ""The Hurt Locker"", Kathlyn Bigelow's barren ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a serial account of major events relating to the State sanctioned terrorist killing of Usama Bin Laden. The movie stars a relentless Jessica Chastain as Maya in an emotionally taut story of her crusade and job to hunt-down and kill terrorist targets; it succeeds in imparting a claustrophobic feeling of base work space, as well as barren or impoverished settings. From hearsay the story was related to the book, ""No Easy Day"", a recount of the Navy Seal Mission that enacted the killing in Pakistan by a former Seal. Thirty's climax is that fight, which keeps to the Seal's description of what transpired faithfully. However, there is no joy and a constant drain and strain on all the characters psyche evidenced in the departure of Co-Star's Jason Clarke's character Dan, and especially in the beginning with gruesome scenes of interrogation. The experience is certainly not dull, and there's a docudrama feel to it - like Bigelow is trying to keep close to her source material. 7/10 Deserves a recommendation."
"ianjameslindsay","7","0","5","12 April 2013"," Feminism
","There are many different aspects that people consider when giving a movie a rating, one of the more important is the message that lies within the film itself. When the viewers watch the film there is a heavy tone of feminism. There are several major things that stand out, there are very few other women shown in the film, the entire time Maya acts like she runs the CIA, there is even an instance where she screams at her boss. In the script the message of feminism doesn't present itself as obviously and it was written by a male author, while the movie was directed by a female. There are small things a typical action-movie goer would notice that are a lot different than a typical action movie. It is advertised and seems like it would be an action movie but in reality it is just a drama with a very small amount of action. Some of the key things that would be noticed is that the main character is a girl that is not the most attractive and that most of the movie is portrayed at a struggle for women to gain power in the work place. Another thing is how much work she actually does, although there were tons of members helping her out the movie makes it seem as though she did all the work. The story should have just been called a documentary of Maya, because all that was ever really talked about was her. It discussed how she ""was recruited out of high school"" and that all she had ever worked on was the search for UBL. The entire story just shows how frustrated she is, and how much she finds, and what she can do to solve the problem. And it boils down to a point that makes almost makes it seem inaccurate just because there was so much of a focus on Maya, most people would probably be okay if it was a pure action movie and there were mistakes or inaccuracies but this draws a lot of attention to one person. Although there were many problems with this movie it still was an entertaining film the earned a solid seven out of ten stars. The story that was presented was still a quality story of a mission that took an extremely long amount of time to put together."
"mefburks","7","0","3","8 April 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty is good, but be prepared for graphic torture scenes
","I waited to watch this movie until it came out on DVD, so needless to say, I was very excited to watch it. I was pre-warned about some of the graphic torture scenes, but I don't think I was prepared for the first scene with the prisoner who was hung from the ceiling by his arms and verbally, physically abused. This film, however, generated a very relevant discussion about government, military power during war or other emergency situations. I really thought a lot about whether the government has/should have the power to detain anyone it feels has knowledge of a certain event that affects public safety. On the one hand, yes if it protected hundreds/thousands of citizens, but on the other hand, what if that individual really had no knowledge of the subject of the questioning? This is a very tricky balance.<br/><br/>The scene where one of the main CIA agents planned a meet-up with a known terrorist associate at the CIA compound was very powerful for me. This female agent invited a well-connected man into the compound with minimum security to encourage discussion and keep the lines of communication open; she felt that this man had information that would be helpful in preventing terrorist attacks. But, the man arrived strapped with a suicide bomb and blew up himself and the others involved, including this female agent. This made me stop and think that maybe peaceful negotiation is not always the way to address these terroristic type problems. Here, people were killed trying to protect my freedom and relying in good faith on the idea that this man was coming to help out/offer information.<br/><br/>In the end, whether to use tactics that may require some socially unacceptable mediums, such as waterboarding, or to open our arms wide to communication with unstable people is a tough discussion to have. But, nevertheless, is a conversation that needs to happen."
"chucknorrisrules","7","0","3","5 April 2013"," A flawed gem
","To be fair, it's hard to write spoilers for this since everybody knows what happens in the end anyway.<br/><br/>The face of Osama Bin Laden has hung over our heads for years. Even for non-Americans he has been in the shadows for 10 years, laughing at our fears as we have boarded planes and trains wondering if we're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Until May 2011, suddenly the man was no longer a part of the world we live in.<br/><br/>The story follows Maya, a CIA analyst, who - for reasons undisclosed - is pathologically fixated at finding and capturing or (more likely) killing Bin Laden. Played very well by Jessica Chastain, you really root for her as she fights to go after the one man she wants to reach. A lot of intrigue and investigation follows as the CIA and the military pursue Bin Laden, with setbacks apiece, and some scenes that just seem to come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>One of the flaws however, is the overuse of torture. Though it is an honest portrayal of the CIA's dirty little secret, it is not honest enough to show the fact that torture is a disastrously unreliable method of obtaining information (hence the 'WMDs' claim courtesy of Egyptian police).<br/><br/>The final raid is very exciting and atmospheric, except that it goes on for a bit too long, and the SEALs seem to not know how to shut up at some moments. One of the best moments being when the locals start to approach to find out what's going on, in a particularly eerie scene.<br/><br/>In general, it's quite a piece that takes some patience, but Katheryn Bigelow has really pulled out the stops for this one. Maya's final realisation of her success sums her situation up very well. She has achieved what she has wanted all this time. What to do with herself now? It might take some time to invest in, but the end truly pays off."
"cragsby_kellogs","8","0","3","4 April 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty (2012)
","Following the tragic events of 9/11, the US government bring in young CIA operative Maya (Chastain) to spearhead their mission to track down Osama Bin Laden and kill him. For the next decade, Maya spends her whole time dedicated to finding this man but faces up to various challenges along the way including intimidation from her male superiors (Chandler and Strong), handling the rough tactics used during intense interrogations with terrorist subjects and her scrap with the odd few bomb attacks. But despite being ridiculed for her obsessive search, she vows to get her man as the hunt becomes more decisive ultimately leading to the crucial discovery of Bin-Laden's secret hideout which gives the Americans the chance to finally close in on their target.<br/><br/>Right from the outset, Bigelow makes it her intent to depict the uncomfortable setting of this film when it opens with a black screen in which we hear phone calls made by frantic and terrified sufferers of 9/11. Though it is chilling, it builds up the tone of the film which becomes more unsettling in the next scene as the Dan character uses methods of torture to interrogate a scared delegate who is linked to key terrorists involved in the event. Controversy has overshadowed the film's reputation especially with its focus on torture which has led to harsh criticisms. The scene itself isn't necessarily shocking to watch and gives a clear message that perhaps the US were right to use such tactics in order to gain crucial information that would help them with this important mission. From then on, Bigelow and Boal are able to craft together a compelling story that captures the stressful period that these American officials went through as the long search provided many high and low points. Having Jessica Chastain's character Maya be the focal point of the film proves a key decision as the situation clearly affects her during these ten years. Chastain's rise from unknown actress a couple of years ago to Hollywood royalty almost mirrors Maya's own character development as we initially see her acting squeamish during the opening torture scenes. However once she encounters a few problems over the next few years, her determination to land Bin Laden becomes borderline obsessive and makes for a fascinating watch. While some critics have complained about the lack of back-story to the character, it is important to show that this woman never gives up in her pursuit of the terrorist and that she is able to stand her ground even when being criticised. But once we get to the final scene of the film, the psychological strain that Maya has gone through is illustrated with emotional intent as she reflects on finally completing her task but tearfully realising that the hunger is now gone and that she must lead a normal life. It proves that Chastain's unquestionable talent as the best actress in Hollywood is something to marvel at as she pounces on her first leading role and makes it a powerhouse of a performance that relies on grounded subtly and minimal showiness. But this doesn't mean that the supporting cast are overshadowed as a host of under appreciated actors get their chance to contribute with Jason Clarke standing out amongst them with his gripping role as the forceful interrogator Dan who dominates the earlier scenes with his torturous tactics. Other recognisable names like Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong and James Gandolfini lend fierce authority to their brief appearances while Jennifer Ehle gives Chastain a bit of female support as her fellow colleague Jessica who gets caught up in a couple of the film's more dramatic scenes. Ultimately when we get to the film's thrilling final half-hour, it is obvious what will happen as Bigelow handles the sequence with nervy precision as the Navy SEALs patiently prepare to raid Bin-Laden's hideout. Having done an effective job with the action scenes in her last film The Hurt Locker, Bigelow carefully adds striking moments to build up the tension of the attack from the amount of doors the team has to get through before coolly taking down servants of the target in order to complete their mission.<br/><br/>What does limit the film is the lack of focus on other characters aside from Maya. Though you have a group of effortless actors playing these roles, most of them don't get given enough time to really make an impact outside of Jason Clarke's character. We don't really learn more about them (though you could argue the same about Maya even if she is the primary lead) as the likes of Chandler and Strong spend most of their time hurling abuse and are occasionally presented as incompetent and one-dimensional. Audiences will also have to deal with the film's lengthy running time of 160 mins which may bore them especially as its more of a talking film than an actual blockbuster.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's intimate and masterful take on the hunt for Bin-Laden refuses to be dragged down by controversy in this fascinating drama which is driven forward by an astonishing performance from the very gifted Jessica Chastain. All hail Maya!"

","Zero Dark Thirty is one of the years most controversial and troubling films. It begins with audio from real-life phone calls from the World Trade Center as people realize that they are trapped and doomed to die. It is a disturbing and heartbreaking opening. But is the film good? In my opinion, not really.<br/><br/>The movie is about the hunt for the terrorist Osama Bin Laden over the span of twelve years. The main focus though, is on a CIA operative named Maya played by Jessica Chastain and her tough-minded and determined pursuit for his whereabouts. Maya barley sleeps or even eats out, and is willing to torture suspects to get information.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty runs at a long two hours and forty minutes. For me, that is too much to take. The movie keeps throwing different events at us. The torture methods, the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Pakistan, the list goes on and it is all is quite exhausting. Mark Boal, the screenwriter for Zero Dark Thirty is a former journalist, and he says the movie was based on a first hand account and he packs enough information for two movies. I would have appreciated more of a documentary approach. More insight into Al-Qaeda and how the terrorists think.<br/><br/>Not to say that the movies does not have its upsides. Jessica Chastain gives the performance of the year worthy of that Academy Award nomination and it is always good to see Mark Strong (playing an American!), Mark Duplass and Kyle Chandler. They all have small roles, but they do their jobs well and Mark Duplass, a usual indie director, injects a small dose of humor in his one scene into a stone cold film. Jason Clarke shows up as a veteran CIA interrogator in the beginning of the film and literally made me shake in fear. He makes his character believably real.<br/><br/>What the movie lacks is the heart pounding suspense that made The Hurt Locker so good. It also lacks some ingenuity. We have all seen this before. The last thirty minutes are devoted to the raid on Osama's compound. The sequence is well shot through the POV of night vision goggles), but their was no suspense and I felt rather bored. To me, Zero Dark Thirty was the biggest disappointment of the year."

To be honest that was right on the mark.<br/><br/>Besides the controversial decision to make this film, the movie in all sights spectacular. Is it something I'd show to my kids to show them what really happened? Probably not, because of most of the language, but when kids get older, I'd definitely tell them to watch it. <br/><br/>The acting was absolutely great by Chastain but I do think it is one of those roles where a lot more actresses could have done just as well as she did. <br/><br/>It is a movie I highly recommend picking up, and well worth the cost. <br/><br/>P.S.

","In an age when so much of what we hear is intended to influence opinion, seeing a reasonable portrayal of actual history is a breath of fresh air.

Too often we hear the failures of intelligence without much support FOR them and their god awful lives and dedication.

She deserves to coast for the rest of her life.<br/><br/>The SEAL teams who drop themselves in harms way with particular American humor and diligence are the best in the world. Not just their skills but their humongous selfless sacrifice. Their reaction to having gotten UBL is very real shock and awe at what they just did.

"lee_eisenberg","6","0","3","24 March 2013"," addressing the controversy
","When Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" got released, it drew controversy for what was seen as an endorsement of torture. It should be noted that the movie does depict torture committed by the CIA. However, the torture takes place years before there are any leads, so it doesn't appear that the torture leads to Osama bin Laden's capture and subsequent execution. As can be expected, the actual mission is the most intense sequence. We can debate whether or not it was a good idea to kill the world's most wanted man as opposed to sending him to the Hague, but what's done is done. Jessica Chastain is particularly intense as the CIA agent whose dogged determination eventually leads to the capture. All in all, I thought that it was a good movie. Better than ""Argo"", although not the year's best movie."
"Robert_duder","6","0","2","22 March 2013"," Oh I don't know...
","Alright so here is the unbridled version of what I think of Zero Dark Thirty, not just the movie but the hype around it. First of all, I saw nothing in the movie deserving of Oscar nominations let alone wins. But same could be said in my opinion for Argo, Lincoln, Django, Anna Karenina, and more. It was a weak, weak year for Oscar movies. I believe this was nominated for two reasons...1. The Academy likes Kathryn Bigelow because she's so close with James Cameron who is rich enough that he basically runs the show and 2. Left wing Hollywood enjoyed that right wing Washington hated this movie. Also I am so sick and tired of hearing people complain about how its fake, untrue, supportive of torture blah blah blah on and on. Then these same people complain about how long it is (which it is excruciatingly long.) So many mainstream movie goers expected it to be a blow things up action flick and its not. Its a lonnnng, drawn out investigation to find Bin Laden. Fortunately for me, I had read enough on the film that I knew it was lonnnnng and drawn out. But for those complaining about the legitimacy of the movie...ITS A MOVIE!! I don't care what it's ""based on"" or who told them facts...its ALWAYS A MOVIE. So I am reviewing this on entertainment merit. The investigation is long but interesting enough. The performances are okay albeit a little over intense at times but I suppose the situation would be over intense. I do think the film would have been more effective and more interesting at 45 minutes shorter at least.<br/><br/>All right so its no secret that I can't stand Jessica Chastain. I think watching her is equivalent to watching that one girl in High School that thought she could act so she over dramatized everything. This is no exception. The script is rife with pointless and underwhelming obscenities and she delivers those curse words with such awkwardness that its almost painful to watch her. Her nomination for an Oscar for this silly performance is just as bad as Amy Adams' nomination for The Master or Alan Arkin for Argo. Jason Clarke on the other hand was excellent. I wish the film had spent significantly more time on his character. I wouldn't say his performance is Oscar worthy but compared to Chastain, he nails it. He is convincing and believable and strong. The supporting cast is huge and definitely lots of familiar faces. They all do a solid job in their respective roles. Some of the more stand out performances include Kyle Chandler and Harold Perrineau in small but vital roles that they did well. Having names like Mark Strong and Joel Edgerton as headliners in this is ludicrous. They're barely there and I think I remember one line from Edgerton in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Obviously the raid is the climax of the film. It is very dark and gritty and disturbing so that part of it is done very well. It actually felt like the one part of the movie that was probably closest to accurate and didn't feel like it was dragging and full of propaganda. However (and I am the furthest thing from a Military expert or strategist) and yet I thought a few of the things they did during the raid seemed completely wrong and foolish. The way the film plays out the raid was truly an assassination mission as they move through the house killing and double killing every target. Osama's mark and death is incredibly anti-climatic, even less than hearing President Obama talk about when it happened. The script is sloppy. Every character, not just Chastain, delivers obscenities awkwardly like it was specifically thrown in there to make it R-rated and gritty. I'm not against obscenities in a film, I know as a writer that sometimes it just flows that way but it doesn't flow at all in this and feels awkward. Basically I found the movie to be incredibly off in its pacing, mediocre acting and way over hyped. Why anyone would even be remotely upset about the portrayals in this movie is beyond me considering it is a mediocre movie at best that most mainstream movie goers won't understand or want to see. It weeds out the short attention spans in the first half hour. The driving force in the film is Chastain's character's obsession with capturing Bin Laden and I'm not sure they really captured that. Even in the closing scenes when she stands over Bin Laden in what should be an inspirational and powerful scene is lack luster. There was a small low budget flick released earlier this year called Seal Team Six that I thought would be a total dud and turned out to be pretty good. I honestly feel like Seal Team Six (while not an amazing film) did a better job at making you feel for the characters and delivering entertainment. See it for yourself but it is an intense investment of nearly three hours. 6.5/10"

","I wanted to like Zero Dark Thirty better than I did. It is a good film, but it takes a long time to get started. You never really feel like you know any of the characters. Jessica Chastain who plays Maya, the CIA agent who pursues Bin Laden down the years never reveals who Maya is, what drives her, why she is so obsessed with this pursuit.<br/><br/>The movie didn't come alive for me until the final half hour, when the actual raid on Bin Laden's compound takes place. That is very exciting and very well crafted.<br/><br/>The torture scenes at the beginning of the movie are tame compared to others I have seen. Why there was so much controversy over torture which never reveals anything valuable is a mystery."

"riziger","7","0","2","11 March 2013"," Good, not great.
","Zero Dark Thirty is a film about the decade long man-hunt for the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. It follows Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, as a CIA agent trying to find Osama. It makes interesting use of Maya as a ""fly on the wall"" type character for a glimpse into what the CIA was up to during those 10 years. The CIA has come out to say it's obviously a dramatization of actual proceedings (they definitely would, after those torture scenes), but I think it's loosely based on 2 books about the hunt.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is brilliant. She plays a CIA agent recruited straight out of High School and basically spends all her time on the Osama chase. She's incredibly tough yet still manages to portray some sort of vulnerability. The supporting cast are solid as well. The film has a very similar feel to ""the Hurt Locker"", also directed by Kathryn Bigelow, which examines the mind states of personnel on the frontlines. I think my problem with the film is I expected too much of it. The middle chapter is definitely a slow burner and felt like a chronicle of events more than anything else. The final chapter though, where they re-enact the killing of Osama was pretty good and is the only real ""action"" you will see in the movie. If you're expecting gunfights and action, this will not be for you. A majority of the film is spent showing how they linked and tracked down Osama and the difficulties it brought. Overall, it's still a very solid film and definitely worth a watch."
"PhilGuest","9","0","3","11 March 2013"," Intelligent, gripping drama
","Less than two years after being terminated with extreme prejudice, Osama Bin Laden returns. Kind of.<br/><br/>ZERO DARK THIRTY dramatises the decade-long hunt for the most wanted man on the planet. It's a story where the ending is known by everyone buying a ticket (and if they don't, their priorities in life need seriously adjusting) But there's more to ZD30 than documenting the last fifteen minutes of Bin Laden's life. The bigger picture is how American forces - both military and intelligence - stepped up their efforts post 9/11 against the invisible enemy of al Qaeda.<br/><br/>Understandably, it's September 11th 2001 where the film begins. A black screen, punctuated only by the white text of that fateful date. Then a collage of voices - panicked telephone calls to loved ones and emergency service switchboard operators - tumble forth from the surround speakers. It's a memorable opening, reinforcing what the flash point was in the stepping up of the hunt for Bin Laden.<br/><br/>We follow the chain of events through the eyes of CIA officer Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. Some have criticised this reduction of the CIA's efforts to focus on one person. As ZD30's canvas is huge - the story playing out across many different countries, with more than a hundred speaking parts - it wouldn't have worked as successfully as a drama with a multitude of lead players. In Mark Boal's lucid script, Maya is our guide, on point duty through the maze-within-a- jungle that was the tracking down of Bin Laden's location.<br/><br/>It's one of the CIA's methods that has attracted the most criticism and possibly ended the film's chances of Oscar glory. The torture of suspected al Qaeda members is shown explicitly - water boarding, stress positions, sleep deprivation. Whilst these scenes are not for the faint of heart, it's impossible to agree with criticisms that the film is justifying the use of these methods. Torture was a fundamental part of CIA information gathering in the early stages of the Bin Laden manhunt and to not show it would have been a gross distortion.<br/><br/>The climactic sequence of ZD30 - the SEAL Team Six raid on Bin Laden's Pakistan compound - is edge-of-the-seat, nail-biting stuff. Director Kathryn Bigelow knows how to do action and she knows how to do it well. It's a bravura, yet completely disciplined piece of cinema.<br/><br/>ZERO DARK THIRTY is not the definitive account of how Osama Bin Laden was traced and ultimately despatched. Nor, do I think, it was meant to be. Where it does succeed, however, is as compelling viewing. An absorbing, adult view on modern warfare that makes you fully appreciate the magnitude of the task and the extraordinary way the mission was completed."
"seaview1","9","0","3","10 March 2013"," ZERO DARK THIRTY and the Ultimate Manhunt
","Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal garnered Oscars for their war film The Hurt Locker a few years ago. While planning a film on the fruitless hunt for Al Queda leader, Osama Bin Laden, the fugitive was eventually tracked down and killed after a decade. The filmmakers subsequently expanded their film, gathered from several first-hand accounts, and the result is Zero Dark Thirty, a thoroughly detailed, complex study in the greatest manhunt in recent history. It is a fascinating study in the tedious work of the behind-the-scenes faceless men and women whose intelligence gathering efforts and in some cases obsessive determination culminate in the most stunning of missions.<br/><br/>As audio of frantic, desperate victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center plays in the background, we flash forward a couple of years to the Middle East and a torture scene of an Arab prisoner witnessed by newly transplanted CIA operative, Maya (Jessica Chastain), whose intelligence is matched by her sharp tongue and dogged stubbornness. As part of a group of operatives sifting clues and leads to locate terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden, she comes into conflict with traditional, out of date methodologies. Her theory centers on a courier who could be the link to their target, but to identify, locate and follow this suspect proves confounding and fruitless over the years as other hopeful leads fail to pan out or prove deadly. More terrorist attacks occur globally and there is a greater sense of urgency when Maya stumbles upon a crucial, misplaced piece of information. A remarkable series of interviews in remote, secret locations and painstaking surveillance result in a possible hideout. The question is whether to take the chance of launching a strike mission based on imperfect, yet probable data and plain, gut feelings. What follows is a minute by minute recreation of the subsequent, military mission to end all missions.<br/><br/>The infamous torture scenes are not so much violent as unbearable and uncomfortable. To center on these scenes misses the point of the film. While the story could have left out the bulk of these moments, they only serve to illustrate one of the means of collecting hard intelligence. The film also shows the toll these acts take on the human psyche of some of the interrogators.<br/><br/>Chastain's character is quite the rebellious analyst who is unafraid to speak her mind or display emotion. What we don't know is her background or her family or friends. This rough sketch of a character may serve this story adequately, but it denies the audience of more textured character development and audience empathy. She has a deep resolve that will keep her searching for years and endless interviews often in disguise to protect her identity as she herself becomes a target, looking for the one misstep or inadvertent mention of a name or detail. She even challenges and stands up to her superiors including the Director of the CIA (played with great effect by James Gandolfini) because of her self belief. Hers is a female operating in essentially a male dominated profession much as Jodie Foster proves herself in similar environs in Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>Bigelow excels with this intense, intricate screenplay. She is in her element during the last half hour of the film (where there is effective use of a minimal musical score and eerie, night vision camera work) as the stealth helicopters proceed to their target and she flexes her filmic muscles, which she does as well as any action director. John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) would be proud.<br/><br/>As a chronicle of the remarkable mosaic of intelligence work, Zero Dark Thirty is excellent. If it lacks a little heart and soul, that's not the fault of the filmmakers so much as the source material. While it could have easily been a thorough miniseries on television, it has been distilled to a highly engaging tale of good old fashioned detective work of the highest order. When Maya reacts to the mission's completion at the end, it is one of emotional release which the audience shares and could very well have been Bigelow's own reaction to a job thoroughly well done."
"fellow456","9","0","3","10 March 2013"," Incredibly Wearing (As It Should Be)
","Why you shouldn't see it:<br/><br/>If movies that come to a slow boil aren't likely to hold your attention, there's a chance Zero Dark Thirty won't either. It covers a time period of nearly ten years, and you feel the length of the film accordingly. Each minute wears on you as time passes by with no real headway in the search for arguably history's most wanted man, and you begin to wonder whether it was all really worth all the fuss (and time... and effort... and cost...) of watching people look for him. This movie is drama much more than it is suspense, action, or anything one could remotely consider ""light"" (there are moments of levity, but they are more brief breaks from the slow-mounting tension than anything genuinely comical).<br/><br/>With the main characters of this movie all being CIA and military special forces, you might expect it to be an edge-of-your-seat thriller. While there are a couple moments of thrills, the vast majority is spent wondering where the thrills ran off to. Between a moderately graphic torture scene at the beginning and a raid on UBL's compound at the end, there's mostly just a lot of talking and scheming and thinking and nerve-wearing stretching of moments.<br/><br/>If you prefer for your movies to present you with some sort of agenda, as though Hollywood is responsible for calibrating your own moral compass, this one might not do the trick. It presents its material in a surprisingly even-handed light, which has reportedly bothered some of the more negative-minded critics out there. Since this film features depictions of distasteful acts, in the opinion of some, it is the job of the filmmaker to make obvious her distaste for said acts instead of simply portraying the story unfiltered.<br/><br/>Why you should see it:<br/><br/>On the surface of it, Zero Dark Thirty is, in the mold of both Argo and Lincoln this year, an expertly told historical tale. It takes an event about which most of us know many of the details and still makes it a gripping film going experience. When I take a step back and think about it, I realize that it's pretty inappropriate for me to catch myself holding my breath while watching any movie, let alone one with an ending of which I am quite familiar. And yet, that's exactly what this movie did to me, even more so than either of its historical counterparts among this year's crop of nominees.<br/><br/>I could probably talk at length about any number of things that I consider strengths of this movie. The brilliantly understated performances of every member of the cast, not least of all Jessica Chastain, which allow the film to be driven by the slow grind of the developing plot and the atmosphere it creates. The deft and even-handed treatment of the (only partially known) source material that allows the audience to draw its own conclusions regarding both the means and the end of the hunt for Bin Laden. The distinct lack of blatant Hollywood moments used to artificially amp up the suspense of each moment, which intriguingly does much more to draw the viewer into those very moments. And, not necessarily the movie itself, but - the trailer, which perfectly conveys to the viewer exactly what to expect from the movie without spoiling any of it (I seriously love this trailer, even more than I typically love trailers, which is saying a lot).<br/><br/>But what I really want to talk about is something else entirely. Or, more appropriately, maybe it's the combination of all of the above that leads to something that has really stuck with me as a movie-going experience I'm not used to. Now switching to explicitly first person, since it's the only voice that really seems appropriate:<br/><br/>When I was leaving the theater, I knew that I had been made to feel something, but I couldn't quite figure out what it was. Then, as I thought back through the events of the movie, I realized that I hadn't felt ""something"" at all. I had felt a number of things, and those feelings had corresponded exactly with Jessica Chastain's character Maya. And, by reflection, my own feelings on the UBL manhunt itself. Ranging from discomfort to resolve to determination to jadedness to exhaustion to relief, and, as the screen went black: emptiness. I had just devoted nearly three hours of my life to watching this movie - much like the characters devoted nearly ten years of their lives to catching Bin Laden, and the closing impression we were all left with was emptiness. Not the kind of emptiness that accompanies the depressed thoughts of ""why did I just watch this movie,"" but instead the kind of emptiness that hit Maya like a hammer when she pondered her past and wondered how that could point her to any future.<br/><br/>In Short:<br/><br/>To be honest, if you have seen the trailer, you should know exactly what to expect from Zero Dark Thirty (unless you're bad at watching trailers... it's not a skill everyone has). I saw in it one of the best and most evocative trailers I've ever encountered, and that's pretty much exactly the kind of movie I ended up seeing. It's subtle yet direct, clear in purpose yet uncertain in meaning. I recommend it with a 9 out of 10, because while it isn't necessarily what I enjoy about movies, it is certainly what I appreciate about them.<br/><br/>Exceptions to the recommendation: if you prefer your waterboarding to be in a more private setting, people who actually enjoy the artificial, Hollywood-injected moments of suspense, if you would rather your media present you with one slant or another so that you don't have to risk getting lost in the uncertainty of your own self-resolved morality, if you're an Osama Bin Laden apologist."

"siderite","8","0","4","3 March 2013"," It's like Homeland was made into a movie
","Kathryn Bigelow again tries to depict the realities of modern warfare against terrorism with this film that looks remarkably like a movie adaptation of Homeland. The same feisty female CIA agent that is ""her against the world"", the same obsession with her target, the same great cast placed in somewhat insignificant roles to make her shine in her role. Is it something more than that, though? Barely.<br/><br/>On the other hand it is difficult to tell this story and also make it interesting without forgoing some of the realities in it. CIA work is a thorough, heart wrenching and, most of the time, boring job. The movie is likewise in its depictions of torture in the hands of Americans, numerous bureaucratic obstacles before action is even considered and the many discussions. As an idea, the operation for the capture or killing of UBL was not started for more than 100 days from the moment they suspected where he was.<br/><br/>Bigelow does well to not go into a political direction or another. You don't feel the movie accusatory against the War against Terror, nor do you feel it apologetic towards the less politically correct actions of Americans in the conflict. It feels real and I certainly hope it is based on facts. That's why this is not a very dramatic movie, nor has it a lot of military action, it is almost a documentary.<br/><br/>Bottom line: As a depiction of facts, a great job; as a movie, a little boring. And I also don't know about the veracity of the information Bigelow received as source material.<br/><br/>As for what happened in the film, the operation itself felt weird to me. They go there to kill bin Laden. Just kill him. Not detain, not prosecute, not torture and interrogate. Bin Laden himself, in the midst of an obvious American attack, doesn't blow up the entire compound, or at least himself, he just sits tight and waits for it all to end. He could have just hidden somewhere in a compartment and the Americans would never have had the time to do a proper search. None of that happened.<br/><br/>One phrase in the film also left me wondering. Apparently, the reasoning behind sending the team in the house in the first place was to ascertain that bin Laden really was there. Otherwise they would have just thrown in a bomb. Really? Is that justice? It's seems like American Fatwa to me. And this is the most terrifying thing to me, how a few bombs and terror threats have sand blasted away the patina of civilization from the American behavior and showed the angry, barbaric desire to dehumanize and destroy their enemy, just like the people they are fighting. I think that is the meaning of the last scene: the girl, having reached her target, cries for her own lost humanity."

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is unfortunately not ""The Hurt Locker."" The success of ""Hurt Locker"" was its attention to detail and well-formed characters. Boal and Bigelow scrape together office loads of people and create the rather annoying heroine, Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. A woman who in the middle of the Afghan desert still has the ability to have perfectly pressed clothes and coiffed hair. Her acting was way over-wrought. The fight between Maya and her supervisor seemed cliché. The movie felt like a made-for-TV reenactment. Unlike ""Argo,"" this movie had little suspense. It went through the motions without giving the audience anything to care about. Sure, Bin Laden was killed. Okay great. I didn't feel anything for Maya.

However, unlike other movies that knowing the plot would certainly kill your pleasure of watching the show, this ""almost"" accurate portray of CIA hunt for OBL had you wanting to see what is going to come next. The climax of the show is the Navy Seals raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Though most had felt this part as the holy grail of the show, I would think that the depiction and events leading to the raid as the essence of the movie.

","Let's face it. This film isn't that great. I don't necessarily think it's bad, and it may have something to do with me comparing it directly to Hurt Locker, but I was expecting something better.<br/><br/>Chastain's character was not likable, not interesting, didn't really have much conflict and to be honest wasn't really acted that well at all. She was basically a lifeless prop until the two scenes where she raised her voice over not getting what she wanted. And those scenes, rather than feeling like desperate actions of a determined woman (as I assumed they were meant to be), they just felt uncharacteristic and came out of nowhere. The way I saw her was a snobby, stubborn cow that worked alone all of the time, had no friends and was totally cool with torture but wouldn't dare get her own hands dirty.<br/><br/>Also her friends that died in the car bomb, were hardly even known to the viewer, much less cared about. They didn't really give me that desire to succeed in their honour, kind of feeling.<br/><br/>The aspects I did like was the historical side; the facts. As an Australian, the Osama assassination wasn't something that many people really cared about, and thus we didn't hear much about it. But I enjoyed learning how they went about tracking him down, etc. That being said, I could have got that out of a History channel 1 hour special. In fact that would have probably had more content.<br/><br/>The scenes where they locate Abu Ahmed and then follow him to his house, was all exciting stuff and the take-down scene was pretty good too.<br/><br/>Music and sound was really cool, particularly the sound design in the take-down scene and aftermath."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","2","25 February 2013"," Coming-of-age of a woman CIA agent
","If you look at the reviews of ""Zero dark thirty"" by two most-read critics, you just might get the impression that they are talking about two entirely different movies. The elite critic focuses on the subject of torture, citing that even when in terms of screen time it covers only the initial 15 minutes of the 150-minute movie, it has the effect of ""Rosebud"", implanting a theme that dominates the entire movie. The mass-audience critic, on the other hand, paints a picture as an espionage investigative thriller, without a single mention of torture.<br/><br/>Just for fun, I am offering a third angle of viewing this movie as a coming-of-age story of the protagonist, a fictitious CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain).<br/><br/>""Zero dark thirty"" is fiction based on well-known facts, the tracking down and killing of Osama bin Laden. As such, it actually has the better of both worlds. For some sequences, such as the final operation in bin Laden's hide-out mansion, it pretty well have to follow all the details that have been under close scrutiny by the world. On the other hand, with the fictitious protagonist, there is significant creative freedom.<br/><br/>The persona of Maya is presented initially as somewhat nervous when posted to a CIA ""black site"", witnessing a torture scene. Soon, we see her picking up the ""trade craft"" using exactly the same opening ""line"" on a prisoner to be questioned as the one used earlier by experienced interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke). Although she is opposed to using extreme violence and torture, she is gradually becoming, in every other respect, just as much of a veteran as Dan. She has, at least, no reservation about slapping a prisoner hard every 30 seconds (to be more precise, have her male colleague do the slapping). This coming-of-age then takes another turn, when a colleague-turned-friend called Jessica (Jennifer Ehle) is killed by a suicide bomb attack, when killing bin Laden becomes her very own personal vendetta and the movie turns somewhat melodramatic.<br/><br/>At the time of this writing, Oscar results have just been announced. It is quite a surprise to see Chastain who has swept just about every major award so far losing to Jennifer Lawrence. I won't be seeing ""The silver linings playbook"" for another week and so cannot compare (although I do know how good Lawrence can be from ""The winter bones""). Chastain's performance is top-notch. However, I suspect that the nature of her character suffers somewhat from the lack of depth, the way it has been written. As mentioned above, midway through the movie. Maya's character, instead of being developed into more dimensions, takes a turn to a more melodramatic personal vendetta.<br/><br/>In addition to Chastain, ZDT has an excellent cast. Mentioned earlier are Clarke who was in explosive brother in ""Lawless"" and Ehle who excelled in two support roles as Christabel LaMotte in ""Possessions"" and as the speech therapist's (played by Jeffery Rush) wife. Other similarly impressive resumes are from Joel Edgerton (the shaggy-haired knight Gawain in ""King Arthur"") playing the squadron team leader in the operation and James Gandolfini (the over-the-hill New York hit man in ""Killing them softly"") as CIA director, a –show-stealing support."

","One movie I had definitely been looking forward to seeing this week was Zero Dark Thirty, a film directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who also directed The Hurt Locker. Fans of Bigelow's work are now asking themselves the same question: Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker? Well, to be perfectly honest it's The Hurt Locker for me, but of course Zero Dark Thirty isn't a bad film. In fact, it's a thrill for anyone interested in biopics. I love biopics; my all-time favourites are Ed Wood and Raging Bull. However, this one, I didn't love. Let's explore why.<br/><br/>The Good: Jessica Chastain as Agent Maya. Jessica Chastain was excellent in this film and the rest of the cast were all equally as good. Whenever Chastain was angry or frustrated, the audience really felt it and I think that she should win Best Actress in the Oscars this Saturday.<br/><br/>The plot. The plot was very interesting and gives the true insight into what happened during the ten year search for Bin Laden. The different threats Maya survives, as well as her great determination to capture Osama make the film so much more interesting.<br/><br/>The fact that they were allowed to make this film. There was much speculation as to how Osama Bin Laden really died or if he even existed. Now this film gets it straight and tells us what happened, I'm sure putting many people's mind at rest. They also show the true terror of a terrorist attack and how dangerous a job a CIA agent's really is.<br/><br/>The thrilling final act. This was the best part of the film. It was the part where the final assault on Bin Laden took place and it was this which reminded me very much of the Hurt Locker. The way it was shot and the shifts from normal cameras to night vision goggles really stood out and made it very realistic.<br/><br/>The Bad: The Pacing. The pacing in this movie is pretty off. There are certain moments which I think were not as important as they were made out to be. If the movie had been cut by around thirty minutes, I would say that it would have engaged its audience more and been an even bigger hit. But unfortunately, it dragged like the third act of Skyfall.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 9/10 Awesome. I think this movie was very good and well made, being tailored towards people who want the truth. However, I think if it had been presented in a documentary style rather than a dramatisation, it would have worked better. That way we wouldn't have boring telephone calls that just shout exposition but interviews with people involved, which would have involved me more. It was awesome but I don't expect it's going to be one of the movies I personally pick for my DVD collection. Probably just not my type of film."

","""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a pseudo-documentary-like-thriller revealed a true story that we all know, but didn't surprise us at all. People are hungry these days. Hungry on more information about ""what's happening behind capturing Osama"", unfortunately ZDT didn't satisfy us in this way.<br/><br/>In the start we can see a very nice modern style Shaky-cam that gives us a pretty good feeling of a documentary itself, until the moment when one realizes that he is in the middle of the cruel tortures of an Iranian prisoner that last horrible 15 minutes! Now let's talk about our main character - Maya. It's woman-centric film, where all story is spinning around her as a CIA operative and her thoughts, and ideas. What I liked in Jessica Chastaine's acting is that we can see full transformation of character starting from her firs interrogation of prisoners following the Al Queda attacks against the U.S. on the 11th September till the last moment when they caught Ben Laden in his large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. She starts as an indecisive and perplexed girl, and then going all the way of becoming a neurotic, assertive ""Iron Lady"", who didn't have private life, lost her friends, but would not give up on an idea of capturing and killing Osama. <br/><br/>Perhaps in future in could be shown as a fine documentary in schools and colleges, but for average ""hungered audience"" we need more."
"sashank_kini-1","Null","0","3","18 February 2013"," Zero Dark Thirty alienates its audience with its metallic, distant and self-important style. You end up admiring it more than loving it.
","Each and every moment in 'Zero Dark Thirty' (ZDT) is crafted with monumental finesse and precision to an extent that we feel as though we are reading the blueprint of the Twin Towers. The modus operandi in the various procedures and proceedings followed by CIA is so realistically and truthfully depicted that we wonder whether ZDT was planned as a movie for public viewing or as a project in a seminar meant for theorists and scholars from different backgrounds. In one word, if the movie has to be defined, I shall say that ZDT is 'metallic', just like those fighter helicopters that were used to raid Osama's sanctuary, all hard and impregnable for most of the duration. It is an achievement for Bigelow to make such an important work, yet ZDT is more to be admired as a solid work of craftsmanship and less to be loved as a superbly intense film. <br/><br/>Nearly every person on planet earth knows about 9/11 (a hyperbole, yet not overly exaggerated) and its repercussions on the world politics. Almost every guy or gal would know Osama Bin Laden (not a hyperbole actually) with a majority aware of his actions in the past, and a few minority getting acquainted with the name thanks to Facebook memes of President Obama and Osama. Majority of the Americans and Pakistanis would know about the torture cases in Abu Ghraib, with gruesome and sickening pictures leaked online acting as explicit proof of certain American soldiers' execrable treatment of Iraqi detainees. And with Osama's death in 2011 headlining news channels across the world, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal knew that this was THE subject of their next film. So with massive preparations and research, the duo gave birth to 'ZDT', a synthesis of an independent tough female director's vision with the meticulously detailed effort of an analytical male scriptwriter's mind. <br/><br/>Boal and Bigelow's ZDT is led not by a tough-nut rugged man but by a strong and determined woman named Maya who is played brilliantly by chameleonic actress Jessica Chastain. Maya is on her first and her most important mission as a freshly recruited CIA officer: to capture Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind behind the 9/11 bombings and the leader of the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization. During her eight-year long mission, she witnesses the various 'stick approach' (read torture) methods used by her superiors to extract information from detainees in Pakistan, interviews a number of Muslim men, most of whom are prisoners, reviews the videotapes to get new findings, encounters and narrowly escapes attacks and bombings, loses some of her colleagues and gains respect from her superiors and most importantly gets a vital piece of information that finally leads to Zero Dark Thirty. <br/><br/>The opening moment of the film with a blank screen and audio echoing from the surround sound speakers is haunting especially when it ends with a female helpline operation saying the words 'Oh my god'. The visuals begin with an intense interrogation scene between Dan, a CIA officer accompanied by three people and Ammar, a detainee held at a black site. Only later do we realize that the masked person standing behind Dan on whom the camera frequently pans is actually Maya. The scene then continues with a water-boarding torture inflicted on Ammar with Maya filling the jug with water for Dan to pour it on the struggling Ammar's covered face. The camera work during the scene (and the rest of the film) is stellar, with shot-reverse shots at same camera height/level is used during the initial interrogation and the same technique but with the camera kept at a lower height emphasizing Dan's upper-hand and from at higher height at Ammar to show his helplessness is used after the water-boarding scene, with shots of Maya's reaction inserted at intervals. During the second interrogation, instead of cutting, the camera moves back and forth from Dan to Ammar to increase the pace of the questioning.<br/><br/>When the plot leaves the interrogation, the pace drastically reduces especially during the office talk, which reminded me of Bourne Series, where we didn't bother lending our ears to the little office-room scenes that gave some background information only because office-room talk is usually pretty banal. And Zero Dark Thirty is pretty heavy on jargon and theory, as the great film critic Roger Ebert pointed out. The entire first half after the torture sequence pretty much moves on in a self-important manner where characters speak plenty of 'important matters' to each other without involving the audience even to a little degree. The constant fade-outs to introduce new segments are to blame for this. This kind of editing used repeatedly drops our curiosity and interest for what's to come next. The failure here reminded me of why Social Network succeeded so well in raising tension – David Fincher, Social Network's director never dropped the m***********g pace and instead let it build and build further. <br/><br/>The second half has better moments and is more a film than the first. Maya's dialog ""I'm the m**********r that found the place!"" got quite some response from the audience apart from Dan's ""If you lie, I hurt you"" in the first half. A smart thing for Bigelow to do after Osama's hideout was discovered was to keep Maya absent from the film for a while and instead only showing her hand writing the number of days since the discovery on a glass wall with a marker to show her frustration at CIA's dormant response. While the actual operation of capturing Osama Bin Laden, whose outcome everyone knows, is quite subdued compared to how I had visualized the encounter after I heard it in the news, it is the resolution and final shot especially which drive home the point.<br/><br/>I do not think the film is one looking for stars. I find it impossible to give it stars. Can't say I enjoyed it much but I couldn't take my eyes of it."
"advanderlaan","Null","0","3","17 February 2013"," Asks more questions than it answers, but a very good film.
","After finally getting to view this film there are two things that are clear. First is that Kathryn Bigelow is a master film maker. Similar to The Hurt Locker this film will make you cringe, want to cry, and be glued to the screen waiting for the other shoe to drop, so to speak. All of this happens in a well planned and executed picture piloted by this amazing director. You need to have a strong stomach and be able to stand a a lot of shaking camera work, but the end result is worth it.<br/><br/>Secondly, the two main characters (Maya and Dan) give a powerful performance together and individually. Jessica Chastain gives an amazing performance which is well deserving of the nominations she has received. I think you see this amazing transition throughout the film where she goes from a seemingly young and scared girl, to a grown woman at the controls of this incredible man hunt. There are times where she looks lost, and others were she is getting in peoples' faces so that they listen to her. She shows many sides of the character but does it in a subtle way for the most part that fits her CIA officer status. Dan, played by Jason Clarke controls the screen in the first act of the film. He character is seemingly capable of incredible cruelty and great caring between his interactions between the detainees and Maya. Clarke is completely believable in his business like approach to his work of ""breaking"" the detainees. Some of the first scenes are difficult to watch, but it is a testament to his acting chops.<br/><br/>Now for the not so clear part. As I said in my summery line the film asks a lot of questions that it doesn't answer. One of the reasons that The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty work so well is because the director combines the vivid pictures on the screen with the bigger questions that are left hanging for the audience to think about. I enjoy this style of film making and I wish that there were more ""cerebral"" directors out there who would allow the audience to chew on the questions posed in the movie.<br/><br/>One thing that I hope people remember before and after they see this film is just that; it is a film. While it is based on actual events and eye witness accounts, it is a dramatized retelling that has been modified for the medium of film. I have a limited knowledge of the middle east and modern warfare and I think I spotted a few things that probably weren't 100 percent accurate. In the end however, it really doesn't matter. If you go in expecting another ""Hurt Locker"" you are going to be disappointed. While the two films were made in the same style, this film has a lot more characters, story lines, and takes place on a much larger scale. You also have to be willing to wonder about the questions posed in the film; things like torture, US work overseas, and how this country has conducted itself in the last decade are put front and center for your consideration. I hope that if you see this film, you will go in not expecting all of the answers and resolutions to be handed to you. Also please remember that there was some creative license taken; and despite knowing the eventual outcome you will allow yourself to enjoy a well made film."
"Rabbit-Reviews","Null","0","3","17 February 2013"," More of a documentary than a movie
","It would seem Kathryn Bigelow after her great success with The Hurt Locker gained enough credit to do this little big movie about the hunt for the most wanted man on a planet. I first saw a cable TV movie Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden, so I roughly knew the story and of course the ending that I think everyone knows by now. They kill Osama, there, I've said it, major spoiler. Lets start with the fact that this movie caused a major discussion all around the world concerning the methods used to obtain informations about Osama's whereabouts. Torture is something that we would like to think belongs to the dark ages or some fringe terrorist groups and ""evil"" countries, but the fact remains that almost every country in the world uses it to obtain information. To continue with this part of the story we must first take a look at the actual movie: Zero Dark Thirty is more of a documentary than a movie, yeah it sure looks like a regular movie, but the direction, storytelling and everything else screams documentary, all its missing is Morgan Freeman or David Attenborough to be complete (that would be a fun movie). We start with a young female operative, unexperienced and unaccustomed to torture, water-boarding and all the fun stuff that is being used on ""assets"". As we follow her on her path we learn more and more about the actual processes that led to the capture, and the lengths that people are prepared to go to achieve their goals. Later on we meet the team that actually raided Osama's house, and killed him, so we get to know more about them and their take on this situation (just another job) Again this entire film is shot without any prejudice or bias, and I must commend Kathryn for not turning it into a blood fest or some patriotic bullshit. What you take from it is your choice, you could just see it and go hmmm thats how they did it, or you can start asking questions is torture OK, should we spend money and recourses on some more immediate threats...<br/><br/>This brings us to that outrage from the first part of the review, where people were so shocked and appalled by the scenes of torture that they questioned the director for shooting them, and consequently (talk about reverse priorities) the actual torture that went on and is going on. I must admit that those scenes are quite difficult to watch, what with all the truth and that masterful camera work. There is no music, just two guys hanging out (well at least one of them is hanging) and you are left there with the feeling that you should do something about it. A brilliant scheme, if it was intentional, but it does not sit well with everybody, because they will see the emptiness and not fill it, while others will see the same emptiness and fill it with their own thoughts...<br/><br/>So, finally should you watch this movie? Well that depends on a question what kind of person you are. If you are interested in the hunt, and not somewhat morally squeamish you should definitely check it out, but on the other hand if you do not like almost historical portrayal of events style movies, you will find the movie incoherent and ultimately boring. The choice is yours.<br/><br/>As for me, I've of course seen it, and it was a pleasant information gathering mission, without any problems, plus the ending is much like a video game(COD,BF...) so thats a major plus :) Movie recommendations Rabbit-Reviews.com - Only movies worth watching"

She finds Osama almost a decade.<br/><br/>The director Kathryn Bigelow makes another good movie but not that good enough as we comparing to The Hurt Locker (2008), it was an excellent movie also won an Oscar award. Besides, zero dark thirty is a good movie to watch but not a brilliant kind of movie. <br/><br/>Reason's to watch this movie<br/><br/>1 Jessica Chastain's peerless performance (deserves an Oscar for sure).<br/><br/>2 Created good thriller as well, and it will not loose the grip till they found the location of Bin laden.<br/><br/>Weakness<br/><br/>1 Long duration: about more than 2:30 hours, rather than the movie could cover the whole story in 2 hours. <br/><br/>2 The worst part is when they killed Osama (its kinda boring).<br/><br/>So, for my side it was a good movie, Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke(Dan) played a very good role in it.I gave 7/10 just for Jessica's performance and it was only one time watchable but not an Oscar type material."

","Firstly I'd like to say that this is an excellently thought up movie plot, very gripping an very entertaining. But it shouldn't be a movie centered around the killing of OBL. Which for one, drags on for a bit too long, and two, does not give enough insight to the viewer. I've watched countless clips, movies and documentaries about 9/11 and it is to my belief and understanding that 9/11 truly was an inside job, etc.. Therefore I do not regard this to be a true depiction as to what we, from all over the world, have been led to believe. In my opinion, one should thoroughly have knowledge and a good background to 9/11 before watching this flick or else you may over empathize with certain characters."
"ArthurVanDam1","9","0","5","2 February 2013"," You Are There -- Jessica Chastain Rules
","Initially, I was reluctant to see Zero Dark 30. But am I glad I did, despite the 157-minute length. Which drags for only a brief moment or two in the middle of the film mind you. <br/><br/>Zero Dark 30 turns the old phrase, ""It's like being there"" on its head to YOU ARE THERE. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow (Hurt Locker 2008) has surpassed all. The realism (from my seat) was Astounding. The cinematography amazing. I felt like I was right there with our special forces. Wow. <br/><br/>Jessica Chastain (The Debt 2010) was Truly Brilliant as Maya, the supremely motivated CIA agent who takes on this crusade as a personal mission and doggedly tracks down Osama Bin Ladin. According to Entertainment Weekly, Maya was Chastain's own incarnation since she was unable to meet the real ""Maya."" She showed tremendous resolve and near robot-like ability to forge ahead in spite of the Agency's continual roadblocks and criticism from her peers and colleagues. This on top of the usual hurdles one faces in a quest of this scope and magnitude. <br/><br/>A fine and compelling performance from CIA agent Dan (Jason Clarke; who also appeared in Lawless; Public Enemies; and Death Race). He is quite the interrogator. And Maya's peer too. <br/><br/>Our old friend James Gandolfini (Tony Soprano in The Sopranos - HBO) weighs in as the CIA Director. Good to see ""Tony"" in action. <br/><br/>Even though we know the outcome, the suspense was there from beginning to end. <br/><br/>The cinematography was truly amazing, capturing the ruts, zigs and zags of the various Third World countries and hunt for Osama Bin Ladin. The military equipment was real, at least to me. The camera bounces around a fair bit, not quite like a roller coaster, but enough so I felt like I was riding shotgun (walking alongside) with the agents and ready for a menacing nemesis or two to be lurking just around the corner. <br/><br/>One warning (and I don't think this is a Spoiler): there are some torture scenes in the first approximately half hour of the movie. <br/><br/>But interestingly enough, I found these scenes somewhat less upsetting than the torture scenes in James Bond's Casino Royale (Daniel Craig, 2006). Maybe I was forewarned here or expecting these scenes in Zero Dark Thirty. I sure hope I'm not desensitized. <br/><br/>On a more realistic and somber note, my friend and mentor Bill's son Rich Died in 9/11. He was a Citibank - Citigroup employee. By some fluke, a colleague asked him to join a meeting at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the top floor of The World Trade Center... Thankfully, the rescuers found Rich's remains and the family held a wake. Bill has never been the same! Understandably so. Who would!<br/><br/>Throughout the movie though, I was left wondering why are humans such a violent lot? <br/><br/>Aren't we supposed to be the most intelligent species?<br/><br/>Years back I happened to attend a Holocaust presentation. One survivor said he and his colleagues hid in the forest to avoid the Nazis. Some nights, they slept, huddled with a pack of wild boars - to keep warm in the cold, cold winter. Mixed species seeking warmth. The boars welcomed another being to help create warmth. Will we be fighting for another 5,000 years to come?<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Is this really necessary?<br/><br/>Many Heartfelt Thanks to our Armed Forces and Navy Seals for their efforts to protect us! No small feat. A great sacrifice! <br/><br/>While we ponder society's future or whether this review is too surreal or deep, be sure to see Zero Dark Thirty! And Live the History.

"Laakbaar","9","0","4","1 February 2013"," An important, gripping and technically competent historical drama
","This is an important movie. It is a technically superb docudrama that walks the movie goer through the arduous and controversial process that resulted in the killing of OBL.<br/><br/>Every movie needs a hero, and in this movie the role is played by Maya (Jessica Chastain), a tenacious CIA employee who is portrayed as instrumental in finding OBL. The movie is more or less told from her perspective. <br/><br/>The involvement of a strong woman represents the clash of values underlying it all. The presence of a dynamic, intelligent, career-oriented woman during the interrogation scenes and at the identification of OBL's body is hugely symbolic. This is why.<br/><br/>It's astonishing how Bigelow was able to recreate everything so realistically (although I'm sure there are some aspects that are not realistic). She shows us several aspects of the hunt in much depth: the intelligence gathering, the CIA politics involved, the cultural clashes, the military operation, and so on. The movie has the feel of an interesting documentary or news story. The movie is long, but it doesn't feel long, which is quite remarkable when you think that this is a movie with a plot known to the viewer beforehand.<br/><br/>I felt the movie was rather dispassionate. The climax was understated and lacking in triumphalism (apart from a bit of excitement from the soldiers involved). I certainly did not rejoice at the end. Why did the climax unexpectedly move me the second time I saw this movie? I suppose it's because I had a better feeling of the justice of it all.<br/><br/>The one thing about this movie that really surprised me is the fact that most of it was set in Pakistan. Pakistan has a lot to answer for, it seems. Is Pakistan aiding or fighting terrorism? It seems unclear to me now.<br/><br/>I didn't find the ""enhanced interrogation"" scenes too difficult to watch. This movie doesn't condone it or condemn it: it simply shows it. The same treatment is given to the killings at the OBL compound. No punches are pulled. We are shown what happened. In this movie Bigelow portrays the stark reality, including the moral ambiguity of the process. The tone is one of fallible human endeavour, grim necessity, determined competence."
"cosmonadz","8","0","3","29 January 2013"," Fact or Fiction
","It seemed to me that the movie was trying so hard to stick to fact over fiction but as we all know it takes a little dramatization to put bums on seats. Although the film started off by gripping the audience it did seem to lack a little punch through the middle. It's hard to keep the audience hooked when there is little to offer them in a story that seems to blow hot and cold. Having said this on the whole the details provided in the story line were pretty easy to follow and it was surprising to see the political machine not falling foul of election frenzy. The cat and mouse scenarios were perfectly balanced and although some may argue that they may have been a little stretched out I personally didn't see it that way. The end was a little rushed but I guess it's hard to show much more since most people went into the movie knowing plenty of facts already. It was all a matter what you already know and what you believe to be true. It's one of them movies where how much you know or believe is paramount to what you see in the film and what you are led believe. Enjoyable and full of suspense it's definitely worth a watch. I predict an Oscar winning performance for a supporting woman but I won't spoil anything by saying too much."
"phd_travel","8","0","3","25 January 2013"," Riveting
","Whatever the controversies it is riveting and well made cinematic version of the most significant man hunt in history the search for and killing of Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>Because this movie is a sort of historical testament, if there never was any torture in the search, it shouldn't have been included. But as far as movie making is concerned the torture scenes keep one engrossed during the early part of the movie. It would have been hard to keep the tension up during the first third with the slow search for the contact that took years. The screenplay is quite adept at minimising confusion in a long story.<br/><br/>The raid on the Bin Laden compound is scary and well filmed. Even in the darkness and green lights it still is quite clear what happened.<br/><br/>Katherine Bigelow's direction is generally very good showing the viewer what they want to see. Some of the camera angles were a bit close and jerky at first but that soon stopped. Production is good with an on location feel.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain does a convincing determined and balanced performance that doesn't resort to painful jerky overacting like Clare Danes in Homeland.<br/><br/>It is a scary and fascinating movie and well worth watching."

","Zero Dark Thirty: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Intense, Thriling, Convincingly Real and aided by brilliant acting by Jessica Chastain and co, Zero Dark Thirty shows the assassination of Osama Bin Laden extremely well and convincingly and is embolised through the tough acting by Chastain and the rest of the crew and some brilliant and convincing presentation by Kathryn Bieglow who keeps on making movies related to war and crime superbly.<br/><br/>The Story which is based on true events of the assassination of Osama Bin Laden and the screenplay written by Mark Boel is based on CIA's hunt of finding out where Bin Laden is hiding out after the 9/11 attacks and shows the life of Maya(Chastain) who is a extremely capable CIA agent who is sent to help out in finding Bin Laden, and how she gets adamant of finding him and bravely goes through much risks and hard-times to finally get a source of where he is and must prove it to the high officials that he is in a location and they should assassinate him.<br/><br/>Jessica Chastain is basically the only ''lead'' character in this movie as the fearless Maya who is adamant and obsessed to find and kill Bin Laden and she does this role superbly, and considering that she is in the pressure of delivering most of the acting goods, she does an extremely convincing job and probably deserves the awards she is receiving for this performance which is probably her best so far. Joel Edgerton is a really talented and underrated actor i believe and he does another fine performance as Patrick(Squadron Team Leader) who must take his team to assassinate Bin Laden, and though he does'nt have much screen time, he does greatly in whatever screen time he gets. Jeremy Strong and Jason Clarke do their bits superbly to make the acting in this movie look really realistic to what happened.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow has done another extremely super job in making a film based on really controversial events and I don't think many imagined the movie to be made so quickly after the real events and she took a bold decision in making this but it paid of really well as she made a really convincing movie explaining the audience of what actually happened before and during the assassination. Although she gets a bit desperate in explaining extremely thoroughly at times but apart from that she has done a brilliant job in all parts of the film and really helped Chastain and other deliver there performances greatly and she has made another great film.<br/><br/>The Story is quite precise and explains to the audience of what happened during and before the actual assassination happened and although it is quite convincing, one begins to feel that its a bit over-stretched and at times could have been cut short a bit, but apart from that screenwriter Mark Boel has done a great job with the dialogues and script of the film and has done a convincing job in showing this story well, and the story's backed up superbly by Bigelow and the rest of the crew. The Editing of the film is quite superb as the scenes of the film are synchronised superbly and the editing makes it tough to predict it.<br/><br/>The Cinematography of the film is quite fitting to the film and some of the scenes shown in Iraq and Pakistan are brilliant and dark at the same time and cinematographer Greig Fraser has done a really fine job with it. The Background music of the movie is extremely fitting to the scenes and its haunting and dark and as good as it can get for this type of movies and Alexandre Desplat keeps on delivering remarkable scores for each movie he decides to go with, he is really talented in delivering the backgound music of a film.<br/><br/>Finally, Although this was'nt as good as i thought it would, its extremely close to it and Bigelow has made another brilliant movie which keeps you thrilled and guessing all the time and at the end you're quite convinced of what happened during or before Osama Bin Laden's assassination."
"Theflyace","7","0","3","21 January 2013"," Great for Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow, Horrid Chastain Brings it Down
","**This Review Contains Some Spoilers**<br/><br/>The sounds of the 9/11 calls from the planes and the towers drew me in, as i believed this would be really epic and an awesome portrayal of how everyone felt and how everything went down. And the cut after deflated the film and set the tone for what would happen.<br/><br/>Is there torture? Yes, but it doesn't glorify it like the politicians have been saying. However, it doesn't demonize it, showing it did get us very vital intelligence that we desperately needed. Then the movie drags for about an hour and a half. The last half hour is one of the best sequences I have seen in a long time, but the key moment is a let down. Unlike Titanic, where you knew the ending but it was awesome to see and experience how it happened, in this film the moment happens, and it's just like, ""Oh yeah that happened, nothing important.""<br/><br/>Now we get to what should be the strongest bones of the movie, Jessica Chastain's performance. WHERE DO I BEGIN? She comes in unannounced, reacts to something, and yells at her bosses. I give her credit s after a colleague dies (which the colleague is made out to be a complete moron when it comes to protocol) she does show some genuine emotion. But that is brief. <br/><br/>I felt that Bigelow and Boal made their biggest mistake with this character. I wanted to punch in one scene where she badgers her boss about the compound. I wanted to scream at her, but being in a theater that would have been rude. I can sum up here character like this. She found Osama, she actually does work, she is the first American to see him after the mission, It's all because of her. Here's the biggest insult to the audience, she makes everyone else, who spent years and countless hours trying to hunt this guy down, look like complete IDIOTS. (One man: 75% he's there; Another man; 40%, we have no strong evidence; Chastain: 100% he's there ""I am the one who found that man"") I can't care for her, which storytelling really counts on for a film like this. If she wins an Oscar, it is not well deserved at all.<br/><br/>Boal's screenplay can get murky sometimes, but it's still a solid script, even with Chastain's character in it. If he wins, good for him. I do think Bigelow was unfairly snubbed, but I think it was because how she handled Chastain.<br/><br/>So, like I said before, it is entertaining. It will never, ever match The Hurt Locker, which is the better film from the Bigelow-Boal team.<br/><br/>""For God and Country, Geronimo!""<br/><br/>P.S. How dare they make Kyle Chandler from Friday Night Lights an idiot! How dare they!"

","Impressive movie with lots of toys and factual accuracy... but somehow felt hollow and failed to keep me engaged for the length of the movie.. <br/><br/>Some of the things that bothered me.. 1) that use of torture is justified.. I understand that some seriously bad people are detained in these camps.. but not everyone is guilty..what about those innocent people who faced no prospect of a release and have been in confinement for the last decade? <br/><br/>2) The characterisation of Maya, was in my opinion, inconsistent.. she is portrayed as this go-getter tiger, who was posted here to get things done.. and yet cringes away when someone is tortured and then act like this cold ""muthafucka"" in front of her superiors.. what is up with that?<br/><br/>3) The movie has traded cinematic gravity for factual accuracy."

","I feel obligated to re-write a brand new review of Zero Dark Thirty.<br/><br/>On January 14th, I wrote my heartfelt review of this movie with my true feelings about all the events and characters portrayed. Sadly, I feel the need to censor myself and save myself from, well, me.<br/><br/>No, I don't believe in censorship, but I do believe in choosing to live. What I originally wrote was fairly harsh and absolutely opinionated on how I feel about the topics brought up in this movie. In the light of self-preservation, I am only releasing this second commentary of one of the great movies of 2012.<br/><br/>The best part of Zero Dark Thirty was the fantastic performance of Jessica Chastain. Everyone else was good, she was excellent. I hope she wins for the Best Actress Oscar.<br/><br/>The cinematography, score, dialogue and acting were all top notch, as was the directing. I can understand Lincoln might win, and while I wouldn't be upset with that, this is a great and suspenseful film of one CIA agent's plight of finding Bin Laden.<br/><br/>I understand this is very unusual of me to release a second opinion of my own opinion, but trust me when I say: Even I can recognize I can be over-the-top at times and for the safety of Steve, trust me when I release only the good points.<br/><br/>Side Note: Anyone curious, ha, please feel free to email me and I will send you a copy of my original and stronger approach to this film."
"Hellmant","9","0","6","14 January 2013"," If you're looking for action this isn't the movie for you but 'ZERO DARK THIRTY' is an effective and informative historical thriller.
","'ZERO DARK THIRTY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow's much anticipated and highly controversial cinematic recreation of the events that lead to the killing of al-Quaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. It turns out that most of the political criticisms of the film are untrue and one could say that the movie plays out more like a Bush/Cheyney apologist film than the pro Obama movie that conservatives feared it would be. President Obama is never seen in the film and barely mentioned and the story seems to imply that he had very little to do with the killing of bin Laden. Ridiculous accusations that the Obama administration leaked classified information to the filmmakers have been proved false and now the movie has come under attack by liberals for what they say is glorifying torture and implying that it lead to the CIA finding bin Laden. Having seen the film I don't think it implies that at all. The film does depict some gruesome and disturbing torture scenes but it definitely doesn't glorify the method and it does show the detainee who was tortured finally giving his torturers information (after being tricked by them) but that's what happened (there's no distortion of facts). It's up to interpretation whether the torture lead to finding bin Laden in the film just as it is in life. I don't think the film has a political agenda of any kind (liberal or conservative) it's just a historical thriller that gives the viewers a lot of information about the ten year manhunt of Osama bin Laden. Maybe too much information (not because it's information that shouldn't be exposed) but because the movie is perhaps too long and very slow paced at times. Technically it's a masterpiece though and a great examination of the hunt for one of the world's most notorious terrorists.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) and begins in the year 2003. As the movie opens she's assigned to work with another agent named Dan (Jason Clarke) at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan. Her first job is in aiding him in the interrogation of a detainee named Ammar (Reda Kateb). After torturing him multiple times (and tricking him) Ammar gives them information that eventually leads them to a personal courier for Osama bin Laden named Abu Ahmed (Tushaar Mehra). Maya pursues the lead for several years (at one point being mislead into believing the man is dead) as Dan grows tired of his gruesome job and asks to be reassigned. As he leaves he asks Maya to go with him and warns her that politics are changing (under the upcoming new presidential administration) and she needs to be careful when it comes to using torture. There's also a video clip of President Obama saying torture would not be tolerated but Maya remains undeterred and continues on her obsessive hunt while surviving multiple attacks and attempts on her life. The movie builds to the infamous raid that is depicted in a surprisingly uncinematic way and actually does seem like you're watching live footage of the actual event.<br/><br/>At first I was a little disappointed in 'ZERO DARK THIRTY'. I think I was in the wrong mood for it at the time I saw it and had a hard a time getting in to it but it's definitely a different movie than I expected. I knew it wouldn't be action packed but I did expect it to be more suspenseful and emotionally involving. The only character fully developed in the film is Maya and Jessica Chastain does a great job bringing her to life but she's kind of a cold and obsessive character and we know nothing about her other than the job at hand. So the one character we have to relate to is mostly unrelatable. Jason Clarke, Jennifer Ehle, Joel Edgerton, Chris Pratt, Kyle Chandler and Mark Strong all do a good job of bringing a little more humanity to the film in supporting roles but their characters aren't fully explored. There's also nice cameos from James Gandolfini, Edgar Ramirez, Harold Perrineau, Frank Grillo, Mark Duplass and Scott Adkins (of all people). The movie isn't about characters though (unlike Bigelow's superior film 'THE HURT LOCKER'). It is a great in-depth and detailed look at one of the most extensive and hard fought manhunts in U.S. history though. It's long and very slow paced but it does serve it's purpose well. It doesn't use a lot of music or other traditional cinematic tools and it does have a strong documentary type feel to it. If you're looking for action this isn't the movie for you but 'ZERO DARK THIRTY' is an effective and informative historical thriller.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xLp95d1OTk"

","The hunt for Osama bin Laden was an excruciating one, especially by American government agencies. Countless people, both at home and abroad, lost their lives and time fighting and searching for the man, and in a small town in Pakistan, 2011, the search came to a blistering end.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow's docudrama ""Zero Dark Thirty"" recreates the tense events leading up to that day. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal sidesteps the drama and goes straight for the jugular, a controversial decision given the attention by the masses towards the plot material.<br/><br/>I am not here to divulge into political issues that may or may not have been brought up in the film. I am merely judging the film in terms of its craftsmanship as a thriller. And to that, I say, Bigelow has crafted a superb thriller; raw in suspense and crackling with tension and paranoia, not unlike ""The Hurt Locker"".<br/><br/>This is not an action movie although there are good scenes which suggest it. Bigelow sheds the genre conventions down to basics to show the journey without any delay. The film is, stripped-to-the-bone, a thriller set on a slow burn, opening with brutal torture scenes, followed by investigative/procedural dramatics for the first half. In the second half, Bigelow purposely left the stove running to a boil, culminating in a surprisingly nail-biting climax.<br/><br/>Characters come and go as the plot requires it, but Jessica Chastain's character remains the core of this movie, as she determinedly buries herself in her job to capture the most notorious man on Earth. At the end of it all, you might be putting yourself in her shoes: is it all worth it?"
"the_grand_lebowski","8","0","4","13 January 2013"," ""The Whole World Is Going to Want In On This""
","The greatest manhunt in history is chronicled in Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, Zero Dark Thirty. The Academy Award winning director of 2010's The Hurt Locker, returns with another gritty, intense military thriller. Established through firsthand accounts from eye-witnesses, Zero Dark Thirty presents a fictional portrayal of the CIA's efforts to capture the most infamous terrorist of all time: Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>The film opens with audio recordings of phone calls made during the morning of September 11, 2001. Voices—some fearful and panicked, others calm and committed—play against a black screen, hollowing out the years between the present and that horrible event. We are instantly reminded of the powerful emotions evoked during that day, and how deeply that attack affected us, and continues to do so. Bigelow took a big risk in replaying those phone calls: Her decision could have easily been interpreted as a shoddy appeal to the audience's emotions, but instead acts as a harrowing reminder of the heartrending situation the nation had thrust upon it. The few minutes of audio have an intense sting, putting us in a reflective mindset for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>The film then leaps forward a year, beginning its journey of documenting the plot to capture Bin Laden. The lump developing in your throat is quickly jammed into the pit of your stomach as a torture scene ensues. It is not the only scene of aggressive interrogation in the film, but it is certainly the most severe. Much has been written about the length at which Bigelow chose to depict these episodes of torture, and has provided the film much controversy. If you have read the tremendous essay by the late Christopher Hitchens regarding waterboarding ('Believe Me, It's Torture'), it is sure to come to mind as you watch this gruesome scene. I will not attempt to infer Bigelow's intention in depicting this action, but the viewer should ponder whether they are more disturbed that this practice is featured in a factual retelling, or that such actions actually take place. <br/><br/>The film's lead actor is the prevalent Jessica Chastain. As Maya, a young CIA operative passionately intent on locating the Al Qaeda leader, Chastain creates a character unlike any other in her repertoire. Her restrained emotions shadow an insatiable obsession that begins to consume her as months evolve into years, and failure begins to loom over each new lead. Maya begins as an avatar for the audience, but through the evolution of the film, slips beyond our grasp, becoming a creature of her own passion. Chastain possess the remarkable ability to adapt into any role thrust upon her.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is brimming with familiar faces. Kyle Chandler, Édgar Ramírez, Harold Perrineau, Jennifer Ehle, Mark Duplass, James Gandolfini, Joel Edgerton, and Chris Pratt all lend their talents to this production. Mark Strong is featured as a CIA section chief who serves to epitomize the frustration felt by the nation after numerous years of fruitless investigations. Although Chastain deserves the lion's share of credit for shouldering the heaviest role of the film, Jason Clarke—who gave an excellent performance in last year's Lawless—appears as a chief interrogator for the CIA. His acting in the film's opening scene is a dichotomy of human persona. He immediately shifts between raw brutality and jovial exclamations. Clarke is being sorely overlooked by many, but manages to stun with his callous demeanor and severe magnetism. Look for him to start making significant waves in the future.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty is a rare film that exemplifies the emotions of an entire nation, yet manages to focus upon the mentality of the individual. Teamed, once more, with Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker), Kathryn Bigelow accomplishes a remarkable feat in pragmatism. Shunning conventional thematic embellishments, Bigelow and Boal produce a film that is tense, graphic, and harsh: the very nature of reality. The film describes an event that is all too real, and it achieves greatness through that realism.<br/><br/>http://flickermotion.blogspot.com"

","(First off I'll say that anybody giving this film less than 7/10 is a f**king idiot although the 1st Amendment stills applies to y'all. Go back to GlenBeckistan & wait for Ahnuld's new movie.)<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow/Mark Boal's follow up to their Oscar winning ""The Hurt Locker"" is as tightly focused as that intense thriller but not nearly as exciting because it paints a much broader canvas over a much greater amount of time.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film ""All The President's Men""in pacing, tone & brains. ZDT is a procedural depicting digging for clues & evidence discovery. It invites the audience to go along on the process that includes trust issues & backing off & pushing on. Though it may not be as flat entertaining as the excellent ""Argo"" (& ""Lincoln"") it is very compelling material that Bigelow expertly depicts.<br/><br/>I think that Jessica Chastain is fantastic as Maya who drives the whole ""hunt for Bin Laden"" along at some great personal costs. Her face often captures the pain that goes along with the gain.<br/><br/>Bigelow & Boal treat the audience as adults --smart adults-- by not spelling out everything in bold capital letters & black & white. The climatic raid that finally gets UBL plays out in very matter-of-fact manner. It seems almost slo-mo at times but it shows military expertise that has already been played out hundreds --if not, thousands-- of times in training& actual operations on the battle field. I don't remember ever seeing a climax staged in this way. It is a virtuoso effort by a director at the top of her game who is not afraid to change things up.<br/><br/>This is a tough film to categorize. I think of it as a ""compeller"" rather than a ""thriller"", but I was caught up in it every single second."
