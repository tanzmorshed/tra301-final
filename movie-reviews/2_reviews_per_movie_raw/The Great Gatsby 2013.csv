","I've read The great Gatsby book several times and I watch the original movie before Han d. Of the two movies this one really captures the essence of the book. On people complain about the narration but it was only solution to really accurately convey the story. The parties are epic and that's what I kind of felt they were in the book. DiCaprio deserves more credit."
"naregian","8","542","725","8 May 2013"," An intriguing story re-told again with attention to mystery. 8/10
","8/10.<br/><br/>I know a lot of the other reviewers will compare this film to the older one and also the book, so if you're interested in a comparison, stop reading here. I want to review this film as a movie that tells a story, like every other film. I don't want to review this as a film that tried to beat its preceding film adaptation. <br/><br/>I myself have read the book and have always been so intrigued with the character of Gatsby, and when I heard a few years back that he would be portrayed on the big screen by DiCaprio, I couldn't wait. The character carries such a mystery about him that was delivered so excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio, and made it so fun to watch. It was almost like I didn't know what the ending was because I was so immersed in 1920s New York, and in the lifestyle of The Great Gatsby. <br/><br/>The film itself, as a film, was awesome! The visuals and soundtrack were captivating and lavish. The acting was great overall, as you can trust these actors to deliver.<br/><br/>I read somewhere on IMDb (message board or another reviewer, I can't remember) that Leonardo wasn't a good fit for the role of Gatsby. I think this statement couldn't be more wrong. If you have read the book, you must have some idea about the depth of Gatsby's character, the depth of his mind, his desires. The false smiles, the phony handshakes, the uneasiness in being in public, the way Jay Gatsby conducts himself in front of Daisy, and in pursuit of her. All these things are delivered so well by DiCaprio. His nerve, his frustration, his determination...all so eloquently portrayed. But most of all, his passion, and as Nick Carraway, our narrator so emphatically reminds us, his hope. The character development of Jay Gatsby, and the development of all those surrounding him gives us such a deep look at the relationships of such a diverse category of people.<br/><br/>The storyline is obviously interesting: A man realizes his new neighbor is a mysterious, and incredibly wealthy man. Like how awesome is that? Throughout the whole film, as the relationships between all the few main characters become deeper and deeper, and the questions become answered, you just can't help but feel so into the characters' lives. Great writing for the characters, great directing, great great great acting. <br/><br/>Overall, this is just a great film. If you go into the theater thinking ""oh this'll suck compared to Robert Redford"" or ""I bet the book is way better"", you're setting yourself up for a bad 143 minutes. Don't be so close minded and try to view it as just another film that tells a fictional story, and a great one at that."
"olyahannah","9","311","427","10 May 2013"," Visually and emotionally lush with a great cast
","Baz Luhrmann really has outdone himself in this film. The cast is beautiful as is the script. The scenes are a visual feast. It is as if Luhrmann reached into Fitzgerald's vision of the 20's, pulled out the heart of it and merged it with what society is today, over nine decades later. Alongside personal strife, we see social inequality, abuse of drugs and alcohol, political and moral corruption, and the failure of financial institutions and their responsibility to people. This film will make you feel that these issues will always be relevant, and that not much changes from generation to generation.<br/><br/>The achingly romantic and hopeful Gatsby is played impeccably by DiCaprio. He has aged into a beautiful man while still possessing those boyish good looks. The beginning of the film has the viewer itching to see Gatsby and hear him speak, and when he finally appears he holds on and captivates throughout the film. The film may awaken something in you, a memory of when you were crazy in love with a person or in love with an idea for what your life should be. DiCaprio embodies a dream and makes you root for him, even though he is shown to be a liar and a man who is desperately trying to steal another's wife- all that does not matter because we see the gentle child-like frailty in him and identify with it. DiCaprio is an excellent actor and was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>I must say that I didn't think that Mulligan can pull the role of Daisy, who in my mind was supposed to be a flawless beauty. However, she didn't disappoint. It made Gatsby's love and desire for her even more fascinating- she was beautiful to him and that's all that mattered. Mulligan was able to play the spoiled and dazed rich girl well, while adding an emotional dimension to the character. Tobey Mcguire definitely held his own, and his story line had an interesting deviation from the novel which was enjoyable. All in all I think it is a must see this year for movie buffs."
"copyright908","9","281","390","14 May 2013"," Nothing exceeds like excess
","THE GREAT GATSBY There is no movie I have been more prepared to dislike than this one. How dare some Aussie come over here and tell us about the meaning of one of the great works of American literature. Especially this Aussie, Baz Luhrmann, who is known to overload, over-hype and overcook his theatrical product into a glittery miasma of small meaning and little consequence. (i.e. Moulin Rouge) <br/><br/>But I was wrong.<br/><br/>Jay Gatsby has achieved success in a fashion beyond most imaginations, excepting his own. In true Horatio Alger tradition he has worked hard to improve himself, but when his past creeps up on him and threatens his well crafted self image, he suavely and effortlessly changes it, his past, and he inhabits the change until it becomes the reality. He is the self made American man in every way. He is the American success myth both personified and perverted.<br/><br/>Unlike Alger's heroes, he has not followed the straight and narrow. He has acquired his fabulous wealth through bootlegging and stock swindles. <br/><br/>This belief, that he can change his past, to correct it as it were, has given him a veneer of respectability that has put him in good stead with his underworld connections. But it is not for them that Gatsby has made this remarkable metamorphosis. No, he did everything, and I mean everything, for the love of a woman. <br/><br/>Daisy was Gatsby's great love, but he lost her, and now in one final herculean effort he is going to correct his past this one last time. He is going to win her back and make things as they should have been.<br/><br/>Leo DeCaprio is the only actor of this generation that could play Gatsby, just as Robert Redford could only play Gatsby the previous generation. Redford's Gatsby seemed reticent and insecure about his past; regretful that he must live a lie in order to accomplish his goal. DeCaprio's Gatsby is forceful, decisive; he is a determined man of significant accomplishment and great ability. He has a plan and he is going to execute it and as far as he is concerned, for all the right reasons. For myself, it is DeCaprio's best and most powerful performance. <br/><br/>This decision (both DeCaprio's and Luhrmann's) to take Gatsby down from some ethereal literary icon into a flesh and blood human being gives the movie an intensity that the 1974 version and most of the literary criticism of the book that I have ever read, never perceived. This is not a shining white knight rescuing a damsel in distress; this is a bare knuckles brawl for the hand of Daisy, and she is going to have to choose. <br/><br/>Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) is Gatsby's antagonist. He and Daisy were married when Daisy could no longer wait for Gatsby to prove himself worthy of her. Tom is as rich, maybe even richer than Gatsby, but his money is old, he is an aristocrat with a deep sense of entitlement. He has status and wealth because he's supposed to have status and wealth, and he's not about to give up all that, and certainly not his wife, to this new money usurper Gatsby, without a fight.<br/><br/>Bruce Dern played Tom as a kind of loopy (Dern's specialty) racial conspiracy nut, but Edgerton gives Tom a much harder edge. When Tom espouses his vile racial philosophies one might think that someday he might actually do something about it.<br/><br/>Daisy (Carey Mulligan) is a tough role. For all the time that Gatsby spends trying to prove he is good enough for Daisy, the audience, for the book or the film, is led down the path that she is not good enough for him. Mia Farrow played Daisy as an airhead and a dingbat, but Mulligan gives Daisy a bit more spine, and fashions a character that has a pretty good idea where her self-interests lay. <br/><br/>Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearse stay pretty close to the text with a few additions and devices, most notably, to those of us who read the book, know that it is Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire) who tells the story, and is a firsthand witness to all the events, but we never knew from where he tells the story. Luhrmann tells us it is from a sanitarium where Nick is drying out from excessive alcoholism. <br/><br/>As for Luhrmann's reputation for excess: Well, he certainly visualizes Gatsby's parties as excess, but they are supposed to be excessive, excessive materialism is part of the point of the story. There are times when Luhrmann can't resist himself and feels the compulsion to punctuate matters with some visual flourish, but I did not find it too distracting. His decision to go 3D however, I think was wise. The characters seem to come out of the screen and get next to you. You get to know them personally, and after all this is a very personal story.<br/><br/>I think this story has survived the test of time so well because it is basically a love story. Whatever the viewers or readers opinion of the characters are, Gatsby and Daisy do love each other, but Fitzgerald was not interested in boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl and they all live happily ever after. Where Fitzgerald reached his own aspiration of creating high art is in wondering if living happily ever after is even possible in an age of class consciousness, even class warfare, that is driven by a compulsive materialism in a world changing so fast that we can't even formulate the question before we have to come up with an answer. Luhrmann stays true to these themes and displays an avid curiosity about them himself. <br/><br/>What he has created is a work of art that stands very well on its own.<br/><br/>check out http://blognmovies.tumblr.com/"
"nurkeverly","10","737","1057","10 May 2013"," Stop being pretentious and enjoy a decent film.
","After seeing this film I was more than a little disgusted to see so many negative reviews. The main problem with this film I find is in the first 20-30 minutes, a common problem I spy in Luhrman films that should by no means define an entire film. Giving away nothing the film begins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hits what I like to call ""Baz's golden point"", slows to absolute perfection. That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads, but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all its glory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio gives yet another glorious performance. If I'm going to be honest I think a lot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the ""classic"" status of the book, people want to act like the hours of school discussions should make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of the time. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974 & 2000 adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful, over the top, heart wrenching, and thoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","9","361","532","11 May 2013"," ""The Great Gatsby"" Review
","Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby,"" is fairly accurate to the classic novel and keeps most of its themes intact. However, Luhrmann's own flair adds a new dimension to the story. Visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grand sets to the detailed period dresses, this film is a treat for the eyes. Never once does it not take your breath away from its impressive scenery. Many people might be worried about the updated music, but there is nothing to fear. Jay-Z's track works incredible well with the film and complements the era in which it is set.<br/><br/>The direction in this film is impeccable. The cinematography is marvelous and really lets the viewer absorb the sheer artistry that has gone into making this film. Luhrmann keeps a high level of energy throughout the film and the party sequences are choreographed and edited in a way that it makes you feel envious of not being apart of it. Editing in the film is seamless and really keeps the viewer engaged. A common criticism the film receives is that it is more style than substance, however, I must disagree. This modern interpretation doesn't forget its themes and morals from the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald tale.<br/><br/>Performances are phenomenal by the entire cast. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is every bit as careless as one would expect, but she also manages to show some complexity in her role. Tobey Maguire is a great avatar for us to take on as we enter this film. He is very much the viewer as he sees everything happening, but is ultimately helpless to change anything. The true standouts in the film are Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio. Edgerton as Tom Buchanan brings a lot of personality to his character that I thought was absent in the book. He's a bit more tender and more vulnerable, especially when he finds out his wife's secret. The true award recognition worthy performance comes from DiCaprio's Gatsby. He hones on being a respectable, but idealistically insane man. His performance is not only compelling, but also charming and quit hopeful. He truly deserves some recognition come Oscar season.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a fantastically entertaining and enthralling film. It is horribly underrated as it is filled with awards worthy visuals, sets, costumes, direction, and performances. It is a great time at the movies for anyone that enjoys the classic novel or who haven't even heard of it. Not only is this film dramatically satisfying, but also quite humorous and a spectacle like no other. I give it 4.5/5, a great adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written."
"laura-alter22","9","167","261","16 May 2013"," Loved it!
","For the record, I've read Gatsby at least every other year since I was 17, so, believe me when I say I have been counting down the days and minutes until the new movie opened.<br/><br/>Here it goes then, I saw Gatsby last night and......absolutely loved it! In retrospect (as in halfway through the movie), it just clicked, Leonardo was perfect. He wasn't Redford, but in my humble opinion, better! He nailed it, portraying Gatsby as this truly multi-dimensional character. At first, we're introduced to Gatsby, the well-rehearsed old sport telling his canned story about studying at Oxford, Montenegro medals, etc. etc., but then slowly that forced veneer peels away, and he gives us this angsty, desperate, so-happy-in-love, we can remake the past, tortured soul. Much, much better than Redford. And, the same goes with Daisy. Mia Farrow's Daisy was all flighty and light as a feather, pretty pathetic and self-absorbed, you wonder, what's the big deal with this woman who everyone loves....but with Carey Mulligan, you get it. The scenes of the two of them as young lovers explain it all. Finally, Tobey McGuire....I love him as Peter Parker, Homer Wells and now Nick Carraway. I thought the idea of having him author Gatsby from a hospital was very clever, allowed him to read long passages directly from the book. As for Jay-Z et al., I really didn't mind it, as far as I was concerned, it didn't distract and certainly worked to illuminate the frenetic energy of the 20's. Please, give it another try, see it again. From my experience, a Baz Luhrmann movie is always better the second time around (Moulin Rogue)."
"Bart_OP","5","415","693","11 May 2013"," I did not entirely hate it
","What I thought worked in Luhrmann's Gatsby:<br/><br/>I thought DiCaprio was a better Gatsby than Robert Redford (Redford was too old and underplayed the character). I thought DiCaprio understood a complex character and was adequately convincing.<br/><br/>I Love Carey Mulligan and thought she was mostly convincing as Daisy.<br/><br/>I liked it when the story stuck to Fitzgerald - which was about 75% of the time. (having just read the book again in the last 6 months, I recognized most of the Dialogue as true to the book)<br/><br/>I thought the Costume Design was exquisite. Catherine Martin has done costume work for all of Baz Luhrmann's films and won an academy award for costumes in Moulin Rouge!(as well as being nominated for Romeo + Juliet and Australia. Her work is again superior here - one of the real strengths of the film...<br/><br/>I thought the 2nd half of the movie was much better than the 1st. While I generally did not like the soundtrack I loved that Gershwin's' Rhapsody in Blue' snuck in there in the first scenes in Manhattan.<br/><br/>The ""Valley of Ashes"" and the ""Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, Occulist"" sign are really well done - but sadly, the scenes there are so rushed and so downplayed as to prevent that location from being the symbol of death Fitzgerald intended it to be...<br/><br/>The scene in Nick's house where Daisy is invited to tea and re-meets Gatsby.<br/><br/>What I did not like about it:<br/><br/>Every scene with Tobey Maguire in it. His Nick Carraway is too much of Gatsby's lapdog. He is too wide-eyed throughout the story. By the end of the movie I was praying for George Wilson to shoot him.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's story telling device (Nick Carraway in a Sanitarium telling the story to a Doctor who encourages him to write it) - Really Baz Luhrman, you're gonna improve on Fitzgerald?<br/><br/>Luhrmann's other story telling device: the words on the screen. Yuck!<br/><br/>The Art-direction. Everything was too over-the-top and garish. Gatsby's house looks like a Disney creation. One might argue that this is okay because the new-rich are often garish. But part of the character that Fitzgerald wrote was that he was convincing as a monied man. <br/><br/>The sound-track of the 1st half of the movie. Typically Luhrmann; and I have loved it in other contexts. It did not work in Gatsby. After the last party scene, the soundtrack was much better and the rest of the movie felt like Fitzgerald to me.<br/><br/>BTW - I generally am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I loved Romeo + Juliet while it was being panned by professional critics. And I found Moulin Rouge! delightful..<br/><br/>Moet Champaign (which apparently bought huge stock in this movie)<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton ('nuff said)<br/><br/>The over-the-top garishness of the production is so distracting that the great social themes of the day are almost completely lost. They are so subtle int he book and they must be subtly depicted in cinema. They are so subtle as to be almost entirely lost in this production. When I first read the book I felt such sympathy for almost every character (except Tom Buchanan). I did not really care about the characters in this movie at all.<br/><br/>That Damn green light - much too much. It is a powerful but subtle symbol in the book. Let a symbol be a symbol without having to constantly refer to it and without hitting your audience over the head with it.<br/><br/>Because I did not think it entirely sucked, I will give it a 5. Adolescent girls will disagree with me (even as they are failing their Gatsby finals because they based it this mediocre retelling of the story). Fitzgerald and Gatsby fans will think I am being too generous<br/><br/>Note to Hollywood - If you are going to make a movie based on a great work of literature, respect and humbly submit to that greatness, and make a movie worthy of the original."

","""In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'"" I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read, but I do have the advantage of literacy. However, I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens Fitzgerald's classic novel ""The Great Gatsby"".<br/><br/>The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguire's Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This Nick is a quirky, agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong. Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish, boorish ways of the old money and new money of Daisy, Tom, Jordan and Gatsby in East Egg and West Egg. <br/><br/>Much has been said about the lavish style of the film's sets and imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly works. I don't think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money, extravagant mansions, brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively score just make the whole story seem more fun. <br/><br/>I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nick's bow-tie and the strange shooting style (mostly prominent early on) just made everything look cartoonish. At times, it looked like they were driving Gatsby's yellow car through the set of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". The cartoon- stylings mostly affected Nick; Gatsby's parties are always supposed to be at least slightly surreal.<br/><br/>Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the narrator we once trusted, was only re-confirming that this was in fact the disaster many expected it to be. <br/><br/>But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly, we met Daisy. And even more importantly, Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations about Gatsby – both the man built on wild whispers of him being a war hero, but also the literary character so ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective ""great"" in front of his name. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in, and since Nick couldn't do that, it was even more than I could ask of him.<br/><br/>One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog from the end of Daisy's dock. The one thing missing from DiCaprio's interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a photographer on a model shoot: ""Now give me a look of hope! No, that's anger. Give me hope! No, that's sadness. Give me hope! No, that's frustration. Fine, just give me another look of despair.""<br/><br/>Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligan's Daisy was probably the most accurate character re-imagined from the novel. Starting from her introductory scene where she lay on the couch and the wind rustled her white curtains and her diamond ring sparkled in the daylight and then she turned to stare at Nick, she filled the screen with her ethereal beauty and faux innocence. I don't think it's surprising that the film takes its best form in the scenes where it's just Gatsby and Daisy.<br/><br/>It's hard not to get wrapped up in the grandiosity of Gatsby, the grandiosity of the story, and the grandiosity of the film's visuals. It's a beautiful story and it does look beautiful on the big screen, but then comes the nagging suspicion that Luhrmann never actually read the novel. After all, half of the quotes are just paraphrased and are not the actual lines from Fitzgerald, and all of the scenes and famous imagery are only the ones that have seeped into the public consciousness (straight from the Cliffs Notes, perhaps). It should work well as a way to introduce another generation to this accomplished work of art, and I do applaud them for that, but it doesn't serve those who already know the book well."
"Caterpillar_City","4","194","327","10 May 2013"," A Spectacular Failure
","Adapting famous and well-respected classic literature can't be easy. The film industry's track record attests to this: for every Ran, there are five misfires that people quickly forget. The filmmakers behind this year's adaptation of The Great Gatsby make the task seem impossible. This movie is a disaster.<br/><br/>Much has been made of director Baz Luhrmann's overblown style in The Great Gatsby, but that is just one of the movie's many issues. Actually, let's start with the production design. This movie is super polished and glamorous, but everything looks so blatantly fake. CGI stands in for actual set design and shooting locations. One of the movie's few redeeming features is the scope of the production, but even that is unimpressive when considering most of the movie was made on a computer. Admittetly, the costumes and makeup/hair look nice, and the movie will surely receive some award attention in that department. <br/><br/>The script and the acting are where The Great Gatsby really falls apart. There is no depth of character for anybody involved. The central three characters don't come across as real people. Nick Carraway has nothing to do but stand around and watch Gatsby and Daisy court each other. His frequent narration is baffling pointless, often describing the events exactly as they happen or directly telling the audience the movie's themes, as if we are too stupid to notice them. Carraway frequently stands in the corner watching the action unfold, instead of driving the plot forward with any interaction with other characters. This is a huge problem because Carraway serves as the main protagonist (Gatsby isn't introduced for over 20 minutes). Gatsby and Daisy don't fair any better. Their romance takes up the majority of the screen time in acts two and three, but there is no chemistry, nor do they display any emotional connection with each other. Instead, Gatsby and Daisy just tell each other how they feel with laughably clunky dialogue. There are no scenes showing the intense feelings they supposedly have for each other. They speak at each other instead of having actual conversations.<br/><br/>The actors cannot handle the script's horrible dialogue. The central three actors (Maguire, DiCaprio, and Mulligan) deliver the cornball dialogue with misplaced self- serious melodrama, making many of the conversations draw laughter from the audience. Several members of the supporting cast take the material and ham it up, causing a jarring inconsistency in tone. Lurhmann shows no motivation to rein in his actors.<br/><br/>Speaking of the supporting cast, some of the prominent characters from the first act completely disappear for most of the movie. The only person who shows some level of depth and complexity is Elizabeth Debicki's Jordan Baker, but she vanishes for over an hour, before coming back to do absolutely nothing. Isla Fisher's Myrtle Wilson suffers a similar fate.<br/><br/>The use of music should be mentioned, if only because it is drawing some criticism. Using modern music in this movie wasn't a bad idea, but the execution is nothing remarkable. Instead of using contemporary pop for any dramatic or stylistic purpose, it just seems like Lurhmann picked some songs off his ipod and threw them into the movie.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is a failure on nearly all levels. It's individual flaws could be overlooked if the movie came together to form something cohesive and meaningful, but the whole affair feels hollow. Any symbolism or larger thematic goals get lost in the glossy extravagance. The filmmakers seem to be aware of this, so they pound the themes into the viewers with nothing resembling subtlety or grace. It's truly baffling how anybody in Hollywood could green-light a script this poor, and then throw millions of dollars at the production. The Great Gatsby is a soulless movie that covers up its lack of passion and heart with computer generated spectacle. All signifying nothing."

","Whoever decided that blaring modern pop/ hip hop music into a story of the early 20's was a good idea needs their heads examined. It not only removes you completely from the story but jolts you so far out of it that you need a few minutes to try and refocus yourself back into the story. (and that's not a knock on this genre of music, it just has no place here..) <br/><br/>After an hour, I could stand no more, the acting and story seemed great, but the soundtrack was too much to take.<br/><br/>So much great music was made during this time period that if used effectively could have elevated this story. Such a waste."

","I watched this film with a sort of tender curiosity.<br/><br/>It was deliciously excessive and exaggerated, as expected from a Baz Luhrmann production. Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own (""Old spor'!"") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.<br/><br/>But I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.<br/><br/>Gatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).<br/><br/>Luhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of ""The Great Gatsby.""<br/><br/>I wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of the people and events, ""angry, and half in love with {it}, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."""
"MarkRomance","10","49","78","17 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby, a spectacular ravishment of amazing complex and beautiful story telling through visuals
","I've now watched The Great Gatsby a total of three (3) times, one in 3D. Though there are plenty of harsh critic reviews for this film, an yes I said film and not movie, is because they are too focused on the length of the film and the complex story line and not understanding fully the range of the time period set.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is a touching tale of an interloper, person on the outside looking in from the perspective of a young coming yuppie. Truth be told it is another star crossed lovers tale of missed chance and opportunity and the lengths one goes to rewrite the past and mend the wounds felt for years. Like all tragedies, this film does no better in having hopes up. Staying true to the book, the characters lives all end tragic one way or another. The fond and curiousness felt by the main narrator Nick for the infamous Gatsby fuels the story along, intertwining the 'Golden Girl' Daisy; a minx'd bombshell villianized by her brut 'polo' playing husband, the ever unfaithful and racists Tom. Upon meeting Gatsby, Nick is enthralled by the complexities of Gatsby's demeanor and back story as well as enjoying the ever entertaining side to the secretive bachelor. The plot to re-win Daisy's heart and fulfill the empty void in Gatsby's broken and tired soul didn't come easy. Along the way the other challenges were both infidelities and the accidental murder of a mistress. After all of this, Nick is still recovering pierces of the Gatsby puzzle and figuring out ways to make complete sense of all events take place when in the end some gaps are left unfilled.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the intense performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Tobey Maguire. Both playing cozily off one another and both gave superb vocal and facial workouts. I really liked the easiness of Carey Mulligan's character Daisy. She spoke eloquently enough to pull of the soft and rough tone of a 1920's wealthy east coast flapper gal. Joel Edgerton as Tom, what can I say? Born to play the role of a thick and broastic rich-mistress-having- know-it-all who can't stand to lose anything, not even a potential side sway with a beautiful actress. <br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed the film production value. Also I am sad that the film waited so long to be produced and released, but a little happy because it gave enough time to include Lana Del Rey to the film soundtrack and score. I enjoyed the film despite the critics. All I can say is reread the book and watch the film again and tell me that Baz Luhrmann didn't try to make an emotionally driven artistic masterpiece with great actors and amazing focus shots. I give this film 10/10, but that is my own opinion based on many different category factors.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoyed this review. Thank You."

","The Great Gatsby tells a lot of stories and gains more themes so on. This new adaptation takes a different direction and unique scale. The experience feels familiar to other Baz Luhrmann film, which means it's quite dazzling by his fabulous style and creating an over-whimsical version of the setting. The easiest thing to say is it's fun as a Baz Luhrmann film, but it kind of glosses over the story too much. While it's generally stunning, it didn't dig deeper within the context. The Great Gatsby is fascinating enough but it could have been much grander than what it was shown on screen.<br/><br/>The film did follow the book, it takes a lot of time exploring its setting, characters, and conflict, but explores only little on what's beneath it. The Great Gatsby actually has something more than just romance, but the film's storyline ambition mostly lies in there. The film mostly glosses at the points that suppose to provide more depth to the story which makes the possible satires of the period feels missing. But the film still has plenty of life. Beginning with the performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is definitely the kind of actor who can perfectly play the role and he did standout to be the better Gatsby than anyone else who portrayed the role. Tobey Maguire did what he usually do in movie but he is fine enough as Nick Carraway, same goes to Carey Mulligan as Daisy. Joel Edgerton steals all of his scenes by his intense performance as Tom Buchanan.<br/><br/>The direction is spectacular however. Baz Luhrmann still perfectly uses his own style to tell the story. There are many extravagantly magnificent sequences, especially the party scenes that works amazingly even in 3D. The style really shows how ambitious this film will be and it transcends the scale which makes it wholly an interesting cinematic ride. Around with visual pleasures, there's the soundtrack and music score also keeping things groovy.<br/><br/>It's hard to deny how enjoyable the experience is, but it could have also taken a higher perspective to the actual story. To be much fair, it did a remarkable job bringing it to the screen in a spectacular way with a cast who are very enthusiastic. While the visuals flare endlessly, the storytelling makes the overall film gripping. It's somewhat disappointing how some of its morality was left as a background even though people will say it's not necessary to take it seriously, but everyone has their own aspect on reading the book. The Great Gatsby is not as satisfying as it deserves but it manages to be incredibly eye candy and thoroughly entertaining."

"jordang73","5","11","15","22 December 2013"," Almost an insult to Fitzgerald
","One of the most beautiful masterpieces of American literature has been unfairly mistreated here, one more time, as Hollywood and literature don't match often. Jesus Christ, whose idea was to cast Tobey Maguire for the role of Nick Carraway? I was just looking to Spiderman all the time, a funny character, childish, and sometimes plain idiotic. It only takes to read one page of the Fitzgerald's book to realize that Nick was a very serious man, almost depressed (as it was Gatsby, being both of them Fitzgerald's alter egos). This is a book about sadness, about the depression that plagued that period in American history. Fitzgerald was one of the most prominent exponents of the Lost Generation, and that's the feeling that the book conveys in a masterful way. This movie, however, looks for the most part (especially the first half of the movie) just like another fancy Hollywood movie, made with the intention to be a blockbuster and nothing else. <br/><br/>The entrance of Gatsby was vague and plain, diminished in front of the background paraphernalia. I can even tolerate the modern electronic music, but all those computer generated scenarios with the fancy camera movements a la Disney are just ridiculous. And of course, you have the speed, the very short shots that don't allow for a meaningful grasp of the situations and the characters. <br/><br/>There are some achievements, however, like some of the acting (I don't think De Caprio is that terrible, is just the entire thing what makes him look not convincing at times) and the girls are OK, as well as Buchanan and other minor characters. The visuals are sometimes pretty good and interesting, if you take off the Disney like stuffs. I understand that the director wanted to do something different, something ironic and postmodern, in the line of Moulin Rouge, but I think that it is just a failure to go that way with this literary masterpiece. It just falls very short, and does not make any justice to the stature of Fitzgerald."
"ccn1-678-790520","Null","84","151","10 May 2013"," 'Gatsby' proves not as great as classic novel
","There comes a time in a director's career when he or she may face one of the seemingly impossible cinematic feats: to make the movie better than the book.<br/><br/>Director Baz Luhrmann accepted this challenge when he signed on to direct a new theatrical take of ""The Great Gatsby."" F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is considered an American literary classic, a staple in high school English courses. To tamper with greatness could spell disaster for the film and disappoint fans. With this in mind, Luhrmann took the details that made the novel so successful and generously applied them to his film.<br/><br/>The result? Beautiful visuals, awkward editing and overblown symbolism.<br/><br/>The adaptation is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), who recounts his adventures on Long Island to a doctor while at a sanatorium. Using word-for-word passages from the novel, Carraway describes his move to New York to try his hand in the bond business. There, he reconnects with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and learns his next-door neighbor is none other than Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), the secretive millionaire known for his lavish parties and fantastical reputation. Little does Carraway know that Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man.<br/><br/>Hoping to live up to its hype, the movie tries to be as fantastic and flawless as Gatsby himself. Servants open doors and move about the house like choreographed dancers. The grand landscapes of New York City and Gatsby's estate look pristine. And the parties are a flapper's dream, with the vibrant outfits and music for dancing (although the occasional rap songs seemed a bit out of place).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the flawlessness stops with the visuals. Reminiscent of ""Moulin Rouge,"" Luhrmann's excessive cuts put cinematic emphasis in all the wrong places. The opening scenes fly by with exaggerated zooming and cutaways that disturb the flow of the script. Yet during the climactic standoff between Gatsby and Daisy's husband, the camera comes to a virtual standstill. Without the dialogue, it would appear no different from any other scene.<br/><br/>The film was also keen to draw on, and overemphasize, some of the novel's best traits. Carraway speaks Fitzgerald's words like poetry, which fans of the book will appreciate. Yet seeing them additionally written on the screen is distracting and unnecessary, no matter how artistic the font is. Likewise, the symbolisms that added such value to the novel do not translate as well on screen. We can only see the green light so many times before its significance starts to fade. <br/><br/>Luckily, the lead performances keep the plot comprehensible even when the camera is having a spaz attack. Few (if any) actors would be better suited as the suave, slightly obsessed Gatsby than DiCaprio. He and Maguire enliven the unlikely relationship between Gatsby and Carraway with their occasional comic relief and intimate conversations. Mulligan also gives a strong portrayal of Daisy and her struggle to choose between Gatsby and her husband.<br/><br/>There is potential for the film to be marginally close to par with the novel. Unfortunately, it gets lost in the pomp of Luhrmann's chaotic editing, which proves what literary purists have been saying all along: Only the book can put the ""great"" in ""The Great Gatsby.""<br/><br/>Stars: *** ½ (out of 5)<br/><br/>Read more: http://www.973radionow.com"

This makes an awful ridiculousness of ""Why didn't he just go to her?"" for years. 2.- After he finally meets her, the entire plot for ENTIRE 30 MINUTES is about her not being able to make up her mind about Gatsby or her husband. 3.- The ""climax"" of the story is when Daisy's husband discovers he used to be poor. He breaks out in rage, and Daisy gets scared. That's it. Most of the story wouldn't mean much without the visuals, and most of the reviews were obviously bought. The only thing that makes the movie bearable was Leonardo Di Caprio's performance. The characters' entire importance and ego based on materialism and money are justified not with interesting deep stories, but with plain image and the love Gatsby felt to ""give her everything"", implying a love story strongly based on materialism."
"Robert_duder","4","34","57","8 June 2013"," Almost the disaster I thought it would be...unnecessary dud
","First of all, let me say that F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is absolutely one of my favourite novels. Additionally, though it has been years since I've seen it, the Robert Redford film was brilliant and I loved it. From the moment I saw the trailers for this version I was heavily skeptical. Heaven knows that someone like Baz Luhrmann needs to make things flashy and extravagant and put a modern twist on a classic story. He did some brilliant work with Romeo and Juliet nearly 20 years ago. However, I was worried and now seeing it it has been confirmed that his version of Great Gatsby is an excessive, chaotic, bright, jazzy mess that completely misses the entire concept of Fitzgerald's classic. The modern day rap music and remixes weren't awful but also weren't necessary either. The elaborate (and admittedly brilliantly done) set pieces of a bizarre almost apocalyptic New York and surrounding area seemed to just take away from a story that should be entirely character driven. The story does mostly follow Fitzgerald's story and yet at the same time completely misses its mark and the pacing felt off entirely. There is no doubt that The Great Gatsby is not an action flick or anything but parts of it dragged.<br/><br/>This is a talented group of people and yet, in my opinion, completely miscast and that includes the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was so miscast as Gatsby and he tries so incredibly hard that it comes off as fake. If I had to hear him excruciatingly and awkwardly say ""Ol' sport"" one more time I was going to scream. DiCaprio is a brilliant actor as long as he has the right role and this was not even close to right for him. He was too young (or at least baby faced), awkward and didn't fit the bill. Same could be said for Tobey Maguire. I don't know why they chose to cast these baby faced actors for the film but it doesn't work. Maguire carries the film decently but just not good enough. Joel Edgerton is probably the best cast in his role as the abrasive, womanizing Tom Buchanan. He is definitely the most watchable and the most convincing in his role. Carey Mulligan carries herself well and certainly has this subtle sexuality that is perfect for Daisy and yet the character comes across as near boring. The chemistry between her and DiCaprio is okay but not timeless and passionate the way it should be between Daisy and Gatsby. The cast work well together but not as good as I think it should have been.<br/><br/>The single issue with this version of The Great Gatsby is that all this flash and jazz has been created without any thought to the true heart of the story. This story is all about greed, pride, obsession, and gluttony and the threads of each one of those is barely existent in this story. I'm actually very surprised that the film is doing as well as it is especially after being delayed for a year before release. One of the most powerful scenes in the original film was Gatsby's death and once again it is handled well, and powerful and its also artistically done. I simply felt that the cast tried far too hard and came across as unconvincing and the film had more modern glitz and glam than was necessary. The pacing was nearly excruciating at times as it stumbled through an otherwise classic story. I had very low expectations going into this and it met those low expectations but barely and did nothing to exceed them. 4/10"

","To walk through the Musee du Louvre and to micturate upon the works of da Vinci, Van Gogh, and Picasso, would compel penectomy as punishment. Yet what has Baz Luhrmann, in his film, The Great Gatsby 3D, done to F.Scott Fitzgerald? And how has the world punished this impious Baztard? It has given him one-hundred and thirty million non-Australian dollars in box office receipts as of May 28th. Such are the economic mysteries of the world--why does money obsessively search out the stupid?<br/><br/>The extent of profaning and desecration is evidence of a mob. But conspiracies are not composed of one. The casting director is a member. There are two such that blame may be diffused--Nikki Barrett and Ronna Kress. A critic may only speculate as to the extent of analingus performed by whom upon whom for the role of Meyer Wolfsheim being given to Amitabh Bachchan. I understand the audience is required to have a level of suspension of disbelief. But the level that is asked in The Great Gatsby 3D is schizophrenia or a level achieved by those who have had ice pick lobotomies. Because of his experience in portraying characters of such depth as Spiderman in Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, Tobey Maguire was given the role of the deepest character, after Gatsby, in Nick Carraway. Mr. Maguire did not fail to show the full two millimeters of depth, piercing the top layer of the epidermis, that he is capable of. He plays the sober Nick Carraway as a bona fide Toby Belch. And why would Carey Mulligan be Daisy Buchanan, when KH is the fatale described to the letter by F.Scott Fitzgerald? It is the voice of Daisy, the sound of money, the voice of a siren that summons a sailor to his death. Miss Mulligan's voice is as beckoning and alluring as an unsolicited, automated telemarketing pitch for life insurance. How many mulligans can be gracefully allowed to this casting director duo? Apparently at least one more because who is Gatsby but Leonardo di Caprio. There is not an iota of facetiousness in Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby. Unfulfilled dreams are sullen and serious in essence. There are plans formed and executed to achieve improbable ends. Nothing is random happenstance. Mr. Capricious, without wearing a buffoon's red nose and a clown's white face paint, makes Gatsby into a whimsical wag. I run out to my balcony and indignantly shout, ""How can this be?"" There are no echoes; there are no voices answering. According to the pigeon hole principle, if you are casting enow straws you will eventually find the right actor for some part by a process of exhaustion. They did. A two-fisted caveman, Joel Edgerton lives a true Tom Buchanan. Ostensibly, Mr. Edgerton might have read the un-pirated Scribner edition of The Great Gatsby."

I saw it in 2D--in 3D it must be impossible to watch. When it isn't in your face it's deadly dull and moves at a snails pace. To make matters worse Maguire is lousy. Totally blank-faced in his role.

","For a while yesterday I'd been wondering whether or not to postpone going to see The Great Gatsby, tempted as I was by the significant amounts of blue sky and sunshine outside. Once the film started, and for the next two hours and twenty something minutes, my thoughts never once strayed to the weather outside. Within minutes of the start I, like Nick Carraway (the film's narrator), was being drawn into the sumptuously glamorous world of 1920's New York high society. The film making is simply astounding. At times the screen seemed filled from corner to corner with both elegance and frivolity. This is, however, a film that's most certainly not 'all visual spectacle' though. Several of the film's main characters were developed in sufficient detail to allow me to form meaningful opinions about them. Without wishing to give away too much, I found The Great Gatsby to have elements of a love story, a tragedy and (last but not least) a critique of a way of life having strong parallels with what is happening (in certain sections of society) in present times. Acting and cinematography are top notch. The 3D is cool. Some of my favourite actors and actresses are in it (DeCaprio, Isla Fisher) as well as some new ones I was impressed by (Elizabeth Debicki). Oh, and did I mention the music? I was the last person out of the auditorium. I simply had to stay and listen 'til the very end of the credits just to hear as much as possible of the amazing musical score. (Make sure you stay for Sia Furler singing Kill and Run at the very end of the credits.) OK. I think I've prattled on enough. I loved it and can't wait to see it again before it ends its run.

","""It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment."" ~ Chapter 6, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald<br/><br/>People, you think you understand the book enough to criticize Luhrmann's movie? Let me begin this review within that heart-breaking note from chapter 6 while I'm telling people how I respect Baz Luhrmann's look at the novel by Scott Fitzgerald. If you've got your own way to dip yourself in the story about Gatsby, this director certainly got his own. And there's no doubt that Baz Luhrmann is a great name because of his own power of expressional adjustment. <br/><br/>Following are 4 main reasons which enable me to vote 10 stars for The Great Gatsby 2013.<br/><br/>1. Music --- I don't know why many people dislike the OST of this movie. I've been listening to Young and Beautiful (L. D. Rey) and Happy Together (Filter) and Back To Black (Beyonce feat Andre)... everyday. For me the music here is quite an intelligent touch to make me feel that the story of Gatsby could absolutely happen in any summer, any era. It's a smart way to link the man named Gatsby of 1920s to every man who was, or who is, or who is going to be 30-year-old. In the novel, Nick Carraway told us many times about this detail, that they - Nick and Gatsby, and Tom Buchanan - were at the same age, 30 year old.<br/><br/>Book, chapter 7: ""What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,"" cried Daisy, ""and the day after that, and the next thirty years?""<br/><br/>2. Cast --- Jay DiCaprio or Leo Gatsby, which name is right? I can't believe if someone else could ever be more brilliant than Leonardo playing Gatsby. And Carey Mulligan is the most beautiful Daisy. I like the whole cast. Tobey Maguire, I totally like him in this movie. There're many bad comments about Luhrmann's choice for Nick Carraway, I can't get their underestimation. Definitely Tobey shows us the real Nick who participated through out the story with an appearance that looks younger than men at his age. I think Tobey, with kind-of-naive eyes and efforts, successfully embodies the best character of Nick. Let's discuss the detail again: men at around 30-year-old. People spend much time drawing the portrait of Gatsby but not many ones can imagine the right picture of Nick, even me. Thanks to Baz Luhrmann, now I remember the eyes of Tobey, the eyes of Nick, and the eyes after the glassed of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.<br/><br/>Book, chapter 2: ""But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.""<br/><br/>3. Sreenplay --- I won't tell much because I don't want this review to be a big spoiler. The only thing I can't help writing about is the green light. Yes, the glamorous green light from Daisy's. You see it at the beginning. It's Baz Luhrman who knows how Gatsby was haunted by that green light. I'm a woman and I don't know much about a man's psychical motivation that leads him to dos and don'ts, but now I can imagine more exhaustively the deceiving hope of Gatsby. And the answer for the question ""Why Gatsby is great?"" may come clearly: it's his primitive love raised by the idea that once a green light is visible you can take it, you will take it at any price. Well, inspired by this I got a wish that every woman could seed such green light into a man to make him as great as Gatsby. And I know Luhrmann's sreenplay makes me love the novel much more.<br/><br/>Book, the end: ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning---- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.""<br/><br/>4. The 3D era --- Everything looks more splendid, more ""real"". But the best impression showed up right at the beginning: the old W. Bros logo dimming out and the introduction in 3D comes, then... the green light appeared! I think about an Oscar statue for best production design. Much appreciate to see a modern film being designed that way in praise of the immortality of a literary classic like The Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>Book, chapter 1: ""If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ""creative temperament""--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness..."""

","Coco Chanel said ""Once you've dressed, and before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take at least one thing off."" This is what Baz should have done. In The Great Gatsby's case, a lot more than one thing should have been taken off or out of this film. It is Over The Top; Bad. Too much fake CGI.<br/><br/>In a major cinema complex in Sydney in Cinema 1 (largest theatre in the complex) on the second night of opening it was bearly one quarter full and even then a whole row of 10 patrons walked out after that silly scene in the underground jazz club.<br/><br/>It is a cacophony of nothingness.

I came to this film with only one preconception; that I was going to be watching a flamboyant piece set in the 20's.<br/><br/>The costumes and sets are stunning, I did not mind the editing, but doing the Charleston to music that was out of time with the dance moves was where I finally drew the line and switched off.<br/><br/>The music was awful not because it is modern music thrown into a period piece but mostly because it is out of time with the editing and movements on screen. It felt like the music soundtrack was produced independently to any of the film making process and then just added without any direction.<br/><br/>Confused how this happened I even thought to myself ""are they trying to be clever and creating an improvised jazz feel of the period"". But even in improvised Jazz the musicians take their cues from one another, whoever added the soundtrack did so without any cues from this film.<br/><br/>It's a shame no one with any sense of timing was involved in the making of this film."

Are we now catering to the vapid generation because they don't wish to read the classics? And if they do manage to crack open a book now and then, is this the way to make literature more palatable?

","The jury has been out on Baz Luhrmann for a long time. A lot of people were won over by the quirky combination of Claire Danes + Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Romeo + Juliet'. Others (myself included) were taken in by the sheer over-the-topness of 'Moulin Rouge'. I recently saw that again and found that it has aged badly. But, I decided to give 'The Great Gatsby' a chance, anyway. I figured, why not? What have I got to lose? Well, apart from the admission price and a few hours of my life, I find that my good memories of the book and of the 1974 version (Robert Redford, Mia Farrow) have been permanently compromised by this piece of rubbish. Let's start with the casting: Tobey Maguire was a mistake, Carey Mulligan was a big mistake, Leo is good. On to the special effects: atrocious! You'd think with this kind of budget, they could do a decent chroma key. Finally, the so-called production design: oh my god, how could they do this to Fitzgerald?!?!?! The whole picture is like an extended hip-hop video, complete with extras and music from more than one specimen of the genre. If someone had only told me that the executive producer is Jay Z, I might have had a chance of saving my time, money and self-respect. Fitzgerald did not deserve to be so rudely travestied. The jury on the Luhrmann case is in: guilty of being a hack."
"stebmarc-592-891931","1","53","95","12 May 2013"," Give Fitzgerald a break and try not to think of him when you watch this
","This movie is DOA, a victim of the colossal misjudgment of whoever thought The Great Gatsby would be a suitable vehicle for 3-D special effects and tried to turn it into a showcase for them. At best they add nothing to this subtle and complex classic and at worst they distract the viewer from the novelist's intent, masking every other theme of the novel behind a garish attempt to overwhelm the viewer with with a stylized vision of the roaring twenties. The actors struggling to compete with this distraction and bring Fitzgerald's characters and themes to life are at a serious disadvantage before they even appear, and Leonardo DiCaprio simply isn't up to the task. His seems to be alternately trying to channel Robert Redford and Marlon Brando, the former being an improvement and the later a particularly inappropriate source of confusion about the character. Gatsby is supposed to be an enigma, but this is ridiculous. And when those resources seem unable to sustain him, he drifts off into something more reminiscent of Orson Wells, an impersonation that is way out beyond his ability, though in harmony with his bloated and dissipated appearance. The silly device of scattering bits of text into the snow or rain and then assembling them to float in front in front of the screen is no competition for Sam Waters sensitive reading of the same texts. The interjection of a psychoanalytical frame story to explicate Nick's character would be totally unnecessary if a more suitable and capable actor than Tobey Maguire had been cast. I went home and watched the 1974 version, which I had underestimated. In contrast Sam Waters, Robert Redford and Karen Black were nothing less than brilliant. Poor Fitzgerald. What a disservice. But the novel is pretty much indestructible and will live to fight another day, even if it lost this battle."
"leah_zero","7","25","41","15 May 2013"," Some thoughts from a Fitzgerald fan.
","I am a great fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing, which I think is some of the finest literature that exists in English. Adapting it to film necessarily loses some of the magic of his words. I'm too young to have seen the 1974 film, so I came to this without preconceptions of how Gatsby could be adapted to the screen.<br/><br/>This is a complementary piece of art that sometimes captures what's hinted at in the novel, yet falls short of its richness and depth. It is, however, a visual feast, and comes across as a tenderly crafted love letter to the novel and to the Roaring Twenties.<br/><br/>Nick Carraway is a framing device for Gatsby's story as he is in the novel, but here he's in a sanatorium, recounting his season at West Egg for his psychiatrist by writing it out in a journal. This device allows for showing off some of Fitzgerald's evocative sentences--including, of course, the famous final line of the novel. There's also a clever scene where Nick amends the title of his just-completed novel, which is one of those bits that was not in the original novel yet somehow captures its spirit.<br/><br/>There are transcendent moments throughout the film--Jay and Daisy reuniting is gloriously funny and painful, the ""beautiful shirts"" scene is breathtaking, and the final argument between Jay and Tom in the hotel is a powder keg of tension that's impossible to look away from--but there is also a disappointing sense of literalness when it comes to symbolism.<br/><br/>For example, the film opens on a silent shot of the infamous green light at the end of Daisy's dock. I thought, ""Good, so they're going to allude to it subtly and leave the audience to figure out what it means.""<br/><br/>But no. The film then proceeds to beat the viewer over the head with that green light. It felt like sitting in a high school English class and painstakingly hashing out the theme until the slowest kid in the class got it. Fitzgerald, I think, would have cringed at such ham-fisted repetition. It felt like an editing mistake to me--at least two or three of those green light shots should have been dropped.<br/><br/>Technical annoyances: the hyperactive camera, especially in the first act, which refuses to stay still on a shot even in a languid scene like dinner with the Buchanans. This had the effect of blurring and fragmenting the lavish sets, which is a shame, since they deserved to be pored over and savored. It also made me feel a bit drunk, which was probably the point. But that kind of visual metaphor tends to annoy me more than anything. I know what ""drunk"" is like. You don't need to show me with camera movements.<br/><br/>The tragic climax is also somewhat spoiled by ostentation. What comes across as brutal and shocking in the original novel is here transformed into a drawn-out, grotesquely sentimental event, complete with choppy slow-motion. (What is with the choppy slow-mo, by the way? Why not just shoot in high-speed and slow it down smoothly? I can only assume it was used for aesthetic effect, but to me it came across as cheapening.)<br/><br/>These complaints aside, I found a lot to like in this film. The acting was incredible, particularly Joel Edgerton's insufferable Tom. Carey Mulligan's eyes deserve an Oscar. Leonardo DiCaprio is by turns magnetic and pathetic. And Tobey Maguire brings a quality of innocence and wonder to the film, which grades slowly and elegantly into disillusionment, disappointment, and despair. It was gutsy to end on a note of pure sorrow, and I applaud Luhrmann for taking that risk.<br/><br/>This is a good, solid adaptation that respects its source material (if not quite trusting the audience to get it). It isn't flawless, but it's clearly loving of and intimate with Fitzgerald's work, and that counts for a lot, in my book.<br/><br/>Oh, and that soundtrack. Masterful. Jay-Z was a brilliant choice. The parallels between modern hip-hop culture and Jazz Age flappers are obvious."

","Don't waste your money. Rather than conveying the excess of the time, this film is brimming with trite costume and set design, and more than anything - has some really bad acting. Obvious and boring. The actors are not compelling. Ms. Mulligan is so bad, she sounds and looks as it she has been dubbed by another actor. Plus, she is simply not attractive enough in appearance or delivery to convince anyone that she is a love interest. The Myrtle character truly looks like a cartoon. The sets look as if they have been computer generated, which I think they were. The first long shot to Gatsby's house looks amateurish, as if a film student has built a model. And then filmed it. The film contains one cliché after another. Loud does not equal fascinating. Very, very disappointing. This film makes the Redford version look like a masterpiece."

"Gizmo967","10","34","59","17 May 2013"," This is one of true examples of masterpiece and best possible example of purest form of love!
","Can't repeat the past? ...of course you can!<br/><br/>This will be my first review containing spoilers because right now I want to write about everything that I saw in this movie!<br/><br/>First of all let me start by saying that this is definition of masterpiece movie. Words just can't describe how beautiful this movie is, in every way possible. Story, acting, dynamic, visuals, music.. everything. It's crafted to be masterpiece and I applaud Baz Luhrmann. I don't know for how long he had this vision, but I get feeling he's been waiting for technology so that he could make his perfect vision of this classic.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I've had review written in my head. Up to a point where everything goes downhill, I've had thoughts like ""Best love story ever""""; """"If love could be shown it's Great Gatsby"".. Those were my thoughts, not taken quotes. Actually, even after that point in the movie, I still think those things. Leonardo DiCaprio brought one of his best performances ever. I believed every second in his love and pain that he felt. Love that Gatsby showed for Daisy was pretty much perfect. If true, purest love, could be shown, it was in Gatsby's eyes.<br/><br/>Sadly, I have to admit that I have never read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, it was never mandatory in my school and I have missed it. People always say that book is always better than movie adaptation, but if book is even close to the movie, it's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Up to a point where Gatsby and Daisy are about to declare love to Tom, you get feeling that I could end there, with a happy end. But the very moment when Daisy moves hand from Gatsby, you get a feeling that it can't end well. After they go to town, and when they are in hotel room, entire time I was waiting for Tom to do something bad. Make a scene, hit Gatsby, even kill him. But no, that's not what happened. He chose to fight for her the only way he could win, with arguments and memories. He gave her freedom and fought for her. I hated Tom but at that point, I completely understood why she couldn't say she ever loved him. After Tom's mistress is hit and killed, you can see that Tom actually loved his wife and mistress, despite being a scumbag.<br/><br/>Nick Carraway has described Gatsby best. He said that he has not seen a man as hopeful as he is. And point where he's waiting for her call and slightly losing his faith is amazing. Nick's call at the end could not have happened in more perfect moment. Gatsby died happy thinking she called after all. He died having his faith. Entire cinema was quite after the movie ended, I guess everyone was in their mind rethinking movie, as I was. Even though extremely sad and tragic, I didn't feel too sad. I think he got what he wanted just before he died, and it would destroy him completely if he survived and she didn't call. Love, dream, future.. they would all have died in one day.<br/><br/>Gatsby from the beginning of the movie is portrayed excellently. As a mystery man, but you can sense that he's much more than what you see. Slowly discovering real character layer by layer was excellent. I was so excited to see what it was all about. The real story behind him. And it was biggest love story ever written.<br/><br/>Cast was perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio has done his best role in my opinion. Oscar nomination for him is a must, if not win! Carey Mulligan has showed class once again. Although not definition of beauty, there's something in her that makes you want to hug and protect her, and love her. Perfect for the role she played. Once again top performance after Drive. Tobey Maguire - I just love this guy. His performance was maybe crucial to gluing the entire cast and making it all fluid and connected. Joel Edgerton was fantastic. I could not hate him even though I wanted to, so much. His character I mean.<br/><br/>Soundtrack of this movie is most talked thing about, and it's deserved. It had huge influence on the entire movie and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Visuals of this movie are perfect. So much color, design, it's perfect. You have to see this in 3D, if you don't, you'll miss out on a lot! Trust me!<br/><br/>Overall I find this perfect example of masterpiece. If I ever want to see a movie about love, it won't be Notebook but The Great Gatsby. True definition and example of purest form of love. Now I'm going to go and read the novel. I don't want to forget about Gatsby soon. And soundtrack will be playing in my love for a long time."

"cornflakeboy20","6","74","142","9 May 2013"," Moulin Rouge in the 20s
","Watching Gatsby, one gets the impression that Baz wanted to remake Moulin Rouge! In 3D and couldn't find a good way to retrofit it, so made a non-musical story on similar themes, using some of the exact same camera shots. However, the movie is not as gaudy or over-the-top as I fear/hoped it would be. But it does feature cartoonish elements that distract from the seriousness of the overall story.<br/><br/>The first point are the performances. Often, when modern actors try to imitate old fashioned acting styles, they fail miserably. Often this is the case with actresses doing mannered/expressive acting common in the 30s and 40s. However, the actresses in this movie do a better job than the actors. The only flaw is that some characters, especially Daisy (who really is a shallow and symbolic character) are presented with much greater depth than they were meant to possess. Meanwhile, Tobey Maguire gives a performance so mawkishly earnest and cornball, he's sometimes like something out of a Capra movie. Leo DiCaprio looks better than he has lately in a Redford-esque role, but his accent is all over the place (could it be that he's a self made invention or just can't master an accent? We don't know). His pronunciation of ""Old Sport"" is jarring. And while the movie keeps telling us he has charisma, he does not project enough of it. Joel Edgerton, as Tom, is giving a performance as a type of man seldom seen in modern movies and does his level best, but we are never quite sure what to make of him. He seems at turns goofy, villainous and sympathetic. The scenes of Tobey and Leo together highlight the sublimated homoerotic tension many people have discerned in the book. It's almost like they're picking up where they left off with their quasi romance in This Boy's Life.<br/><br/>Secondly, overwhelming all else is the camera-work and atmosphere. The 3D is occasionally distracting, but also brilliant in bringing out small details, like the exquisite sets and costuming and tiny elements like confetti or pearls. The photography can also overwhelm the Moulin Rouge! party scenes and make certain elements look cartoonish (when you see people hanging out of cars it's reminiscent of the weasels in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?). I would not have wanted to see this movie in 2D, or certainly not on the small screen, because of the visual treats I might miss. I'm not sure it would be a different movie entirely. The incorporation of modern music is not overly distracting, and done in a similar way to Marie Antoinette, with modern music simply played over a period scene with period dances. I wouldn't say that any particular song is moving or evocative enough to rise to the level of great uses of song in romantic films, but it's also not terribly distracting. The use of rap music does highlight gaudiness and false showy glamor, as opposed to stately tasteful wealth. And in a sense, Jay Gatsby does represent this factor, so it sort of works.<br/><br/>The adaptation of the book seems fairly reverent in every regard except what I have mentioned about modern music and crazy camera work. <br/><br/>It was hard to get a read off the preview audience, and I think this movie will be divisive. In the 70s, they did a big budget version of Great Gatsby, trying to make it the new Gone With the Wind, and it failed. Here, a 100+ million effort at combining Titanic and Moulin Rouge! could also be an Ishtar level disaster. On the other hand, I think when you get sucked into the world of the film, it really works. And as in Moulin Rouge!, repeated viewings might take some of the shock out of cartoony or jarring elements and bring out the human, small touches that really won me over."

Of course, does anyone read anymore or do they rely upon no- talent actors and sensationalist directors to interpret literature so they may spare those precious hours required to actually enjoy a book for video games, cell phones, and reality television?

"ironhorse_iv","7","13","20","9 June 2013"," It's probably the best Great Gatsby movie, old sport.
","I think everybody has read this book during high school. I don't know why they want us to read it, but it probably has to do with it being a linguistically sophisticated, intellectually teaching about the political, moral, and social fabric of our nation. In my opinion, it's not the greatest American masterwork novel of all times and no way represented how the people should seek the American Dream. I have to say, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was a better novel than this. I read the book, but 'The Great Gatsby' wasn't never sacrosanct to me. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald 'This Side of Paradise' was a better novel than this. Still, I did like Great Gatsby in an odd way because it was a cautionary tale. How faithful is Baz Luhrmann's movie 'The Great Gatsby' is to F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. In my opinion, it somewhat follows the novel. Nick Carraway (Tobey McGuire) is an upstanding young man from the Midwest, moves to New York to seek his fortune in the bond business. He rents a cottage on Long Island, next to a mansion occupied by a man of mysterious origins but manifest wealth: Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), known far and wide for his extravagant parties. One day he is invited to his party, and learns his deepest secret. Everything he has work up for, was designed to attract the attention of his first love: the beautiful Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who happens to be Nick's cousin and marry to an unpleasant cheater of a husband, Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). He pursuits her, only leading to tragic results. The movies does well in establishing a lot of F. Scott Fitzgerald themes. Such in the case toward the end, in the hollowness of morals of the upper class and how greed decayed social and moral values. The film makes great use of the Green light that represent Gatsby's hope and dreams of the future, and the Eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg that represent God. The visuals in the film are stunning. The movie did change a few things in the story that work and didn't work. The biggest changes of the story is that of Nick Carraway, who in the film is not in a relationship with Jordan Baker. I didn't miss that part of the novel so much in the film, as it really does freed up space in the film to focus more on Gatsby and Daisy. Fitzgerald did devoted a lot of work to Nick and Jordan's relationship which was sadly cut. It would have been nice to add on the end of the film, rather than the depressing ending, the film put out there. The movie does reveal some of Gatsby's past way too soon in the film as it is repeated yet again toward the end. It would have been stronger to reveal his past toward the end, for a bigger reaction from the audience. The biggest problem with the film is while Fitzgerald's book always feels very much a product of a particular period in time, Luhrmann's work always seems like one grand costume party, irrevocably modern and full of rap music. This movie reminds me, too much of 2001's Moulin Rouge. Rather than having good songs like Moulin Rouge had, this just had badly made contemporary music. In no way does Jay-Z rapping help this film with the 1920's feel. I could have done without all the rap music. I just didn't feel it adding anything to it and seem out of place. I do like the Jazz score. In every film, he directs, Director Baz Luhrmann can really make a party seen fun, but gees, this are the most unrealistic parties I ever witness. F. Scott Fitzgerald 'The Great Gatsby' was very humorless. At less, Baz add a bit of humor to it. While Luhrmann's film is loud, bright, vivid extravaganza of color, action, and drama in 3D. The film could cut down a bit on the CGI & 3D; and focus more on the story. The 1974's Great Gatsby served Fitzgerald's novel better even if it's a bit slow then this. The acting in this 2013 film is great. DiCaprio was perfect as Gatsby. He plays the character exactly how he is in the novel. Still, could have there been a scene where he doesn't call somebody, Old sport for once. Joel Edgerton and Carey Mulligan were great in their role. Tobey McGuire was pretty OK, but since his character was cut down a lot when not talking to Gatsby. He didn't have much acting to do, besides walking around and watch people. About the characters. Yes, it's about rich people having parties. So it might be hard to identify with any of the characters, as most of them have little to no redeeming values besides many Nick Carraway. They can all be a bit unlikeable. Let's remember the film and book shows the lack of empathy is in New York society. Nick and Gatsby are the only ones who show any empathy in the film. It's the carelessness that is being criticized here and their lack of morality. That is what makes the book so great. In my opinion, the film works because of that, so if you ever get the chance. Watch this film and learn what makes Gatsby, so great."

","Well now, I was taken aback by how tragically bad this movie was. Let me start with some positive things before I go on berating it. First, visually this movie is captivating beyond words. Now I went and saw it in 3D (not necessary) and I think it would have been better in a standard format. Now the acting. I felt like everyone acted their part well, aside from Toby McGuire who has such an unlikable feature for me (his acting) that I wish he could just disappear from cinema altogether. The female parts were just.. OKAY, they felt a little watered down for me. Really I honestly enjoyed the book, and have liked one or two of the film adaptations that were done in the past but this one just missed it completely. You cant put Leonardo DiCaprio, in the lead role and it automatically makes the film good, although I think that may be some directors thoughts. The pacing in the movie is just weird. Its like you are literally getting all of the sour parts of the book, being pumped up by some visual effects, trying their best to woo you over. Well needless to say at 2hrs and 20 min, it completely missed me. The Dialogue seems patched together and last minute, none of it ever seems generic. But WORST OF ALL is the MUSIC.... I absolutely can not stand non period music in a period film. For instance, the movie takes place in the 20's and they have Jay-z and ""Dub step"" slathered all over this thing. And its so thick you feel like your drenched in it by the time you leave the theater. In all honesty, this film was one that I wanted to leave half way through, and by the time the end credits rolled I wished that I had. Don't see it, and sure as hell do NOT waste your money and pay too much by going to a theater."

","This doesn't happen often, but we left the cinema after 45 minutes; Irritated about the rape of Scott Fitzgerald's fantastic narrative. It wasn't only that the characters where unlikable (I couldn't feel a grain of the empathy I felt when I was reading the novel, and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway is an awful cast), but the director thought it needed gang-rap during the lavish parties in the Gatsby mansion gang-rap? during the roaring 20's? That felt like if sir Lancelot would appear, mounted and in full attire, during the maze-scene of ""the shining""; quite ""Monty Pyton-ish"" indeed I advise all people whom are not 16yo girls (or feel like one) to avoid this movie.

","A remake of a remake of a remake of a novel that pretty much every high school in America includes in its curriculum is not an easy legacy, but I think Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic job of tackling the material. His somewhat flashy, story-driven methods give the novel life in a way that's never been seen before. I'm not going to compare it to the other remakes, because that feels redundant and pointless, but insofar as the book goes, it was a great adaptation. The director stuck close to the author's intent and really got the audience invested in these characters. The cast gave a great performance, with Mulligan and Clarke going above and beyond. Maguire, as usual, is unintentionally comedic in some of his expressions, but as someone who is not a fan, I thought he did pretty well. The sets, costumes, music...everything was flashy and exuberant and perfectly matched the mood of the movie. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people are complaining about the soundtrack, but that was one of my favorite things about the film. Luhrmann didn't even try to stay period appropriate, because The Great Gatsby is a novel that transcends the time it was placed in. By using contemporary artists, he was able to effectively position the film in the audience's mind as something they could relate to. To borrow and roughly paraphrase a quote from the book/movie, the soundtrack invited them within, even as they were without. I'll admit, he made a few missteps where the music just flat-out took the viewer out of the movie entirely (a certain Jay-Z number comes to mind), but overall, it was a brilliant directing choice. <br/><br/>I'll also say that the movie ran a bit long, with certain parts feeling overdone and unnecessary. I watched it in 3D, which I would not recommend unless you really, really love 3D. The movie is visually stunning and does not need the added dimension; in fact, I'd go so far as to say it hurts the tone of the film. That said, it was a great film and I would definitely recommend it."
"Manal1987","10","10","15","23 June 2013"," Fitzgerald Passes It Over to Luhrmann The ""Great"" Great Gatsby.
","It's usually on the second viewing of any film that I turn from the innocent audience member into the scrutinizing critic. I save the first viewing for total absorption in the movie. My first viewing of The Great Gatsby was quite an euphoric experience. Nevertheless, I don't expect everyone to love the movie the way I did because at the end of the day it's a matter of tastes and interests. All I'm trying to do here is to give you some reasons why I think Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is an exceptional film.<br/><br/>Let's start from F. Scott Fitzgerald's book. Most people have read the novel at some point in their lives. The Great Gatsby stands as a literary landmark in the history of American literature because it not only incarnates Fitzgerald' smart and swift style but also levels harsh criticism against the American highlife in the early twentieth century and iconically presents the complexity of the human psyche. Whether you like or hate the novel, do not let your judgment transform to prejudice, because Luhrmann's adaptation is a unique work of art that uses its literary source merely as a preliminary structure. That's why I will not get into useless comparisons and contrasts.<br/><br/>The film has the unmistakable, authentic stamp of Baz Luhrmann an audio-visual feast for the senses. The extraordinarily picturesque quality of the film gives the story a visual edge that doesn't exist in the original text. Luhrmann's exuberant camera movements and his use of luscious colors and extravagant visual techniques create a sensuous atmosphere and succeed in conveying the lavish lifestyle of the American upper-class. Regarding the music (which I believe is not less important than direction, performance.. etc.), Luhrmann follows his genius habit of mashing up modern music and customizing it to old settings. In The Great Gatsby, his musical choices are BRILLIANT in the sense that they cover a wide range of genres including jazz and hip-hop (I never thought that one project would bear the names of both Fitzgerald and Jay Z!). The songs fit the film and its themes perfectly. They also give the story human depth and help in extending the movie horizontally by relating the mad 1920s to our 21st century. Honestly, the soundtrack needs a review of its own. Having a character of their own and contributing to the significance of the story, Lurhmann's image and music both join hands in fully engaging the audience's senses and hearts.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding! Do I need to say more? The guy never seizes to surprise me with his ever-maturing acting skills and his great selectivity (I still can't believe he's the same Jack Dawson I used to despise). Not many actors are capable of choosing their roles that wisely. In the film, DiCaprio breathes life into Fitzgerald's tragic hero and manages to capture all his charm and misery. Similarly, Joel Edgerton stands out as the oppressively dominating Tom Buchanan. As for Carey Mulligan (playing Daisy), I do believe she is a beautiful and talented actress; however, I don't think she was the right one for the role. She shows an overacted emotional involvement that contradicts with her character's deeds. The rest of the cast were definitely lovely.<br/><br/>Back to Luhrmann, I believe that he deserves more credit for his bold choices and his ability to defy all the snobbish voices that frown upon modern adaptations of canonical literary works. His first adaptation, Romeo+Juliet, made his point clear. His second, The Great Gatsby, sets his own cult.<br/><br/>Again, I don't expect anyone to love the film the way I did. But for me, a good film is the one that makes you hate going back to reality after watching it... the one that makes you wish it lasted a bit longer. Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is definitely one."

","After reading it my first year in college and being completely mesmerized, I wasn't completely thrilled with the 1974 version (critics agreed). Mia Farrow's performance was a bit over the top, but the movie, as a whole, captured the magic, sadness and despair of the book. (Karen Black & Sam Waterston were the standout performances.) <br/><br/>But this? I could barely watch it all in one sitting, it was that bad. Poorly acted. Poorly representative of the book, and rap and modern music? It is just pure, disrespectful garbage. DiCaprio's performance was a joke and totally unbelievable. He obviously never read the book, or he was completely unable to glean any of the emotion or meaning of his character from it. I actually laughed hysterically at how poor his performance was at times. <br/><br/>The only saving grace of this movie (or the reason for the single star) was Carey Mulligan's performance. While I don't think she portrayed Daisy correctly in any way (not fragile enough), she is always a joy to watch. <br/><br/>And to IMDB, if you are worried about ""spoilers"" with regard to The Great Gatsby? I realize it's on every title, but if you don't know the story by now, that's a very sad testament to this great piece of literature. It certainly was greatly disrespected by this director and TPTB who made this travesty. Fitzgerald is spinning in his grave."

","The Great Gatsby glides into my top 5 movies of the year.The setting is New York in the 1920's post world war 1 and wall street is bustling with activity.The rich,the elite,the actors and anyone popular are all invited to larger than life parties.Their host is an elusive figure going by the name Gatsby.Gatsby,Gatsby who is this Gatsby?He is the name on everyone's lips yet little is known about him.Rumors circulate about him,who he is and what he does.He is hardly even seen by anyone.Leonardo Di Caprio plays Jay Gatsby a suave rich businessman with a colorful past.I am a Leo fan and once again loved his performance and enjoyed his rendition of Gatsby.Nick Carraway(Toby Maguire) is a young ambitious man who is a writer of sorts but currently looking to invest in bonds.He happens to end up as Gatsby's neighbor and gets a surprise invite to one of Gatsby's parties.The real reason for that invite(and the parties) is revealed later.Nick is the cousin of a beautiful woman called Daisy(Carey Mulligan),Gatsby's past love life.The two fell in love when they met but the war meant Gatsby was separated from her for five years.In the meantime Daisy marries Tom Buchanan(Joel Edgarton).Nick is roped in by Gatsby to re-introduce her to Daisy who has been ignoring Gatsby's parties.It was amusing to see that when the two meet again,an impeccable and charismatic Gatsby stutters,falters nervously and sits in uncomfortable silence-A total transition.The movie is all about how he tries to re-ignite the flame between him and Daisy and how they have to tussle with Tom,her current husband.All this as Nick the silent observer watches on.<br/><br/>What can I say about the acting?It was superlative.It was the first time I got to catch Joel Edgerton and the pretty Carey Mulligan and their acting prowess and screen presence was amazing.Toby Maguire was brilliant and this role should be a renewal of sorts to his career.Leo as always was outstanding.There is even a cameo from Amitabh Bachchan(He had a centric role to the plot,wish there was more of him though).<br/><br/>What is enjoyable is the development and the depth of every character.Finally it's about whether or not you give a damn about the characters and what happens to them and in this case you totally do.At 142 mins it's reasonably long,but it never felt so.Time flies when you have fun they say.I was totally absorbed in the world interested to know what happens next.The narration(it's Nick recalling) is superb and told with a thrilling touch.Now the sound element-The score was apt and well made,it would rise with cadence whenever things got tense.The dialogues are exceptional.Beautiful story telling.<br/><br/>In all I have n't enjoyed any movie this year this much since 'Silver Linings' and i think you should n't give this movie a miss-It may turn out to be one of your all time favourites."

","The newest adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's vastly well known novel, is directed by Baz Luhrmann, staring Leonardo DI Caprio as Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as daisy and Tobey Maguire as nick caraway.<br/><br/>Most people will know the plot but for those that don't.....Nick caraway moves to new york trying to become a stockbroker in the mid 1920's but instead of working finds himself caught up alcohol fueled parties that were rife in the city. He moves into his modest apartment next to a huge mansion, who he is told belongs to the mysterious Gatsby. Gatsby throws huge parties often for the general public to enjoy, Nick attends one of these parties and ends up befriending Gatsby. As their friendship grows, Gatsby becomes more trusting in Nick and asks if he can invite his cousin daisy Buchanan round for tea, so he can ""bump""into her. It turns out that the married Daisy and the the rather unknown Gatsby fell in love when they were young and have held a candle for each other ever since. The question is does it do justice to the book?<br/><br/>The answer unfortunately is a resounding no! i have seen this film 4 or 5 times and each time my dislike of it has grown. It's hard to know where to start with this film, there are so many negative views i have on it. The film is made with huge house, big parties and fancy clothing, in true baz Luhrmann style that is all the substance you get. Carey mulligan is mind numbingly boring as daisy and not interesting at all. However the performance i have the biggest problem with is Tobey Maguire who narrates the story and it is seen through his eyes, i spent the entire film wanting to knock him out as i felt he was nothing more than a ""scrape"" and a bit annoying. There is no sense of the time period at all, with a bizarre modern day soundtrack booms out, which are good songs but not for The Great Gatsby, this makes the film feel like it is set in a club in the 21st century. Luhrmann goes for deeply emotional scenes and completely fails in my opinion. The one very dimly light shining light is Di Caprio in his Disney themed mansion, who gives a performance far better than anyone else<br/><br/>This fantastic piece of American literature has been attempted as a film many times and success has not really been found as of yet. This is an extremely hard book to make into a good film you can give Luhrmann that but not much else. This isn't the worst film i have seen but because of how well known it is and expected it was, this bad piece of filmaking will never be forgotten!"

Are we really supposed to believe that this supernaturally great man harbours these intense feelings that form his every action for an irritating vacuous fairy who is young enough to be his daughter? There is nothing great about this Gatsby(hey director, you can't just list a load of unbelievable facts to make someone appear great, you have to show it through their behaviour and develop their personality)and the couple display no attraction towards one another. I've seen more passion in 2 pieces of cardboard. DiCaprio has been in some decent films since casting off his titanic scar. This performance will put him back years. That first scene where he appears flashing his teeth like some kind of demigod made me physically retch, which kept happening each time that he was on-screen. Surely his worst ever film, in fact the worst film of all, with or without him, that I can remember, and I've seen some bad ones. This has no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","3","19","34","5 June 2013"," What a disappointing Aussie-American production.
","The Great Gatsby was The Great Disappointment of the summer. It has all the problems of Baz Luhrmann's Australia, the bad moments of Moulin Rouge (if there were ever that many in the first place) and the 20s never looked so odd in 3D, especially when Jay-Z provides some exclusive music for the movie.<br/><br/>Everything from the music to the characters is just wrong. The pacing is literally out of the window by the middle of the movie. It's like Baz only saw the first half of the film and didn't continue editing the film after that. It's like somebody at Warner Brothers hired another editor who followed their bizarre orders and made the film an even clunkier mess.<br/><br/>Now before you assume that I'll criticize every aspect of the movie, hear me out. There were some GREAT moments in the film; the scene where Daisy is invited to tea with Gatsby at Nick's house, was great. It's such a shame that the film was bogged down in an over expository monologue by the once great Spiderman star Toby Maguire. His character is just as thin as his interpretation of Peter Parker in Spiderman 3. <br/><br/>Leonardo was the star of the film. His performance was the only three dimensional part of the movie. He is a man who has everything except the girl of his dreams, Daisy. His character gradually lost the charm towards the end of the film and he shows the bitter side of himself. There's no real mystery to The Great Gatsby. He is a millionaire who can't buy a better life. He has to pursue his real dream, which money cannot buy. We've seen that so many times in so many other movies and stories in general. Bruce Wayne, anyone? Citizen Kane? Ring any bells?<br/><br/>The 3D was effective but of all the periods in history that would suit 3D, the 1920s was not the first thing that popped up in my mind. It adds nothing to the film, but actually makes it worse. It's just an empty visual gimmick that's unfortunately embedded in the Hollywood system nowadays. 3D does not add depth to character, just what's in front of the camera. Avatar showed the problems of emphasizing 3D over story. Regardless, Avatar still captured a sense of scale that is extremely hard to capture in 3D. Sometimes 3D reduces the scale of stories because everything is so close, yet the film gets smaller somehow. There's too much of an emphasis on visuals instead of the deeper meaning of the story or the characters. This smaller scale worked beautifully with Life of Pi. Everything was up close and there wasn't anything that distracted you from the story. You were there with the characters.<br/><br/>However, this is not the case here. The audience caring for the characters except for Gatsby is simply not there. The 3D put a dent in what could have been a better film had Baz Luhrmann NOT made it. The 3D was distracting, everything from the scale of the story to the depth of the world was completely gone. You could have watched this in 2D and it still would have been the same disappointing experience.<br/><br/>If there was one problem over all of them combined, it was the pacing of the film. Moulin Rouge had an eccentric pace and was edited in an eccentric manner. It worked for that movie, but by the time Australia came out, it didn't work that well. With The Great Gatsby, the editing of Moulin Rouge was there at the beginning of the film, but that energetic editing just vanished after the tea time scene between Gatsby and Diasy. The pacing was replaced with slow and many tedious false endings that followed. I refuse to spoil the movie for those of you who've never heard of The Great Gatsby, but I can say this; you're going to be bored to tears that you'll be persuaded to walk out of the cinema.<br/><br/>Not a good film, not rock bottom of the barrel either, but still bad nonetheless. I recommend that you wait for Man of Steel to come out, the next big film to come out this summer. Don't see The Great Gatsby unless you're interested to see what the hell everyone was going on about, and see if the fuss made any sense."

","This piece of garbage provides accurate insights into the crudeness and obsession with immediate gratification that now characterize American popular culture, but conveys absolutely nothing of the heart and soul of the novel, or the era it depicts. Gatsby's first encounter with Daisy is pathetic enough when compared to Redford/Farrow (1974)and Ladd/Field (1949), but the garish party scene where Nick first meets Gatsby is meant to appeal to the basest mentalities, and nothing more. There wasn't enough good music, and enough style, during the 1920's that hip hop and rap need to be injected here? Give me a break. For the reviewers who praised DeCaprio's performance, I can only shake my head in bewilderment. A.O. Scott's review in The New York Times, which includes this gem, ""the best way to enjoy the film is to put aside whatever literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you."" is an insult to the intelligence of any high school senior taking AP English, let alone self respecting adults who have loved the book from its opening pages.

","This movie...I wanted to like it. Honest. There is much that is good, such as the costumes and attention to visual detail in background props. Also, it's fair to say performances are solid. No award winners here, but the actors didn't cause any issues. Music, however... I'm sorry. It sucked. The music was 80% modern rap and hip-hop, with 20% period instrumentation and style. Hip-hop sung as 20's jazz is still hip-hop. And it does NOT belong in a period piece. So not only did I hate the music now, but in just a few short years, this movie will have no relevance because the music will sound like it came from the 'teens. People watching this for the first time in 2022 (only 8 years from today) will feel how 2012-ish this music is. If you're doing a period piece, then use period music! Perhaps you have the Hot Young Stars of Today perform the music, but if you have a period piece, use period music! Please! Also, there were a series of car driving and car chase scenes that helped to blow the movie for me. The image doesn't sync up with the conversation at ALL. And in every driving scene the cars seem to be driving 100 mph (that's 161 kph for my friends in the rest of the world). The car scenes were so unrealistic, I would rather they didn't even show them at all. A block of text saying ""car driving"" and the dialogue voiced over would have been a great improvement. I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But it's pretty bad. Don't bother watching it."
"bkoganbing","7","8","12","30 July 2013"," Good film, bad musical score
","Only a poor soundtrack filled with contemporary music spoiled this latest version of The Great Gatsby for me. In a tradition of blond Gatsbys, Leonardo DiCaprio steps into the shoes of Alan Ladd and Robert Redford in essaying the part of the social climbing bootlegger from the Roaring Twenties. All that will make Jay Gatsby's life complete is the love of Daisy Buchanan whom he courted before his service in World War I. The problem is that she's slightly married to upper class Tom Buchanan. Daisy is played by Carey Mulligan and Buchanan is played by Australian player Joel Edgerton.<br/><br/>In fact except for DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway the whole cast is mostly Australian which is to be expected since most of the production was shot there. I have to say that the Australian studio did a marvelous job in recreating New York of the Twenties and the ritzy and glamorous part of Long Island where most of the story takes place.<br/><br/>As the book is written in the person of Nick Carraway it was also a good move to have Maguire narrate the story. Tobey's narration gives us the background of the story and Carraway's character functions as he should.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job playing the social climbing Gatsby who weaves his own legend as he gives fabled parties on Long Island where the illegal liquor flows freely. Beneath his self assurance there is a bit of a frightened edge like this is all going to be taken away from him so enjoy while you can. <br/><br/>Perhaps the producers thought that no one would see a film with old music in it. There is some there, Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue comes to mind. But the contemporary music on the soundtrack is jarring and out of place.<br/><br/>But overall this is a good telling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of the Roaring Twenties."

This latest adaption has only two things going for it: it is visually beautiful and the actors are well-matched with their roles. Its positive aspects stop there. The irony of this adaption is that it seems to miss the point of the novel. The Great Gatsby is about the superficial lives led by the rich, yet this is one of the most superficial films I've ever seen. It's all about appearance, with so many frills and pretentiously artsy touches that the heart and emotion of the story itself are less powerful than they could be. The uneven pacing of the story makes it difficult to watch. It whirls through most of the story, and only occasionally screeches to a halt for some important scenes, as well as some unnecessary ones.

The characters seem flat and function more as caricatures as opposed to unique souls. As such, it is difficult to relate to them and be drawn into their lives. Oddly enough, it is the dialogue, the interactions, between these stick figures that give the story its dimensions and depth. We are drawn to their drama and gossip, anxiously awaiting for their demise.<br/><br/>I'll be honest: I was irked and confused by the decision for ""Gatsby"" to be in 3D; but after watching it in 3D, I truly believe that there is no other way to watch this movie. The 3D effects aren't special, but the artistic choice for 3D parallels the book's tone. As the audience, we are reading/watching 2-dimensional characters fighting and dancing their way through a pop-up book, which is ironically as superficial as the characters themselves.<br/><br/>The various settings of the novel are beautifully rendered in the movie with lavish use of CGI, lushly colored costumes, and grandiose spectacles of money flexing.<br/><br/>Although the characters are despicably shallow and morally ambiguous, their portrayals were respectfully done. Tobey Maguire's accent is a bit distracting and inconsistent at times, but as the ""want-to-be"" outside observer, Nick Carraway, Maguire did a knock-up job with his aloof stares. Leo was pretty fitting as the titular character, Gatsby, especially with his gradual unraveling from firework-shining smiles to bittersweet desperation. Overall, Joel Edgerton stole the show. His presence commanded the audience's attention in every scene, regardless of his character's likability and immorality. Foiling Leo's deteriorating Gatsby, Edgerton's Buchanan adapts to every situation and demonstrates his strength lies not in his brawn or brains, but in his persistence to survive. And with little screen time, Edgerton is able to convey Buchanan's forte.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Gatsby"" is worth a watch, regardless if you liked, disliked, read, or analyzed the novel. The movie provides great conversation and is worthy of the 3D ticket price. I wish that more movie adaptations were as respectful to the original source material. By all means, ""Gatsby"" is not perfect, but even through all the glamour and shimmering glasses, it remains engaging and thought-provoking."

","Where should i start !? This was so horrible that it was actually a spiritual experience, like the ones you get on a bad acid trip when your glad your 12 hours bad trip is finally gone. This movie is actually the most expensive, over the top kit-ch TELENOVELA ever made. its like a whole soap opera squeezed into 140 minutes of pure disappointment, shear agony of the soul when you understand that this movie is not going to develop any further than a love story. I started the movie with high expectations from a movie with such good actors, i thought i for sure be a dark movie full of U-Turns and surprises, but actually.... NO! every time you think this movie is about to develop and turn into a psychological thriller is mat with a steep fall into the pits of soapy hell. the movie is shallow like a puddle of mud making you think there might be message to it, a point, about the rich decedent life's of rich people, maybe about the materialistic nature of people, but.... NO! ITS JUST A LONG LOVE STORY... you know like the love stories in movies from 50 years ago, like gone with the wind and such... I thought that girls would love this movie FO SHOW, because all the guys in the theater were on the verge of an epileptic seizure or way to deep into trance to get that far, but..... NO!!! even the girls said that with all respects to the romantic storyline 140 minutes !!! is to long for any love story... and if it isn't than its surly not for cinema but for cuddling at home with the boyfriend while chatting with him, later having the film as background for having sex.<br/><br/>ALL IN ALL: When the film ended everybody was in shock, zombie like boyfriend and their sleepy girlfriends, or bunch of guys who are on the verge of ecstasy that the horrible LSD trip is finally over. This is for sure an experience, from the kind of its so horrible and bad that it is actually good, but still this doesn't make it a good film, only a matter of a good joke.<br/><br/>i recommend that all the guy stay far away from this movie unless your the kinda guy that is willing to sacrifice hes own mental health for the love of hes life, about the girls and this movie, if you are a brain-dead soap opera addicted house wife, this is the best movie for you, you could cut away from seeing cheap boring soap operas at you living room, and see a very expansive one at theater.<br/><br/>HORRIBLE"

"Buddy-51","6","4","5","23 November 2013"," A mixed bag
","Attempting to adapt a literary classic like F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" to the screen is always a tricky proposition. Just ask the makers of the 1974 version who got their rear ends handed to them for their efforts - by both critics and audiences alike. The risk, of course, is that devotees of the work will balk at any attempt to expand or modernize it beyond what is contained on the printed page. After all, great works of literature exist primarily in the individual's imagination, and the way one reader envisions a particular scene or character is likely NOT how another reader - or filmmaker - sees them. The result is that literary adaptations all too often turn into stuffy affairs, with movie makers taking the safest possible approach to the material in an attempt not to offend anyone while still trying to make the piece work in an entirely different medium.<br/><br/>All of this is prelude to saying that when it comes to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby,"" regardless of how one feels about the final product, one has to at least admire the chutzpah of the effort. (His trumped-up modernized version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" similarly divided audiences in the 1990s).<br/><br/>A high school English class staple if ever there was one, the highly prescient ""Gatsby,"" published in 1925, is often considered to be THE archetypal novel of the Roaring '20s, focused on the party-like decadence, conspicuous consumption and spiritual emptiness of a decade sandwiched between a Great War on one end and a Great Depression on the other. At the center of the piece stands Jay Gatsby himself, the self-made millionaire who achieves the American Dream through a combination of dreamy-eyed determination and corrupt opportunism (with much of his wealth gleaned through bootlegging and gangsterism). Yet, for all the wealth and material possessions he's managed to accrue for himself, Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) can never find true happiness until he re-connects with the girl of his dreams, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), an alluring Southern-belle he fell in love with while still a penniless officer in the army. In the five years since their last encounter, Daisy, who is willing to go a certain distance with a fantasy romance until the going gets too tough for her, has gone on to marry the brutish womanizer Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby, in that same period, has bought a mansion across the bay from Daisy's house, hoping against hope that she will one day wander into one of his parties and that they will be able to rekindle their love as if nothing had happened in the interim. It is to this end that he befriends his next door neighbor, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a naïve bondsman from the Midwest, who's moved to New York to make his fortune on Wall Street and who also happens to be Daisy's cousin. It is Nick who narrates the tale (in this version from a sanitarium after suffering a mental breakdown from the trauma of the events he's witnessed), claiming to be an objective observer of what's going on around him, but in reality casting moral judgments on the people he encounters all along the way.<br/><br/>It's easy to understand why the filmmaker was drawn to the material in the first place. With its wild parties and overall air of carefree abandon, the era practically screams out for the Baz Luhrmann treatment. But does the novel? I'm not so sure. The problem is that ""The Great Gatsby"" is about so much more than just unrestrained partying, and the director (along with his co-writer Craig Rearce) often seems oblivious to that fact. Luhrmann typically drenches his film in all sorts of visual razzmatazz, but the result is that the movie is so over-stylized that the characters are all too often reduced to caricatures and the whole thing to the level of a cartoon. The parties themselves become out-of-control orgies as seen through the lens of Simon Duggan's hurdy-gurdy, hyper-kinetic camera. Meanwhile most of Fitzgerald's nuance and subtlety are wiped away in the phantasmagoria. A case in point is the first appearance of Gatsby in the story. In the novel he literally sneaks up on Nick - and us - as just another anonymous and inconspicuous party guest who engages Nick in conversation. In the movie, his entrance is greeted with a literal display of pyrotechnics. The stylization extends to the décor as well, which often reflects ""Alice in Wonderland"" more than 1920s Long Island. Nick looks like he lives in an enchanted forest attached to Gatsby's mansion, which has more turrets than Blahousie Castle and manicured grounds that would put the Palace of Versaille to shame.<br/><br/>Viewed another way, however, Luhrmann's approach seems to make a certain amount of sense. The grandiose, over-the-top theatricality, and stiff, yet, at the same time, over-emotive acting are aptly reflective of the silent movies of that era. It's hard to actually evaluate the performances since the actors have clearly been instructed to ham it up as much as possible (especially Edgerton). At times, they come across as little kids engaged in dress-up and playacting. But in the context of this particular film, is that necessarily a bad thing? (I will say that Robert Redford cut a more impressive figure as Gatsby than Di Caprio does here).<br/><br/>And there's one other thing that can be added to the movie's win column: its overall manic energy, which seems a direct attempt to avoid at all costs replicating the mistakes of the heavy, inert 1974 version.<br/><br/>Luhrmann knows that he is treading on sacred ground here and he clearly doesn't care. He's going to give us ""The Great Gatsby"" as HE envisions it and to hell with the rest of us. In this age of artistic timidity and over-cautious commercial calculation, that attitude turns out to be both admirable and refreshing when you come to think of it."
"GlimmerBunny","9","16","29","14 May 2013"," A dazzling and depressing tale
","""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered one of the best American novels of all time. Its themes of love, loss, obsession, friendship, greed and social status has made it a timeless classic, but the previous film adaptations have all been considered poor attempts at capturing the complexity of the novel. Baz Luhrmann's new version has also received its fair share of criticism, but in my opinion almost all of the complaints are unwarranted. Because this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of how Nick Carraway gets acquainted with his neighbor in West Egg, Long Island; the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby. Opposite the bay lives Nick's socialite cousin Daisy Buchanan with her husband Tom. Soon Nick finds out that Gatsby and Daisy used to know each other when they were younger, and that their relationship is far from over.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a bit duller than the second and makes the movie seem shallower than it really is. Many of the criticisms the movie has gotten has been that the director has prioritized style over substance. But while the movie indeed is beautiful (more on that later) it is also complex and emotional, and from when the movie picks up (I'd say this is when Gatsby and Daisy first meet at Nick's tea party) and onwards it's a near-perfect film. Stand-out scenes include the tour of Gatsby's house, the flashbacks to his youth, the confrontation between him and Tom in New York and the final pool scene.<br/><br/>No other actor could have portrayed the elusive Jay Gatsby as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. Every single one of his personality traits, from the romantic idealism to the self-doubt, is apparent in his amazing but subtle performance. He is the core of the movie and all scenes without him feel lacking. Carey Mulligan's daisy is a more complicated performance to judge. On one hand she truly is lovely and the audience immediately sees why Gatsby is in love with her. But at the end of the day Daisy is such an unlikeable character that not even Mulligan's natural likability can make the audience sympathize with her. Joel Edgerton as her husband is, on the other hand, pure perfection. His menacing but nuanced portrayal of Tom is second only to DiCaprio in terms of skill. The worst casting in the film is Tobey Maguire as the narrator Nick. He is wooden, uninteresting and has no chemistry with Elizabeth Debicki(who plays his love interest Jordan). Only in scenes with Gatsby is Nick an even vaguely interesting character, and this is undoubtedly due to the fact that DiCaprio is strong enough to carry both of them.<br/><br/>Ever since I read the novel I have been aware of the depressing message that the story conveys. But while both the novel and the 70's film version are sad, they aren't even half as heart-breaking as this movie. Many will relate to the story of Gatsby, a man desperate to"" fix things just the way they were"" and realize with him that it just isn't possible. It's a gloomy realization but a good one nevertheless. Yong people especially will benefit from understanding that no matter how hard you work for something there is no guarantee that you will get it. But all of the messages in the story aren't depressing. One can also relate to the ""extraordinary sense of hope"" that Nick describes Gatsby as having and see him as an inspiration to never give up.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is impressive. The costumes, sets and special effects are dazzling, and since the soundtrack is modernized it was a smart move by Luhrmann and production/costume designer Catherine Martin to keep the rest of the film period-accurate. The 3D-effects however are pretty but forgettable and add nothing to the movie. Just like everybody else I was skeptical when I heard that Luhrmann had hired Jay-Z to helm the soundtrack and meant to include hip-hop and rap music. My suspicions turned out to be completely unnecessary. The modern music works very well (especially during the party scenes) and doesn't even include many hip-hop tracks. Variations of Lana del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" is used as a ""love theme"" for Gatsby and Daisy and I wouldn't be surprised if the stunning track get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Original Song"". The soundtrack is actually one of the main reasons that the movie feels current and inspiring in contrast to the at times dated novel.<br/><br/>So no matter what critics have said I think ""the Great Gatsby"" is an amazing film. It tells the interesting and important story just as well as the novel, but Luhrmann has added even more glamour and excitement with his visually creative choices. That makes it not only a satisfactory adaptation of the classic novel but a completely fantastic film. Beautiful, emotional, well-acted, unique and thought-provoking it truly is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."

","Visually Brilliant at times (and not so much sometimes) but vapid and pointless otherwise. All this comes down to is a remake of Moulin Rouge!, which I think is a flawed gem, but without the humour or enthrallingly joyous and silly musical numbers. Luhrmann, who is a great talent as is the entire cast, has reduced Fitzgerald to rubble. I'd rather not rate this because I really don't know what to give it. At IMDb I'm giving it a 4/10. It's just not that good but to be fair it should be broken down between visual accomplishment and story. For the visuals I would give it 3.5 out of 5. It doesn't come up to the spectacle that was Moulin Rouge! but it's still quite good in that respect. As a story, Baz spends too much time on the romance and not the tragedy of the central character's folly. For that, The Great Gatsby gets a 1 out of 5. Next time maybe he can remake The Ziegfeld Follies."

","20 minutes into this and I am ready to turn it off. I am so glad I did not pay to see this in the theater. The rap music played throughout, totally does not fit. When I began to watch, and saw who was playing Nick Carraway, I immediately had high hopes, but this movie is a waste of time... trash.<br/><br/>The original with Robert Redford was a classic, with classy characters portrayed by actors with a touch of class. They have ruined a classic by making these characters ordinary and crude. I'll admit I didn't like Daisy any more in the original than I do in this version but at least the original demonstrated some class. This one is all raunch. I loved the characters in the original... with the exception of Tom who I passionately disliked... but he was supposed to be an unlikeable character. None of the characters in this version are likable in any way.<br/><br/>It is hard to watch and I don't know if I'll see it through to the end. That will depend on whether or not Leonardo DiCaprio can bring anything to it.<br/><br/>One hour in and I couldn't watch any more. Watch the original if you appreciate good film making."
"lasttimeisaw","8","13","23","18 May 2013"," a solid film regardless of its source material
","Watched this topical Baz Luhrmann extravaganza in a plain 2D version, adapted from a world- famous classic, the daunting comparison is predestined, lucky me for being completely oblivious of the original novel and its earlier cinema adaption, so I feel privileged to take my pleasure from viewing this film without being nettled by any premeditated notions whatsoever, blessing the ignorance! <br/><br/>Zero expectation does assuage the nitpicking impulse, this period film establishes its unparalleled visual spectacle which its additional charge of a 3D fee could be considerably goaded, it has been the first time I wish I could watched it with the unease gizmo since INCEPTION (2010, 9/10). The upbeat Hip-Hop infused party music and retro-induced melancholiac strains (now I can not get Lana Del Rey's YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL out of my mind) is another novelty rarely being presented in a period drama, Luhrmann again victoriously testifies himself is the maestro of contemporary cinema's flamboyance and garishness (without any pejorative overtone). <br/><br/>The long-time-no-see former Spidey Tobey Maguire (who is still able to pass off as a twenty- some due to his perpetual baby-face) is the narrator of an ill-fated love story, and surprisingly he does occupy such a lengthy screen time, even outstays DiCaprio's Gatsby. He is the observer, the bystander and a useful buffer between Gatsby and Daisy, Luhrmann and his co-writer Craig Pearce intentionally sacrifice his personal life (no relationship entanglement at all) to intensify his unspeakable admiration towards Gatsby (a bromance in the period time?), he is the one who is captivated by Gatsby's beguiling friendship, his grandstanding lifestyle and the money to sustain all these grandiosity and opulence. Maguire is impeccable as a wide-eyed third wheel, a surviver who is destined to tell the tale. <br/><br/>Then comes the problematic couple, Gatsby and Daisy, both being introduced under the heightened and pompous settings, Mulligan's Daisy is first seen by her slender legs swinging with curtains fluttering around, a spoiled flapper subordinated by male chauvinism (who sincerely hope her young daughter would be a fool since it is the perfect niche for a girl). Gatsby, whose front officially being spotlighted during the lavish party, with tender golden light lingers much longer than it should be, DiCaprio's over-familiar persona almost prompts me into laughter. Both thespians are impassioned with the best they can offer, their first meeting in the film is a marvelous romantic gambit, and Baz still gets it! <br/><br/>I must be too optimistic to say DiCaprio may stand a chance to win over Oscar's attention this time, his red-faced yelling outburst during the conflict is his Oscar-bait, but makes me squirm a bit, since it is his stock antics. For Mulligan, her role has an innate defect for being the collateral culprit of the denouement, so the misogynous judgement aside, Mulligan is praiseworthy in balancing the morally equivocal personality with her dainty style. My only cast gripe is the usually-outstanding Edgerton, as Daisy's gentrified husband Tom, Edgerton is too vulgar in physique and looks like a nouveau-riche doesn't tally with the chic surroundings.<br/><br/>A few technical glitches, the editing is a shade too fast in the first half, noticeably during the happy-moment sequence of the reunion, the glitz does hurt my eyes. Then near the end, the caption-floating of Fitzgerald's text is a lame maneuver, we all know there are too many to tell in the book, however poetic it is, a more subtle approach is recommended. <br/><br/>It is an over-romanticized saga, the final telephone call good-heartedly bookends it, even facing the demise, at least a tinge of warmth manages to run through our senses, one may call it over sentimental, others may refer it as poetic license, all in all, I think it is worth your ticket, and I cannot believe I would say that, even in the despised 3D form."
"rgkarim","Null","22","43","10 May 2013"," Gatsby I Presume
","Hello all, it's me Robbie K finally returning after a three month dry spell. I apologize for my absence but I return once more to attempt to inform you about the latest releases at the theaters. My first review back is on the book made movie/remake of a literary classic: The Great Gatsby. I'm sure if you are like me; you might have big expectations for this movie, or at least were hoping that Hollywood didn't screw it up. Well if you've got a few minutes keep reading to hear my opinions on this film, if not well hope to catch you next week.<br/><br/>Instead of giving you a summary of the trailer, I'll jump straight to what I thought about this movie. Let's start with my favorite thing about the movie, the soundtrack. Rather than falling into cliché of using the music of the era, this rendition of Fitzgerald's literary classic chose the path of blending modern, orchestra, and jazz into their music mix. Modern rap and hip hop opened up the party often showing the masses conglomerating into the house. Once inside the party zone, the music transitioned into the jazz to provide the ideal beat to support the various dances the extras performed. Of course the movie isn't just about partying, but also has a lot of emotion tied into the film as well. While jazz and other current hits, the orchestra track provided the extra kick needed to bring out the emotion embedded into the various scenes. Sure I may be too obsessed with the musical score, but the truth is an epic soundtrack can add an extra edge to make a scene more memorable. <br/><br/>Of course what is a movie without stunning visuals? Usually not a very good movie, but luckily Gatsby has got some pep in its step. The parties in particular were what impressed me the most. All the partygoers were dressed in the 1920's fab, filling the screen with both chic fat cat swingers, and stunning women in gorgeous dresses. The setting of Mr. Gatsby's house was also detailed and dazzling filled to the brim with elegant artwork, beautifully crafted outdoor porches, and of course enough room to provide plenty of angles to capture the party goer's adventure into wild, alcohol infused fun. For this reviewer, I applaud the balanced mix of close up dance moves and wide angled shots that showed the masses interacting with Gatsby's house, especially for those that chose to dance and mingle around the pool. Now the rest of the movie was pretty well designed as well, but to my eyes it looked like the editing crew had a fair share of input in this movie. Often many of the car scenes looked fake, with many of the trees, buildings and coal piles looking a little too smooth and polished. My guess is this artificial environment was created for the 3-D version of the movie. Unfortunately there also seemed to be a rather fast, glitchy, movement to the actors in certain scenes that was a little odd to see. It could just be my old eyes, but past this minor glitch and over polished world, the world was well crafted. <br/><br/>By now you might be saying, ""You idiot what about the acting? Did the acting do the characters justice?"" I say yes, especially for that debonair man himself Leonardo DiCaprio who was a shoe in to play Mr. Gatsby himself. Leo's charming smile fit perfectly in the billionaire, containing a combination of confidence and arrogance that was offset by the kindness in his eyes. Over the course of the movie Leo not only added the stereotypical snooty tone of a rich playboy, but evolved to deliver his poetic lines with the emotion of someone who actually wrote those very words. And when the time finally came to display the last parts of Gatsby's emotional spectrum, he transitioned flawlessly into the anger and sadness that followed. Of course Leo isn't the only actor in this movie is he? Tobey Maguire, formerly Spiderman, surprised me with his performance in this movie. The role of Nick Caraway was perfect for him, playing the odd, scared, and rather immature stock boy that tell the audience the story. I must say I enjoyed this role a lot more than the last few roles I've seen, despite his insane rants and depressed writing. Carey Mulligan was a vision of loveliness as well, her looks dazzling and a pleasure to look at. As for her acting, I think she did a good job, though I don't remember the character of Daisy being so annoying. I don't know if it was the directing or what, but somehow Ms. Buchanan was a little too clingy, desperate, and annoying to really get attached to her. Then again I never was able to relate to soap opera drama queens who are stuck on love. As for the rest of the cast well they did fine too, but I don't have time, nor do you want to hear me describe every single character.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this remake of Gatsby very much, and thought it was a good movie to continue drawing people back to the movies. The settings and music went hand and hand, and the acting for most of the cast I think did a nice job bringing the characters to life in the modern age. How well did it stick to the book? I can't answer that question as it has been 5 years since I last turned the pages, though I intend to read it again. My final comment on the movie is that the pace needed a little tuning up and probably shortened a bit to help keep my attention. My scores for this film are the following: Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie overall: 7.0-7.5"
"lallarn","1","12","21","18 August 2013"," Awful

There are no story being told thus its impossible to write any spoilers. How someone could get the idea to spend money on making a movie of such a dull book is bizarre. This movie should be banned from cinema and the makers fined for abuse of the audience. I thought torture was illegal bur apparently abusing the audience with this is legal. Makes me sick."
"yris2002","8","12","21","19 May 2013"," over-mannered in style, but effective and incisive
","Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is first of all brightly-coloured imagery and powerful audio-solicitation, excessive and over-mannered, as to get, sometimes, grotesque, but certainly appealing, mainly while depicting the extravagance of sumptuous parties. But this is the spirit of the roaring twenties, vibrating with intoxicating energy, and the style employed is well matched with the sparkling vitality of those times (and, by the way, you cannot expect sobriety in a work by a director like him).<br/><br/>So, splendor of the scenery, awesome costumes and jewels, marvelous cakes and sparkling champagne abound and appeal the viewer since from the very beginning of the picture. Not to mention the irreverent use of music, with shocking covers and an hazardous contamination between hip pop and traditional jazz. The picture, however, is not only explosive energy and affected mannerism, on the contrary it pulses with emotion in dialogues and situations, and here the novel upon which it is based emerges clearly.<br/><br/>Of course, if you compare the movie with Fitzgerald's work, you realize that some depth is missing, especially that sense of decay and despair typical of those same shimmering years. However, it is always difficult, sometimes impossible, to transpose complex literary works, especially those where the evocative power of the written word proves superior to the necessary directness of the visual image. But the screenplay and the use of camera help emphasise the inner anxiety of Gatsby and the mysterious nature of Nick, supported by the talented performances of the actors (Di Caprio is great as usual, and more handsome than ever), who interact very well with the female performances. To sum up, the final product proves effective and incisive, and the long timerun never bores, on the contrary the picture keeps its quick pace and brilliant touch till the end."
"ArminCallo-PalmSprings","7","17","32","8 May 2013"," Baz Luhrmann's THE GREAT GATSBY is a Tiffany Diamond Bought at Costco
","Full disclosure up front: I love the Fitzgerald novel. I love the literary construct of a first-person narrator who serves, for the reader, as both moral compass and inquisitive voyeur. I love its themes of yearning, for both societal- and self-acceptance and the illusory nature of ""the grass is always greener."" And, I love Baz Luhrmann's visual style and music vocabulary. BUT, after a two-year wait for this film, compounded with all the fuzz and buzz regarding its making, I must say that the movie left me with more disappointment than Wow.<br/><br/>The pluses: Loved the costumes. Loved the music and mix of hip-hop with traditional and fusion jazz; I adore Brian Ferry. Loved the ""look ma, no hands"" bravado of Luhrmann's camera and editing. But, only to a point. Now we get to the heart of my thoughts.<br/><br/>While the material seemed so tailored (and that's the operative word) for Luhrmann's visual style, it was inconsistent throughout the film. On the one hand, it was excessively distracting at the wild jazz- age soirées at Gatsby's mansion to the point of being too choppy (and I realize that folks will think it appropriate for the drunken haze and tipsiness it creates in the viewer). On the other hand, Luhrmann's vision was too skeletal and ""traditional"" in its narrative use to drive the dramatic tragedy to its conclusion.<br/><br/>This is particularly evident in Luhrmann's invention of placing Nick Carraway at an asylum at the start of the picture to create the framework of his voice-over first-person narration. True, this literary devise is quite problematic to translate cinematically, but Luhrmann's approach was traditional, predictable, and quite frankly boring. However, the use of 3D technology with Fitzgerald's text, floating in the air and on screen as it slowly fades away, was wonderful, and effective, serving as an additional commentary on the ephemeral and malleable nature of memory.<br/><br/>Of course, the Casting of GATSBY would be key to its commercial and critical success. There are hits and misses here. The hits are too few, and too minor. The misses are fatal.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan is spot-on. He captures our attention in every frame, and his introduction to us is astonishing. The same goes for our intro to Jay Gatsby himself some 30 minutes into the picture, done in the classic Hollywood style). Edgerton/Buchanan's masculine force, fertility, and brutality are a testament to the Darwinian success of blue-blood society. Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker is also quite effective. Porcelain-like and delicate, she is a doll only good for display and ""not to be played with."" I wish she was used more to drive the narrative -- and the societal commentary – forward. Ditto for Isla Fisher as Myrtle Wilson. I cannot help but recall Karen Black's memorable Myrtle, breaking her fists at the glass window in her failed attempts to call to Tom Buchanan, and her subsequent licking of her own blood as her desperate act of self-preservation.<br/><br/>While Tobey Maguire's Nick Carraway was effective enough, it bordered on hero worship at times. Instead of Fitzgerald's intent to convey societal disgust at the world, in general, and the yearning for hope and innocence in Gatsby, in particular, I think Sam Waterston was more successful and effective as Nick Carraway in this sense in the Redford/Farrow 1974 version. Leonardo DiCaprio, while an effective character actor, was passable as Jay Gatsby. Luhrmann's introduction of him to us was most highly effective, and cinematically theatrical, and that golden smile, well, it could melt butter. Nonetheless, every time DiCaprio said ""Old sport"" I could not help but winch. It seemed so unnatural for DiCaprio, in contrast to the ease of Redford's delivery of the same language.<br/><br/>Most regrettable is Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. I love Carey Mulligan. She is both beautiful and a most effective actor. However, Luhrmann failed to capture Daisy's meretricious recklessness and equivocation in Carey Mulligan. I think it was the eye color, or maybe Mulligan's eye brows which stood in too-much contrast to her blond hair. Je Ne sais pas ! She was beautiful, and oh so beautifully dressed. That Prada ""chandelier"" gown was stunning -- though I did not care for the fur wrap -- and the Tiffany hair band was delicious. BUT, the distance, frailty, and sheer delicateness that Mia Farrow achieved were simply not there on screen this time in Mulligan. Maybe she was too good an actress, and that the character of Daisy Buchanan needed a more delicate and insincere actress for the role? Maybe. I am quite hard-pressed to offer an alternative actress at the moment. <br/><br/>When I first learned that Baz Luhrmann was filming GATSBY in 3D, I thought, wow, this will be great, particularly in light of Luhrmann's skill. While it was ""good,"" there were no ""WOW"" moments like in AVATAR or LIFE OF PI. The rain, the snow, in 3D was predictable. The conveyance of ""yearning"" and ""reaching"" was effective in 3D with the use of DiCaprio's reach across ""West Egg"" to ""East Egg"" and to Daisy's dock and green light across the water. We needed more of this to move that theme of longing and distance to new heights with the use of this ""new"" technology. <br/><br/>Could we not do more? The camera moving through space among the party decorations was predictable, and boring. ""Please sir, I want some more.""<br/><br/>Most distracting was the GCI use of the exterior of Gatsby's mansion. Too fake. True, while Jay Gatsby would have envisioned a garish and ostentatious abode, Luhrmann gives us a Disney princess castle which does not serve to move the narrative to its intended message. In contrast, I point out Quentin Tarantino's use of Jamie Foxes ""clothing choice"" when he is freed in DJANGO UNCHAINED. Now -- this is effective -- with maximum comic punch."
"paulscofield68","3","24","48","12 May 2013"," Soulless Glitz
","A mainstream Hollywood movie for those who like superficial, pretentious movies. This film glorifies wealth, even if it has a few lines about how empty the rich's lives truly are. If you're like me and prefer European art-house and American independent filmmaking then this is one difficult viewing experience. The emphasis of style over substance is one of many problems for this Great Gatsby. It is visually dazzling, and there's music running through practically every scene (including bland hip-hop music in a period piece of the 1920s). But the acting is so artificial, so overwrought as to be almost cartoonish. DiCaprio sounds like Marlon Brando, with this strange accent. Completely emotionally uninvolving. I saw it here in New York City on the Saturday afternoon of its opening weekend in a packed theater and had the feeling that the audience thought, ""Good but it tries way too hard to be something special"" as we left the theater. And that's being generous. This movie's target audience is 12-27 year olds. Some tactless product placement. At times, this movie is MTVesque (and before you mistake this as a compliment, I mean this in a bad way). And finally, though it aspires to be a huge box office hit like Titanic, it surely won't manage to do so because it doesn't have the emotional impact that Titanic has. It's wooden and hollow by comparison. 3 generous stars: 2 for the visuals and 1 for the effort."

No, I mean the cars used in the movie, the actual automobiles that were driven around. In fact, they were about the only thing in the whole movie worth looking at. <br/><br/>In all honesty, I only saw about 40 minutes of the movie before I got up and walked out. I figured it wasn't going to get better and it WAS getting worse.<br/><br/>In 1974 they made The Great Gatsby into a movie with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. It wasn't a huge smash but it did at least make it's money back. And after all, the movie business is a business isn't it. Isn't making money one of the chief objectives. So why on earth anyone would want to spend $190 million to produce this crap and then who-knows-how- much to market it is way beyond me. <br/><br/>Let's start with Tobey Maguire. Enough has already been written about the crap in the sanitarium so I'll leave that alone. Let's just talk about his over the top hammy, not-even-good-enough-for-a-community- theater-production type of acting. Did he really think he had to talk loud and over do it to reach the people int he back row? <br/><br/>If you're going to have dialog about how beautiful a woman is (Daisy/Carey Mulligan) it might help to actually have an actress who fits the description, don't you think? Is anyone supposed to be mesmerized by this too skinny, too pale, too plain-white-wonder-bread type?<br/><br/>I've never been impressed with Leonardo DiCaprio. To me he always seems like a little boy trying to play a man's role. It worked perfectly in The Quick and The Dead but other than that he's just one of those guys who never grows up. Now, if they ever wanted to make a movie about Gilligan's Island he'd be perfect.<br/><br/>It's always a shame when they have to F(*^$(*@&%#$*@ up a decent story with crappy music. It's a shame too because that era was filled with great music and great composers. I'm sure that if the great songwriters of that era had wanted their music to sound like hip-hop or rap they could have stuck their heads up their asses and given it a shot. <br/><br/>And what's with all the terrible CGI? For $190 million they could have bought a couple of real sets, don't you think?<br/><br/>Over all, if you love crappy acting, crappy directing, bad CGI but really cool cars then go see it."

","Having seen the 1974 version a couple of times and having read the novel a few times, I was perhaps primed to dislike this new version. Definitely I dislike it. For one thing, it is very noisy, with totally inappropriate music throughout. The noise, I assume, is used to make the film seem exciting. Ditto the speed of the action and the use of cuts. There isn't a moment of subtlety here. There is a phony fight inserted into the plot. There is a phony framework (Nick Carraway is in an institution, possibly for a nervous breakdown--ugh!--and his doctor talks him into writing down the story). With the exception of Jason Clarke who plays George Wilson with passion and believability, the acting totally sucks. I cannot see why anyone would be in love with Daisy (Carey Mulligan), and certainly why anyone would be obsessed with her. Leonardo Di Caprio is a big nothing—there is no clue to his internal life; the performance is all gloss. As for Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), most of the time he looks like a pleasant nitwit in an outdated comedy. I apologize for the harshness of this review--generally I only write positive reviews of movies that deserve a wider audience (see my history). However, I found it such a struggle to remain for the entire movie because it was a big bore."

This movie is a mighty mess, for two basic reasons that have nothing do with the source material or Luhrmann notorious bombastic style. These reasons are: awful acting and lack of chemistry, and they make the whole story collapse.<br/><br/>Maguire is awful. I never noticed what a bad actor he is until I saw him playing Carraway.

Impossible to believe in any passionate feeling between these two.<br/><br/>Besides, spoiled, coward and selfish Daisy Buchanan is one of the most repulsive fictional characters. It was weird to see two men fighting for the affection of such an obnoxious woman, whose only saving grace is a pretty face. Not unusual, but I just could not buy into the ""tragedy"" of mystery man Gatsby pining for shallow Daisy.I wanted to tell him to get a grip and find a better woman.<br/><br/>Then comes the horrid music, the overblown party scenes and materialism trumping ""feelings"" in every scene (what was that throwing shirts at Daisy? Was Gatsby employed by a luxury garment store?).<br/><br/>If I have to save something, I'd go for the Lana Del Rey song and the final minute of the movie, both because I liked the typing on screen and because it brought this mess to a much awaited closure.

The director took a great period film and turned into Disney-esque, teenage audience crap.

","One reviewer stated ""Eye candy that reflects the emptiness of American culture"". What if the director wanted us to feel disgusted about the movie...like Toby's character did. Like a dark joke. It's the only way I can understand why such movie was created. No. I'm not in shock. In trance - maybe. I just FINISHED watching the movie, but I'm still waiting for it to begin. Really, the characters and scenes were so shallow, that I caught myself laughing in disbelief at a few scenes. Like the one when Gatsby was contemplating the happy moments with Daisy. Wtf. Contemplating what? -You throwing clothes at her from the balcony? There is no connection, no depth. Just ADHD.

From watching the trailers it appeared that it would be a film full of mystery, but they were better than the film itself. Maybe if it was explained what the hell was actually happening in the first part of the film I wouldn't have spent the rest of the time wondering what the point was. Tedious is an understatement.

","The most shocking in this movie is that a director managed such badly with regards to the cinematography — especially during the first hour — with those continuous travellings, CGIs and other unrefined green-screen that succeed each other at a frantic pace to try to blow the viewer away with this tawdry and corny universe. And what about the anachronistic soundtrack which associates rap, RnB or dance to the 1920's... it must be a joke.<br/><br/>And if the form is a complete fiasco, the content also struggles to convince. The first hour is very long and doesn't develop much, favoring the visual aspect and stylistic effects. The movie becomes a little more interesting when problems arise but it remains really laborious until a final outcome that doesn't trigger any reaction. On the whole, the script is a lot too linear, it doesn't arouse any emotions and the characters, who are sold as ultra profound, all seem shallow as the tacky world they live in.<br/><br/>Only the cast barely saves the day in this incredible flop that is The Great Gatsby."
"tedg","Null","8","13","17 June 2013"," Moulin Green
","When I saw ""Moulin Rouge,"" I knew that life would change, because film would have an added mainstream vocabulary. We would embrace it and adjust our dreams and intuitions. And indeed we have had Nolan ascendant. Even TeeVee has shifted.<br/><br/>Oddly, after that film, Lurhmann himself went off on a different experiment, trying to exploit openness rather than constraints of space and view. That failed interestingly. Now we are back at the ""Moulin Rouge"" form again.<br/><br/>That means that we get layers of observation, not necessarily nested. We get shifts in narration that have related cinematic devices, spaces or camera movement. And all of this will be relatively invisible so a mainstream viewer will think she is watching a regular movie.<br/><br/>The novel sets this up well. Everyone in that written world is living a fragile story, partially self-created. Some notions in the story have become less powerful since the time of writing, for instance we have a different notion of the damage carried by soldiers returning from war. But the impending collapse of identity narrative is much sharper today than in Fitzgerald's time, at least the ones we see, based on our knowledge of and wishes about the the collapse of class privilege.<br/><br/>What characterizes the American novel is unsettling narration. In this case, each of the main four charm us into trust, only to have that trust dissolve. The movie adds two new things to the story. The first is a rather heavy framing device where the book we see is written. This gives some purchase for the voice over narration and allows slippery shifts between inside and outside the main thread.<br/><br/>The second addition is the use of the romance movie genre. It pulls on the film in ways not available to readers of the novel. When we see a date movie, we willingly enter what we know to be a desirable but unrealistic world. We see these with our lover, hoping to stitch elusive unachievable remnants into our own pairing.<br/><br/>I'd say that Lurhmann exploits these masterfully in teasing us into one precarious position after another as partygoer.<br/><br/>The story itself revolves around two scenes. The first is when Gatsby arranges to meet Daisy for tea. This is where reality first threatens the elaborate story Gatsby has woven. Decaprio sought the role for the tensions he could bring to this dynamic. It is introduced here and he surely places the problem squarely in my heart.<br/><br/>The second scene is when Daisy has to act to consummate what we accept until then as a delicious love story. The two scenes go together with the spring set in the first sprung in the second. We need a profound actress to pull this off. Someone stronger even than Leo. Our actress here destroys the film with her weakness as actor and character. Her choice in the book is one of strength, choosing (local) truth over Gatsby's fantasy. Not here.<br/><br/>Two other weaknesses. The first is that in the book not only are our main characters untrusted narrators over their own lives, but Nick is an untrusted narrator. He is in love with Daisy. He is the penniless war veteran. He is the one tempted by shady financial deals in order to win a love. The book leaves the possibility that Gatsby is his invention from drinking and intersheet fantasy.<br/><br/>The second weakness is that Luhrmann is a master of nested narrative, but he doesn't know how to change the presentation of inner layers. So for instance, we see, actually see Gatsby save a drunk millionaire and it is presented in the same manner as everything else. There is no need for this, and Nolan does so much better.<br/><br/>But never mind. We come for the cinema. We come to be harmlessly tricked. This doesn't change the world like the red film did. Lets call this the green one. If he pulls a Kieslowski, there will be an orange one. Speaking of Kieslowski, I'm a fan of Lurhmann when he collaborates with structureman Craig Pearce. They had a lot of freedom in Moulin Rouge and used it to great advantage. The thing turns itself inside out several times and is vastly more complex than ""Inception.""<br/><br/>Where Nolan has wife as visual anchor and brother for narrative structure, Luhrmann has a similar setup. Both Nolan and Lurhmann produce visual worlds with some striking features, but the key thing is that they are internally coherent. I've become a believer in the power of a sexually engaged collaborator for this. The visual coherence helps with the overlay of the narrative structure; the more reliable the visual world is, the more possibility we have for non- linear elements in the narrative world.<br/><br/>Fitzgerald's novel is almost tailor made for this approach. Many who read it see only the society therein and the associated metaphors for a world adrift, buffeted by collective urges. Of course that has power. But the more interesting thing about the novel is the devious slipperiness of the narration.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

I wanted to see 1922 New York, to be a part of a party in the Roaring 20's, to sweat with the characters, to feel the wind in my face during a ride in an open 20's era car...<br/><br/>It almost did it for me... except the music.

"keatsfan1-1","1","6","9","16 March 2014"," There are some films Baz Luhrmann should leave alone
","First some disclaimers: I am a professor of English and Film Studies and during my 30+ years of teaching and schooling, I have taught the novel and shown various versions of ""Gatsby"" (the film) over 25 times; ""Gatsby"" is one of the novels I have read at least once a year for the past 56 years, ever since I read it in high school; while I enjoy Baz Luhrmann's transformations of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo and Juliet,"" Scott Fitzgerald's novel is way beyond his reach; in fact, I am of the opinion that ""Gatsby"" is a novel that does not translate well to the screen at all.<br/><br/>As to this particular version of ""Gatsby"": DeCaprio is as miscast in the role of Gatsby as Alan Ladd was in an earlier version. The rest of the cast in the 2013 version is totally miscast, given the insights, attitudes, and revelations from the novel, to-wit: Jay Gatz's relationship with Dan Cody is hardly discussed in the novel (Dan Cody being nominally a figure representing the ""wild west"" historical values impressed on the young Gatz--Daniel Boone/Buffalo Bill Cody---and which he ultimately betrays through his association with Meyer Wolfsheim--played by an Indian actor no less--who represents Arnold Rothstein, the man who ""fixed"" the 1919 World Series and removed the luster from America's sport)--yet Cody has more than just a cameo role in this film and that clown who plays Wolfsheim is neither American nor Jewish; Daisy Fay (does anyone get the pun on her name?) is sooooo vacuous a character that one wonders what Gatsby desires her for, except the social standing he so desperately craves and the money her voice represents (remember what he tells Nick?--""Her voice has the sound of money"")--and yet Luhrmann casts an actress who then tries to make something out of Daisy--why????; Nick acts not only as narrator but also as Greek Chorus in the novel, but ""Peter Parker"" (yes, I know the actor is really Toby McGuire) has neither the sophistication of someone who had gone to Yale with Tom Buchanan nor the cynical yet strangely sympathetic vision of the Nick Carraway who is telling this tale some years after it actually happened and who has the benefit of hindsight. Well, I could go on and on with the miscasting and the gross misinterpretations attributable to Luhrmann, but why bother? Bad enough he re-writes Fitzgerald's wonderful prose (compare how the novel opens--first three pages-- with the butchering job Luhrmann does in his script); what is worse, he has no idea what to do with the Valley of Ashes, Myrtle Wilson and her nutso cuckolded husband, and the ultimate mistaken identity murder that is the beginning of the end for Nick's sojourn from the Midwest to Long Island. And finally, it is bothersome that Luhrmann, who has such a wonderful sense of humor in both ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""R&J"" should be so clueless about all the humor in ""Gatsby."" From the novel's title (think circus or magic show introductions) through the comedy of the list of guests at Gatsby's party (see Nick's written parody of the Homeric catalog in the novel) to Klipspringer and other clownish characters throughout, the novel's story line suggests there there is a decidedly comic strain to the proceedings here, something which Luhrmann's film misses completely. There have been four film versions of this novel and not one them comes close to capturing the nuances and multi-faceted aspects of the novel. While it is true Scott Fitzgerald spent time in Hollywood writing story ideas and screen-plays, that was long after ""Gatsby"" had been published. His novel was not written with a cinematic vision; rather, if there is a novel that truly depicts the serio-comic aspects of the American character (we take ourselves far too seriously and make too much of things that the rest of the world laughs at), that novel may well be ""The Great Gatsby."" Luhrmann just lacks the sensibility to see or feel that quality in the novel. His screen version, from casting to scripting to tone, is just plain wrong. And to that reviewer who wrote that DiCaprio ""nailed"" the part of Gatsby, you really need to take a well-taught course in Scott Fitzgerald and another one in film studies."
"Nobody-27","2","6","9","13 December 2013"," One of only few films I could not watch to the end...
","If you can believe it, I actually walked into this film knowing nothing about it, except that it was based on the book ""The Great Gatsby"". I didn't even know who it was directed by, and I prefer to see films that way. I can always find out anything I need to know after the fact.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me about TGG was strange color grading. While some scenes have perfectly normal color, some others have what must have been an attempt by the director to give us a sense of some fairy-tale like world. While still trying to figure this film's inconsistent visual style, an even more painful experience surprised me: that of modern music and dancing. From F. Scott Fitzgerald to ""Moulin Rouge 2"" in a split second. At this point I knew who directed the film...<br/><br/>From then on, The Great Gatsby was one music number after another, with breaks consisting of poor story telling in between.<br/><br/>And about half way through, I found myself walking out. I rarely ever do that, but this was just too painful. It was about as bad as Sofia Copolla's ""Marie Antoinette"".<br/><br/>Here and there, in all that chaos and failed experimenting with camera, shots, acting and music numbers, I came upon a shot or two which I actually liked. They don't really work within the film itself, but on their own, they were well done. It was some sort of an organized chaos which I admired for its complexity and its lack of story telling power.<br/><br/>I can easily see how die-hard fans will love this piece of kitsch to death; unlike Moulin Rouge which had some good qualities, this film has none of it. The only ""quality"" is that it can be easily called ""Moulin Rouge 2, with barely a story to tell"". How do you take a great book and manage to ruin it, is beyond me. At best, this film is kitschy, and at worst - a completely failed experiment. The director confused chaos with creativity.<br/><br/>All in all, this was not worth my time."
"thatguywithglasses-867-49397","3","6","9","10 December 2013"," This film baffles me.
","I hate this movie. So much. Lets start of with what I enjoyed. As usual, with a Baz Lurhman film, the visuals are pretty darn good. The sets are captivating, the lighting really gives a unique sense of atmosphere, and mood, and the camera-work is really just inspired. Lurhman might not be able to direct, but he is a really good cinematographer. The casting, for the most part, is pretty spot on. In particular, Leonardo Di Caprio is an inspired choice for Gatsby, and Joel Edgerton encompasses the role of Tom Buchanan quite well. Some scenes of this movie are handled very well, the standout scene being that of Gatsby's murder. The use of slow motion, and close ups really does enhance the drama of the scene. However, I will say that the shot of George Wilson putting the gun to his mouth nearly made me burst into laughter. I'm not sure if it could have been done differently, but it just seemed so comical.<br/><br/>Now to what I dislike about this movie. Firstly, the use of narration. The character of Nick is used as a narrator, to give exposition, or idiot monologues to the audience. Lurhman's use of this breaks the number one rule of story telling; show, don't tell, as the narrations treat the audience like idiots. For example, the symbolism of Dr. TJ Eckleberg is blatantly explained by Nick as ""A god overlooking the city"". The narration takes away all the power and gravitas of the symbol, as it removes the audiences ability to think, and draw their own conclusions to the symbol. But damn it, audiences don't need to think for themselves, do they? This kind of narration punctuates the film throughout it's entirety, and it disrupts the flow of the movie, and removes a lot of the complexity.<br/><br/>The editing is also a nightmare. Here's a fun game to play for you: try and find a shot in the film that lasts for more than 5 seconds. During some of the dialog scenes, such as the dinner party at the beginning of the film, and Gatsby and Nick's conversation in the car, I actually felt nauseous watching it. The shots flick back and forth, like the editor had ADHD or something, and it removes the audience's ability to focus on anything in the scene. If some of the shot's just lingered for a few more seconds, we would be able to focus on what is in the picture, and actually appreciate how well Lurhman sets up his shots.<br/><br/>Finally, the part of the movie that I absolutely despise the most: the soundtrack. The Great Gatsby is set in the 1920's, also known as the Jazz Era. Note the name ""Jazz Era"". As implied, this is an era famed for it's jazz music, perhaps one of the most important eras for music in American history. This is not an era devoid of music. So why in the world does this movie's soundtrack include the likes of Lana Del Rey, Fergie, and Coldplay? Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against these artist's work. But it is just incredibly hard to believe that Gatsby's extravagant parties are set in the 1920's when all I can hear is Jay-Z in the background, rapping about bitches and hoes. At the very least, the artists should have at least tried to sound like jazz music. The combination of modern day club music and a 1920's aesthetic is probably the most baffling part of this movie. If Lurhman went through all this effort to create a believable 1920's New York setting, then why would you include modern day music as a soundtrack? If the producer Jay-Z insists on creating a modern day soundtrack, then why not update the movie's setting to a modern day context? Either options would have worked perfectly fine. A fully committed jazz era setting? Probably would have been hailed as a nostalgic tribute to the days of old. A fully realized modernization? Probably could have been lauded as a critique of modern day society's hedonism, and materialism, and a great tribute the F Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus.<br/><br/>I hate this movie. Hate hate hate. The storytelling is lazy, and frankly, seems to assume I'm an idiot. The visuals, whilst complex and beautiful, are never given the opportunity to sink in, and show the beauty of the shot. And the soundtrack, good god, the soundtrack. The only reason I'm not giving the movie a full 1 star review, is the stellar cast, and entertaining visuals. Baz Lurhman is an incredibly cinematographer, but that is where he should stay. Frankly, this man cannot tell a story, and he cannot direct."

","I've read the novel and enjoyed the 1974 movie with Redford,Farrow, Waterston, et al. This film was almost a complete disappointment. The computerized 'fills' were too obviously computerized and all the fancy zooming with computer was a further distraction from what credibility the filming retained. This psychedelic approach to the 1920's with rap music thrown in might appeal to computer game players in their 20's and 30's but to me it was a turn off. Save computerized film making for Sci Fi and Fantasy. DiCaprio, Maguire and Mulligan must have been paid pretty big bucks to participate in a film that was such a ripoff of one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest novels. This production was a waste of actors' talent and my time. Read the book or see the 1974 film."

Too long for the kind of story that was told. Worse, several aspects of the movie were not even developed (I have at least 3 in mind).<br/><br/>3) Boring I was almost falling asleep all movie long.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","4","6","9","12 September 2013"," Another misfire from Luhrmann.
","I'm regrettably unfamiliar with The Great Gatsby novel but I'm also regrettably familiar with Baz Luhrmann's filmography. I swore to myself that I wouldn't bother seeing this adaptation as I hated Moulin Rouge! and Romeo + Juliet and there's no way he's breaking that trend. He's all about style and his style stinks. But then my obligation to watch all the key films of 2013 drew me to having at least an opinion. Needless to say, my expectations were rock bottom and with that in mind, I was relatively surprised. Luhrmann is usually consistently insufferable but Gatsby has moments of promise. Moments that were swiftly ruined by flashes of indulgent and misguided style but it efficiently tricked me for a second that it could be decent. I even teased the idea that perhaps the film is in bad taste deliberately to prove a point about greed and vanity but that soon became clear that no, it's supposed to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>There are many aspects of the film I disliked and hated, but all to varying degrees. Special hate highlights go to the cringeworthy Tobey Maguire (of whom I worry about in the brilliantly written Labor Day), the dreadfully misplaced hip-hop-pop soundtrack and the abysmal special effects. Who approves those effects? Come on. Let alone that the film is awfully rushed and its melodramatic script makes a mockery of its most dramatic moments. That said, the atmosphere of the film isn't as bad as I expected and certainly not as torturous as Moulin and Romeo are for me. I quite liked Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan. There's a scene I really liked where Gatsby meets Daisy for the first time in a while, DiCaprio's charm really makes that moment work. It's unfortunate the emotions conjured afterwards aren't as great. Unsurprising misfire but I'll still read the book with an open mind and hopefully without thinking of this.<br/><br/>4/10"
"sky_gaze","9","6","9","13 August 2013"," A Very imaginative and creative take on the novel Great Gatsby!!!
","Wow!! I loved this movie and I would like to share my thoughts on it.<br/><br/>First of all, to all of you that are disappointed about the fact that the movie strays from Fitzgerald's novel's story and dialogue, this movie IS NOT meant to be a direct representation of Fitzgerald's novel. This movie was meant to entertain all the various types of audiences, I suppose in an attempt to identify to all age brackets, while telling the story in an elaborate manner. I believe that a direct representation of the novel was attempted already in 1974 with Redford's role as Gatsby. This movie made the plot much more easier to understand and added many interesting elements to the movie that made it really captivating to watch and there was not a moment in the movie that my focus was lost.<br/><br/>The fact that there was some form of modern age music genre like rap and house music mixed into the soundtrack made the audio of the movie more colourful and some modern new age and ambient music gave some of the scenes with daisy and Gatsby an enchanted atmosphere. Of course not everyone likes house music, rap or new age but I certainly might have felt a bit drowsy if the soundtrack was based on music from the times of the novel.<br/><br/>I thought DiCaprio did an amazing job in the role as Gatsby. I always thought DiCaprio had a very youthful face and behaviour even at a mature age, and his initial facade as an established wealthy gentlemen was well acted but his best acting came as he showed his boyish, naive, and immature side as his established gentlemen persona crumbled away as his love for daisy became more apparent.<br/><br/>I loved the ending where the green pulsing light was emphasized telling the audience how much Daisy meant to him and how the green light was what he looked at through his window waiting desperately for a way to reunite with her. Unfortunately, his obsession towards her led him ultimately to his own demise. <br/><br/>After the ending scene, I felt quite disturbed by the fact that Gatsby's end was so tragic and abrupt and hoped for a bit more scenes to smooth out the discomfort. <br/><br/>This movie really touches on accepting what is past and control of feelings and emotions. <br/><br/>Very sad movie but enjoyed it all the way through."
"Niaz_Morshed","8","6","9","11 August 2013"," An absorbing and captivating story is being told again with a subtle sense of vagueness.
","I really don't get the reason behind so many negative reviews of this film. I thought visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grand sets to the detailed period dresses, this film is a treat for the eyes. The direction in this film is impeccable. The cinematography is marvelous and really lets the viewer absorb the sheer artistry that has gone into making this film. Performances are phenomenal by the entire cast. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is every bit as careless as one would expect, but she also manages to show some complexity in her role. Tobey Maguire is a great avatar for us to take on as we enter this film. He is very much the viewer as he sees everything happening, but is eventually helpless to change anything. The true standouts in the film are Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is probably the only actor of this generation that could play Gatsby, just as Robert Redford could only play Gatsby the previous generation."

","""The Great Gatsby"" (12A) Director: Baz Luhrman. Starring: Leonardo Dicaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan and Jason Clarke. Rated: 12A, for containing moderate sex, violence and bloody images. Out now in UK cinemas.<br/><br/>After moving to Long Island (just outside of New York, America) Would-be writer and WW1 veteran Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire), is thrust into the vibrant and alluring life of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo Dicaprio) his neighbour. Soon, Nick begins to question Jay and how he obtained his large fortune, with consequences no-one could have foretold...<br/><br/>Being a fan of the ""The Great Gatsby"" novel, I was very much looking forward to this adaptation. Many people remember the 1974 version, starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, which received mixed to positive reviews, but was a financial success. You see, there has never been a 'great' Gatsby adaptation, only mediocre ones. The latest adaptation (I hoped) would maybe become the definitive version.<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" (2013) is a well-rounded film, that likes to be daring and add in pieces that are suitable for the youth of today. For example, the film contains a fantastic soundtrack; including music from Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter and the likes of the rock band, U2. There are also plenty of light-hearted moments, action and lots of drinking and partying. <br/><br/>Baz Luhrman has not conformed to the traditionalist's view of the novel, and has instead put his own swing on it, which proves to be entertaining. The style of Luhrman is wonderful; the way he has set out the world of Gatsby is quite brilliant. It is colourful, vibrant and above all true to the book.<br/><br/>The cast was well thought out and I believe that ""The Great Gatsby"" gave Tobey Maguire his chance, to show the world that he wasn't just bound to the ""Spiderman"" franchise and can actually act. The moment, Leonardo Dicaprio signed on, I was hooked. Dicaprio has been making films for nearly twenty-four years, but has never won an Oscar. At the next Oscars, I hope that Dicaprio wins; as he is superb as Gatsby. The supporting cast is brilliant, Carey Mulligan (veteran of ""Doctor Who"") plays Daisy Buchanan, the love of Gatsby's life and is surprisingly good.<br/><br/>In summation, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a good adaptation, boasting a great cast, lavish effects and the chance to bring an eighty-eight year old novel, swinging and dancing into the modern age. <br/><br/>4 STARS<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."

","I had heard a lot of people say this movie sucked. I actually enjoyed this film more than I thought I was going to.<br/><br/>The director has a very stylized concept for his films. The fact that it is not set in present day does not mean it has to be a period piece. Everything was over the top and to me it didn't feel out of place since they needed to portray their lavish lifestyle.<br/><br/>It was all around well cast. The chemistry between Daisy and Gatsby was amazing. You could feel the lost love between them and their desire to be together. The emotions were felt on an almost personal level for me. The character of Tom was exactly who you wanted him to be. Tobey had the difficult task for playing the straight man. The main narrative who shows no motives throughout the entire film was executed with subtle gestures.<br/><br/>Keep an open mind, and you might like it."
"littleindieralph","4","7","11","3 May 2014"," Not so great Gatsby
","The film is shrouded in bad CGI, bizarre music and admittedly good costume design. There is a complete lack of character development, like seriously Toby Maguire as Nick is a disaster. He does not change from beginning to end. He is plain and boring and lacks any characteristics that makes him an individual. This plays the same for the other two leading cast whose characters are soul crushingly boring.<br/><br/>The dialogue is even worse, there aren't any memorable scenes with characters interacting with each other they all just roll off one another scene after scene after scene. <br/><br/>The editing is strange, its fast and choppy (which could have been the purpose) and cuts scenes down into mere minutes. This doesn't allow any conversations to flow, characters to build or scenes to be crafted effectively. It just does not work. <br/><br/>The music is nice but again is just a cheap way of attracting a young audience and filling out boring scenes - which it does extremely often. <br/><br/>To be fair the story gains ground near the end with more thoughtful scenes and more interesting dialogue but by then its too late and the overall product has been ruined. <br/><br/>I really don't understand the hype over this film."

","A director makes a movie called Moulin Rouge. It works very well, so he tries to make the same dang movie with another theme. That is, Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Not surprisingly, it is less successful the second time round. It's not that the acting was bad, or the cinematography wasn't enjoyable, it's simply that he tried to recreate MR in a new setting. Same tortured writer at the typewriter. Same excesses and debauchery. Same sweeping camera shots. Same haunting background musical theme. And, well, it doesn't work - at all!

","The movie is essentially an overstated and overcomplicated series of emotional gradations that castrate and mystify what the reality of the movie is: a cheesy, unoriginal and unilateral (the admiration of Gatsby by Carraway never seems to be reciprocated by Gatby ) ""friendship"" that could have been wrapped up in an hour. The extra 1h 20 mins is dedicated towards the enchanted extravagant lifestyle of Gatsby and the perks of being ultra-rich in New York during that time (or any other time for that matter). I guess the movie is best suited for a certain segment of viewer-ship- Kids and their discernible craving for enchantment."

","I had no prob with the look of the movie. The CGI was a little cheesy, but I thought it had a dreamy look... A little surreal... I was OK with that. The acting was decent, and there were some impressive production values. There were loads of talent, both in front of and behind the camera. The music, however... Sucked serious ass, though. Big time. That's my main gripe. It's so obvious that the film makers wanted a marketable soundtrack, and Jay Z is currently selling more product then Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman or Cab Calloway. There is a reason this era was called ""The Jazz Age"". Jazz was king... It was the music of youth. Not 2013 youth, but 1920's youth. But some numb-nuts decided to take a heavy period piece, and destroy it by putting in ultra-modern hip hop... Thus completely annihilating any credence the film might have had going for it. It's Moulin Rouge... All over again. There was a fantastic amount of great and relevant music being made at that time.<br/><br/>This would have been a great opportunity to introduce young people to cool music, music they may never get a chance to hear. But some idiot instead said, ""To Hell with ""time and place"", let's make a soundtrack that's totally 2013"". Just like every other movie currently out now. Bad idea. In my humble opinion. Call me a purist. I will agree with you. There was one poster here on these boards and he should have been given a medal. He said something to the effect of ""Let's make a movie of today's inner city youth, and overdub a 1920's soundtrack over it"".

"dpg-87522","5","2","2","14 February 2020"," With all the elements to be a great movie, not knowing how to use them the movie ends up failing.
","""The Great Gatsby"" (2013) is a film based on the novel ""The Great Gatsby"" written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1925, being honest I have not read the book, I do not know if it is very good or if even the film is better than this, but to tell you the truth I don't think so. When ""The Great Gatsby"" was released, it did not have much popularity, many people simply did not attract much attention and if the film really does not attract much attention, you may turn to see it twice because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the cover, but that's it, I doubt that most who have not seen it yet see it. In a nutshell the movie is about a writer who remembers his past, how he met the great Gatsby, in New York 1920. With that, the movie starts with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) telling his past to a psychologist and here already We have a problem, this would be that, once you finish watching the movie, you realize that all that was totally unnecessary, it does not contribute anything to the plot, one believed that at some point this would stop narrating his life to continue with the plot in the present, but that never happens, Nick finishes narrating his past, then nothing really important happens and the movie ends, I say again that all that was unnecessary, it would have been better if Nick simply told the story without the need to use two time lines, and thanks to that the narrative ends up being not very good. But before continuing with the bad I would like to talk about the good, this would be that, although I said that the narration is not very good, I recognize that the way in which Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) are introduced is good , especially for the famous DiCaprio scene raising the glass. The 1920 rhythm music is very good, is used in a good way and does not feel so out of place. I also want to emphasize that photography is different, in the sense that it does not look very real but this does not necessarily have to be something bad, so let it be that it is different from the vast majority. The interpretations of DiCaprio, Mulligan and Bunchan are good, but especially that of Bunchan, it is clear to the naked eye that this was the one that gave more importance to his role. Do not mention Maguire because his interpretation of depressive alcoholic writer, fails in the sense that he has nothing left, but not everything is Tobey's fault, it is also the fault of the writers for not writing his character well according to his supposed personality, another problem with this is that Nick feels more like a spectator than someone who has an important role in the movie. The romance between Daisy and Gatsby feels somewhat flat because there is no background behind it, is that the movie only tells you ""They loved each other a lot because I say so"", I think it would have been more interesting if they told how it was love relationship between these two through a few flashbacks, yes, yes, there are two flashbacks but they don't endorse anything I just mentioned that the movie does wrong, I mean, one is about Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) speaking about how he already knew Gatsby, explaining that he was Daisy's boyfriend and the other talks about how Daisy and Gatsby kissed, as they see there is no background, nowhere do they explain how Gatsby managed to conquer Daisy, if they make you understand that their relationship was great, but they do not explain why it was great, and that is also why the characters feel so flat, or heavy in the sense that most of them are conceited to the point that you do not feel empathy For none of them, for example, the scene of Gatsby's death is supposed to make you feel something, but it does not, I read that many give the film a lot of credit just because Gatsby dies, and if it is always worth recognizing when a movie kills its main character, but as long as this is executed in a good way and that is not the case of Gatsby, I will put it in a nutshell, his death feels a bit forced, because the way is totally ignored in which George Wilson (Jason Clarke) managed to enter the mansion, when we had previously seen all the safety of Gatsby, so that any guy between this way and kill him, I usually do not put much weight on this type of thing, but In this case I will make an exception because Gatsby's death is a very important event for the plot. Then it seems somewhat simple (FLOJA) the way in which the ""arcs"" of the characters are closed, its end is no ""WOW"", I appreciate the metaphors like the green light, which represented the dreams that Gatsby always wanted to achieve but I never succeed, but that is not going to save the movie from being what it is. In conclusion ""The Great Gatsby"" is a film with an atmosphere that does not feel very 1920, with good performances, a good use of music, but with a structure of history not very good, and characters with whom you never really empathize , but at least I recognize the attempt of the film, to mix the drama with love, and to try to be a great production."

But the film has two good pillars, more than interesting - Carrey Mulligan as Daisy and fascinating Wolfsheim by the great Amitabh Bachchan . And, not the last, the shining di Caprio, more portrait from an old Hollyiwood poster than the expected Gatsby. Another good point remains the tragic romanticism use.

"eric262003","6","2","2","25 May 2015"," Overrated Adaptation Of Fitzgerald's Novel
","In spite of having a degree in journalism, and has high regards to literary masterpieces and have had the honour to read and admire the one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"". I was also very fond of the the adaptations that came after like the 1974 Robert Redford and Mia Farrow version and also the 2000 adaptation starring Mira Sorvino and Toby Stephens. And I'm sure my teachers and instructors if they ever had the chance to see this later adaptation directed by Baz Luhrmann, they like me will likely have their eyes rolling. At least more so than me. But even though I know the story and the happenings, I went to see what Mr. Luhrmann has to offer. And one bit of advice for those who saw the movie, but never had the pleasure read the book, read it after not because of what justice Luhrmann did with the book, but more like what he neglected. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire stars as Nick Carraway a former writer who's now in the bond-selling business. He seems fond for his neighbour, a charismatic, dynamic millionaire, James Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Every evening he throws these elaborate parties at his abode, but is still quite melancholy. He still has feeling for Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). Daisy has moved on in a rather unloved marriage to a skirt-chasing scoundrel named Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby lives on the opposing side of the lake where Tom and Daisy live. Her persuades Nick to set up a reunion in hopes to reignite the flame to the torch that was put out years ago. <br/><br/>Like all of his movies before this one (that includes ""Moulin Rouge""), Luhrmann takes has execution in an over-the-top perspective which will be liked by some chastised by others. Once again this movie like ""Moulin Rouge"" falls victim for the usage of playing inappropriate music that doesn't fit the time period. Which to me is ludicrous. I found it absurd to see Mr. Gatsby driving his car to the sounds of Jay-Z with contributions to modern artists like will.i.am, Beyonce and Lana del Ray, when yet he should be driving to the beat of big band artists like Charlie ""Bird' Parker,Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway. Sure these modern artists may make this film a bit more fun, but it's still inappropriate. And to add more to this strange brew, Luhrmann decided to make this film in 3D. It might work well in the party scenes along with the streamers, confetti and fireworks to give it more in-your-face look. But by the second half of the the film, the 3D just loses its necessity. But it's still fun to look at. <br/><br/>So even though the visual effects are a thing of beauty, the storytelling was what brought this film down quite tremendously. Sure his flamboyance in making the film look exquisite, but the actual story itself leaves you with an empty feeling in the end. The plot was quite impressive with Gatsby and Daisy trying to get back together, but at times the execution feels quite tiresome and not very fulfilling. DiCaprio and Mulligan turn in great performances, but the passion and devotion to one another isn't very convincing. They seem to not have much chemistry between the two and that ruins the atmosphere substantially especially since they're trying to get back together after their love was taken from them. Tobey Maguire looks very one-dimensional as Carraway. But let's not implant the blame game on Maguire, but it's the script by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce which has him narrating and observing the world around him, without really having any idea how he feels about what he's up against. <br/><br/>The final minutes of the film get quite dramatically intense and the gist of the story is where the story really starts to unfold. By then it was too little too late. Sure the film is visually stunning, the music was fun, though not fitting the time period, the performances were impressive and the story was splendid. But in spite of all that, the film did not offer enough bit than it should have. With all the scandals,mysticism and romance it has to offer, it still left me feeling cheated. The film is entertaining as it is, but overall it is still overrated. The book is way better if not see the older adaptations for better details."
"Hitchcoc","6","2","2","3 January 2014"," Maybe Someday!
","Maybe it's not possible to portray one of the greatest books ever written on the silver screen. This is at least the third time and I've been really disappointed all three. Neither DiCaprio or Redford (both of whom I really like) catch the true sense of the mysterious Gatsby. At least Redford was a bit detached. His failures of the past are in his head. DiCaprio (or the script he must follow) make him seem like a giddy love soaked schoolboy. He is so obsessed as to appear weak and maudlin. Another issue, however, is with the portrayal of Nick Carraway. Tobey Maguire is just too cute. I never pictured Nick as the little boy seen here (Sam Waterston, while not perfect, at least seemed like a possibility). Again, I like Maguire in other roles, but here he seems nothing more that Gatsby's toy. He's still physically lacking as a leading man. Mostly, it just lacked a bit of pizazz. Luhrman seems to think he can do it all visually, but this is a story of lost souls, trying to recover something they can't seem to reach. It fades and fades and in the end, it's hard to care much. Also, the portrayals of Daisy and Jordan just don't seem to draw us in."
"Callum_Hofler","5","2","2","26 December 2013"," Disappointing, Unfortunately
","The Great Gatsby is a film directed by Baz Luhrmann, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan. It centres around the character of Nick Carraway(Maguire), a man who has moved to New York to take up a job as a bond salesman. He finds himself neighbour to a man known as Jay Gatsby(DiCaprio), who holds extravagant, wonderful parties every weekend. Carraway becomes friends with Gatsby, and is asked by the man to fulfill a set of tasks to help him with his love life.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann is no stranger to extravagance. Moulin Rouge is a perfect example of this. He loves to make energetic, wonderful films, which are certainly exaggerated to the maximum. The Great Gatsby is no exception. Luhrmann delivers us a film which adheres to all of his traits, and brings lots of colour to the screen. He certainly creates a visually pleasing film here. The parties that take place within this film are all wild, huge and colourful. Talk about stylistic! Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy all the visual effects that he implemented, and wish that maybe the film could have been toned down slightly. The whole scale of it makes it hard for you to absorb yourself in these characters and their motivations, which makes for a less than rounded film experience.<br/><br/>The performances are all fairly decent. DiCaprio certainly steals the show, as he has a subtle energy about him which contrasts against the loud and obnoxious characters that surround him. Whilst his character isn't written very well, I found that I enjoyed watching him on screen. Tobey Maguire gave a more neutral performance. I personally can't stand him doing voice overs as his voice is just too... boring! He stays consistently uninteresting for the majority of the film, as does Carey Mulligan. Her character is written poorly, and her performance doesn't help. She's incredibly one dimensional, sappy, predictable and plain annoying. I just couldn't help but cringe every time she was on screen. The ensemble, on the other hand, is fairly good. Joel Edgerton gives a wonderful performance, as does Isla Fisher. For the most part, the performances won't disappoint you. <br/><br/>The whole pace of the film is incredibly slow. The film starts off energetically, with Maguire's character getting into the details of his story quickly and efficiently. It's from there that the film goes from fast and fun, to slow and sappy. The love story that emerges was so silly and boring that I just couldn't help but lose interest. By the end of the film, none of these characters had me engaged. The Great Gatsby starts off incredibly promising, but slowly turns into a predictable, unexciting, at times corny film.<br/><br/>In summary, I was certainly disappointed by the result of this film. I enjoyed the first half immensely. It was Baz Luhrmann at his finest, and it showed promise for the rest of the running time. But the final half of the film really lost my interest, and had me cringing at multiple points in time. Whilst the performances were acceptable, the writing was not. I haven't read the book, and based on this, I'm not going to be any time soon. It's a basic, stupid love story, which could've been so much more. It's not one of the worst of the year, but it's certainly over-hyped.<br/><br/>5.6/10"

","I was excited to see this version of The Great Gatsby, especially after reading the mostly glowing reviews. I was expecting a film that would bring me back to that unique period in American culture.<br/><br/>After about 45 minutes, it reminded me of Moulin Rouge, which I hated. I hadn't made the connection that both films were made by the same director. Overblown, ridiculous party scenes, no real structure nor story, basically just a mess. After realizing this and watching one party scene after another with emphasis on the fireworks, etc. I found myself,losing interest in the film. I felt the characters weren't developed and the whole structure of the film was off. I kept asking my wife if she liked the film, hoping I could use her lack of interest as an excuse to turn it off. We both eventually fell asleep not even halfway through and I hope she doesn't want to finish it. How this got such glowing reviews is beyond me. This interpretation of one of the great American novels was a disgrace and making it almost 3 hours long doesn't help either."

","The film is not recommended.<br/><br/>The latest adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel has again transitioned to the silver screen. (There have been 5 previous films, none of which were successful at the box office or achieved critical raves.) Now, the ""enfant terrible"" of cinematic excess, Baz Luhrmann, has taken a crack at it, turning the romantic drama into a melodramatic concoction of flappers and booze with a stylish 3-D approach added to his usual opulent visual imagery. The result is like an expensive vodka martini, extra dry, and with enough garnishing to shock Mrs. Astor's pet horse. It easy to liken Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby to an uninvited drunken party guest that you hoped would have left hours ago. It outstays its own visit.<br/><br/>Yes, this party goes on far too long, with too many impeccably tailored bystanders in their fancy duds and inebriated guests hanging out just for show. Do the filmmakers capture the circus atmosphere of the twenties and its bacchanalian orgy of carefree decadence? Absolutely. The film looks perfect, but it's all facade. The glitter, and there are tons of it, fades, leaving a rather tame tale in its wake. Do they create compelling dialog, believable characters, and an interesting story? Sorry, old sport!<br/><br/>￼For those unaware of the story: It's the Roaring Twenties and everyone wants The American Dream. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire), cousin to the lovely Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), befriends his rich and mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and gets involved with his hedonistic lifestyle. Gatsby, who has been secretly in love with Daisy for some time, uses Nick's friendship to rekindle this romance. Unfortunately, Daisy is married to a brutish husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton), who is having a affair with a waitress on the other side of the tracks named Myrtle (Isla Fisher). All of these soap opera relationships collide with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>Now the underlying power of Fitzgerald's masterwork is in its prose, not in its plot. And the script by Craig Pearce and Luhrmann rarely reaches that level, or any level, of artistry. The film plays like a Cliff Notes version of the novel, relying too heavily on narrative voice-overs and overstated visuals that work on the page but not on the screen. The characters are so one-dimensional and lacking in any nuance. The actors, try as they may, are all constantly upstaged by their opulent surroundings and stilted conversations. <br/><br/>￼DiCaprio is perfectly suited for the role of Gatsby, literally speaking. With his boyish good looks and charming personality, he wears the period costumes well and has enough charisma for his enigmatic character. DiCaprio displays the correct measure of ambiguity and desperation with his portrayal of Gatsby. However Mulligan as his romantic partner lacks the allure and frailty needed to make her character remotely likable. The pairing just doesn't work. Maguire as Nick plays his part with his usual innocent demeanor as he has in past performances, which still works here. The other actors fail to bring any nuance to their sketchy roles, with the exception of Elizabeth Debicki in her short role as Jordan Baker. Edgerton makes his repellent character villainous to the point of caricature as well as Ms. Fisher' as his floozy mistress. However she would be an ideal choice to play Miss Adelaine in a summer stock production of Guys and Dolls.<br/><br/>￼As with most of the director's films, production values are flawless. One can see the big budget lavishness in every detail. Costumes and production design by Catherine Martin, Baz talented spouse, is truly stunning. Simon Duggan's vertigo inducing cinematography, though far from subtle, successfully captures the atmosphere and the opulence that was the Jazz Age. The hyperactive editing by Jason Ballantine, Jonathan Redmond, and Matt Villa helps to liven the film's prodding dialog. It is a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>As for the ears...Much has been said about Luhrmann anachronistic use of music, combining today's pop and hip-hop musicians to create new songs for this period piece. (The director used this same approach with his earlier hit, Moulin Rouge, with mixed results.) The same can be said here too. Too often, he overstates his scenes with a soundtrack that telegraphs its message long before its actions.<br/><br/>Just as the character of Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald's alter ego in the novel, always appears to be observing the proceedings from the outside looking in. So was I watching this film. Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby never connected to me emotionally. It becomes so overindulgent, like the era it tries to depict. Ultimately, the film is as phony and glib as Gatsby himself. It left me wanted more and wanting less simultaneously, a strange contradiction to a strange and ultimately unsatisfying film. Sorry, old sport! GRADE: C+<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com<br/><br/>NOTE: The 3-D effects truly energize Luhrmann's vision. The director continually plays with foreground and middle ground dynamics which gives the film a unique and slightly artificial theatrical edge which works well with the spectacle. Now, if only the script could provided some of that same passionate spirit."

","Nick Carraway in a nut house? What? His time with Gatsby gave him a nervous breakdown? Why? You stink Chris Pearce (screenwriter) This concept undermines F.

With the author's prose in actual words on the screen and fireworks in the sky, we are given a weak script, failed characterizations devoid of all meaning. <br/><br/>The music takes you completely out of the jazz age and dumps you in a glitzy nightmare populated with no characters no audiences can invest in. <br/><br/>On a personal note DiCaprio is not good looking enough nor talented enough to play Gatsby. No one is. <br/><br/>There should be a rule regarding certain pieces of literature, filmmakers can't film them just to make money. <br/><br/>Walking out of the film I am reminded of parties I have attended, and stayed too late, only to wake up amongst the stale remains and debris of the previous nights excess. <br/><br/>When DiCaprio said, ""Old Sport"", the audience laughed.

"Lara-m-gale","10","8","14","28 May 2013"," Emotional Essence
","F. Scott Fitzgerald tried his hand at writing for the silver screen and was a complete failure. His genius for communicating truths of sweeping depth through simple, subtle, masterfully crafted scenes and details was not well translated into film in his time of linear, stage-like storytelling. <br/><br/>Today, with technology and a well-developed culture of cross- disciplinary artistic collaboration, the craft of filmmaking is able to place before us an array of experiences touching all sensibilities which come together to communicate a story more meaningful than the sum of its parts. This is what was required to really bring what is not just a linear story to the silver screen and do justice to its emotional depth and underlying meaning.<br/><br/>After we're blown away by the sensory overload of Gatsby's desperate excesses and Tom's careless thrill-seeking, Lana Del Rey's plaintive question, ""Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?"" lingers behind the masterful performances that unravel the rest of the story and the nature of the characters involved. The emotion at the core of the story and its purpose for being told at all is communicated creatively and effectively, and is, I think, a testament to F. Scott Fitzgerald's creative legacy- the core of the story itself governs the means by which it is told."
"SforSmile","9","8","14","24 May 2013"," A Delight to Behold!
","Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of ""The Great Gatsby"" combines the latest motion picture technology with the essence of F. S. Fitzgerald's over 80 years old modern-classic novel in order to make cinema at its most magnificent, most excessive.<br/><br/>This movie has such a great power of attraction you can hardly escape from, it's fast and dynamic - like a good party, and you as the viewer are in the center of all the exuberant happening revolving around you in a hurricane of glance and glamor; it smiles at you with a raised cocktail glass as Mr. Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) did when he welcomed Nick Carraway (T. Maguire) in his castle for the first time and from this moment on, there is only one question: What's behind his whimsical smile?<br/><br/>The cinematography: the camera-work (tracking shots, pans, zooms, different perspectives, high-angle shots, &c.), the 3D effect that suited well the pomp, the editing (fast cuts, time leaps, different color filters, text sequences, archive footage...) as well as a cool, contemporary score with jazzy remixes of known hits by various artists such as Beyonce or Lana Del Rey, is what makes this movie stand out beside a very strong cast with DiCaprio's intriguing performance at it's top. The ""Roaring Twenties"" were never more vital and the old New York never shone brighter or was dirtier (like in the ""Valley of Ashes"") than in this motion picture I acknowledge as a really good piece of art which I refuse to compare with ""Moulin Rouge"" (as some critics did) since it is neither a musical nor a comedy although it certainly had one or two humorous scenes.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan as Gatsby's love interest Daisy Buchanan is a delight to behold like a rare pearl you long to call your own, of a fragile and tender nature torn apart between Gatsby and her jealous husband who is played by J. Edgerton with such hypocritical arrogance that you cannot but find him unlikable in a positive way. Only Jordan Baker (E. Debicki) disappoints because she plays a rather shallow role which should have been a somehow emancipated opposite to a dependent woman of the 1920's who Daisy certainly is. N. Carraway recounts the tale in retrospect using Fitzgerald's powerful prose, a tale not so much of a tragical love affair as of a mysterious billionaire who is enormously wealthy and yet unhappy for the one true love of his life is married to another man.<br/><br/>This movie aroused my wish to read the book again and this is indeed a good sign: highly recommendable!"
"rennells","4","8","14","24 May 2013"," Disappointed to say the least!
","I was looking forward to watching this movie ever since I read the book three years ago. I've always loved the 20's .... the music, costumes, Paris, Josephine Baker, the artists, the culture. If I could go back in time and spend my youth in any era, it would be in the 1920's.<br/><br/>I love the story of The Great Gatsby because of the theme of love and obsession, and of course because of the setting in the 20's. <br/><br/>The acting in the film was of a high standard. Leonardo was superb as Gatsby and likewise Carey fitted the role of Daisy very well.<br/><br/>The music throughout the film was a shocker! I was horrified when I was bombarded with Jay Z, Beyonce, Kanye West and various other hip hop and dance tracks. I felt like walking out of the cinema. The party scenes at Gatsby's mansion was the perfect opportunity to show the world how awesome the 20's was for producing music that is still loved by many today. Instead we heard none of it, but were forced to listen to modern hip hop and dance.<br/><br/>The actors were wearing 20's costumes, and were dancing using 20's dance moves, but to hip hop and dance music. I found it offensive and if I hadn't gone there with a friend, I would have walked out.<br/><br/>If the director thought that fusing the 20's with the modern would make it seem ""cool"" and would appeal to a younger audience then obviously he was only interested in making money. He ruined what could have been a great film, and those people who really appreciate the 20's and expected something authentic will be utterly disappointed, offended and even angry that they spent money to have to listen to that awful music.<br/><br/>I do NOT recommend this film to anyone who is expecting even a remotely authentic depiction of the 1920's.<br/><br/>Well done to Leonardo DiCaprio though. He is maturing as an actor and is looking more handsome in this film than he has ever looked before."

","Having read the book back in High school and being a fan of the Robert Redford version (yes I know it was flawed but I still enjoyed it), I was overall disappointed with the new Great Gatsby. The director was more enthralled in the visual spectacles that he forgot about the heart of the story and character development. The movie was dull and the character's roles were feckless (i.e. Myrtle: I forgot she was in the movie until the pivotal scene at the end). Isla has great talent and her role wasn't handled very well. Mulligan was great as Daisy and I must say that she outdid the great Mia Farrow (I still love her! I mean, have you seen Rosemary's Baby? Smile #Great Acting) I digress... Leonardo is a great actor, but I believe that he was OVERACTING in this film. Especially in the scene when he screams at someone SHOWN IN THE TRAILERS!!!!!!... the yell was over the top. Also, the scene when he is about to meet Daisy for the first time was a little forced and unbelievable. Honestly, the Great Gatsby is such a profound story that it is challenging to translate into film. Luz has jumped the shark with the film and although I've been waiting for over a year to see this movie, I was left extremely disappointed."
"Danusha_Goska","8","11","21","12 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby Forced through a Kaleidoscope -- And It Works!
","8/10<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is an eye-popping, over-the-top, hyperkinetic, loud, heavy-handed circus, opera, and kitchen sink drama. Luhrmann takes F. Scott Fitzgerald's quiet, brief, cerebral novel and forces it through a kaleidoscope, crashing and scattering images in a peacock-colored, geometric Busby Berkeley dance routine. The amazing thing is, it works. The heart and soul of Fitzgerald's novel are there on screen, and honored. Underneath the literal glitter – that sticks to characters' faces and shoulders in multicolored patterns – this is a genuinely serious film about big themes. It entertained me, it moved me, and I cared. <br/><br/>I am very sensitive to color and there were scenes in Luhrmann's ""Gatsby"" when I was overwhelmed by chromatic sensation. There is a hotel room orgy. The women wear vivid, finger-in-your-eye obvious eye shadow that contrasts with their vivid, obtrusive colored jewelry that clashes with their crazily colored dresses which throb in contrast with the hideous, red, patterned wallpaper which I am sure is the wallpaper in the hell that bad interior decorators go to. In another scene, purple, blue, and gold metallic streamers cascade downward on a dancer in a buttercup-yellow, ostrich feather tutu. <br/><br/>And it all moves so fast. That ostrich feather tutu is on screen for seconds. The camera just keeps moving on to the next visual sensation. The costumes, the cars, the special effects, Bollywood film icon Amitabh Bachchan as Jewish gangster, Meyer Wolfsheim!!!: this movie's fabulosity budget must have been a zillion dollars. <br/><br/>Luhrmann lays everything on with a trowel. Long after the audience has realized that certain characters are users whose wealth protects them from the consequences of their evil deeds, Luhrmann tells the audience that, not just by speaking those words from Fitzgerald's book, but by writing the words out on the screen. Luhrmann shows, he tells, he beats you over the head. Only twice, though, did I feel he'd gone too far. Once when an obviously fake shooting star crossed the screen not once but I think three times, and when a character, struck by a car, is shown hurtling through space not once but twice. Once really was enough in both cases – one shooting star, one hurtling corpse. <br/><br/>There is a scene in this movie that took my breath away. After all that jazz, and color and movement, the movie just  stops. It stops in a hotel room. If you've seen the film, you know exactly which scene I'm talking about. There are no special effects in this scene, no fireworks, no presto changeo. It's just a group of people sitting around talking. And suddenly you feel as if you are on Broadway watching a Tony-winning production of Eugene O'Neill. That scene make my guts churn; it broke my heart. Is Luhrmann showing off here? Saying, See, I could hook you in with fabulousness, and now I will move you with nothing more magical than words and real feelings. <br/><br/>The cast is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio totally owns Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be human amidst all the glitz. He conveys Gatsby's power and his vulnerability. His voice is perfect; he sounds like someone trying to sound like a Kennedy. Joel Edgerton inhabits Tom Buchanan's brutality and snobbery. Isla Fisher is solid trash. Carey Mulligan brings Daisy to charming, pathetic, despicable life. Tobey Maguire is appropriately observant, lost, tempted, and jaded as Nick. Gorgeous Elizabeth Debicki channels Kirsten Scott Thomas. Richard Carter conveys quiet menace as a character whose job it is to announce, ""Chicago is calling."" If you can make that line scary, you are very talented. <br/><br/>The soundtrack mixes genuine jazz age music with rap-influenced music, and it works, too."

With that said, I can honestly say that I think this movie delivered. It was not only true to the novel, well-structured, visually stunning, and excellently acted; it was also a film that immersed the audience into its bright colors and intriguing soundtrack. Some of its highlights include: -Lana Del Rey's song ""Young and Beautiful"" pulled the film together as it was played a number of times but in variations. <br/><br/>-The film's bright colors drew the audience into it in a way that I haven't seen since 'Avatar'. <br/><br/>-Leonardo DiCaprio's acting was phenomenal. I really do hope he finally wins that Oscar<br/><br/>-If at all possible, I recommend viewing this movie in 3D.

","This is the most worst adaption of the wonderful novel that could have been made, ever. Gatsby's villa is a CGI-fantasy-nightmare. The (unneccessary!) attempt to point out the timely relevance of the story with a horrible Hip Hop- and Electro-score is just pathetic. The character of Carraway, who should be deluded by Gatsby and Daisy, is completely misinterpreted as the only one who really can understand Gatsby. Gatsby himself is not anymore this exciting ambivalent character, caught in his own pipe dream, not able to cope with the fact that past is irrecoverable gone, but a martyr, a victim of a cruel world that is oh! so degenerated - except him... And Daisy? A stupid little girl with a nice stupid face, far too young for the character. Even the way things put in picture is horrible! Just everything about this film is so horrible! If you want to get to know The Great Gatsby, read the book. Or watch the quite decent 1974 adaption with Mia Farrow (as a brilliant Dasiy!) and Robert Redford as Gatsby. It has its flaws as well, but it's quite close to the gist of it."
"StevePulaski","9","7","12","26 May 2013"," A mystifying hit, old sport
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's timeless novel ""The Great Gatsby"" is a wonderful piece of literature that dabs into many themes and events despite boasting a rather simple premise. Its commentary on the American Dream, its noted palette of colors, and array of ambiguous characters make it one of the most fascinating books I've read in high school. However, it's an understandably challenging read, seeing as the visual representation of the color and descriptions of the parties are left confined to the viewer's imagination, making something very important to the book abstract and personal.<br/><br/>It comes as a small surprise that he who mans the camera in the film is director Baz Luhrmann, a longtime Hollywood-man known for showcasing incredible visuals and limitless set designs. Luhrmann's grandiose vision is perfect for a story of this magnitude. He provides us with the best film rendition of ""The Great Gatsby"" I have yet to see, and one that perfectly compliments the style, tone, and thematic tendencies of the novel.<br/><br/>The story is difficult to summarize to those who never read the novel. I question if those unaware of the book or its plot before the release of the film expressed interest solely by the trailers. The story concerns a group of wealthy socialites in 1920′s New York, with the central focus on Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a young, ambitious writer-turned-bond broker. In the middle of studying business, he is instantly taken by the way the areas of East Egg and West Egg interact and hangout and becomes immersed in the desirable lifestyle, reconnecting with his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).<br/><br/>He soon becomes aware of a man named Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), an elusive figure largely concealed by his enormous parties that disguise his presence and true character. Many rumors exist about who he is and what he does, but the character is vacuous to everybody but Nick, who strikes up an early friendship with the man. Nick learns the justification for Gatsby's larger-than-life parties and mystifying ora is an overall attempt to get closer to Daisy. After being shipped off to war, he lost all contact and desperately craves her love and tenderness once more.<br/><br/>Like most great works of literature, ""The Great Gatsby"" can be seen as an embodiment of several themes and ideas. Most commonly associated are its symbolic representation of the American Dream, along with a romantic love channeling obsession and the idea that money can't buy or produce happiness. Writers Luhrmann and Craig Pearce beautifully articulate this in an accessible, yet versatile way. The film should not be viewed as a party movie, although the parties are extreme and excessive. Nick describes them as a ""kaleidoscopic carnival"" and that is, by far, the best summation of the lavishness and vivacious qualities of a Gatsby party.<br/><br/>The performances here are divine. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio are wonderful fits for their respective characters, each emphasizing their own particular qualities. Carey Mulligan of Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is, at times, mesmerizing here, Elizabeth Dibecki does some fine work here, in terms of creating a character out of small parts, and Joel Edgerton is terrific as the incorrigible brute that is Tom. The talent combined with the pulsating energy of Luhrmann's production and effects creates an indescribable allure.<br/><br/>This is the second film by Luhrmann I have seen, with the first being his dismal ""Romeo + Juliet,"" a film modernizing the iconic play by effectively creating a film for kids who don't like reading. With ""Gatsby,"" he has left a lot more in tact with the original novel and doesn't make too big of an attempt to rewrite its devices with things from the new-age. If one can overlook the anachronistic music by Jay-Z and Florence + The Machine, which can blend awkwardly with the aesthetics of the Jazz Age/Roaring Twenties, this is still a faithful adaptation of the beloved book. It also helps if you overlook the use of phrase ""old sport"" at the end of nearly every sentence Gatsby says.<br/><br/>It's always intriguing to see a film based on a book many kids have read in school be adapted into a mainstream film. Detractors of it now become anxious to see it, and those who loathed it just because they were required to read and test on it in school flock to see it. For ""The Great Gatsby,"" I think it helps that Luhrmann's distinctly flashy style and bombastic image took the foreground for the marketing of the picture. Thankfully, this isn't a hollow and superfluous adaptation with little below the surface. It's a visual spectacle and a delightful picture completely fit for the cinema.<br/><br/>Starring: Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Elizabeth Dibecki. Directed by: Baz Luhrmann."

","(Not sure if spoiler, don't think so, but do not want to get banned) First of all, although I love DiCaprio, he was not the best to play Gastby. He didn't capture what Gastby was really all about. DiCaprio sensationalized Gatsby more than necessary and it took away from the movie as a whole. Tobey Maguire was a perfect Nick. I must give Luhrmann that. Maguire captured all the right facial expressions, all the uncertainty and hesitance that Nick has. Mulligan was an okay choice. She grasped the fake innocence well-enough, but something was still not right about her. Debicki was an awful choice for Jordan. Jordan is a very important character in the book, she symbolizes how the old eggers also cheat and Luhrmann didn't even go over that. She was just there and Debicki didn't do very well playing a stuck-up woman. The biggest problem I have with this movie is it seemed too fake. It's hard to explain. But, when watching a movie, you should be able to delve into it, but, there are points in the movie when even the back drop was fake and it took away from the story. Also, we are suppose to feel sorry for Gatsby at the end, not Daisy. Daisy is the bad guy and Luhrmann didn't get that. At the end, he rushed through the main theme of carelessness and greed of the Buchanans that have. Instead, he makes Gatsby seem like the bad person. Luhrmann gets the idea of God watching and the Green Light very well. Wait, no, there was no mystery to what it meant. He told you. Everything was put out there, nothing to make you think. But, another thing Luhrmann failed to show was the importance of the owl-eye man. The owl- eye man has a very important role because he is the only one who sees through Gatsby's parties. But, yet he is the only one who shows up in the end. Luhrmann missed his importance. Lastly, the costumes, the scene was great. It looked just as we imagine the roaring 20s. We see the alcohol, the speakeasies, the flappers, everything we imagine 20s are, we get. Except, for the music. The music is contemporary jazz, not 20s jazz. Not the same. So, do not watch this movie for a book report."

","Set in the 1920's, Nick(Tobey MaGuire) befriends J. Gatsby(Leonardo DiCaprio), a lonely billionaire, and quickly discovers that he once romanced his cousin Daisy(Carey Mulligan), but she is now married Tom(Joel Edgerton) another billionaire. How will this end for everybody? <br/><br/>Baz Luhrmans direction is beyond brilliant, he makes us feel like we are in that period. Tobey MaGuire is good here too, you'll forget he was once Spider Man, you are put in his shoes, you are going through everything with him. Joel Edgerton is great has Tom, he is so unlikable, that every time he's on screen you just want to smack him. Carey Mulligan is Oscar worthy has the tortured Daisy. But Leonardo DiCaprio is beyond terrific as Gatsby, You feel his loneliness, and his love for Daisy, I'm not gonna say any more but this a great movie, I hope it won't be missed by the Oscars."
"Princess_Nuala23","9","22","49","8 May 2013"," After a year of waiting.... I am soooooooooo not disappointed
","I read the book last year, loved it, have read it two more times since, and after seeing every trailer for the movie I just could not wait for it. I was a little worried that my expectations would be too high and that the movie wouldn't reach them, but it definitely did. I loved it. The direction is a bit flashy and over-the-top as most Luhrman stuff is, but only for about the first 40 minutes or so. Once Gatsby and Daisy are reunited, the film has so much heart and soul and the film intensifies all the way up until the end. It was sad, tragic, and best of all, it carries the same themes and motifs from the book. If you're not familiar with the book you may question some of the stuff in the film, but I honestly think if you love the book, and have been waiting for a GREAT Gatsby movie (I didn't like the '74 one much) that is very true to the book, has some great acting (Leo's Oscar-worthy here, folks, and Mulligan, Maguire, and Edgerton give some of their best performances I've ever seen, and newcomer Elizabeth Debecki is just wonderful as Jordan Baker), beautiful visuals, fun music (the music here is cleverly done and didn't feel TOO out-of-place, and the mix of old-school and jazz symbolically works here in my opinion) and a basically over-all understanding of the book and it's meanings, I feel you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Even as just a film, I do believe this film will become a true classic years from now, despite it's less-than-stellar box office intakes or poor-mixed reviews it's getting, I feel over time this will get good word of mouth and the general public MIGHT learn to love it over time.<br/><br/>But we'll see. I loved it. 3D was well-executed too, imo. 9.5/10"

","A few months ago I saw the first trailer of the great Gatsby and thought it was going to be great, now an hour after watching it, was it actually that good?<br/><br/>The great Gatsby is a very good movie with just as good actors, when the movie starts you can feel and see it was expensive and did cost a lot of effort to make. the story is well written, the characters are interesting and the shots just looked great. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie just feels like magic, all the unreal parties which everyone would like to join just look great. the custom made car Leonardo Di caprio's character drives in would easily be chosen for world best car. <br/><br/>After an hour the passing slows down and the story starts, I am not going to spoil any part of it but i can tell you it is good and unexpected this happen all the time. <br/><br/>Are there any bad parts in the movie? yes in my opinion the ending could have been done much better, the movie leaves you with an empty feeling which was not necisery.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 it is one of the best movies seen this year and it will most likely end up in my top 5."

","So much time was spent on the staging of the elaborate parties, which was well done, that there was little for the core of the plot... the three affairs, one with Nick and Jordan, totally ignored. Of course the movie can't cover everything and it did hit the high spots accurately, but there is no passion, only ersatz parties, which anachronistic music including ""rap"" at one point is played. It's just poorly written. Fitzgerald's book had soul and vision of a society corrupted by greed. This movie seems to extol the value of greed, proving that ""all that glitters is not gold"" as far as movie making goes. DiCaprio was good as was Maquire, but the women seem more like mannequins... perhaps echoing performances of silent screen stars of the 20s."
"martina-701-699171","5","9","17","2 June 2013"," A lot missing in the portrayal
","The 2013 Baz Luhrmann movie is both hit and miss. The themes of excess, decadence, and idealism of 1922 Long Island New York were well done. However, the critical theme of hope fell short. Costumes and jewelry were beautifully and authentically represented, but the sets (particularly the New York scenes) looked like school dioramas.<br/><br/>I was extremely impressed with Elizabeth Debecki who played Jordan Baker, golf amateur and Daisy's friend. Not only was she the most beautiful and gorgeous woman in the film, she was true to character. I couldn't take my eyes off her. I think she stole the show in a riveting but subtle way. She of course was one of Gatsby's conduits to Daisy. However, in the book she is described as having ""autumn-leaf yellow hair"" yet in the film her hair is black (which is odd because in real life, Elizabeth is auburn-haired). The book hints as her being Nick Carraway's ""girlfriend"" but this is not depicted fully in the film.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton who played Daisy's husband, Tom Buchanan, is an Australian affecting an American accent. It took me half-way into the film to get used to it (and there are many Australians playing Americans in the movie which can be quite distracting). After half-way, I thought Tom's character came to the fore and the awkward acting of the beginning was replaced with some superb scenes. So in effect Joel was weaker in the rich old-moneyed American scenes and exceptionally strong when deeper emotions are required.<br/><br/>Isla Fisher played Tom Buchanan's mistress and George Wilson the mechanic's wife, Myrtle. With less of a role, nevertheless she did a fine job. It's a pity that the over-hyped visual effects ruined the critical scene. Instead of a poignant scene, Luhrmann chose to make the gravity of the situation too obvious - and in slow motion - which was like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.<br/><br/>The narrator Nick Carraway was played by Tobey Maguire, working in the stock market and coming into the new-moneyed society. His character was too ""starry-eyed"" and sometimes clownish in his innocence. I would have liked to see more depth in his character.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan played Daisy Buchanan. Her clothes, style, movement, looks, and naivety were all well done, but there was something missing. She didn't quite master the ethereal qualities which I think were the true Daisy. And she is not as sympathetic and warm as she would like people to believe, and although this was portrayed by Mulligan, again Baz Luhrmann hammered it home too much instead of letting the script tell the story.<br/><br/>I love Leonardo DiCaprio and all his work. Unfortunately he does not come close to the magnificent, powerful, emotive, love-struck, poor-boy-makes-it-rich rendition of Jay Gatsby. I don't think this was Leo's fault entirely – I think he was poorly directed by Baz Lurhmann. In wanting to make Gatsby the American symbol of hope, it was lost in too much facial expression which only served to exaggerate his feelings instead of letting the character emerge with a look, a smile, a turn of the head. It just, to me, looked like too much over-acting. He never really captured the gentleness and elegance of Gatsby. The closest he got was during the shirt scene in which he threw his shirts onto the bed and over Daisy and Nick. That was DiCaprio's finest moment – and his truest depiction of Gatsby. The rest did nothing for me, except the last scene in the swimming pool. That was finely acted.<br/><br/>Some reviewers wrote that it seemed that Luhrmann hadn't read the book carefully and I tend to agree. If he did, he had his own preconceptions of what he wanted to do. But even if you hadn't read the book, there were too many cringe-worthy factors in the movie, with only some ""wow"" factors, and not enough tenderness, subtlety, nuance, and love-lost poignancy."

","I believe this is the third remake of the Great Gatsby . Unfortunately, whatever faults the original film may have had is nothing compared to this silly time waster . Fine actors have been replaced by lots of stupid CGI's you would expect to find in your run of the mill action flick . Lot's of needless car races between Gatsby in his yellow Duesenberg and next door neighbor friend Nick Carraway who drives a blue Auburn Speedster . In one scene they speed all the way to get to a Harlem nightclub to watch a risqué show with scantily clad ladies dancing to Hip Hop ! Yes, the time line is 1922 but you won't hear Rudy Vallee singing in this picture . Gatsby seems to enjoy indulging himself with huge parties and millions of people he doesn't know in his gigantic mansion . The romantic plot between Gatsby and Daisy is downright boring ! I couldn't wait for this movie to end as I had absolutely no feelings for Gatsby or any of the other characters . Fortunately, Gatsby's Duesenberg survived the movie with only a cracked windshield . Don't see this movie in the theater . Instead rent the DVD for $1 when it arrives next month at your local supermarket Red Box . At least you will be able to take a snooze on your comfortable couch if you happen to doze off like I did ! Not Hot !"

","No, no, no, no, no. I wanted to love it..... scratch that I did love it uh i'm so confused. Let me elaborate, You see ""old sport"" I went to watch this movie rather later than the rest of my peers. So I kept hearing how it wasn't as good as it could have been and how Tobey Maguire mutilated his character and gave a weasel performance. So then there I was, watching it with all these negative views already imprinted in my brain. I personally haven't read the novel, or seen the original (don't shun me I'm relatively young) but there's been only raving reviews. So this was a fresh story for me and desperately trying to neglect anything I was previously told. I have to say, I did love it. Tobey Maguire did play a spineless Jesse bell and was rather insipid at times but I felt that he was only our intermediary for Gatsby so I wasn't really all that bothered that his performance didn't blow me away. Leo gave me exactly what I needed from him, he can play any charismatic character and have the audience fixated on him for the rest of the movie. It's nature Vs nurture and you cannot teach charisma to anyone, they must be born with it. I had an immense feeling of exuberance anytime he was on screen. And I have to admit I've never rooted for anyone to prevail as much in my entire movie watching life until Gatsby. I suppose I'll give the others a mention too Joel Edgerton(the warrior) gave a mentionable performance playing the arrogant, pompous ass Tom Buchannan. I think it's his face he's got a long career ahead of him playing the antagonist... I despised his character in the warrior(ALL THOSE WINS BY TAP OUT). Carrey Mulligan(Daisy Buchannan) also gave a very endearing performance she leads us to believe she is as delicate as a flower, only to find out that the flower is the most poisonous of all flowers and will draw you in and suck the life from you. Isla fisher was okay, she had sex appeal.<br/><br/>If you scrape away at the superficial facade of wealth and the fête in the story you will find the real profound meaning to this tale that Women and Money are evil.Both known to extremely cloud your judgement. The great Gatsby is a unique love story and open to many interpretations. Watching this movie, It was the first time that I had noticed that the upper class are actually being slated at every opportunity. I have no problem with it I just wonder if they are really that shallow and conceded. If not it must be hard being a multi millionaire with an established family name... my condolences. Last but not least I wish to commend Baz Luhrmann I don't think he's been given enough credit(everyone saying his movie is mediocre) for really capturing the glitz and glamour side of that era. From the automobiles to the illegal backroom drinking and from the beautiful mistresses to the extravagant parties it was all quite remarkable. Excellent story I loved it"
"vissini95","8","5","8","14 July 2013"," One of the best recent films I have seen
","Maybe it's because I haven't read the novel or seen any other film versions , but I can't understand why some critics are so harsh with this one. Baz Luhrmann seems to know what he's doing for another time and , as in Moulin Rouge , he combines impressive colors and pictures with quality and drama. I can't imagine any other actor ,at least at this day, who could portray Jay Gatsby as Di Caprio did. This elegance and charm he clearly possesses just make him ideal for the part. Mulligan is a little bit indifferent but you can't say she is not playing well. Maguire is also great , even if the idea of telling his story to a psychiatrist seems a little out of the spirit of the film. But there is high drama in this film especially at the end. You must not miss this one. 8/10"
"anavaleria114","10","5","8","29 June 2013"," One of the most loyal adaptation's I've seen
","My favorite thing about this movie was definitely how loyal it was to the book. The dialogues, the suspense of several situations, were portrayed in this movie as good as Fitzgerald did in the book. Leonardo Dicaprio and Mulligan did amazing Gatsby and Daisy and I really enjoyed the photography. The only thing I didn't like much about the movie was the music (except for the main song by Lana del Rey which fit perfectly), I think that Luhrmann could have taken advantage that the movie is based in the 20s and could have put more Charleston or Jazz; it was an interesting experiment to put Hip Hop songs in it, but Jazz would have fit best for it."
"larasbryant","9","5","8","17 May 2013"," actually, it's pretty good
","I never liked the book or the other Gatsby films I've seen, and after all the negative reviews I thought I wouldn't enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>But I did. The cinematography, elaborate visuals, set design, costumes, all bring the story to life in a way I was never quite able to imagine before. The yellow car was sublime, and the billboard with the eyes - in the book somehow I never was able to picture that and this film actually helped me understand the geography of the story better, in the drive between Long Island and Manhattan. The film is faithful to the original story. The editing was nicely done; I didn't feel that the film wasted time or dropped the ball with the story. Acting was fantastic from absolutely everyone, I loved Leonardo DiCaprio and Joel Edgerton. I didn't expect to feel sorry for Tom and somehow I did at one point. I was worried about the music after hearing the reviews but should have known better. Baz Luhrmann knows what he is doing. It was modern enough to be relatable but still connected to the older time - loved the Gershwin, very nice touch. But Nick Carraway stuck with me the most, after the film was over - excellent job by Toby McGuire and the writers. Nick is both a voyeur and a participant in the story - both outside and inside. The film really made that clear to me. I'll be thinking about Nick for a while, and what he could have/should have done differently, and how this story changed his life."
"Eaglebelf","9","5","8","12 May 2013"," Luhrmann comes through!
","Baz Luhrmann's visuals are amazing as usual. Of course the story is compelling being based on such a popular book. The acting is also done very well. DiCaprio's Gatsby is perfect in displaying the true nature and complexities of the character. It all comes together in a truly great adaptation. <br/><br/>By the end of the film you realize why so many people have loved the book (myself included). However, it's Luhrmann's visual style and storytelling ability that bring the classic to life on film. It is an absolutely beautiful film from start to finish. <br/><br/>The quick pace at the beginning of the film is mildly jarring and that is somewhat typical for Luhrmann's more eclectic films. I also think that is somewhat the point of those scenes. While some may see this as a mistake I also can't help thinking that the indulgence is intentional as it relates to the ideas and themes of the book. <br/><br/>This one is definitely worth seeing in the theater. I don't think you should see it in 3D but I don't really think you should see anything in 3D. It's a brilliant film. Bringing Fitzgerald's Gatsby to the screen is an incredibly difficult task. Luhrmann not only accomplishes that but he does it with a style and flair that add to the story and present it in a unique way. That's the reason you go see an adaptation. The more I think about it the more I like it. That's the mark of a great film."

"Leofwine_draca","4","3","4","31 December 2017"," Extremely silly
","I suppose the thought behind hiring Baz Luhrmann to direct THE GREAT GATSBY was that he could bring the Roaring Twenties as described in F. Scott Fitzgerald's book to life in a lavish, vivid, and colourful way and he does that all right. The first thirty minutes of this film is a headache-inducing overload of the senses, with everything directed in a way which makes over-the-top sound like a tame description. It's as if a kid ate a jar of sugar and then went berserk with tins of paint in an all-white room. The effect is nausea-inducing, and the worst thing for me is the use of anachronistic music (hip hop) and the like instead of period-era fare. The rest of the film settles down a bit, but the story still feels lightweight and drawn out, with a minimum of characterisation. Leonardo DiCaprio does the best he can with what he's given but you feel a bit sorry for him due to the lack of direction he receives, while others like Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan are miscast and out of place. Isla Fisher is embarrassingly bad. This is the kind of disappointment that I do my best to erase from my memory soon after watching."

"MrCosmosPhD","3","3","4","8 March 2017"," All Flame With no Real Fire
","Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel ""The Great Gatsby"" is all flare with no real fire. In his attempts to focus on the pizazz and vibrancy that many associate with the Roaring Twenties, and focus on that alone, Luhrmann dismisses any substantial effort to analyze the facetious, layered veneer of the world around our characters. He is able to get by with basic qualities of the original text, such as the events of the novel being primarily told through the perspective and understanding of Nick Carraway, who isn't even the center protagonist, but what he does retain can be described as ""duhs"" and not even worth a mention.<br/><br/>This is not to say, regardless, that every facet of the film shatters at the slightest critical touch. The vibrant lights and colours of the splendid Long Island, made contrasted by the dark, grey, and melancholy Valley of Ashes, are almost exactly how this viewer had pictured them as he read the novel, and several of the film's performances (namely Mr. Maguire as the shy, evidently out-of-place Nick Carraway, and Miss Debicki as the smouldering, seductive Jordan Baker) feel ripped straight from the pages of the novel. Unfortunately, I myself never could shake the uneasy feeling that Mr. Leo DiCaprio was doing a retread of a character he's done in a movie before. You should not be blamed for stumbling in during Gatsby's introduction thinking for a few seconds you are watching Titanic.<br/><br/>On to where the film crumbles, collapses, and comes crashing down-most notably, the pacing is absolutely dreadful, and dreadful absolutely. The film never stops striking you as being rushed along, as if Luhrmann's primary goal is to use as many of the novel's noteworthy quotations as possible more so than achieving any deeper introspection into the flaws of our protagonists in a flawed world of corruption, theatrics, and dreams long past. This viewer never once, in the entirety of his viewing experience, felt as if the novel's most illustrious and emotionally climactic moments were given the time deserved to trickle into the viewer's emotions themselves. I am aware of Gatsby's terminal fate occurring immediately just before the novel's closing chapter, but five minutes is simply not enough to acknowledge his isolation in death-merely removing every other funeral attendee from the novel except for Nick does not make me less aware of that fact, in spite of it in all truth being one of the major changes I found myself leaning favourably towards-the sudden interruption of Owl Eyes' arrival in the novel I could have done without. I should furthermore make mention of my dissatisfaction of the film's score-that strange mixture of hip-hop and electronic music does not become jazz purely by adding a trumpet in the background, much in the same respect that adding a symphony to a ""Disturbed"" song does not a Beethoven piece make.<br/><br/>The paramount issue this adaptation faces, nevertheless, is how it wholly fails to translate the novel's topics on the American Dream and the sick, poisoned world that hides behind its bright, attractive exterior. Only by the end of the picture does the Green Light, the most notorious symbol of the novel, step out to become more than a secondary object that exists predominantly for our characters to point out so the director can brag about how faithful his adaptation is. The movie's gross dearth of subdued reflection left this viewer feeling broken nosed, understanding that he had obtained nothing of value from the experience except for appreciating the worth of director that is forced to wave his arms, bellowing, ""This is how you wanted to see it come to life!!"" because he lacks the aptitude to offer anything beyond dazzling white noise-that is, none.<br/><br/>I think there is one moment of the film that bar none demonstrates my argument better than any other. Once Nick Carraway is invited to the house of our prestigious protagonist, we are treated to what feels like 10 minutes of long, uninterrupted huzzah and celebration, during which we meet our protagonist, and during which Baz obtains the opportunity to revel in his own sets and lights. After this, as Nick is set to leave, a loud crash is heard, and the camera turns to the now-ditched Owl Eyesfor about 2 seconds, before it's time to head home. No deeper examination, no analysis of the partygoers savage debauchery, no moment to give Nick any time to question the company he is in; no, it's played for laughs before it's immediately time to retire for the night, because Baz Luhrmann likes shiny keys, and especially likes to jangle them in front of your stupefied face to seduce you into a trance-like state, because his efforts fall apart once you decide to think critically.   <br/><br/>It makes me weep to think of the appalling reality of this reinterpretation undeniably going to be the one recognized by current and future consumers of media. It is empty, narrow, dense, loud, moronic, witless, benign, and most of all unworthy to even kiss Fitzgerald's feet, and it is with no falter of my judgment that I proclaim this film to have fizzled out faster than the era it is set in."

","I understand that this movie is set in ""the roaring 20's"" and that everything is supposed to be extravagant, but the way this movie was made stripped it of its credibility.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, Nick Carraway is telling his story years later from an alcohol rehabilitation center. Right from the start, the story is altered. If the opening scene doesn't coincide with the novel, what other major changes can we expect? Is this movie going to be anything like Fitzgerald's novel? <br/><br/>Later we arrive at the house party scenes. The party at Gatsby's estate was just like I imagined. I was convinced that this was 1920's authentic, until I heard Jay-Z and Kanye West in the background. Maybe this wasn't a problem for other people but to me the music was out of place. <br/><br/>My last problem with this movie's execution was the car chase scenes. Something about the set made the entire scene look like a cartoon. Was I supposed to believe that Gatsby could actually drive 100 miles per hour without looking or steering? Or was the movie now completely fictional. <br/><br/>I expected a different movie. This movie was hardly similar to the novel ""The Great Gatsby"" and I think the director could have done a better job to make it like the book."

This movie. This...this thing, this creation. It's not worthy anyone's time.
Baz Luhrmann as a director has no idea what the hell he's doing. His Romeo and Juliet film was dumb enough on its own (Dancing with guns, enough said), but this film started off in the bottom of the barrel and dug a basement for itself, then fell through to Hell. The beginning sets a bad enough precedent; Nick is apparently institutionalized for anger issues and alcoholism that were never present in the story, and the plot device of him being institutionalized is ultimately pointless. Why the hell would you make such a stupid change when it's largely inconsequential? The infusion of modern radio music leaves me scratching my head even now. The actors for Tom and Nick actually fit their characters relatively well, and DiCaprio does a great job as usual, but for chrissake even their acting couldn't save this trainwreck. If it wasn't for the safety net of the source material, only god knows how much worse Luhrmann could've made this."

I believe that a carefully selected modern score can compliment a film which is set in an earlier period however the choice was poor, unflattering and so divisive that i nearly turned off. The costumes are well selected but again the early sections of the film were simply a riot of colour, noise and fashion which rather than add to the celebration of shallowness and wealth that it so overtly tried to depict, distracted from any nuance by way of the directors own ego.

Although it did have some things that were similar to the book, not everything was there. And I think that Myrtle in this movie looked a little too ""skanky"" to be a woman living in the 1920's.

Maybe, one day, he will make a film worth watching to the end - I shan't hold my breath.<br/><br/>Please stop Baz - it's not about you. Just let the film/story speak for itself."

","The Great Gatsby is based on the film in the 70s of the same name and a novel, which was mediocre to begin with so there was no reason to be highly invested in this movie. But since time has passed since the last film you expect them to learn from their mistakes and make a better movie overall. <br/><br/>Plus I am always eager to see a Leonardo DiCaprio film, he in my honest opinion is a thrill to watch and always puts on fantastic performances. Since he was the front and center of the Great Gatsby, I was highly anticipated to watch this movie. But unfortunately I was let down, not by his performance but the overall movie. <br/><br/>Leonardo actually does the best he can and plays his character well, the movie overall however is not laid out well at all in my opinion. Leon will grasp your attention and make you pay attention the scenes he is in. Toby Maguire on the other hand was OK as the narrator of the plot but he was not doing anything astounding, I actually liked him in his role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman series, but Toby as the narrator here did not do anything special. The rest of the cast was fine, Carey Mulligan was OK, I actually really liked Joel Edgerton character in a antagonistic sort of way unfortunately his role was not extended he might have uplifted this movie with his good performance.<br/><br/>The setting was captured well they showed how the rich people back then lived their life. It is one of the positives of this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts out SO slow, and it is not until 30-40 mins that you see Leo and then things SLIGHTLY pick up from there but even after that the whole movie feels cliché and the plot/narrative still doesn't interest me much, it is a love story, of a how far a man would go for a woman, touching for some, but I was not really astounded by it, mainly because the movie has too many songs in between scenes and those songs are not really good and only distract the viewer on the narrative, they just seem filler and go on too long. What was the point of that? To add more extra time to the movie? To drag out the plot which could have been told better in half the time?<br/><br/>Gatsby's back-story and the mystery behind him was something i was interested in knowing and was invested in but they took SO long to reveal it that by that time I did not care.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby just like the novel is a mediocre affair, if they had tweaked things in the novel to make for better cinema I would have been all for it, plus reducing the number of unnecessary dance and party could have helped the narrative a lot and would have uplifted this movie. Unfortunately what we get is a long slow and mostly boring film which is just a mediocre affair and hard to watch. <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 5/10."

","I teach 11th grade literature. My students read ""The Great Gatsby"" earlier this semester and their verdict was a very unenthusiastic ""it's okay."" Now this absolutely horrified me, as I am a huge Fitzgerald fan and completely in love with the novel. So I thought that maybe if the students saw a visual representation of the novel, they would come to appreciate this beautiful tale.<br/><br/>Now, I had watched the 1974 Redford version and really liked it. However, it's a little long and a little boring to show to a group of 17 year olds. So I decided to give this film a try.<br/><br/>I bought the film and watched it at home with my husband (I wanted to make sure it was appropriate to show my kids). I have to admit, the first time I watched it, I wasn't blown away. I found it intriguing....but not great. I decided, however, that I might as well let them see it since I had paid 10 bucks for it.<br/><br/>It would be an understatement to say that my students LOVED it! They loved the sets, the music and, of course, the girls went crazy for Leonardo DiCaprio Moreover, for the first time ALL YEAR they were able to intelligently discuss character motivations, tone, mood, theme, symbols and literary devices...and not just from the film... they actually insisted that we go back and re-read sections in the book! And they were so thrilled to see much of the same language in both the book and this film. Because of this film, my students were able to appreciate a classic piece of American literature! As for me, this movie definitely got better the more I watched it. It is visually stunning, and surprisingly loyal to the book. DiCaprio gives a beautiful portrayal of Gatsby-- I'd say even better than Redford (and I love him)! <br/><br/>Give this film a second chance, or maybe even a third. It's worth it!"

","A long time ago every Saturday afternoon you could see an old movie on Flemish television. John Wayne , Danny Kaye, Charlie Chaplin, Spencer Tracy, Mickey Rooney, Clint Eastwood etc. were seen weekly in a black and white or in those faded 60's Technicolor color movie. Regularly they played the old dance movies and musicals with well-known stars such as Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth , Gene Kelly, Samy Davis Jr. . and many others . All situated in the 20's with men in tuxedos and women who float around in expensive evening gowns and overloaded with glitzy jewelry. A paragon of wealth and decadence which was reserved for some at that time. So I saw a lot of them passing by on the screen while dancing the Foxtrot. My hate and disgust for anything that smells like musical , is grown in that period. I skip each musical or dance film purely for the fact that they always start to sing or spontaneously start dancing for every trivial fact. Pancakes are made and you can expect there is a serenade on this baking process. Or there is some ordinary shopping done in a local supermarket , and before you know it, everyone dances a waltz in between the vegetables. Pfffft , nothing for me .<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" itself is not exactly a true musical or dance film, but the decadent parties that Gatsby is organizing are dangerously close to it. I expected every moment an alignment of women dressed in swimsuits, extremely precise in a row, making a jump in sequential order and with deadly precision into Gatsby's enormous garden fountain. And yet I didn't like the choice of music. It didn't really fit the whole of this movie. The beginning of the song by Jay Z (I thought it was him) mixed with images of New York and the display of wealth that some people possess , I found successful. But the music does not fit with the swirling parties afterwards . In some way it clashed with the picture what you got in mind. And personally I thought that the interpretation of ""Back and Black"" was a blatant violation of the sublime song of Amy Whinehouse despite that Beyonce has a beautiful voice.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any previous films directed by Baz Luhrmann. I only know Moulin Rouge and i obviously haven't seen that for the well-known reasons that I already described above. It took some effort to get used to that airborne camera images in the beginning, but on the whole, his approach is sometimes grotesque. It looked all magical and fairy-like. Several times it had such an effect that was used in ancient times to emphasize a love scene or some magical moments. Those hazy and shimmering shadows around certain images. It reminded me sometimes of the first ""Wizard of Oz"" movie. The imposing and monstrous looking mansion of Gatsby looked like it was in a direct competition with the castle you can admire in Disneyland. So exaggerated. So it all looks decent and is terribly perfectly portrayed. The glamour of those days splashes of the screen, but at the same time, it all looks so fake . The computer animation department clearly had to do an extra effort. In terms of costumes for the characters, this film is matchless. Ditto for the props that can be admired throughout the film. From the Oldsmobiles that drive around until the furniture. In one word: masterful .<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire I think is the biggest flaw in this movie. The fact that he's a person who has to get over his alcohol problem and tells his story about Gatsby to a psychiatrist or physician, and at the same time has the appearance of a pubescent student, makes the whole rendition of Carraway totally unbelievable. By the way, I still think that his acting ability is limited to the sometimes silly staring into nothing, with such a moronic smile on his face . DiCaprio also looks too young for his portrayal as Gatsby . In fact you may well expect that he would have a face that shows how difficult his live has been. But I think Leo does an excellent performance as the mysterious and extravagant billionaire . Maybe a bit too melodramatic . And the phrase ""Old sport"" does not fit completely with him. Besides it really started to get on my nerves after a while hearing him saying that over and over again. A disadvantage is that it takes a while before he comes into the picture and then Maguire needs to carry the complete movie. And that failed miserably . For me, Joel Edgerton , who played Tom Buchanan, was the best actor in this film . The bravado and arrogance that he displayed was beautiful to watch.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever read Fitzgerald's book. The content is actually a plain simple love story . The run-up to the meeting with Gatsby, I liked the most in this movie when Maguire moves into the small house overshadowed by the immense castle of the mysterious Gatsby. Once this is over , it's really only a dull and ordinary love story and Maguire is relegated to a pathetic spectator of the flirting between Gatsby and Dais.<br/><br/>Actually I expected more from ""The Great Gatsby"". It's is a damn long, boring and sad movie. I had problems keeping my eyes open. Nothing much happens in it. And if you're planning to have a fun time watching a happy movie, you better look further."

","Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) recalls his time with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's 1922 on Long Island. Nick rents a small house next to Jay's mansion. He is constantly throwing big parties. Nick is visited by his cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton).<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann definitely injects his vision of the roaring 20s. The music is perfect. The movie has the grandiose vision that it so desperately needs. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for this role. In many ways, he brings his real life and breathes it into this character. His real life models-filled-partying ways make it so realistic. Carey Mulligan brings a more sweet sensibility. However Tobey Maguire and his non-stop literary narration isn't always needed. Unlike the visuals, more is not always the best. What is truly needed is a solid lens for the audience to view the proceedings. Tobey is more a shaky cam. The last 1/3 is too slow. It needs a more tension filled resolution. All in all, it's beautiful and Leo's perfect."

","I have always looked in those deep, intense, passionate blue eyes and wondered what would that man be like in real life? Perhaps he wanted to answer that question for all those out there like me, so be became the Great Gatsby of F.Scott Fitzgerald. Or perhaps he loves mysterious characters. And that's saying a lot, because it defined his entire life.<br/><br/>Obviously I thought something was intensely defining, daring yet also silently questionable about Leonardo when he appeared in 'what's eating Gilbert Grape' as a perfect actor. But then he did more than amaze the world in Titanic. Then something happened as 2000 began, beginning of the new millennium in your lifetime or something, he began endless series of what seemed like chapters of shutter island all the way;Gangs of New York, Blood diamond, Revolutionary road, Inception, J.Edgar, Django unchained, Great Gatsby of course, and now post production is 'The wolf of wall street'. <br/><br/>I mean, what could be 'wrong' with the most celebrated actor of the century? Fame could be what happened but I maybe just blabbering. <br/><br/>So what is The great Gatsby like; it's like perfect illusion, perfect acting, directing and it does justice to the story. But I am the kind of person who just can't help imagining what would be behind the screen, it's just irresistible; how would Leonardo relate to Gatsby while acting, or how would Tobey Maguire to Nick, or Adelaide Clemens to Daisy. I loved the way Adelaide said it, as if she could be this girl in real life; 'That's the best a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool'. How honest that sounded, as if she understood the character. But I couldn't help notice that something about this movie didn't seem to make it look complete, it had a missing part, or I guess too much in it, or perhaps imperfect lines, or the music, something seem to be missing. But maybe again, maybe that was what it was supposed to be like, for every Leonardo's movie, there is something that leaves people wondering about the answers, or perhaps about the real questions. I love this guy though, I love his work. And yes, it is Amitabh Bachchan the Bollywood actor, HATE him, I do, but yeah, Leonardo seemed to get well along with him, who am I to blame, it tuned out to be a good movie. For those who are wondering why such low rating for a Leonardo's film, let me tell you people, it's something with the rating and the romance movies, they seem to reciprocate each other."

","Stories, especially famous ones, thrive on their retelling. Different artists can pick out different aspects of the tale or give it a particular slant or direction, rather like different singers produce idiosyncratic covers of the same song.The original always remains no matter what.<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" is a story of artifice: of a man who constructs an entire existence out of artifice with the sole aim of rekindling an artificial 'great love story' which exists now almost entirely in his own mind and romantic memories, who achieves it by living a lie designed by his sinister backers in order to further their criminal activities. One can see why Baz Lurhmann, relentless champion of artifice and un- reality, would be attracted to such a tale, even more so given that it is set within the debauched Jazz age, now virtually a whole centuries remove from us (while the more famous 1974 version was made when it was still living memory, equivalent to a tale today told about the 60s) and whose music and style still influences the current pop scene.<br/><br/>We have seen his own gaudy versions of classic love stories ""Romeo and Juliette"" and ""Moulin Rouge"", infused with over the top spectacle, cabaret dance numbers and modern music, yet also shot through with a very delicate romantic sensibility when dealing with the tragic loves at their hearts. ""TGG"" is also a tragic love story of course, but tragic for a different reason. Here the tragedy is not of two star crossed lovers who cannot achieve Earthly happiness because of social impossibilities yet hold the flame of love to death and possibly beyond, but of one man who dreams of a love story that cannot be and destroys everything including himself in the process of trying to vainly realise it. Such a story is much harder to pull of course, though it is a common enough theme in tragedy throughout the ages (and the headlines of almost any newspaper) and it is also harder to get behind the characters. We intensely will two ardent lovers to be together, but watching a farce played out by a fool and a selfish harlot is hardly going to stoke the fire in our souls! <br/><br/>To his credit, Lurhmann has created a version that is faithful to the original, both in spirit and narrative, and also created something that will satisfy as a cinematic drama, especially for those totally unfamiliar with the book or other versions. Of course it is ""Lurhmann Style"", but is not the gaudy vulgar 3D circus the rather unappealing trailer made it out to be. The CGI fuelled artifice works within the context of what he is trying to do because (A) It's a Lurhmann project and (B) as we said the before the whole story, and indeed the sub-strata of an entire age of gaudy artifice, accommodates such blatant un- reality. <br/><br/>The actors chosen to play the parts do so fairly well. De Caprio, launched to real fame by Lurhmann as the tragic young Romeo now plays the tragic 30-something Gatsby. Like Redford in 74, a modern superstar is needed to play a character that is glamour and success apparently personified (but is just an actor like the actor playing him!) and De Caprio fits that bill for 2013 audiences. He does well in conveying the basic sham under the glamour, being little more than a love sick adolescent who still hasn't grown out of it, a little boy still dreaming of being a Prince. He fares less well in creating an aura of power and success, but given that his sham is revealed almost immediately in this version (rather like the interestingly analogous Mandarin character in the current Iron Man) perhaps that was the intention. He nails the basic tragedy of Gatsby, the naïve dreamer still pining for his fairy-tale castle and fairy tale princess, so that crucial element works. Tobey Maguire plays Tobey Maguire again, just as he did through 3 Spider Mans, and his take on narrator Nick Carraway is still Peter Parker. However, given that he is meant to be an idealistic fool taken in by all the glamour even as it evaporates, his casting is spot on! Carey Mulligan, already a veteran of tragic love stories, does well as the elusive object of his obsession Daisy, who was never intended to be a particularly alluring or beautiful, but rather to be a symbol of everything that Gatsby aspired to. Joel Edgerton is also good as Daisy's brutish jock husband, finding a redeeming quality beneath the seemingly ugly character and making us care for him (his views on race and class, though distasteful to modern audiences, were actually the norm for intelligent educated people at the time) Short changed alas are the ""Ash Valley"" couple of Myrtle (Isla Fisher) and George (Jason Clarke) Wilson, who perform nicely but are reduced to mere plot points – This beautified version keeps the ugly poverty very much to the margins! Elizabeth Debicki is also very good as golf pro, sarcastic observer and Carraway paramour Jordan Baker, but her part has also been drastically reduced here.<br/><br/>The anachronistic music is part of the Lurhmann style so is what it is. This being aimed at young 2013 audiences, it gets the IDEA of party madness across well while still maintaining a sampled styling of 20s sounds. Delicately mournful ballads are also provided for the ""tragic love"" bits too of course, courtesy of the likes of Lana Del Rey, Emile Sande and Florence Welche.<br/><br/>As a dramatic film is works well enough, and will crucially serve as an introduction to a great (and still highly relevant) masterpiece and the great F.Scott Fitzgerald to younger audiences who may never have heard of either. For that alone it should be praised."
"melsuds","7","4","6","16 May 2013"," Unfair Reviews
","I have seen and heard many mixed reviews for this film, many being deeply unfair, and also rife with people not understanding the aim of the film. As an avid fan of Baz Luhrmann and F. Scott's book, the movie had high expectations; which were very almost lived up to. <br/><br/>One negative comment I've heard is the film is it was 'too extravagant' and 'too glamorous'. but this is the thing, the movie is narrated by Nick Carraway (Maguire), who moves from Chigaco to New York in 1922. he mentioned he'd only been drunk once/twice and upon meeting his old college friend Tom Buchanan (Edgerton) was pushed full force into the glamorous lifestyle of New York in the 20's. we see the movie from his view -when to him the glamour would have been too much, over-whelming and hard to bare, therefore we feel exactly how he felt - like a tidal wave of fashion and alcohol and glitz had hit him.. It was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Another negative comment I have heard is how 'superficial' the film was how it focused on appearances too much. As much as I do feel the book was a little let down as those who have read it may feel like the story and feelings of the characters (especially Tom and Murtle) were lost a little but that is true of many books, it has to be true because film and novels are completely different ways of communicating and nothing is ever going to translate fully one way or the other. it's impossible to replicate every emotion and thought read about in a book, into a movie without an inner monologue of every character - and that would be too messy. I am writing off this 'fault' as irrelevant - as it exists in almost all novel adaptations.<br/><br/>the last is the contemporary music. first off, I feel like it was used extremely well (to an extent, I've had a few ideas as to when the songs used could have been put to better use) but it's an expected part of Luhrmann's work, and no one should be surprised. A lot of Jazz music was still involved, and even though there was some Beyoncé and Jay Z was squeezed in, the music suited the film well. music in a film does not always have to be historically correct, because then any films from roman times should not have any music except maybe the harp, or medieval films with only the..... mandolin. and remember that directors, cinematographers, writers, actors, musicians and everyone else will adapt with the environment and with the times. it's 2013, when 3D and CGI is used in most films being made, so why not put it to good use? the film was cinematically beautiful, and because graphic images like that is something we can achieve in the 21st century, why would we not just because the movie was set in 1922. Even 'the artist' had contemporary elements synthesised in, and it won an Oscar. <br/><br/>I'd also like to mention that every time I see Tobey Maguire I can't help but see 'Evil' Parker from spider-man 3, but somehow I did see past this when playing Nick. The acting was spectacular - from all starring roles and most of the supporting. Set design and Costumes were also beautiful. <br/><br/>My only real complaint was the editing, I can't help but cringe when giant heads are projected into the sky. cringe so bad, and also I disliked the type on screen at the end. but if that's my only fault then it did pretty well. I Think that's all I have to say......."

","I could not imagine watching Hugo in 2-D. I did not care much for it in 3D frankly but it was a superb use of the medium. For me 3-D has been disappointing more often than not, that includes Avatar and a host of Comic book films that I have seen plus a handful of animated films, though I also feel ""How to Train Your Dragon"" was certainly worth the extra few bucks for 3-D. So that is it out of a couple dozen films that I have paid to see in 3-D this is only the third one that was really worth the extra price. And truthfully, seeing ""How to Train Your Dragon"" in 2-d would be almost as good as in 3-d.<br/><br/>I am also not Baz Lurhmann's biggest fan having felt Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet were quite mediocre. I really enjoyed Australia though (I know I am in the minority on that one.)<br/><br/>I guess I am glad this film has opened to some mediocre reviews because I didn't have the greatest of expectations, but it was a wonderful film. Starting with the spectacular visuals. I tell you I think I would have enjoyed the film with no sound just to watch it as a moving canvas. But the sound was almost as phenomenal. I am an old guy. The idea of Jay-Z doing the Soundtrack for a classic novel was underwhelming at best to me, but I was happily surprised by the beautiful soundtrack throughout. I enjoyed every note. It also helped tie in the themes of the novel with the excesses of our present society.<br/><br/>I am a huge Leo DeCaprio fan and once again he gave a great performance. This was Joel Edgerton's best role besides maybe ""Animal Kingdom"" which is a real favorite film of mine. He does a sort of Gable impression as Tom Buchanan but it really works. Carey Mulligan was surprisingly strong as Daisy. My one disappointment may have been Tobey McGuire. I normally really like him as an actor but here he doesn't really deliver as Nick. In my mind, there is no great logical progression to the character that he has become in the first scene as he flashes back and tells the Gatsby story. <br/><br/>An extra bonus is that my daughter is planning to read the novel now. She reads a lot, but has avoided most classics. I loved the novel when I was a teenager, I am glad the film pointed her to the book. My daughter is 14 now, so I am not seeing as many animated films as I did a few years back. Maybe 3-D has been used well in some more recent animated films, but I don't miss any Marvel or DC films<br/><br/>Trust me, if you plan to see this film, and you really should, do yourself a favor and see it in 3-D. It is breathtakingly beautiful."
"gab-fan22","9","7","13","28 May 2013"," A rare treasure that captures the power, heartbreak and pain of its source
","Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is the 5th time this great American novel about how greed and excess corrupt and destroy us has been adapted to the screen. However, unlike the 74 version I truly left the theater like I did after reading the novel disturbed and haunted by the characters', their actions and moral values set against this ""time of wealth and happiness."" <br/><br/>The acting in this film is surprisingly great... Dicaprio is amazing as Gatsby and really in my opinion shows Gatsby as being who he is, he's rich yet he's also self-conscious about how he acts and talks to keep up his illusion of grandeur(Many will say Dicaprio is confused, but I feel this was essential especially even when he's taking to Nick or when he waits out in the rain for Daisy and even tries to leave prior to her arrival to capture Gatsby's character: He's empty, confused and desperate to live the life he craves where he is someone, he has love and bliss and is able to live the ""American dream"" that everyone else claims they're currently living in this time with all the parties, technologies and so on. He truly deserves Oscar consideration as does Joel Edgerton who simply BLEW ME AWAY as Tom Buchanan and truly captured Tom's bigotry, contempt and power as he shatters Gatsby's dreams at the Plaza by revealing how he's associated with gamblers, he's a bootlegger and a liar about his past. The scene at the Plaza hotel leading to the shouting match over Daisy was heartbreaking and great with the ice-pick serving as tension-building and Dicaprio flipping at Tom who's shattered his illusion of grandeur and respect as he begins after losing his cool to stammer and falter breaking Daisy who's unable to say at this point she never loved Tom.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan who I had doubts in actually really played Daisy spectacularly as she played her not like Mia Farrow as a ditzy and over-the top, but gave her a level of subtlety, nerve especially when she talks back to Tom which was not as seen in the book, but was great to show Daisy not as a total ditz... and will that gives her character a level of vulnerability and strength that makes her love for Gatsby more believable cause she does love him too(aka the scene where she rips her wedding dress when she finds Gatsby is till alive). She was excellent t showing how Daisy craved Gatsby, but was unable to bring herself to make that fateful leap to him and his idealism, instead falling back to money and security, rather than love and freedom to be her own boss.<br/><br/>Tobey is OK as Nick and he does seem believable in some scenes, and not in others. The music and the beginning was a bit odd, but the music really worked in the last hr and a half which were exceptionally filmed and really highlighted the chief symbols of the green light(hope, desire and Tj Eckleburg(God looking down at the moral decay of society.) The people who played the Wilsons were good, and weren't hurt by lack of screen time and the one who played Jordan was also quite good in the role. The novel in itself a criticism of America as its growing and evolving, yet at the same time losing its human and moral values as they slip into racism, bigotry, ignorance and individualism which is eerily similar to America today. The scene where Gatsby and Nick are talking about the past in my opinion was the greatest point in the film, and in my view get Leo the Oscar he deserves. Gatsby is like Jack from Titanic, he dreams of a life where he can get the love and fullness he craves, yet their destroyed by tragedy and classism of rich and East Egg looking down on the poor or old money. We all want to try and keep things as they were, but we can't as people and lives change and must move on to prevent us from suffering inside and outside which sadly Gatsby can't do and the real tragedy is he's the most honest, hopeful and real ""American"" who wants to change himself to achieve his dreams which instead lead to his destruction."
"JackCerf","7","7","13","15 May 2013"," When Jazz Was New And Frightening
","This was a much better movie than the misleadingly cut trailer made it out to be. Luhrman avoided the temptation of being taken in by the glitz. The parties -- both Tom's little mud wallow with Myrtle and Gatsby's extravaganzas -- are as chaotic, as crass and as hollow as they should be. The anachronistic music make emotional sense where its used. DiCaprio is an excellent Gatsby -- a man visibly playing a part, watching himself play it, anxious about being found out, and urgently delusional about Daisy. Tobey Maguire plays Nick as a wide eyed naif from the Midwest, almost a bumpkin. Joel Edgerton is a very convincing Tom -- self assured, bullying, pedantic, proprietary, contemptuous of his inferiors, but far more intelligent than he first looks. He and DiCaprio really bring off the confrontation at the Plaza that is the story's climax. Carey Mulligan is an adequate Daisy, who is anyway mostly a projection of Gatsby's; she's petulant, bored, resentful of Tom's infidelities, ready for a fling with a lost girlhood love, but nothing more than that. Elizabeth Debicki is underused as a magnetic Jordan Baker, and Isla Fisher has great fun playing Myrtle Wilson as a working class floozy.<br/><br/>Luhrman has made some interesting changes of emphasis. Nick is much more callow and innocent than the narrator of the novel; he seems 21 rather than almost 30. His relationship with Jordan disappears. Gatsby's father never makes an appearance after his son's death. Instead, much of the back story he tells Nick in the novel is confessed by Gatsby himself. In the novel Nick states that he had ""always disapproved"" of Gatsby; the movie is much more of a bromance. The wild vulgarity of the apartment party is only implied the book, and the lunch with Wolfsheim takes place in a flamboyant speakeasy with a chorus line of highly sexualized black dancers instead of in a restaurant. In the book, Nick is fascinated, frightened and also disgusted by Wolfsheim. The movie keeps the fascination and fear but plays down the disgust. Wolfsheim never tells Nick the full story of his relationship with Gatsby, as he does in the book after Gatsby dies. Instead, we hear part of it from Tom.<br/><br/>Luhrman's treatment of the novel makes sense when you put Gatsby in its political context and see the story through Tom Buchanan's eyes. The 1920 Census was the first one in which a majority of Americans lived in cities instead of farms and small towns. The second and third generation of Ellis Island immigrants were becoming a political force. The movies, a business conspicuously dominated by Jews, had grown from nothing to become the most popular entertainment medium in less than 20 years. Jazz had become the dominant popular music, both in its raw African-American form and as mediated by the Jews of Tin Pan Alley. The movies were feared as seductively immoral, and jazz denounced for releasing impulses that decent people never spoke of, much less acted out in public. Young people were engaging in what their elders thought was intolerable sexual license. Organized crime, the product of Prohibition, operated with an open, shameless defiance of the law never seen before. Books like Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race (1916) predicted that Nordic civilization would be overwhelmed and swept away by inferior races unless eugenic measures were taken to improve the breed. Small town Protestant America was in a full scale moral and demographic panic that seems very familiar today.<br/><br/>Native white Protestant rural and small town Americans felt their country slipping away from them, and they struck back. The modern Ku Klux Klan was formed in 1915. From 1919 into the early 20s white mobs attacked black communities throughout the country. There were mass deportations of alien, mostly Jewish, radicals in 1919-20. Prohibition was enacted in 1920 through the decades long lobbying of the organized Protestant churches. The Immigration Acts of 1920 and 1924 effectively cut off the immigration of Italians, Slavs and Jews. <br/><br/>Luhrman is trying to recapture the atmosphere of traditional America assaulted by frightening new forces. That's why he makes blacks so conspicuous, as servants, as entertainers and, once, as mysteriously prosperous revelers. Because jazz has become familiar, respectable, classical music, he uses hip-hop to recapture the fearful sense of black moral degeneracy infiltrating white society from below. Because Jews are now an accepted and highly visible part of American society, he uses an Indian actor, Amitabh Bachchan, to better communicate the exotic menace that Jewish gangster Meyer Wolfsheim had in 1922. <br/><br/>Most importantly, that's why Luhrman puts Tom Buchanan's strident, pedantic racism front and center, when other aspects of the novel are deemphasized or cut. And it's why, at the climax of the movie, the most damning thing Tom can say about Gatsby is not just that he's a bootlegger but that he -- a real American -- is really a front for ""that kike Wolfsheim"" in some mysterious financial fraud. Though that expression is true to Tom's character, it isn't in the book. <br/><br/>Luhrman's Gatsby isn't just a self-made nouveau riche vulgar outsider, though he is all that, and he isn't just trying to ""make a rumpus"" in Tom Buchanan's house and steal away his wife in the name of romance. Gatsby is the agent of subversive forces attacking the civilization that supports Tom and Daisy's place in the world. He is exposed, he fails, Daisy rejects him and Tom destroys him. But ninety years later those forces have triumphed. We are living in the world Tom Buchanan feared, and that Fitzgerald saw struggling to be born. Luhrman is trying to remind us just how contentious that birth was."

","This movie is a failure because the director failed to realise that , while its true that Great Gatsby is one of the best novels in American literature, it doesn't necessarily mean that any film based on it would automatically be good.I don't think there will ever be a good film which follows the plot of a novel consistently,it'd be like drawing a photograph. Take Frankenstein films as an example, most of them changed the general storyline because the maker realised that some reworking is necessary to fit within the nature of cinema, as a conversion from the tendencies of literature to cinema. The casting was also weak, notwithstanding the poor performance i saw from Dicaprio, Denis' husband character(I think Tom was his name) was very poorly developed and the party scenes were poorly filmed. I'd like to think of it as a ""video book""for those lazy people who cant be bothered to read the great ""Great Gatsby"".

","I'd heard some ripples about this and decided to check it out as I like DiCaprio. There was something a little off about it from the start - I've nothing against Toby McGuire as a human being and in some roles he seems a pretty decent actor, but I think he has that very distinctive kind of appearance that only really lends itself to very particular types of role - e.g. the jockey in Sea Biscuit. I don't think this was one of those roles though - he just didn't fit the character at all and some of the expressions he pulled were frankly a little embarrassing - maybe the director's fault, who knows. Simlarly I think Isla Fisher is a capable actress but she really didn't suit the part. Edgerton was better as Buchanan even though he too has an unorthodox appearance but I think he handled it well regardless. Clearly there was a bit of pro-Aussie casting going on here and it seemed a little unnecessary and misplaced given how many authentic American actors there are available.<br/><br/>What really murdered this film to the point where I had to turn it off was Baz Lurhman's self-indulgent attempt to remould an era he never lived in, but which the author did, in a dishonest way - an uber-flamboyant way, a way in which modern liberal values are rammed down our throats, and modern music grates against the action. I know some people will admire this artistic choice but I personally don't think that's what the author had in mind when he penned it and it made me nauseous watching it. Please don't mistake this for an anti-Luhrman rant - I absolutely loved his Romeo and Juliet and Strictly Ballroom. And yes the former was also a re-imagining but one which obviously replaced the entire context of the story with another, rather than splicing in hand-picked elements; a re-imagining which I believe the original author would've actually approved of, unlike this. No, I've absolutely nothing against Luhrman, but his judgement was way off here for me.<br/><br/>It's a shame - I was really looking forward to this, but Luhrman's choices made it a very esoteric affair that precluded me from watching it. As such I found myself stopping the movie at about the half hour mark, which is *staggeringly* rare for me to do. I wasn't going to leave a mark because I didn't finish it, but as I wrote this I realised the sole reason I didn't finish it was because it was so bad - in my humble opinion."

","I'm a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and why wouldn't I be, he is a great actor when he's in good movies and he's a total dreamboat. Loved him since Titanic (not a great movie but again he is a dreamboat). But in this movie he wasn't at his best and I don't blame him. Maybe it's because I had such high expectations going into this movie with the great actors attached to it and the subject matter (they're doing The Great Gatsby for goodness sakes) but I thought it was pretty bad. I honestly almost left the theatre like my friend wanted to but ended up convincing her to stick around until the bitter end. I think the main reason this was a disaster is that the director didn't have a clue what he was doing. Way too many beautiful shots of people dancing like flappers and champagne and all the roaring 1920's nostalgia which isn't what the movie is supposed to be about. DiCaprio was wasted and the rest of the cast pretty much was too. Daisy was not cast right she's a great actress but not right for this part. A real missed opportunity and a disappointing film, avoid watching it unless nothing at all else is on TV."

","Okay, I wasn't exactly frogmarched to the box office and had a gun held to my head until I shelled out for a ticket. I went of my own free will despite having watched Baz Luhrmann's pathetic Moulin Rouge; in other words I knew Luhrmann was a Philistine, nay, a Philistine's Philistine, with no respect for true artists and an ego that makes Joe Wright appear bashful so I suppose I was just fascinated to see just how low he would drag Fitzgerald. Luhrmann resembles a filmmaker the way a slug resembles a swan and is about as sensitive as Stalin. His idea of filmmaking is to take a subject rooted firmly in the past - Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge, now Gatsby - and distort it via 'modern' music. Although I have yet to see it there is reason to believe that the 1949 version of Gatsby with Alan Ladd in the title role is the finest to date. I can well believe this given that Ladd had both the clean-cut looks of Redford and the DeCapriot but in addition he could be convincingly 'tough' as and when necessary. Lurhmann clearly thinks he is taking as his source material a Redbook story rather than a classic novel and, like another misguided director (see: The Deep Blue Sea) he thinks he can write better than the sublime Fitzgerald and has seen fit to top and tail the story with Nick Carraway an alcoholic confined in a drying-out clinic. Baz, my old darlin', you can bring in all the cgi you like, have sentences coming out of the screen till you're blue in the face but do us all a favor and get yourself a job stacking shelves at Safeway, something you might JUST be suited for."

","First of all, the good things: The period scenery looked wonderful.<br/><br/>Here is a movie that should have been handled by someone who loves the period, understands the subtlety of this type of literature, and most importantly, might have some familiarity with the period. When Woody Allen explores the period or thereabouts, we know for sure there is a sense of nostalgia. He knows how to recreate the period and respects its particulars, from its very distinctive look to its very specific music.<br/><br/>This adaptation suffers greatly from its anachronisms. For God's sake, what is a hip hop piece doing in the middle of this very boring love story. There were times when I was praying that the new ice age started so an iceberg would go by and put us out of our misery. Everyone with the exception of the actress who plays Jordan Baker and Joel Edgerton appear dazed from the ultra kinetic camera moves and some really blurry 3D. Maybe the audiences who saw it in plain 2D avoided the dizzy spells our group endured.<br/><br/>A doomed love affair, plenty of yearning, grief over lost time, misunderstandings, obvious division of social classes, and so much wonderful material is recklessly ignored so we can be dazzled by some sloppy CGI. My mind kept wondering where was Peter Jackson and the team that put together ""King Kong"" where we needed it, and in popped the hope Ang Lee could add some of his classy direction and find the hope and pain Leonardo and Carey failed to find in their characters. Yes, they look sensational in their well-crafted outfits, with their dazzling jewels and expensive surroundings. Yes, their souls are nowhere to be seen or much importantly felt.<br/><br/>They knew each other, only to find themselves trapped by her failure to pull through, and as it is expected, there is too big of a chasm between them to make this succeed. We expect tragedy, and it hits with a bang, literally, with the expected debris flying all over the 3D screen.<br/><br/>There is no memorable line, no tribute to the literary masterpiece this came from, only half-hearted deliveries and a tepid narration that contributes little to a classic story that is now certainly doomed. Nevertheless, it looks good for a while."

This picture on the other hand makes it clear why, more often than not, book lovers are hesitant to even see movie versions of beloved books: it's not pleasant seeing ones dreams treated poorly. Baz Luhrman, here, seems determined to turn Gatsby into a grotesquely mannered pop-cgi cartoon opera. Our minds and hearts are assaulted by old roadsters flying through busy streets at three to four times their normal speed and a horrific soundtrack of amped up contemporary sounds including hip-hop. The acting is so arch/over-the-top that one finds oneself actually looking away in embarrassment. The actor's facial gestures, DeCaprio's in particular, are at times so extreme and unnatural that one wonders if Luhrman were trying to get them to appear as tho they were in a silent film from the era. Yet we're expected to pick up the emotional ball when's things become truly serious. We're meant to feel for these marionettes. Amazing costumes and sets tho. Tour de force in that era.

Leo DiCaprio is great as Gatsby and Tobey Maguire does a great job of leading the film's narrative as Carraway but the real show-stealer for me was Joel Edgerton. Watching any scene he was in was like watching a unicorn give birth to a rainbow--he was amazing, is what I am trying to say.<br/><br/>The movie looks good, has great music (although, not indicative of the era)and the actors do their job tremendously.

"smijatov89","8","5","9","22 July 2013"," Luhrmann's back in shape!
","Luhrmann has been one of my favourite directors solely relying on his mastery with ""Moulin Rouge"". I enjoyed ""Romeo+Juliet"" also, but nowhere near as much as MR, and then Australia was kind of a let down. His visual style, however, has always been consistently amazing and his films are a true feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" continues this trend, and possibly pushes it further. With Luhrmann's trademark great and innovative cinematography, editing, costume design and art direction, Gatsby is technically top-notch. The impressive line up for the soundtrack also adds layers and layers to the film, in a choice similar to ""Moulin Rouge's"" soundtrack back in 2001. While some have complained about the over-stimulus visually and the over-the-top costumes and parties depiction in the film, I felt as if it was quite appropriate. It truly showed the lavishness and shallowness of those events, costumes and places, while at the same time allowing for the audience to see the emptiness of Gatsby's life.<br/><br/>My only concern was the length of the film, but it is manageable. Almost as long as ""Australia"" was, it still managed to feel reasonably lengthy, instead of being a drag. Overall, ""Gatsby"" is a well-executed film with lavish sets, amazing costumes, beautiful soundtrack and all other technical aspects. Acting is rather good, too, with DiCaprio having a stand-out performance, while Mulligan and Maguire are rather sidelined in their conventional acting and do not quite push the envelope far enough. Nonetheless, it is a good film and I'd recommend watching it!"
"trex_daemon","9","5","9","29 May 2013"," Great adaptation of the book
","First of all, let me tell you that usually I don't review movies, unless it's a movie that either really impressed me, or it was really bad.<br/><br/>I first saw the trailer of this movie a couple of weeks ago and then I've decided to read the book. I didn't manage to finish the book, (I've read around 80% of the it) and saw the movie. Later I've also watched the one from the 70s to be able to make a comparison.<br/><br/>There are here people who tell that the book is the best and the movie is bad. This is partly true, your imagination when reading the book cannot be surpassed by the vision of one's director. However, I have to say that this is a very good adaptation of the book( nearly as good as Shutter Island, which is the best one I saw until now , in my opinion, of course)<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio does a hell of a job in giving life to the character of Gatsby. He's just like I've imagined while reading the book. So does Carey Mulligan(Daisy) and Joel Edgerton(Tom) too. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about Tobey Maguire(Nick), somehow I've imagined Nick as a different character: more confident, with more life. He's just a person that even if he knows he's poor, it doesn't bother him to hang around rich people. Don't get me wrong, Tobey does it's job well, he just doesn't excel in doing it. Jordan's character is hollow, but she's not very emphasized in the book either.<br/><br/>What I really liked is, compared to the old movie, which is just the transposition of the book into the screen (just like a theatrical play), this movie manages to express all the emotions and feelings of the characters while preserving most of the dialogs present in the book. This is mostly the merit of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mulligan, of course, but all the other characters contribute to this. <br/><br/>The set is very nicely done with beautiful ""special"" effects, especially at the beginning of the movie. However, the director took always great care to follow the book. The interior decorations are astonishing, by the way. <br/><br/>The music: Now this, at the beginning of the movie was a bit disturbing, as it's a combination of music from the 20s with modern nuances; but it fits very well, making the story of Daisy and Gatsby timeless.<br/><br/>What I really disliked, and this drifted from the book, is the fact that Nick is telling the story while writing the book. No, this was really unnecessary and the credit always belongs to the author, Fitzgerald. But the way the words appear on the screen... I have to admit that it was very nicely done. <br/><br/>This movie is a must see, I'm sure it will win a lot of Oscars this year. Even if you have already read the book, you won't be disappointed, go and watch it."

","The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite novels. It was required reading in American Lit. However, the movie is mockery of F. Scoot Fitzgerald's novel. The novel left much for the imagination with its powerful imagery. This movie sucks. It is like a comic book version of the original novel leaving nothing to the imagination. It is only what the movie maker imagines, not what Fitzgerald had in mind. As for the cast, the last person that should have been cast as Gatsby is Leonardo DiCaprio. He not only doesn't fit the image of Gatsby, trying to make him Gatsby is like trying to drive a square peg through a round hole. And he doesn't even come close to acting like Gatsby.<br/><br/>If a viewer had read Fitzgerald's book and then walked into this movie without knowing that it was supposed to be based on the novel, one would not have recognized the movie. Perhaps a viewer would have believed it was some sort of sequel.<br/><br/>While the earlier Great Gatsby with Robert Redford was not perfect, at least it strongly resembled the novel, which this last version does not. So if someone wants to see a movie version of the Great Gatsby, watch the Redford version. Don't waste either your money or your time on this wacky version. Best yet, go read the book which I am doing again. That is the only benefit I got from watching the movie. It got me to read the book again which after this stinking movie, made me realize how good a writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald was."

And kudos to Leonardo DiCaprio who I think is a great actor and who can portray a wide range of human pathos, qualities and characters. I love his movies. Having said that, as a classicist, something in me dies at the reality of this great book being re-done again. It shouldn't have been done. I see hugely different opinions and perceptions here and I accept all of them, but I would be re-miss and disloyal to not state here that Robert Redford and Mia Farrow just ARE Gatsby and Daisy, to my mind, and there could be no other. They should have been left to stand forever in our memories, like Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh.You may want to see this Baz Luhrmann rendition just to see it, but seriously,then go back and look at the exquisite beauty and subtly of Redford/Farrow and Sam Waterston; these beautiful and subtle actors of such brilliance and depth! It's beside the point which movie was truest to the novel. Rather, which was more subtly beautiful in rendering that aching, longing feeling of Gatsby and Daisy, and the similarly aching, longing dreaming quality of all the music and sounds and feeling of the 20's? Do you need hundreds of dancers for that? Go back and look at it:the brilliance of every moment and every drunken actor in the great party;Gatsby(Redford)in his uniform dancing with Daisy to the scratchy music; the long, sweaty aching moments of togetherness and longing looks; the utter shallowness and confusion of Daisy(Mia Farrow); the intrigue and beauty of Jordan Baker ; the manic despair of George Wilson;the sweaty slimeyness of his wife (Isla Fisher was too sweet!) and the goodness and utter disbelief and helplessness of Carraway (Waterston).These were great actors and every one of them, especially Redford, deserved an Oscar for their performance. Luhrmann's film is entertaining, but all the beauty and subtly is gone and ruined the memory of what to me is a classic. Will we ever forget Clark Gable's stunning slicked-back hair, necktie and suit and ""Frankly, I don't give a damn?"" Well the memory of the sheer beauty and ethereal quality of Redford in his white suit, appearing amongst all those roses in the cottage, should have been left untainted ,for all time, longing,longing.Finally, if Carey Mulligan is ever asked to play Scarlett O'Hara, please, think twice: Don't."

","There was enormous hype preceding the release of this film, given the nature of the original novel, and big names involved. The initial response was mixed. While my expectations were somewhat muted, I was pleasantly surprised and, although the film wasn't perfect, can't imagine how a ""Gatsby"" adaptation could have turned out much better.<br/><br/>I'll talk about the performances first since those are what most readers will be most interested in. DiCaprio is very good in the title role. There are inevitable nitpicks to be had in regards to his performance, and Gatsby is such a nebulous character that it isn't possible to truly represent him as imagined in the book, but DiCaprio's choices are all sound. Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgarton are solid. Carey Mulligan made Daisy a bit too sympathetic in my opinion, but was still passable. Isla Fisher was the main disappointment for me, as I believe she turned her character into a caricature. Elizabeth Debicki was the other standout; she perfectly represents the literary Jordan Baker with much charisma and screen presence.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed Luhrmann's direction. He brought the roaring 20's and Gatsby's elegant lifestyle to life with much flair and beauty. As for the much maligned period music, I found it to be a good idea that was not well executed. The idea of playing the modern day equivalents to Jazz in the soundtrack to better communicate the atmosphere to modern viewers was good, but some of the songs simply did not fit and were quite jarring.<br/><br/>My main criticism is that the movie would be confusing thematically for anyone who had not read the book. This is an inevitable problem for Gatsby adaptation, since so much is communicated through narration in the novel, and as it is the movie relies too heavily on it. This prevents the film from getting anywhere near the heights of the novel. Nonetheless, for the time being, this is the definitive Gatsby adaptation, and it will likely remain as such for some time, given the strong performances and that most of its problems were unavoidable."

","Though it has bountiful visual flair and is stylishly ambitious, The Great Gatsby's story gets lost amidst it's dazzling, yet overproduced spectacle and ultimately ends up being a prime example of style over substance.<br/><br/>The story, if you haven't been through 11th grade English, is based upon the iconic novel, The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1925, and over-analyzed and dissected to smithereens by confused teens ever since. It tells the tragic tale of a writer, his complex influence, his pouty lover, her snarky husband, and of course, a green light. No but we follow the story from the eyes of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in the Roaring Twenties as he moves to Long Island and begins the follow and befriend a rich and mysterious man named Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), who 1. Throws parties and 2. falls in the middle of a deadly love triangle which may or may not have tragic results. The novel offers up a plethora of social commentary on the American Dream and young pride, but do the story and allegories translate to the big screen? That's a loaded question old sport. <br/><br/>The Great Gatsby rockets off with as a visually spectacular, sometimes overwhelmingly energetic, and stylishly entertaining piece of eye-candy. We start off with a bang, and the pacing is quick and exciting. The visual design is glossily crafted and everything, most notably the parties, are just a pleasure to watch. The cinematography is always lively, and seems to allow the viewer to enter the film's exuberant setting by gliding and sometimes whimsically traveling around the set pieces. The costumes are fantastic; each's color is saturated to their greatest, and the flashy intricacies of each look fantastic and add an important element of art deco style to the film. The sets range from marvelously detailed to the almost cartoony looking, obviously green screened, but for some reason it does fit with the style of the rest of the film. The 3D effects don't add as much depth as they should and become dizzying in some tightly edited, ecstatically shot scenes, but it still is passable. And now for the soundtrack; many are conflicted about the soundtrack due to its juxtaposition between, let's say, Gershwin and...um...Jay Z. I personally didn't mind it and thought that they oddly fit well with Luhrmann's style even if many were underused throughout. The acting is a bit of a mixed bag, but no one is terrible. Leo isn't captivating, but he still manages to add a level of like-ability to Gatsby, even if he doesn't seem completely invested in the role. Maguire is just fine as Carraway but just kind of blandly follows and narrates. The best is Edgerton who nicely creates both a slimy and intriguing character to counter Gatsby. Honorable mention goes to Elizabeth DeBicki who doesn't have much to do, but puts forth her best effort. And now for Daisy, Carey Mulligan isn't served the best justice due to the supposedly purposefully annoying nature of her character, but still she ends up just helplessly pouting and moping around the sets like a hormonally 16 year old. Also to be fair, this isn't an actors movie, but rather a directors movie, so it makes sense that some of the actors may seem only decent. Speaking of directors, Luhrmann altogether creates an interesting experiment. It's admirably ambitious and daring, and I partially admire him for his choices, however per usual, he does overproduce A lot of the film and almost seems to become too distracted with himself and the film's giddy style. By doing this he adds more color, but also takes away the vibrancy of the story. He tries to adapt much of the symbolism and themes form the book, but after a while they become too repetitive, and don't have anything to say about themselves. The films second half does have a deflated sense of energy, and also becomes tonally and narratively inconsistent. Some scenes and character interactions don't mix very well with others and there are slower sequences that feed sharply into fast-paced ones and the result isn't always entirely cohesive. Even while I haven't read the book, I still understand the importance and significance of the story, but feel like the film was aiming for recreating more of a mood that the book and characters evoke rather then focusing more of the narrative. I also disliked the ending, and thought that it was too uncompromising because in the book, it may have had a much more literary significant representation, but many of those words become lost in translation to the silver screen and the result is mixed. Also the overproduced sequences and pizazz of the film do become a tad bit annoying and hard to fully absorb. <br/><br/>So, no matter what you think, it is safe to say that this film will be and is very polarizing. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. The style didn't completely win me over, but it did keep my attention through it's long running time, and I was slightly invested in some of the characters, especially in one earlier sequence in the film between Gatsby and Daisy which I did adore. <br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: I have not read The Great Gatsby, but will soon old sport."

","I finally broke down and watched it. I have to say it was better than I expected, but I still thought it was less than good.<br/><br/>The actors were not believable in their roles, and I still can't figure out the accents. All of the characters are from the Midwest, but none of them sound Midwestern. Gatsby's accent makes the least sense. He is from North Dakota, but he has taken pains to become cultured, yet Leo gives him a weird Jersey accent or something.<br/><br/>The music was good, but it didn't fit the period. If they are going to do a period piece, the music needs to be accurate. The costumes and sets were spectacular, but that isn't enough.<br/><br/>Whenever a book is made into a movie, I expect scenes to be added; however, the whole thing with Nick becoming an alcoholic and being in a sanitarium is...well...crazy, and not believable with what we know of Nick's character from the book.<br/><br/>I think If I had never read the book nor watched the 1974 movie version, I would have found this movie more interesting. At least it is much better than the horrid 2001 disastrous attempt to remake the classic."

","'The Great Gatsby' is a new motion picture based on the Fitzgerald's work. It sketches scenarios from the 20s in combination with modern day technology and music, keeping the movie far from becoming static or dull. The over the top, extraordinary situations are easily accepted by the viewers and are very humorous. A great build-up of curiosity is created in the first part of the film, by leaving out the mysterious Mr. Gatsby, though constantly mentioning his name. This concealment keeps hold of the viewer's gaze, while feeding them with the extravagance and fascinating lifestyle of the rich.<br/><br/>Mr. Gatsby is played by Leonardo Dicario, who has no problem with shifting from the amazing Gatsby to a more desperate Gatsby, wanting nothing more than relive his happiness with his beloved Daisy (Carey Mulligan). DiCaprio's opposing actor Tobey Maguire, already known for his acting skills in playing decent, half-naïve characters, is a right fit for the comparable role of the, seemingly simple 'Nick Carraway'.<br/><br/>Altogether, 'The Great Gatsby' is not just another movie based on the Fitzgerald's book. The director (Baz Luhrmann) selected outstanding actors, most suitable for playing the available roles. Moreover, the film adds a modern day dimension to the story, reviving it and making it simply very amusing."
"jjgooner","8","4","7","6 July 2013"," Stylish Adaptation of F.Scott Fitzgerald's Classic
","The Great Gatsby<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>142 mins/ 12<br/><br/>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jack Thompson, Jason Clarke, Elizabeth Debecki, Amitabh Bachchan, Richard Carter<br/><br/>Director: Baz Luhrmann<br/><br/>Plot: Bond-seller Nick Carraway, enters the world of his ambitious, big-spending neighbour, Jay Gatsby.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: When reviewing a film which is based on a book as popular and written about as F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 classic, The Great Gatsby, it is important to not review the plot and story, but the style and method in which it is represented. Despite saying this, the story is one of an epic tale of love, greed, ambition, obsession and tragedy. When mixed together, there is no doubt that your story and film, in this case, is a splendid one.<br/><br/>The film centres on Nick Carroway, a former writer turned bond-seller who, after moving into a small cottage on Long Island, becomes fascinated and lured into the lifestyle of his incredibly wealthy neighbour, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, who has become obsessed with a former-lover, Daisy Buchanan who left him because he had struggled to earn a living, (who just happens to be Nick's cousin), persuades Nick to bring them together. From here, Nick becomes involved in their troublesome relationship which includes his admiration for Gatsby, Gatsby's obsession and life plan for Daisy, Daisy's struggle to choose between Jay and her husband Tom, Tom's troublesome relationship with his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, and Myrtle's working-class life with husband George. Call it a love hexagon!<br/><br/>The performances of these famous characters are mainly superb. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a knockout and extremely bold portrayal and, for possibly the first time, becomes completely cemented into his role and is Gatsby. The eventual fall and reveal of his criminal past is handled brilliantly by one of the finest actors of his generation. Tobey Maguire, who has struggled in fulfilling his supposed box-office star destiny since the conclusion of his Spider-Man series, gives a more likable and less showy role than something like Spider-Man 3. He is a wonderful narrator and you certainly feel for his character. Joel Edgerton gives a truly evil touch to Tom Buchanan and Carey Mulligan's Daisy manages to appear angel-like, when she actually isn't. In Baz Luhrmann's adaption of the story, he stays true to the story, but not to the style. This film is bursting with vibrant colours and precise visual detail, which just adds to the whole experience of a brilliant story. The film has a beautiful scope and epic feel to it and the cinematography is top-notch. Although it certainly isn't horrendous, having modern Jay-Z rap songs in the background of Gatsby's famous parties, can feel incredibly awkward at times. Gatsby's ambition, style and brilliant arrogance are an amazing achievement of literature. Now it is an amazing achievement of 21st century cinema. Gatsby is unnecessarily over the top in each and every frame but breathtaking in its masterful storytelling."

","So imagine it's 1967 if you'd missed out on all the hoo-ha over Bond, but you read Ian Fleming's Casino Royale and found you quite enjoyed it... and what's this? There's a big screen version of Casino Royale hitting the cinemas, with David Niven, Orson Welles and Ursula Andress. Better check it out, right? Well this version of Great Gatsby is as close to F Scott Fitzgerald's novel in tone as that psychedelic romp starring Niven, Welles, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen was to Fleming's dour Cold War novel. Or, if you prefer, as close as the mid-1980s Absolute Beginners musical was to the classic novel about Soho coffee houses of the 1950s.<br/><br/>Which is not to say this film jettison's the novel's plot, not at all, if anything it's too faithful. Scenes are shoehorned in because they were in the novel, but for no real reason. When Nick and Jordan meet the old buffer in Gatsby's library, well in the book it means something, but in the film it serves no real purpose I can see.<br/><br/>As with the other two movies I've mentioned, the songs help save it and it does have its moments. The melancholy scenes work better than all the frenzied upbeat stuff, but this film is really about taking a dayglo spray paint to an ornate statue. You know the director has failed when you have Tobey Maguire just talking the whole frickin' time, explaining what people are thinking and doing and their motivations. Don't tell, show, is one lesson Fitzgerald would have been taught when he tried out as a screenwriter in the 1930s. It doesn't help that narrator should be made stronger, not weaker, otherwise what is he doing there? When he's a first person narrative in a book, his raison d'etre is solid, but in a film the lead actor (arguably I know) should have something more to do, otherwise why not just have the director tell the story? I give this 5 out of 10 because the 3D visuals are out of this world and make this a real experience, albeit not always an enjoyable one, but it IS different, probably the same way that the 67 Casino Royale was in its day. It's mad. But the director misses the poetry and poignancy, the subtlety of the book, and probably isn't even aiming for that anyhow."
"garrett-b-marker","4","4","7","20 May 2013"," Great Gatsby Fails to Mesh Modern and Classic
","What a colossal failure The Great Gatsby was. All the lines were delivered earnestly by the actors, but with writing that bad, even Leo couldn't turn crap into diamonds. And Toby McGuire is probably the worst actor who's ever lived. They cast him wrong, wrong, wrong. The epic drama that was unfolding between Gatsby, Daisy and Buchanan felt for the audience, as seen from the correct position of Carraway, alien, as expected, but so alien as to be jarring and uninviting. Felt from the awkward, dorky shoes of McGuire, the heart of the story is kept at an arm's length, failing to allow the audience to become immersed within the plot. The often detectable CGI was distracting, as was the repeating over-use of text and montages. The artistic feel of the movie shifts uncomfortably back and forth, as if it can't decide if it wants to be a very progressive and modern experience or a classic no-frills character- driven, acting-on-set drama. The same goes for the music, which switches between modern genres that catch you off-guard and end up liking, and more traditional orchestration. There was so much promise for one of the most revered works of American literature which was just asking for movie greatness, but this version doesn't make it off the runway, failing to pair the modern style with more traditional cinema. And as a kicker, the fantastic soundtrack featured in many previews was completely downplayed, never taking advantage of the great tracks by Del Rey and Welch."

","I'm betting many of the COMMENTers herein as well as the Rotten-Tomato critics didn't read the book nor know much about the American Roaring '20's and/or the nature of FSF's popularity therein. It seems to me that many of those that didn't like this new film version of THE GREAT GATSBY fail to consider that maybe they don't like FSF's sentiments. point-of-view, etc., in the first place. In other words, this film may very successfully capture a book, an era and a writer that some viewers simply hold in disdain. In such case, why blame the movie?<br/><br/>I concede that the party scenes are over the top. The idea was to display the abandon, recklessness and greed overtaking a new class of Americans at that time. FSF was a proponent of such people. His critics, myself included, argue that he was a sycophant to such folk, displaying a puppy-dog loyalty to their whims and anxieties and mistakenly trying to distinguish their petty domestic squabbles as classical tragedy instead of the mundane human failures they actually were. <br/><br/>But FSF wrote so beautifully and whether or not his concerns were misplaced his passion can neither be denied nor unappreciated. He did so by writing simply yet eloquently. Above all he relied on description and evocation of mood, with -unlike Hemingway and other contemporaries- using a bare minimum of dialog. In such case he poetically and beautifully paints an era and it's longings even if he thought he was doing something else. <br/><br/>This new version of TGG does a fine job of doing what FSF attempted to do. Indeed, the characters say relatively little regarding their actual desires and absolutely nothing regarding their times, their excesses, etc. That the wild parties, NYC landscapes and non-major cast is done in almost-cartoon fashion seems fitting, as it isolates the main characters and their cloistered lives. F. Scot and Zelda would have loved to see this move almost as much as they'd like partying at the Oscars."
"AddisonNikki","6","7","15","12 May 2013"," Decent adaption of a timeless classic but not without it's flaws.
","As we all know by word of mouth or picking up a book, The Great Gatsby is a tale of love, loss and getting loaded in the roaring 1920's. Luhrmann's 2013 adaption stars Tobey Maguire as narrator Nick Carraway, Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, and Leonardo DiCaprio and the mysterious J. Gatsby himself. Supporting cast includes Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Debicki, Joel Edgerton, and Jason Clarke. The already popular soundtrack features artists such as Beyoncé, will.i.am, Jay Z, Lana Del Rey, Florence and the Machine, Gotye, Fergie, and Sia.<br/><br/>What I liked: Well, for starters, the title isn't just a title, it's not just The Great Gatsby for sake of it. It's a great tale and it was translated very well onto the screen. The screenplay was very well written, and given with what the actors had to work with the majority of them did an excellent job, especially Leo. I loved the party dresses and costumes that the women were wearing at Gatsby's, so detailed, elegant and fun.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: I don't know why filmmakers believe this but you do not need 3D and 75 million dollars' worth of special effects to tell a great story. Many people have said that the 3D and effects were for the party scenes and that it was supposed to make you feel like you were there. If you are an innovative and great filmmaker, you don't need 3D to make that happen. A filmmaker should be able to captivate you enough to make you feel like you are in the scene without putting on specialized glasses. The overuse of modern, contemporary music when it wasn't appropriate. There were a lot of scenes in this movie where a rap or hip hop song would play in the middle of something and as much as I am for the experimentation of music in film, it didn't work, it didn't fit, and it was extremely sloppy. I think Luhrmann was trying to reach out to a younger generation by doing this, and in ways it worked but using it in that way in the film completely backfired. It felt so out of place and was awkward. Some of the costuming, design, and editing were over the top and out of place for what was supposed to be a drama. When you do a drama, especially a period drama, especially something that's as well known as The Great Gatsby, it wouldn't hurt to be as realistic as possible. Many things that were supposed to be taken seriously, Nick's writing scenes, looking over the lake, Gatsby and Nick driving into town, felt very cheesy and poorly done for a movie that had a budget of $105,000,000.<br/><br/>Overall: Although there were quite a few things I disliked about this movie, it wasn't inherently bad. After the first dreadful 45 minutes and Gatsby is introduced, I enjoyed it quite a bit. If you want to enjoy it more than I did, you have to take it for what it truly is, a moneymaking piece of cinema make for the generation that only read about Gatsby in sophomore English class."

After watching all 2 1/2 hours of it, all I wanted was to hit replay and watch it all over again! If you've read the book, the movie is SPOT ON with the story as far as sequence of events and script performance by the star-studded cast. Baz puts the icing on the cake with his ""over CGI'd"" elaborate production, leaving every person bewildered and amazed. If Baz had stuck with a hum drum bland 1920's era set and production, The Great Gatsby would just be another puppy love chick flick with no pizazz or excitement. Baz, you are a genius at everything you've done with this classic American novel adaptation. I, for one, give The Great Gatsby a 10/10. I RARELY give that awesome of a rating for a movie (Inception was the last 10/10 I've given)."
"lover101","7","7","15","10 May 2013"," Takes a while to settle in, but good overall
","This telling of The Great Gastsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is, overall, a solid outing.<br/><br/>I wondered if it would be as the story began, however. The first part of the movie comes off a little cartoonish and over the top. Yes, I know Gatsby's parties in and of themselves were over the top, but this portrayal of it bordered on caricature several times. There may have been a little too much pushing the wildness of the scene without letting the scene tell its own story. Yes, caricature is the best word to describe how it was done. <br/><br/>Eventually, however, the movie settles nicely into the story, and the caricature is left behind. <br/><br/>From a literary point of view, I think much of Fitzgerald's poetic descriptiveness and sarcastic humor are missing. The movie doesn't have the same beauty as the straight words of Fitzgerald, but, once again, it slowly emerges over the course of the film. By the end, it is there... beautifully. <br/><br/>Now, for the seemingly controversial use of modern music in a period piece. As soundtrack and music that frames scenes, the modern music worked well. It was not distracting and served well for setting the mood. When music was part of the actual scene, however (a band playing a party, for example), the modern music was distracting. To see trumpets, trombones, and a drum set at a 20s party while hearing hip-hop is a big disconnect. But, this is confined to the early parts where I felt everything was a bit cartoonish anyway.<br/><br/>Some points of the original novel are left out, but in terms of making a movie, they were not missed. Overall, it stuck to the book well.<br/><br/>If you are like me, you'll sit through the first part of the movie thinking, ""Uh oh, they really goofed this one up."" But after a while, you'll see the beauty and true story emerge and be pretty happy with it by the end."
"DarthVoorhees","2","5","10","28 June 2013"," The great American novel adapted into a great American mess...
","'The Great Gatsby' lacks any subtly whatsoever. Baz Luhrmann has turned Fitzgerald's masterpiece into a showy cartoon with extravagance but no taste. One wonders if Luhrmann even began to skim across the surface of what Fitzgerald's masterwork was even about. Luhrmann's film is all about spectacle and superficiality, Fitzgerald's novel blatantly attacks such concepts in search of deeper significance. <br/><br/>This film is a cartoon. That's all there is to it. Everything is so tremendously fake from the decor to the acting. I am of the opinion that 'Gatsby' is a work that cannot be successfully translated to the film without losing it's impact. The joy of Fitzgerald's novel is it's beautiful prose and symbolic poetry which a filmmaker like Luhrmann is not interested in. Luhrmann is in love with the exciting visuals of the roaring twenties. Fitzgerald is often considered the epitome of the roaring twenties but what is often forgotten is that 'Gatsby' does not celebrate such a lifestyle. It is a story about facades and the facade of the roaring twenties that Luhrmann is so interested in hides pain and insecurity. The film moves at a break neck pace too and Fitzgerald's words are brushed over before one has a chance to comprehend them. Luhrmann does however offer us plenty of time to absorb long drawn out party sequences which are loud but are never visually interesting or well choreographed.<br/><br/>The actors buy into Luhrmann's vision to a tee. They are all very fake and superficial. I felt as if I were watching a Saturday Night Live episode parodying Gatsby. Every member of the main cast excluding DiCaprio gives a performance in the vein of some stock view of what these times and ideas represented. The actresses I feel are particularly bad as they seem to overplay the sexuality of these characters. All the actors throw everything out and there is nothing beneath the surface of any of these performances. They are just really playing flapper dress up. If Isla Fisher were playing a larger role than Myrtle Wilson than I would say her performance is bad enough to ruin her career.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is good as Gatsby and saves the film from a bomb rating. He seems to be the only one to explore the nuances of his character. Luhrmann's only exploration of Fitzgerald's gift for metaphor and allegory is the obvious notion of the 'green light'. DiCaprio tries his hardest to give it weight and is wonderfully awkward and shy around Daisy. Any power this theme and character would have is ruined by how blatantly Luhrmann robs the metaphor of any mystery by his over the top sweeping shots of the distance between the two eggs.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is too much of a boy to play Nick Carraway but to be fair Luhrmann's vision of the character is deeply flawed. Luhrmann already hinders the character by building a stupid dramatic conceit in having him tell Gatsby's tale from a mental institution. The experience of the story is a somber character building one and Carraway is supposed to become aware of the world through it. Luhrmann's choice really ruins the whole story as it suggests that Carraway's loss of innocence and faith in the world is unique. One of the joys of Gatsby is it's cynical view of the world and how Gatsby's hope is supposed to mean something profound in a world that crushes such ideas. <br/><br/>The film will no doubt bring 'Gatsby' to a new audience but I fear that it is an audience that will not understand it's importance and lose it's self in Luhrmann's silly music video parties instead of Fitzgerald's epic. If Luhrmann's film inspires someone to pick up Fitzgerald's novel than I suppose it has some worth but otherwise this is a waste of celluloid."

","I'm generally not a big fan of most movies that come out of Hollywood, but this one really takes the prize. I have not read the book so I will not comment on whether or not it's a good transition.<br/><br/>First off, why was it so long? After thirty minutes anyone with a normal brain capacity will be able to figure out how it ends; except for a few, unnecessary twists that have absolutely no bearing on either the narrative or the ending. <br/><br/>Secondly, the characters. They are so endlessly stereotypical and robbed of any interesting character traits. They fit perfectly - without exception - into character stereotypes and they portray nothing else than you would expect. It's like characters straight out of an amateur school project. <br/><br/>Thirdly, the style. You'd think that dragging viewers through almost three hours of boredom would elicit an amazing visual design, but no. It was unrealistic at best. If you want to go for realism (and this is very much a thing in the narrative) then go for it. If you want to create a periodical-inspired fantasy, then you have to be more imaginative - at least for my taste. I was left feeling confused about whether to see the whole thing as an intentional joke or a sincere, failed attempt.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, the soundtrack. Oh, God. I was cringing through every single track. They got the most overrated, overpaid and over- celebrated recording ""artists"" and made them produce modern mainstream music and made the actors dance like they're at drug party and NOT a lavish 1920's party. <br/><br/>It's a stylistic nightmare, the story has been repeated a thousand times over in all the arts (""OMG! I love her/him so much I lose everything but I believe in love until I die and nothing else matters cuz it's all I ever wanted!!!!!"") spiced up with a dreadful soundtrack, horrible acting and shallow, uninspired characters. No offense to the actors - I've seen nearly all of them perform amazingly, but they had no chance here. <br/><br/>I hope the book is better - if this is the ""great American Novel"" then I know just where I won't be looking for a good story."
"cnycitylady","7","5","10","13 May 2013"," The Best Gatsby
","This movie met every expectation I had, both good and bad.<br/><br/>The director Baz Luhrmann did just what I expected him too, and that was ruin the serenity and calm that I felt was part of the essence of the book. He sped up scenes and shot from overhead, diving into angles that weren't coherent with what the story was trying to tell. The beginning was whimsical, which worked, but way too over the top with the scenes flashing all to quickly before your eyes. Luckily for him the chemistry between Dicaprio and Mulligan was sizzling and sultry. You really felt their earnest desire to just see each other, then to just lightly touch the other's hand, and their desire just built from there, so much so that it distracted you from the fast past ardor that Lurhmann loves so much. When they get on screen together you feel as if time has stopped and they are living in a frozen world together with no one else to care about. <br/><br/>Before Daisy and Gatsby actually meet though, the movie's best character is Jordan. The actress Elizabeth Debicki gives Jordan this captivating essence, and you find yourself drawn to her just the same as Nick Carraway is. The casting was fantastic, never will this movie be better casted, as each actor fully understood just what went through their character's head and heart. Dicaprio is by far the best Gatsby I've seen, and the same goes for Mulligan with Daisy. Every actor makes you feel their character's distress and sorrow at least once each as this story unfolds. Not one character, from the naive Nick Carraway to the headstrong Myrtle, escapes your heart when you think of all that they wanted and have been through.<br/><br/>The script was wonderfully written. There wasn't a cheesy line in all of the movie, it was all very romantic without over playing it. The actors conveyed emotion more with their eyes rather than with their words. The wardrobe was also breath-taking. I say go see it, whether you read the book or not; You will be impressed with how well the story is relayed. 7.6/10"
"DubhDoo","9","6","13","26 May 2013"," The greatest 'Gatsby'
","Often when a classic novel is adapted into a film, a director leaves their personal tics outside the door in an effort to make an adaptation undying in its reverence to the source material. Appropriately, Jack Clayton's overly inert 1974 version of 'Gatsby' is an example, because it was simply a direct translation of the book on screen with no surprises or filmmaking flourishes. As its star, Robert Redford commented, ""If a film is just totally loyal to the book, then why make the film?"" Unsurprisingly, the same cannot be said for Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's sublime novel, as this is clearly a Baz Luhrmann film in the same way that his take on 'Romeo and Juliet' was. For those unfamiliar with the Aussie director's filmography, what does this mean for the movie? The answer can be pinpointed to Gatsby's introduction in the film and how it contrasts with the same moment in Clayton's version. In the latter, Gatsby quietly approaches Nick and they engage in a gentle conversation; however in the former, the bombast of Rhapsody in Blue plays and a smiling Gatsby turns to Nick raising a glass of champagne as fireworks explode in the background and guests dance about wildly.<br/><br/>'The Great Gatsby' is set over one summer in 1922, as fresh-faced stock- broker Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) moves to New York from the Midwest, living in a small cottage across a bay from his beautiful cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her blue-blooded husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Nick is slowly drawn to his mysterious millionaire neighbour by the name of ""Gatsby"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) and becomes increasingly intrigued by his past.<br/><br/>Many of this film's detractors have complained that it is a prime example of style over substance, which although not the case in my opinion, it is undeniable that it does carry a significant amount of style. The party scenes are so dazzling on initial viewing that they are almost dizzying; every frame appears as though Baz Luhrmann meticulously thought-it-over, which works effectively in portraying the inflating excess of the period. This 'Gatsby' is a real visual spectacle in the way that no previous adaptation of the novel ever was. Immensely detailed, the beautiful depiction of twenties-era New York feels very alive and vibrant, helping to keep the viewer consistently engaged in the period lifestyle . The movie's visual side is expertly complemented by an anachronistic Jay-Z produced soundtrack that works surprisingly well. <br/><br/>One of the biggest flaws of the 1974 adap of Gatsby was Robert Redford's poor performance as the titular character. Thankfully, in reuniting with his 'Romeo + Juliet' director, Leonardo DiCaprio has become the greatest Gatsby. He perfectly inhabits Gatsby, understanding the depths and nuances of Fitzgerald's creation, delivering a performance that is by turns, assured, insecure, passionate and tormented. DiCaprio is supported by excellent cast who also manage to bring their characters to life, whether it be Tobey Maguire's effortless turn as narrator Nick, Carey Mulligan's great portrayal of Daisy (a considerably difficult role to nail) or Joel Edgerton's pitch-perfect grasp of Tom, holding his own brilliantly with DiCaprio in a hotel room scene.<br/><br/>'The Great Gatsby' is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the greatest novels ever written and thankfully, it is safe to say that while Luhrmann has made a recognisably 'Baz Luhrmann' movie, he has also made a film that is pleasingly loyal to the book, grasping the subtleties in the text. This adaptation of the Roaring Twenties' definitive novel really does roar into life, much like Gatsby's yellow behemoth of a car. This is a lively, inventive and immersive piece of work with visual spectacle, emotion, impressive direction and superb performances. Finally, we have a great 'Gatsby'."

","With the biggest names in Hollywood being associated with this movie, I was expecting it to be something deep but it turned out to be a very flat, rote movie, much to my disappointment. There are no twists as such in the movie and the plot runs its course like the run of the mill. At one point the idea of ""The Great Gatsby"" being just a concept without actual existence was pursued which excited me but it turned out to be false and the idea was killed abruptly. I do appreciate the visuals and I must say that the 3-D effects are fantastic. I believe that Mr Nick Carraway's role is not really necessary and I don't see a reason for introducing him in the plot. In all, it is a no-brainer and if you are looking for something that can twist and turn you brain and leave you dumb-founded, then don't waste your money on this movie."
"generationfilm","Null","6","13","10 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby- Baz Luhrmann's Disastrous Focus on Lavish Style Over Substance Results in a Disparaging Adaptation of Fitzgerald's Novel
","There is certainly a timeless allure to the thin yet dramatically perceptive novel ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald that keeps bringing failed attempt after failed attempt to cinematically adapt its feverish tale of love amidst the backdrop of the Roaring Twenties. No one has ever really captured the novel's delicate intimacy, the time period's extravagance versus dispossession, or the thematic criticism of American decline in full leaving behind unfulfilling experiences much like with Jack Clayton's 1974 version, which starred Robert Redford in the illustrious title role. But no matter how ineffectual previous versions have been none are more misguided or more disastrously disappointing than director Baz Luhrmann's latest disparaging adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby."" Known for his excessively animated flair in films such as Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet Luhrmann has always been the subject of interest in all of his films making them megalomaniacal exercises in overindulgence. One can ultimately imagine that this type of self-aggrandizing filmmaking would be drastically inappropriate for an intimately constructed story such as ""The Great Gatsby,"" and that assumption proves correct in more ways than one. Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby becomes a divisive clash of tonally inconsistent scenes where the slim moments of dramatic sincerity are lost through the high energy chaos that is the Luhrmann style wasting a great deal of the novel's potential modern relevance. All of the poignant themes and dramatic sensibility from the novel are lavishly overstated through overly vibrant camera-work, disorganized editing, and disconnected performances distorting the very values that the original novel intended to highlight. Luhrmann's cliff notes grasp of the material translates into an incredibly hollow and artificial experience where the glitz and glamour of the time period receives the utmost detail in glamorous 3D while the characters slip away into one dimensional obscurity. In this version of The Great Gatsby it becomes increasingly hard to beat on, boats against the decadent current, borne back ceaselessly into wasted opportunities.<br/><br/>Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-y9 More reviews: Generationfilm.net"

","It's rare that I see a movie this bad, but it really was horrendous. Rap music and house music in a 1920s period movie was just a stupid idea early on the film that got alarm bells ringing. The rest of the film was just boring. I couldn't relate to any of the characters at all. I didn't care what happened in the end, I just wanted the end to come so I could stop wasting my electricity.

The way he destroyed that story still give me the creeps. However I heard that this movie was quite good, so I decided to watch it after all and I must say I was surprised by how good it really is.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie makes you remember Moulin Rouge, placed in a more or less fairy tale setting this movie has nevertheless a very dark and dramatic tone mixed up with a romantic story. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo Dicaprio do a good job, but it is Joel Edgerton that steels the show. In an unbelievable way he transforms himself in a very energetic antagonist that just gives you the chills.<br/><br/>The Soundtrack is amazing, I was surprised about the mixture of the modern soundtrack and the old setting (beginning of the 20th century). Personally I thought it was a vivid and energetic mixture that makes the movie even better.<br/><br/>After having seen the movie I didn't understand how so many people could hate this picture, the movie is definitely not for everyone but nevertheless it's a must see for everyone who likes a real dramatic love story."

It is a movie that does not make you think pretty much at all and it for sure does not even try to make you wonder about anything. It's like one of those big and generously decorated boxes that has layers and layers of beautifully folded and crumpled papers & for which you have very high expectations and a load of excitement, but once you open it, you realize that it is absolutely empty inside. Solid actors, stunning decorations, original soundtrack, sort of touching story, which was very poorly executed.

"secondtake","7","3","5","15 October 2013"," An artful film where artifice replaces emotion, highly refined stuff
","The Great Gatsby (2013)<br/><br/>Unlike both ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo & Juliet,"" two amazing movies with literary roots, Baz Luhrman's ""The Great Gatsby"" does not quite let go of reality. The effects and the general visual license throughout are in service to a very literal love story, which rules the movie.<br/><br/>This might be what is best, but it means there is no release into this other world of Luhrman's fancy, which is the real joy (and astonishment) of the other two movies. Instead there is an utterly crystalline attention to light and detail. And to scenes that are themselves over the top and are merely filmed with ordinary brilliance. This is Luhrmann the stage director set loose, and for theatrical excess some of the party scenes are pretty wonderful, recalling (for some reason) the crazy party scenes in DeMille's ""Madame Satan"" (shot back in 1930). But then, DeMille and Luhrmann are both about spectacle.<br/><br/>I'm not sure the story, which is the heart of this, survives it all. The plastic falseness of the approach (the color and light and camera as well as the sets themselves) gets in the way of the drama, the very human and very 1920s American drama. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, though not what I'd call transcendent, which is unfortunately what the role needs. Jay Gatsby is nothing if not a mysterious and highly idealistic man caught up in old fashioned ways. His sidekick and narrator is played by Tobey Maguire, and I usually like him a lot but here he is so detached from the action, as if playing the narrator physically, he ends up adding to the plasticity rather than the human depths of the story.<br/><br/>Third in line is certainly the woman who has Gatsby's attention (and obsession), played by Carrie Mulligan with some deliberate force. She, also, is very good but falls into the idea of the story more than the emotional expression of it. Some of the more minor characters add to this general array of true ""characters"" as if they are types, or as if they are actors playing roles.<br/><br/>In fact, this intentional stylizing of every part into a kind of presentation of ideas, told with visual fireworks, is the point. For some people it might sit perfectly on the cusp of art film and naturalistic drama. If things got pushed into even further stylizing we'd have a piece of art on our hands, and it might have a smaller but more fervid audience. I think it might have tipped further to an old school Hollywood drama with characters who rip your heart out and close-ups that make you weep. That, however, is not possible with so much artifice center stage.<br/><br/>So we have an ambitious, beautiful, curious movie. I wish Luhrmann could say, aloud, what he felt he didn't quite get the way he wanted. He has admitted that filming the movie was no fun at all, and I can imagine the work and attention to detail it would require. It's worth seeing if you like movie-making, or like Luhrmann's other movies."

","I am a book lover more than a movie critic, so my insight on movies might not be that accurate. As a viewer, I found this movie thrilling from start to end, especially the characters - the way the actors act is just so gorgeous and accurate. One of my complains must be the excessive amount of party, the overtly exquisite that Luhrmnann tried to shove down one's throat. I like the Eye of God symbol and the dirt road, but there is no Owl Eyes part and the quote about ""cardboard books"" :(.<br/><br/>I guess I can't ask too much. Anyway, I've read the book and found this adaption pretty much follow the theme and the tone. some people disagreed with the casino-like art-deco settings and modern hip-hop music but I do not really mind. Mr Baz just tried to fit it with our world today to feel more real. <br/><br/>That's all I have to say. Love this movie :)"

","One of the greatest American novels and F. Scott Fitzgerald's finest work, The Great Gatsby is the quintessential story of the self-made American. The novel and the films. based on the novel, are voyeuristic - the lives of the rich as seen through the eyes of Nick Carraway, a commoner and a bond salesman renting a cottage next door to Jay Gatsby]s estate. The story takes place in the Summer of 1922. Everyone wants to know more about the mysterious Gatsby who throws legendary parties of fantastic opulence. <br/><br/>Gatsby was played in 1974 by Robert Redford, a film which covered the same ground as this one. Because of the prestige and prominence of the original text, any treatment of Fitzgerald's work will generate controversy and invite comparison.<br/><br/>While I greatly admire Robert Redford's body of work, his Gatsby was stiff and wooden. Leonardo Dicaprio's Gatsby does not disappoint. I didn't expect him to fill the bill, but he did.<br/><br/>Much of the controversy about the current Gatsby is whether Baz Luhrman's treatment of the work was appropriate. People either like Baz or they do not. I really like Baz. His Moulin Rouge was a visual treat. The Elton John soundtrack was an odd choice, but it worked for me. <br/><br/>His treatment of Gatsby's extravagant parties redefines the experience. Nothing in film history is more grand than Gatsby's parties. If you missed a party at Gatsby's house in 1922, you missed the party of the century. The color and luxury pop off the screen. Baz puts so much life into the script that this remake outshines the 1974 film as a visual statement. <br/><br/>Gatsby is a love story about how a poor fellow tries to woo a rich girl. His exceptional efforts fail, but his efforts are spectacular. Expect multiple nominations and Oscars."
"mcalester66","9","3","5","28 July 2013"," More than Accurtate
","The trailers for this movie made it appear overly-glitzy and raunchy. The movie is neither. <br/><br/>The High Points: <br/><br/>-The acting in the movie is superb. I like this movie more than any other version because it makes the characters all vulnerable in some way, which, in turn, makes them more human. DiCaprio plays a likable Jay Gatsby whose facade includes an accent, which he drops when he finally has Daisy.<br/><br/>-The visuals are stunning. Most of them I thought to be real: Gatsby's House, The exterior of the Buchannan Mansion, the eyes of T. J. Eckleburg. All of which are CGI. For art, this movie gets a huge A by me.<br/><br/>-The accuracy is 98% to the book, with the exception of Gatsby's funeral, which is cut short, and his father is left entirely out of it. They also add the idea of Nick being in a mental institution, which, I believe, was supposed to be like Fitzgerald's wife, who was institutionalized three times for alcoholism and fits of anger. <br/><br/>-The soundtrack is a clever blend of 1920s Jazz - Bryan Ferry's orchestra sounds amazing! The combination of orchestral score and modern music - like Myrtle's death: Jack White blended with orchestra - is perfect to set the mood. I was on the edge of my seat awaiting for Myrtle's grizzly end.<br/><br/>-Which leads me to my next high point. The death scenes and the violence was all artistically done. When Gatsby gets shot, we only see a bit of blood. No gory wound to show what happened. We don't even see Wilson shoot himself - aside from putting the pistol him his mouth. And Myrtle's death is so well done, from the fact that just as she gets hit, a car passes by the camera, shielding us from the impact, and falling in slow motion with the eyes in the background. All well done.<br/><br/>The Low Points:<br/><br/>-Though there are no real LOW points, I will point out things which could have made this movie even better. Firstly, the relationship with Jordan and Nick is glossed over to make room for the Gatsby/Daisy relationship. Almost the entire movie is centered around Gatsby and Daisy's relationship. <br/><br/>-The ending of the movie was a little different, mainly that they did not include Gatsby's father, which I believe, is an important part. Nick does not meet Tom again, in the scene where we learn that Tom told Wilson that Gatsby killed Myrtle. That was included when Tom first finds that Myrtle is killed. I guess they did it for time. Other than that, this was an awesome movie.<br/><br/>Get it on DVD. It's worth it.<br/><br/>9/10 for missing a few parts at the end."
"abie-cloete95","10","3","5","15 June 2013"," Do yourself a favor and watch!
","When I first saw the trailer I thought ""wow this looks good"", and there was no holding back! Baz Luhrmann really doesn't hold back in this one.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio brings something new to the table as Jay Gatsby; he seems more dimensional and delusional. Carey Mulligan is enchanting and the hurt in her eyes rips through your soul. Mulligan's portrayal as Daisy Buchanan has soul and depth. Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway is, unfortunately, disappointing. He seems too young to play the part and he is way too shallow. His is a good narrator though, but he still doesn't get it right. (a bit annoying if you ask me). <br/><br/>I've read the book and identified a lot of dialog from the book in the movie which I really appreciated. The adaption from the book is great and I'm not disappointed that Luhrmann didn't add the relationship between Nick and Jordan or that Gatsby's father attended his funeral. Nick being in a mental hospital didn't make sense in the beginning but it came clear though the movie. <br/><br/>Baz Lurhrmann is known for his over-powering scenes, but it works in The Great Gatsby. The Roaring Twenties and act of materialism is evident in all the scenes. The party scenes are fun, the music is pumping and the alcohol is flowing. The intimate scenes with Jay and Daisy are pure romance and sweet. Towards the end the movie takes a noticeable turn for the worst and it evident with dark scenes.<br/><br/>The music is just simply amazing. Having rap with classic foxtrot is just clever and fits the movie so well. Young and Beautiful by Lana Del Rey is the anthem for the movie (and it deserves to win Best Song at the Oscars next year). The Beyoncé cover of Back to Black was quite boring actually, she didn't do much for the song. The lyrics of Over The Love from Florence + The Machine is brilliantly in context with the movie. The party songs (including Will.I.Am and Fergie) are upbeat and bring a modern twist to the movie which I LOVE. Mixing the songs intro diffident tunes is wise and makes want to build a time machine and travel to the twenties. <br/><br/>Overall the visual effects are great and 3D brings a whole new dimension (pun intended) to the story. Exceptional and a fresh look at F. Scott's Fitzgerald's iconic book."
"rob_gooden","8","3","5","1 June 2013"," Quality Film
","As with many modern adaptions of classic work, there was a lot to live up to. The media hype surrounding the film was somewhat of an annoyance, and I can't help but feel it sullied my perception of the film somewhat before I had seen it. <br/><br/>With this said, I can say honestly that Gatsby has managed to live up to most, if not all, of the expectation placed upon it. Whilst not what I expected, the film presents a lavish representation of an even more lavish story. DiCaprio's performance is top notch, as is Toby McGuire's. McGuire is able to more than hold his own alongside DiCaprio, who's powerful performance conveys strongly the depth of Jay Gatsby as a character. <br/><br/>Luhrman's conveyance of Fitzgerald's world is very bombastic, and at times ventures away from the contextual reality of 1920's New York and into a world of colour, show and performance. Whilst this is mostly in tune with the hedonistic explorations of Fitzgerald, it does at times seem tacky and unnecessary. This results in some scenes feeling very staged as if a theater performance, with some dialogue seeming very forced. However, in light of this, I feel this is simply product of Luhrman's unique style, which for the most part makes for an enthralling watch. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the hyperbole of Luhrman's world serves to accentuate the stark contrasts present within Gatsby's world and highlight the ever present themes of idealism, opulence and materialism. The performances are all top notch and the setting is outstanding. A quality film by any standard, certainly worth a watch - for both those who have read the novel and those who haven't."
"srwhelan-2","8","3","5","1 June 2013"," Welcome to Baz Luhrmann fantasy world.
","I think that people have either not seen Luhrmann's other work or are not considering this film in context.<br/><br/>If you love the book and feel that it's the ""great American novel"" then you'll have little chance of liking this film. Why, it's simple Baz Luhrmann has always setup his films as fantasies. Whilst I haven't seen every film that he has made the four that I have all start with you the viewer entering through the red curtains or in this case the art deco gates into his world. This is not the world of F Scott Fitzgerald it's Baz Luhrmann's world and viewers shouldn't be surprised that a director that reinterpreted William Shakespeare would do the same with FSF.<br/><br/>Once you understand that you're in his world or in other words his dream it's not surprising that the film has the feel of Motion Captor or that he dreams with a modern sound track or ever that he starts and finishes the film in black & white. To complain about Baz's style is like complaining that Hitchcock used cameras in the ceilings or that Busby Buckeley's choreography couldn't have been seen by the audience within the film but only the people in the real life cinema. Some directors have a signature style and you either like it or you don't but you can't expect a Merchant/Ivory film faithful to a novel from a dreamer. <br/><br/>I liked this film because it's Luhrmann's style, it's ""what's on the outside of the can is what you get"". However I also would point out that like so many films this years it's to long and whilst the 3D didn't bother me greatly I'm yet to see value in the extra $7.00 a ticket.<br/><br/>Finally I think that I should point out that I have read the book twice and seen the 1970""s version of the novel and I have never understood why people like this story. Yes it may captor the rich at a unique time in history in a similar way as Jane Austin did in Britain within her time but I strongly dislike Daisy & Gatsby as they are both pathetically weak individuals which I just wish people would stop making films about. Maybe a film about how Gatsby made his money would be more rewarding. Now that would be a gangster film and we'd need Martin Scorsese to direct."

","I'm not exactly a fan of Baz Luhrmann and I have yet to read the book, but after seeing the trailers for this upcoming film, I went to see it with my siblings and my sister's friend yesterday in 3D. Later, when it ended, we walked out with smiles on our faces because I think this is a beautiful film. It does have some problems here and there that I will explain in a moment, but despite the mixed reception it received, I think this is a good film if you give it a chance.<br/><br/>Like I said before, I have yet to read the book, but while it does have some nice moments and it is faithful to F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid writing, it does sacrifice the heart which is the reason why it got such hatred from the critics. It's also a little bit long and it does drag a bit long; on top of that, I felt like there was too much rap music throughout the film aside from a nice music score from Craig Armstrong.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, everything else is perfect. The direction from Baz Luhrmann is tolerable enough and it does have a lot of focus while adding some atmosphere. The dialog is smart and refreshing, the visuals and scenery of New York and Gatsby's house is so beautiful to look at especially in 3D which I think kind of works. The costumes designs and make-up is excellent and the 1920's setting is nicely detailed, but the strongest aspect would have to go to a solid cast of actors.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire did a fine job as Nick Carraway and his narration was perfect; Carrie Mulligan did great as the beautiful Daisy, Joel Edgerton (who voiced Metalbeak in Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga-Hoole) is solid as Tom and Isla Fisher is also great, but Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the greatest actors in history, steals the show for being the right choice of portraying Gatsby. He seemed fit as a fiddle by showing the darker side of Gatsby's character.<br/><br/>Overall, The Great Gatsby does have some problems and I understand that it got mixed feelings from the critics, but for me, I would recommend others to see it even if they haven't read the book."
"Don Muvo","10","3","5","29 May 2013"," The movie brings out the book's one great insight
","I saw The Great Gatsby on the weekend, and I'm quite excited about it. I was glad to hear the director say that living to repeat the past is quite impossible, but I have to admit that Fitzgerald's suggestion is quite fascinating, even if it seems wrong-headed. Since time points forward for us except when indexing thoughts and media, we never look into the past, even relativity doesn't permit that in any direct sense. The past is read-only. Our minds can survey the times that already happened, and we commonly assume that it is unhealthy to dwell in the past excessively.<br/><br/>That's what the novel is about, at least. It is a fascinating attempt by a character to live out his own religion not so much in a quest for spirituality, but in a quest for something he feels a need for in his life. Since life is very much about needs, this opens the question of in what contexts it becomes important or relevant to recreate the past.<br/><br/>One recreates the past whenever one tries to preserve love. Love only happens in an instant, and the spectacle of couples trying to preserve their custom of alliance with each other is clearly one in which reproduction of the past plays a big part. That is ""Great"" Gatsby's great insight: That the moment of memorializing love, in essence attempting to make it eternal, is the reproduction of, and return to the past through repetition."
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","4","3","5","10 May 2013"," 4 out of 10 for Gatsby
","There's a humorously subtle moment towards the end of THE GREAT GATSBY when, after the title character erupts in a jealousy-driven tantrum, our humble narrator, Nick Carraway, played by a fitfully cast Tobey Maguire, forgets it's his thirtieth birthday. Too bad because Carraway makes for a worthy pawn/middleman in a complicated love triangle, and eventually the audience forgets about him as well. <br/><br/>No surprise as the story's really about Jay Gatsby, who has tons of money, a giant mansion and parties to end all parties. The closer we get or rather, the closer Nick Carraway gets  the more can be distinguished of a man who once seemed infallible. Turns out Jay's got an immense crush on Daisy Buchanan, played by an underwhelming Carey Mulligan – she's an apple of his eye and not without a worm.<br/><br/>That's a cue for one of the more interesting characters and our sole antagonist: Joel Edgerton's Tom, Daisy's polo playing playboy husband, is liken to old school villains created solely to be hissed at (think Billy Zane in TITANIC). To manipulate a modern audience he's given racist views, and at one point even disagrees that the sun is getting hotter. Either way, we know he's not the right man for Daisy because, well, Gatsby loved her first.<br/><br/>ROMEO AND JULIET director Baz Luhrmann, no stranger to MTV style excess, brings the vibrant pulse of the roaring twenties to life – yet there's not a genuine feeling we're really in that era. Could it be the abundance of hip-hop and/or rave music playing while bodies flail and booze pours from endless champagne bottles? Or perhaps it's the impressive but overall distracting 3D that gives F. Scott Fitzergerald's human novel somewhat of a corny superhero vibe: Then again, Gatsby is a brooding millionaire whose power lies in his secrets, and vice versa. <br/><br/>What lies beneath the glitz, within the bombastically colorful playground of high society, is a familiar tale – not much different than a high school romance – about a guy who loves a girl he can't get. It's that simple. And perhaps the novel's brilliant writing made up for the fact there's more theme than plot running through those timeless pages. Yet on the big screen, once the party's over and we're left with two otherwise classy men competing like Neanderthals for the love of a vulnerable woman, it's a downhill climb.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio takes a little getting used to in the title role. He's not really big enough an actor to fill the shoes of such a famous literary icon. But his melancholy expressions of a lost/loveless soul make up for the initial letdown of seeing him for the first time after the grandiose build-up of his character. Beneath the layers, either shown in flashbacks or described incessantly by an awestruck Carraway, DiCaprio, always attempting to challenge himself with eclectic roles, gives Gatsby a human side that unfortunately this big budget extravaganza outshines.<br/><br/>4 out of 10"
"OneMovieLover","8","3","5","12 May 2013"," Luhrmann's 'Gatsby' may seem gaudy at first, but overall, it works
","Baz Luhrmann's 2013 'The Great Gatsby' is the first adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece that I've seen. Apparently, Hollywood has a poor track record with this novel. After five attempts that, according to some critics, would be better left forgotten, this one is a huge success in some respects.<br/><br/>First of all, one can't see a Baz Luhrmann film and not expect an abundance of arresting visuals. 'The Great Gatsby' is a great example of it. The mansions and parties poetically described by Fitzgerald in the source material look just as good as I imagined them when reading the book.<br/><br/>Secondly, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is stellar, as usual. Maybe the Academy Awards will choose to reconsider their ridiculous grudge against him and at least nominate him this year. At first, it seemed like DiCaprio as Gatsby was a slight miscasting, although it didn't turn out that way. DiCaprio was able to capture the vulnerability of Jay Gatsby greatly.<br/><br/>Now, the reason why I think that the critics weren't so enthusiastic about this film adaptation: because it simply isn't as profound. When Fitzgerald wrote the source novel and published it in 1925, he had written a poetic, cerebral masterpiece (I've read the book). It wasn't a love story so much as a statement about the Roaring Twenties and the bourgeoisie during that time period. The one problem with this film (besides some of the scenes being a little gaudy) is that it doesn't really seem to make that ""statement."" It's much more emotional than intellectual. I'm not saying it's Hollywoodized dumbed-down entertainment for the masses, but at the same time, it indeed seems to sometimes lack that evocation of the time period and its morals that Fitzgerald succeeded at.<br/><br/>In other words, it's everything I expected in a Baz Luhrmann 'Gatsby': while it may not show the same intellect that its source material does, it's entertaining, well-acted, and contains amazing visuals that ultimately make it a great movie."
"ShelbyTMItchell","9","3","5","12 May 2013"," Surprisingly A Really Good Movie!
","Really a great movie. As kind of went into it pretty low as I saw the 1974 movie with Robert Redford.<br/><br/>As Nick Carraway is in a psych ward for his drinking among others as a kindly doctor tells him to write a journal to describe how his dreams became a nightmare in the end.<br/><br/>As Jay Gatsby is a mystery as nobody has ever seen him before. And he just throws huge parties just to see the girl of his dreams but she herself is married. But that will not stop him at all. As to where he got his money at and how? Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off the title character of Jay Gatsby as he plays him with sympathy plus also with a little mystery, humor, and troubled on the side.<br/><br/>Tobey McGurie gives off a great performance as narrator and really the main protagonist plus Gatsby's neighbor, Nick Carraway an Yale grad and WWI vet trying to make a name in bonds originally wanted to be a writer in NY.<br/><br/>His cousin Daisy, Carey Mulligan comes off as snooty along with being troubled and just a lot more emotion than Mia Farrow gave off in the 1974 version.<br/><br/>The main antagonist in the film, her husband Tom played with charm and snootiness by Joel Edgerton really comes off as a rich, arrogant jerk and racist. Who tries to keep Daisy from Gatsby.<br/><br/>As all four characters seemed to be really fleshed out and not one dimensional like the 1974 movie.<br/><br/>But the only flaw I found is that they did not flash out the characters of George and Myrtle Wilson played by Australian actors Jason Clarke and Isla Fisher. As they only had two or three scenes. But they make the most of it.<br/><br/>Really a surprising great movie and just really glad that I saw it!"
"lloydbowman","6","3","5","11 May 2013"," Fitzgerald Meets Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth""
","The husband and wife team who made this film worked hard to get all of the historical details correct, but anything that is good about the film gets lost in the unrelenting use of overpowering ""Hollywood"" film techniques.<br/><br/>It looks like an overproduced Disney-Jim Henson-George Lucas-Wes Anderson computer-generated fairy tale. F. Scott Fitzgerald meets Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth."" I have nothing against ""Labyrinth,"" Henson, Disney, George Lucas or Anderson. In fact, they are all genius filmmakers, and I've loved many of their films, but ""Gatsby"" is not a fairy tale story. It is a story meant to be about real people in an actual place and time, in this case, New York and its environs during the pre-Crash Roaring 20's.<br/><br/>I'm sure many will defend the film by saying that it is trying to capture and express the quality Roaring 20's with its lavish, decadent, no holes barred orgiastic parties, boozing, gangsters, money lending and trading. But this picture is all psychedelic party with no pathos.<br/><br/>In ""Steel Magnolias"" the character Shelby describes her wedding colors as ""blush and bashful."" Her mother clarifies that she means ""pink"" and it looks like somebody vomited Pepto Bismol all over the church. That's what happened here. The film makers don't know when to stop. They are so enamored of CGI, 3-D, and any other eye-popping technique at their disposal that they use every crayon in the box — over and over and over again. They ruined this the same way George Lucas ruined the nearly unwatchable ""Star Wars"" prequels: by stuffing and cramming the movie with technical production magic.<br/><br/>As a result, nearly everything else is lost amidst the mess: the characters, the zeitgeist, the time and place, and the story, not to mention any subtlety — from a novel which is essentially one long lyrical poem.<br/><br/>The movie is also overwrought from beginning to end with ridiculous over-stylized tropes, like choreographed scenes of footmen throwing open doors in unison and swooping in and out of scenes like a Broadway cast of chorus boys.<br/><br/>With one grand exception the acting is quite good. In fact, the depiction of Tom Buchanan is probably the best I've seen. He is the best portrayal of the boorish, bigoted, entitled, old money American blue blood I've seen. Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby is also a very good portrayal of the character. (Gatsby remains a chimera to the end of the book, so any reasonable portrayal is open to interpretation.) <br/><br/>Toby Maguire's portrayal of Nick Carraway, the story's narrator, is just awful, though. I've liked Tobey McGuire in everything I've seen him in, but whether it was his acting or the direction, his portrayal of Nick Carraway is ham-fisted, awkward, and silly — even embarrassing.<br/><br/>Rather than portraying a detached young, upper crust (the character of Nick is from a ""good family,"" monied and well-off though nothing on the scale of Jay Gatsby or Tom and Daisy Buchanan's riches) war veteran who is just four years removed from the horrors of mechanized mass killing, Toby Maguire's Nick Carraway looks and sounds like an adolescent on junior high summer break in a world of adults. That's a shame because I suspect Maguire has the acting talent to actually get the part right.<br/><br/>Lots of folks criticize the film's use of rap and hip hop music. Even though I don't like hip hop personally, I understand its use here. Hip hop is the jazz of our day. After a hundred years, jazz has become too historic and canonized to capture and signify the original edgy, and sinful character of the counter-culture of that era. The idea, for me, worked — for a little while. Just like everything else in the film, though, it is overused and overwhelms. It becomes as distracting and annoying as someone pushing his way past your seat while you are trying to watch the film.<br/><br/>The basic story of Gatsby is there, even if not the romance, poetry and lyricism of the novel, but despite its best efforts, and sadly because of them, the story and certainly much of what makes ""The Great Gatsby"" great is nearly lost amidst too much, far too much, overproduction. Less is more."

"themissingpatient","4","4","8","20 August 2013"," A Lesson in How to Ruin Classic Literature
","For those unfamiliar with F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby is set after the first World War in the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway tells the tale of how he came to know his neighbor and friend, Jay Gatsby. The novel paints a perfect picture of that era, exploring themes of social status, wealth, decadence, obsession, greed, morality and the pride of the people of that time. The novel is a study of high society and has been said to be a cautionary tale of the American dream. The core of the story is about love, hope and ambition. The film is able to get that much across, if nothing else.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire plays Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate who works in New York as a bond salesman. He lives next door to the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who hosts New York's most extravagant parties. Nick spend his free time with his college buddy, Tom Buchanan, played by Joel Edgerton, and his wife, Daisy, played by Carey Mulligan, who is also Nick's cousin. Nick receives an invitation to attend one of his neighbor's famous parties and immediately finds a great friend in Gatsby. It doesn't take long before Gatsby begins to reveal his secrets to Nick, who soon finds himself in a very complicated situation involving his new friend and his cousin Daisy.<br/><br/>Instead of doing justice to the novel, director Baz Luhrmann seems more interested in re-creating the magic of his past films in 3D. The first act plays out like someone on a dangerous amount of cocaine is speed reading the novel to us while slipping LSD into our beverage or popcorn. It's made clear that Baz Luhrmann is one of the few directors who actually has fun with the 3D gimmick, though it's hard to think of a worse novel to do this with. Luhrmann's usual over-the-top comic touches are present but it's never been so out-of-place. Thankfully, like his other work, the feeling as if the film is being played in fast-forward slowly dies down when we get to the source material's key scenes.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio are perfect in their roles, in fact all the performances are excellent and the costumes are worthy of attention, but everything else with this film is wrong. Like The Hobbit, it has a bright, colorful cartoon look, void of darkness or grit. The vivid colors are nothing short of eye-candy but the picture is so clear it's horribly obvious when the actors are standing in front of a green screen. It becomes a distraction reminding us we are only watching a film, nothing is real and therefore there's no need to invest any emotional attachment to the story or it's characters. This is suppose to be 1922, yet instead of using jazz, which is like it's own character in the novel, we get hip-hop and irritatingly happy pop music that will annoy lovers of the novel right out of the theater. It's down right offensive to the source material. This is a perfect example of how to ruin classic literature. Make all your shots reliant that the audience is watching the film in 3D, make the visuals so crisp, clear and colorful, it feels like a fantasy instead of a period piece, and add a modern score made up of over-played music everyone is sick of hearing.<br/><br/>While it could be said there's not much difference between this and Luhrmann's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, there are quite a few key differences when it comes to the source material. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is a stage play, written in a way in which it is left open to be interpreted and adapted as the director pleases. The Great Gatsby is a novel with great description that delivers a very serious message while capturing the spirit that was Long Island, New York, 1922. Romeo and Juliet had a heart-breaking soundtrack perfect for a modern re-imagining of the story and no matter how ridiculous the images got or silly the supporting characters acted, the story was grounded by the very real, heart-felt love story that blossomed out of the carefully crafted interactions between Claire Danes and DiCaprio. Somehow, despite all the bad decisions made by the director, the tragic love story that is Romeo and Juliet prevailed and shone through. It's not until the very end of Gatsby that the novel begins to shine through the film. While Luhrmann may have gotten the ending right, it's far too late for us to give any respect to his adaptation.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is a novel that goes into depth exploring a very real time and place that should be brought to life with respect, not with endless cheap tricks and gimmicks to lure younger audiences into the theater."
"Karl Self","2","4","8","18 August 2013"," Are my mom and famous Hollywood director Baz Luhrman ONE AND THE SAME PERSON?
","Director Baz Luhrman narrates the story of ""The Great Gatsby"" the way my mother would: linearly, as a third-person narrator, and always trying to wow you with depictions. ""So he's driving this big car, yeah? REALLY big and expensive car, yeah? And he's driving it REALLY fast, yeah?"" until I cave in and go like: ""Wow, now I get it, really big car, huh? I'm impressed, please proceed with the plot."" Another thing they have in common: They never fecking listen to me, but when THEY tell a story, they suddenly have all the time in the world. In the case of The Great Gatsby, almost two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Oh, and my mom and Baz Luhrman also share this: plausibility, logic, positivism -- they all mean sheet when they are telling THEIR stories. ""Hey mom, so he's this mousy bank clerk and cousin twice removed of this famously beautiful debutante and her millionaire sports champion husband, how come he's always hanging out with them?"" -- ""Shut up when we're talking, son!""<br/><br/>And the music didn't really work, either. Jay-Z kinda tries to cross over from contemporary hip-hop to 1920ies Jazz and Swing, cute idea, but it turns out as muzak.<br/><br/>Consequently, I found 2h20m of this movie hard to sit through.

","Now I haven't gone to the movies in about two years, and I used to go on a weekly basis. But now there's so much junk that comes out that most of it isn't worth my time. I had great expectations for The Great Gatsby and just watched the original with Robert Redford to warm up to this new version. And with DiCaprio in it I thought it would be great, especially after his top-notch Howard Hughes performance in ""The Aviator.""<br/><br/>Bang, there we go, the flick was a total letdown. True, the trailer is excellent and exciting, but that was about it. And yes, the movie explains how Gatsby made his fortune (and not in such a clean way) and that's quite unique and appropriate for the roaring 20's as it was since the Gordon Gekko era over 25 years ago, and apparently still is with some folks on Wall Street. But there were too many ""old sport"" in there and after a while it's annoying to hear the same line over and over again like a broken record, ... we get it after about 20 or 30 times that Gatsby likes that expression.<br/><br/>Oh well, maybe something else will come along that's worth watching, but it seems that Hollywood is producing one letdown after another."
"christian-stevens","5","4","8","22 May 2013"," Disappointing and Disjointed
","Firstly, let me say that I'm not trying to hate on this film. The cast and director are all established and talented, and the story of ""The Great Gatsby"" is brilliant. I am not someone who is obsessed with the previous films or hold a staunch upper lip against tweaking the original story (to an extent). When I walked in to the movie theater I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, or a disaster, and I received neither. Overall, however, the film was lacking in what should have been a great tale with a great ensemble.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, as usual DiCaprio plays his character well, and the same can be said for Edgerton, Mulligan and Maguire(although some may disagree). However the side characters aren't great, Jordan is rarely seen, and the same can be said for Fisher and Clarke's characters who would have done their characters more justice had they more screen time. These are just nit pickings. <br/><br/>The greater concern lies with Story, cinematography, and feel of the movie. The soundtrack, although containing fantastic songs, do not belong in this movie, and when they come on, they're out of place. As for the set and props, there is almost too much ""flash"" which I would have found hard to achieve in the first place. And the cinematography, like the music was out of place. It was good, yet just didn't fit in with this kind of story and felt overdone.<br/><br/>I think the two biggest disappointments were the rearrangement of key plot points (or their absence), and that the whole thing was quite dumbed down.For example, the discovery of Gatsby's past was revealed way too early in the film taking away the mystery of the man and the funeral scene was pretty much scrapped with no appearance from his father like the book. Also, the addition of having the whole story told by Nick in a flashback while he's in a sanatorium was bit much and unnecessary.<br/><br/>As for the dumbing down. All the meaning of each metaphor in the book are basically told to you or made as blatant as possible. I just felt by doing this that the movie was dumbing down it's audience a bit too much.<br/><br/>All in all, the cast made a good attempt, while I believe the director took many wrong turns.<br/><br/>Many people claim that I am being too critical and that it was a decent film. And they're right, it was a decent film, but it wasn't Gatsby, and it could have (and should have) been so much more, especially with a cast like that, and the amount of money that was funneled into it"
"cinematic_aficionado","6","4","8","17 May 2013"," Too much gloss does not make a good movie
","Not all than shines is gold and that could not be truer that ""The great Gatsby"". To be fair no one can deny the ambiance of this film which puts us right in the roaring 1920's New York. Well made and fast paced it will transport the audience to a bygone era, which is as good as it can get.<br/><br/>The problem is that its over-reliance on the A list cast to deliver did not work, as far as quality is concerned because there is no doubt in me, it will do well in the box office. A shiny retro looking Di Caprio, Maguire and Mulligan, who arguably played well, could not give this initiative the wow factor. In my quest for substance beyond the gloss and glamour I found none.<br/><br/>There were moments in this film, I could not help but think: ""where is this heading?"" ....and such thoughts are never constructive. The fact alone that it left me with a sense of indifference regarding the outcome, only shows that it failed to be an effective movie.<br/><br/>On the effectiveness side, it must be pointed out that putting contemporary R&B/Hip Hop music on a retro film was an utter disaster; it was like having Hercules dancing on Vanilla Ice. Bad idea all around.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, a very typical Hollywood project that does not do the classic novel much justice being a mildly pleasant experience that is it best to not watch with plenty of expectation."
"blueleaf04","3","4","8","16 May 2013"," Frustratingly poor.
","I've not walked out of a lot of movies, but I've seen enough to know one worth leaving before the ending. I stayed right the way through Gatsby to see if it really was this poor, right to the end. It was. <br/><br/>Before the story-line, the casting, the soundtrack, screenplay and photography all mash together to ruin the rest of the film, it is already bruised by needless 3D. This complete headache of a movie was remedied only slightly when I removed the specs after the first ten minutes. Nearly impossible to watch, completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>So we're on the back foot already, and Luhrmann hasn't even dropped Jay-Z and Kanye West over a 1920s New York crane-shot yet. Before long, you're thrown some dub-step for absolutely no apparent reason. The list goes on, and becomes even more frustrating the more 'Now 83' is piped over the screenplay. This is supposed to be an epic tale of grandeur, love, greed and jealousy. Where's the orchestra? This story deserves a score, not a pop chart.<br/><br/>The theme of laziness continues with the editing. Lip-sync quality is sporadic, there are times when DiCaprio's speech is cut at the beginning so you can't understand his sentence. Where tension could be built with music and proper acting, we have scenes with characters just breathing at one another.<br/><br/>My three stars go to the only actor worth casting for a role in this movie; Joel Edgerton. He excelled where the rest of the entire cinema experience collapsed, in 3D, around him."
"Stoh80","5","4","8","11 May 2013"," Not good, not terrible
","First off, my biggest complaint is how they changed the narration of the story unnecessarily. Throughout the movie, the real story, the story involving Gatsby and Nick and Daisy, is continually interrupted by Nick later on at a psychiatric ward—something that wasn't in the book. Nick being at a psychiatric ward was entirely made up the director, and as it doesn't contribute anything to the movie, I honestly can't see why they put it in there. Now, I can understand how they might want to change up the story to make it different and fresh, but this narration ""story within a story"" technique added nothing to the movie and only served as an annoying break from the real plot.<br/><br/>I also got the feeling they were trying to ""modernize"" a lot of the story, especially with their choice of soundtrack, but most of the time came across as anachronistic. Of course, it is not a bad thing at all to have songs from out of the time period. But there are so many more appropriate, actual 1920s songs they could have picked for the movie, that they would have gotten across the theme of partying and excess a hundred times better.<br/><br/>However, the cast and acting was good. Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby Maguire played their roles pretty well, and there wasn't a moment in the movie that I felt that they should have picked another actor for their parts. Every character in the movie is how I could have imaged a character from the book.<br/><br/>The movie just tries too hard. It hits you over the head with symbols like the green light and the optometry billboard that should have way more subtle. Several scenes are overdramatized, with tons of effects and music and overacting thrown in there that it makes the viewer dizzy.<br/><br/>It was very over stylized. Words fly around the screen in a few scenes in line with the actors' dialogue, which just looks more silly than anything else. It felt like they were trying to replace any actual meaning of the book with glitzy parties and (albeit stunning) visual effects. It wasn't a bad movie, but it could have been way better done."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","6","14","10 May 2013"," Baz Luhrmann moves from roaring twenties to quiet love story, making for an odd mixture.
","Okay, here's the good news: Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" is not an embarrassment to F. Scott Fitzgerald. This is a glorious looking and very well-acted visualization of a story that generations have been forced to read in high school, yet it never boring nor does it ever feel like homework. The bad news is that Luhrmann can't find a tone to get to the heart of the story – he mixes and odd combination of musical elements and tragedy, and misses the subtleties that made the story work.<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" is, in essence, a haunted love story. It is told from the point of view of a man who stands at the sidelines, Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire), a writer in a sanitarium who tells his story to a doctor who suggests that his patient put his story down on paper (no points for guessing what his memoirs will become). He takes us back several years, back to 1922, just after The Great War, when he was living in a small house in West Egg, New York. Next door is a sprawling manor from which come raucous parties with hundreds of guests. Bands play, liquor flows, and every sort of taboo is broken.<br/><br/>The host is a man so mythical that most of his party guests have never even seen him. He is Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), an eccentric millionaire with a taste so indulgence that he has his name embossed on his marble floor as well as his furniture. He is a mystery, a man who reminds us a little of Charles Foster Kane, the difference being that his Xanadu is filled nightly with hundreds happy party-goers instead of a lot of empty space. He has the same wounded heart as Kane, only Gatsby's Rosebud isn't stuffed in a dusty basement, rather it remains in the deep chasms of his heart. His Rosebud is named Daisy (Carey Mulligan), who became the great love of his life before fate and circumstance pulled them apart. What's keeping them apart won't be spoiled for anyone who hasn't read the book. All that can be said is that in the best parts of ""The Great Gatsby,"" we want them to be together. That's always the best indicator of a good love story.<br/><br/>There are two halves to this movie. One is a quiet love story, the other is the birth spring of The Roaring Twenties. These two elements are set against one another into a very uneven mixture. At once, the movie pops and rattles with color and music, and then it quiets down to get into the tragedy of the love story. Just as we are getting our motor revved up, we find that we have to down shift for the romance.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann is a brilliant craftsman, but he mixes a strange cocktail. Fitzgerald's book was about the dark labyrinth of Gatsby's wounded heart, but the tone of this film suggests something that would be more at home in a musical. Too often, Luhrmann gives in to his flashy indulgences – if you've seen ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" or ""Moulin Rouge,"" then you kind already know what you're getting here. He gets us involved in the love story, but he can't resist giving into the temptation to get back to the pizazz. Those two elements don't really work together. The parties at Gatsby's house are more like a dance club than a free-flowing parade of humanity. Who are these guests? Why drew them here? What do they know of their host? The first third of the film is loaded with wall-to-wall visuals that are painted and perfected to the point that we never feel as if we're looking at the natural world. We are told that this is The Roaring Twenties, but his colorful visual palette suggests that it is merely an approximation of that era.<br/><br/>What does work are the performances especially by Leonard DiCaprio who keeps us at arm's length from Jay Gatsby. He remains an enigma whose story unfolds slowly until we come to understand why he is the man that he is. When his beloved Daisy comes back into his life, we feel their bond. Carey Mulligan, one of the best actresses of her generation imbues Daisy, not with a piteous weepiness, but with the heart of a woman whose life – she fears – has taken the wrong turn. It's all there in her eyes.<br/><br/>So, to recommend ""The Great Gatsby?"" It's an odd mix, a great looking film with great performances but an odd mix of raucous music and tragedy. You could do worse. This adaptation is good, not great.<br/><br/>*** (of four)"

(It's probably the best example there is of an ""unreliable narrator,"" and it's bolstered by vivid characters and the occasional poetic turn of phrase.) But the movie doesn't even consider contradicting Nick's version of events, the second act drags along at a snail's pace, the music jumps from genre to genre and mood to mood for no apparent reason, and the whole thing is painfully predictable -- and not because it's based on a classic piece of American literature. It's predictable because it follows every Hollywood cliché that you can think of. (Actual quote: ""He'll pay for this. Oh, he'll pay."")

","Although many may believe that the film, The Great Gatsby, directed by Baz Luhrmann and the book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a false portrayal of the American Dream and how love shall not succeed, the romance that came from a love not meant to be is able to flourish in the fleeting moments Gatsby and Daisy had created a beautiful and gut wrenching film. The Great Gatsby is a film about Nick Carraway, a young gentleman who is coming from the Midwest to New York in pursuit of riches and visiting his cousin Daisy. He ends up moving into a little cottage, neighbor to the mansion of the mysterious Jay Gatsby. He moves in across from his cousin Daisy without knowing what he would be in for by being a connection between Gatsby and Daisy. Gatsby is a mysterious character who throws extravagant parties repeatedly but nobody truly knows what he looks like. Everyone just appears, no invites are ever sent but then Nick Carraway receives an invitation to the party which kicks a off the story's adventure. While attending the party, he ends up with a friend of Daisy's, Jordan Baker who takes him all around and you see the truly rich, lavish lifestyle of Gatsby. Gatsby and Nick end up setting a lunch date through Jordan who secretly knows exactly why Gatsby has picked out Nick from the thousands of people who go to his parties. When they have lunch, the viewers realize that Nick is Gatsby's first real friend he has actually made. Then, the truth is finally revealed, and viewers learn that Gatsby is in fact in love with Daisy, leading to the connection of everything. Then, the viewers realize that Gatsby is madly in love with Daisy and the only reason he was throwing these lavish parties was in the hope that Daisy would eventually show up to one of them. Then, the chaos ensues and the drama begins. I believe this movies is worth watching because it is a fun rendition of an amazing book. The Great Gatsby gives a twist on a history lesson that you can fall in love with because of the tragic romanticism and American Dream that it portrays. If you love Romantic dramas that have a tragic twist then this movie is for you.
The Great Gatsby is a widely known film that portrays a time of the United States that had a great impact on everyone and everything in life. This film portrays the theme of the American Dream during the time of Westward expansion and explains the fruits and rigors of people who risked everything to achieve their goal, namely Jay Gatsby. The success of love is another theme in this story that resonated soundly within me. Gatsby worked and tried to achieve success and greatness in his life through the first theme of the American Dream and then by achieving that, with Daisy in his mind all this time since he met her, he was on a mission to reconnect with the love of his life although it ultimately led to a tragic ending. However, the success of love was evident in the fact that the small time they spent together was one viewed as sheer love. What made this film such a wonderful adaptation was the fact that Jay Gatsby was played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and although this is a common agreement, I have to reiterate it. If it weren't for DiCaprio, then I feel this movie would've been a lot worse. The book was so GREAT..... This movie was so terrible. Some reviews of the film are like this. This review spoke of the pairing of modern music with 1920's music and the fact that this film would not match it but I happen to disagree. Because of the new modern music, it really showed the lavish lifestyle and paired surprisingly well also giving emotion because new music has evolved in recent years a lot. Also they stated that the characters were terrible but the pairing with Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire was a match made in heaven this pairing gave such feeling to the film and in my opinion and the opinion of many, Leonardo DiCaprio is the greatest Gatsby to have been featured in a film."

"Screen_Blitz","8","2","3","10 November 2015"," Sensational and lively showcase based on Fitzgerald's novel
","Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel that many of you were probably required to read in your English class in high school, The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway (played by Tobey Maguire), a World War I veteran who resides in the fictional town of West Egg in Long Island during the 1920s Prohibition era, New York, who is introduced the astonishing lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby (played by Leonardo Dicaprio), a millionaire who owns an expensive mansion on the coast of Long Island and hosts parties of hundreds of attendees. While Gatsby is the most heard-of person in town, the man is full of mysterious of where he is from, where he obtains on his wealth, and what kind of person he truly is. What Nick learns is that Gatsby trying to win the heart of his (Nick's) cousin Daisy (played by Carey Mulligan), his former sweetheart who he abandoned years ago when he was deployed to fight overseas during World War I. Unfortunately, she is now married to her unfaithful husband Tom (played by Joel Edgerton). From there on, everyone is driven in a life of complication and unexpected tragedy.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio reunites with Director Baz Luhrmann after their first collaboration in the modernized adaption to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in 1996. Luhrmann blesses his film with such an incredible script and a captivating direction. The story is so elegantly written and is full of energy and cleverness. Leonardo Dicaprio once again leaves an everlasting impression with an ingenious performance as the film's titular character, and Tobey Maguire does a quite phenomenal job as Nick Carraway, arguably his best role of his career. The chemistry between the two feels so real and engaging and really keeps their characters alive. Gatsby is pretty captivating character throughout the movie. There are some things we never learn about him like he became so wealthy, but neither does Nick Carraway and that is the main mystery of the story and what makes his character so intriguing. Secondly, the production design is quite an eye-catcher as well. The beautiful construction and design of the sets such as Gatbsy's mansion are very gorgeous and give the film such an authentic representation of the 1920s. The same thing can be said about Nick's house and the design of the front yard. The set designs are very moody to where the audience will feel like they are not looking at the film sets, but actual images of the 1920s environment.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is what I considered to be one of the sensational and most faithful film adaptions made, although there are a few changes from the novel. The performances are great, the storytelling is incredible, and the direction and screenplay is quite solid. Regardless of if you read the novel or not, the film is highly recommendable."
"Quinoa1984","7","2","3","18 October 2015"," may be a mess in part, but in other parts is faithful in tone and spirit to Fitzgerald with excellent performances
","I was reminded of this latest adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's seminal work on wealth and identity in the early (and beyond) 20th century. Baz Lurhmann directed it; it's hard not to tell, and especially if you've seen Moulin Rouge you know how he will take this time period (like Shakespeare and just uh, musical Paris in 1900) and make it into a fiasco and fresco of images. It's hard not to when dealing with the high-frenzied party world of the early 1920s in the Jazz age, when people with money had a lot of the (illegal but who cares) hootch, and a person like Jay Gatsby could make a name for himself as... whatever he wanted. Of course, he was a bootlegger in this story, but that's if you look at what he technically does. He's much more in the eyes of Nick (Tobey Maguire, with DiCaprio as Gatsby): he's mythical, and charming and rich, and then... other times completely out of control and unable to really connect with what to do with himself, especially when it comes to his long lost love (Daisy, Carey Mulligan is really great in just that way of being delicate but smart).<br/><br/>The frenetic style is not unexpected for these early party scenes, but they can get so crazed that I grew weary of the anachronistic use of the music; for some reason in Moulin Rouge this worked a little better since it seemed all a delirious fantasy about LOVE (in capital letters) with only a vague sense of the place and time. In Gatsby it's clearly this period - oddly enough DiCaprio appeared before this in Django Unchained, another film by a director who revels in music from today in a period setting, but there it was done very much with a wink and a grin, a audacious black comedy. But here it's a dark drama at heart about the failure of the American dream in the midst of being able to achieve it initially: become whoever you want to be, reinvent yourself, and it can be great. Or, if it spins off the wheels, not so much.<br/><br/>There is conventional stuff that can't be avoided if really delivering Fitzgerald's story, which includes how Daisy is already with Tom, played by a very great Joel Edgerton, especially in how he gets angrier and more intense in a particular argument scene that is, for me, the real centerpiece of the film. But for this second half of the film, when Luhrmann gives us less of the full-blown, Jay-Z soundtracked spectacle, we get the story of this love-that-cannot-be, and with scenes that vary between tender admission (the ""you can't repeat the past"" dialog between Gatsby and Nick), the awkward reuniting of Jay and Daisy, and that giant argument scene. This and other stuff IS faithful to the book, and the actors help sell it so much even with (or despite) the Luhrmann over-flourishing.<br/><br/>But maybe this material in 2013 could only be made (or sold) as this frenetic spectacle. And you do get that, and it is so much it becomes too much. And maybe that's the point and I just didn't get it or respond to it. But The Great Gatsby is still a good movie because the story at heart is so incredible and deep and you can read so much into how characters who lose sight of what they want, or know what they want and muck up getting it - and it's all under that watchful 'eye' of the billboard en route to Long Island from New York city - that it breaks your heart. When it goes for it, this cast (DiCaprio gives it his all, which could have been funny in the wrong hands; Maguire is just the solid core, as he should be in this story, constantly watching and as the audience's eyes) sells it excellently. I'd watch it again, and is a good adaptation if not a great one of a book that lives up to the hype."
"jdonalds-5","4","2","3","22 May 2015"," Over the top
","This was an over the top stylized adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. I should have known better because I have not cared for Baz Luhrmann's movies.<br/><br/>The cinematography was great, costumes were superb, I even liked the Gatsby mansion because I think that is what Gatsby thought Daisy would like.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Leo Diaprio, even less so of Toby Maguire. To me the only bright spot in the casting was Carey Mulligan who I thought fit the part well and she sure is beautiful.<br/><br/>I nearly gave up on the movie about 1/2 way through and I rarely ever abandon a movie. It was so garish I couldn't find the story for all of the flash and absurdity. But I stuck with it. Four stars is about all I can offer for this one."
"joetufano882","8","2","3","17 January 2015"," A bit too much style, but a very interesting portrayal of the novel
","I like a lot of people who went to high school read the Great Gatsby and while I wouldn't say I loved it, I do respect the story and understand why people love the book. Seeing the advertisements for this movie I was definitely intrigued in seeing it but I was put off a bit by the musical choices in the trailer. And Baz Luhrmann's style is a bit too much for me sometimes. This movie has received a polarizing response from critics and audiences, and I can see why people feel that way even though I personally thought it was a good movie. There are some things about the film that don't work for me, but there is greatness within.<br/><br/>As far as what happens in the novel, the movie is very faithful to the plot. The emotion I'd say is done justice about 85 to 90 percent of the time. At times I felt a bit hollow towards it because Luhrmann has a tendency to throw a lot of things on the screen like he's going, ""Look what I can do with my toys!"" but a lot of the visual metaphors fit the theme of the story and there are more than enough times that he allows the actors to shine in their roles. The music is another thing that puts me off because I don't think it fits the time period the story is set in. I'm not saying the music is God awful and it's fine by me if you like it, but I didn't think it fit in the movie. And even though I do understand why it ends the way it does, I have to admit that the ending really upsets me since Nick is the only one who knows the truth about Gatsby and how Daisy and Tom don't even bother to back up Nick's story, and showing just how shallow people in society can be.<br/><br/>The actors are very well chosen for their parts. DiCaprio is probably the best actor they could've chosen for Gatsby, and manages to balance the charm of the character with the hopefulness Gatsby has for Daisy coming back to him. Carey Mulligan is pretty good as Daisy but I've never been a huge fan of the character of Daisy. Even in the book. Joel Edgerton is excellent as Tom and is really great at making him a straight up unlikeable character. And finally, the frequently and unfairly maligned Tobey Maguire. I've seen a lot of people say that he was miscast as Nick Carraway, but I couldn't disagree more. I've always liked Maguire as an actor, and he's the perfect avatar of leading us into this strange world that we as the audience don't understand. This I'd say is one of his best performances. Probably my favorite part was the friendship between Nick and Gatsby which I thought was kind of cool since Leo and Tobey are good friends in real life.<br/><br/>Despite some of my personal nitpicks, I do appreciate this film and what the filmmakers tried to bring to the table and I'd recommend it to anyone who's read the book or if you're a fan of Baz Luhrmann."
"brchthethird","7","2","3","14 November 2014"," Flashy adaptation of a seminal American novel
","Baz Luhrmann has crafted a feast for the eyes and ears in his opulent adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous novel. Having never read the book, I can't judge the film on its faithfulness to the source material. And also having never seen the 1970's film version with Robert Redford, I can't compare it to that either. So as a standalone film, THE GREAT GATSBY mostly works. Despite from anachronistic soundtrack choices, they still felt in tune with how the 1920's might have seemed to those living in that time period. As for period-appropriate selections, I liked the usage of George Gershwin, particularly ""An American in Paris"" which serves as a nice reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and other members of ""The Lost Generation."" Visually, the movie is stunning with great attention paid to detail. The only areas I felt lacking was in some of the pacing and the thematic department. The early scenes with parties play fast and hard, with dialogue coming about as fast as one could comprehend it. It is a bit of a head trip, but it wouldn't be so jarring if the movie didn't slow down to a crawl once the melodrama takes over. I also felt that the whole ""new money vs. old money"" angle could have been explored a little more. As it stands, the film merely scratches the surface of its characters rather than delving in and attempting to understand any of them, except for maybe the titular Gatsby. However, I do think the movie did a good job of portraying excess. Overall, it's stylistically brilliant but the story could have used some more fine-tuning and attempted to explore its characters more than it did for a 130-ish minute movie. Going in, I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised which made for an enjoyable viewing experience."
"tractorbeatfrog","2","2","3","16 September 2014"," Bad
","This movie is bad with a capital B and I will also throw in a capital A and a capital D to boot. Largely because it is so bad it deserves it but also because I apparently have to write ten full lines for this review before I can publish it for some reason, and I need more lines so there.<br/><br/>The music is really bad, it was kind of a good idea to try it on paper I guess and I can see what they were doing but it just does not work and just kept taking us out of the movie, we did not enjoy it one little bit.<br/><br/>I myself also did not enjoy the acting, I usually like Leonardo DiCaprio but I didn't think he was right for this role. The whole movie is a bit of a mess. It's not the worst movie ever but considering the big budget and people involved it could and really should have been a lot better."
"boussora","8","2","3","12 September 2014"," Impressive
","The Great Gatsby is a book that I have re-read numerous times, and as a fan of the novel I was wary that the film adaptation would take away from the book, or fail to do the book justice. This made the modernization of The Great Gatsby for the screenplay initially unnerving, but the film itself is outstanding when you compare it to F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel; none of the changes made were enough to detract from Fitzgerald's creation, and the movie remains satisfying to both fans of the novel and those who have never read the book. <br/><br/>Staying true to the plot of a novel when making a film is incredibly difficult to do, as a dramatic compression of the plot is often required in order to fit the time constraints of the film. In ""The Great Gatsby"", nothing important was cut, and all of the major scenes from the book were nearly identical to the way that they unfolded in the book. The film did not lack any message, or even important dialogue, that was in the book, and the changes made to the plot were merely more succinct summations of what F. Scott Fitzgerald presented due to the time constraints. For example: the movie starts with the first lines of the novel, and also ends with the last lines of the novel – which are beloved quotes among the readers. Another strong point is that the majority of the character dialogue from the film is directly quoted from the characters' dialogue in the book, which in turn allows us to experience the visual representative of the story as well as keeping the linguistic appeal that Fitzgerald presents in the novel. The most significant change made to the plot was Nick Carraway's narration to a therapist and the documentation of Gatsby's story in his journal, which merely aids the film in staying true to the book, as this allows the first person narrative of the novel to remain present in the movie. Other changes are minuscule and do not detract from the plot in any way, such as the soundtrack by Jay-Z that is inappropriate in regards to the setting of The Great Gatsby. Other artistic liberties that come with making the film were a bit too flashy to be realistic; for example, the scenes from Gatsby's party were obviously designed to be visually appealing, or appealing in a different way than the novel, as opposed to accurate. Such insignificant changes were most likely made to modernize the movie and allow it to appeal to a broader audience, and although it may have the disapproval of the fans of the novel, the artistic liberty taken did not violate Fitzgerald's message or plot in any way.<br/><br/>The casting, however, is something that did affect the overall quality. The character interpretation that the actors and actresses portrayed changed the tone of the movie, and it was a more lighthearted film than it was novel. Leonardo DiCaprio was a passable Jay Gatsby, and while his skill at acting was evident in certain scenes such as the tea date, he was most likely cast as a way to attract a different demographic. DiCaprio was not bad, but fit the role poorly. Carrey Mulligan fit the appearance of Daisy perfectly, but the way she conducted her interactions with other characters made her bolder than her novel counterpart and more likable; Mulligan made Daisy more innocent and easy to sympathize with than the way Fitzgerald wrote her to be. Joel Edgerton was an impeccable Tom Buchanan, and probably had the most accurate depiction of his character. Elizabeth Debicki softened Jordan's character drastically, making Jordan charming instead of the frightening and intimidating character that she was in the book. These changes made by the were tolerable because they were so slight and did not take away anything from the character themselves, but were merely different interpretations; the biggest mistake that was made in the film adaptation, however, was the casting of Toby McGuire as Nick Carraway, as his depiction of the character was far from Fitzgerald's version of him. Whereas the subtle changes made by the other actors and actresses in the film took nothing away from the character themselves, McGuire completely disregarded the detached and observational nature of Nick Carraway, which is the main reason why Carraway is such a successful narrator in the novel. McGuire portrayed Carraway as childish, innocent, and playful, and though his dialogue was extremely similar to his novel counterparts (which is due to the script as opposed to his own decisions regarding his role), what he brought to the role changed the character completely. McGuire's acting was not good enough to make up for these changes either, as the other actors or actresses would have been, making McGuire the weakest one in the cast.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Great Gatsby"" film is something that I would recommend to people that enjoyed the book, as almost all of the charm and appeal from the novel is present in the film. It does not do injustice to Fitzgerald's novel and the modernization of certain aspects do not interfere with the plot or the characters at all; if they bother you, they'll simply be rare distractions from what's happening."
"g-bodyl","8","2","3","22 August 2014"," Modern Reincarnation of a Literary Classic!
","This modern retelling of the Great Gatsby is actually a lot better than people give it credit for. It's a film that goes a long way in successfully adapting the themes based on the abundance of wealth and love into the final product. It is visually enhancing and the visuals make the film borderline magical. It's vintage 1920's New York thanks to the strong production design and the costumes are realistic, thus giving the overall film a realistic tone. However the one thing that annoyed me was the music. The score itself was fine, but there shouldn't have been any rap music in a film that takes place during the 1920's.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann's film has Luhrmann's trademark flair for visuals so the movie was certainly pretty. But this film is about a poor man named Nick Carraway who moves in next door to his mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby. The two men get to know each other slowly but surely, but when Nick finds out that Gatsby is in love with his cousin, Daisy, things will surely get complicated.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio made an excellent Gatsby and he really captured the essence of the character. He really showed how Gatsby doesn't fare well in public and all his fake smiles, but he really showed the love that he had for the married Daisy. Leo had a scene here that really reminded me of a scene of his in Django Unchained and both involved tempers. Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as the narrator of the story who is drawn into the mysteriousness of his neighbor. Joel Edgerton does a great job as Daisy's suspicious husband, Tom. Carey Mulligan certainly makes an elegant Daisy.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fine adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's beloved novel. With all the main characters here, each one of them has their faults and we hate them for that, but we are drawn into each character wondering what will happen next. I was absorbed into the film, and I even forgot at times what will happen (I read the novel, so I know), because I was so absorbed. If it wasn't for that blasted hip-hop music, this film would have been near perfection. But alas, a very good film anyhow. I rate this film 8/10."

","Having finally got round to reading 'The Great Gatsby' (and enjoying it immensely) I was looking forward to seeing this most recent film adaptation. And I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>There are problems with it, my main one being the choice to cast Tobey Maguire as the narrator (or to cast Tobey Maguire at all... in anything) but even that I got over after about half an hour when it became clear he wasn't going to take up too much screen time.<br/><br/>What makes the original novella truly stand out is the beauty of the language used and the construction of truly perceptive, insightful imagery regarding human nature, and I think that is captured well for the most part. Granted, you do have to sit through the typical Baz Luhrmann epileptic colour schemes and 2 second shots but this, like the Maguire problem, also wears off after the first act, once Gatsby and the context are established and it slows down to explore the characters.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio and Carey Mulligan (fairly obvious age gap aside) do a great job as the romantic leads. In fact the parts are played so well I started reconsidering some of the evaluations I had made of the characters whilst reading the novel, which is pretty impressive and unusual for a movie adaptation.<br/><br/>So it's a strong 8. At times style over substance, and you have to suffer through some Tobey Maguire, but otherwise a very well measured interpretation of F Scott Fitzgerald's classic."
"rmax304823","6","2","3","19 March 2014"," A Glitzier Gatsby.
","It's time to start wondering if they ought to leave great or even near-great novels alone. No matter how hard they try, they simply can't capture ""Lolita"" on the screen, or ""The Great Gatsby."" Joseph Strick once took a stab at ""Ulysses."" You ought to see it.<br/><br/>I had to read ""The Great Gatsby"" in high school and didn't get much out of it. It was an ordinary love story and rather boring. I preferred Jack London and Stephen Crane. But I was much younger then and my brain was smaller, unable to encompass the theme of lost and broken promise.<br/><br/>Paramount turned out a version of the story with Alan Ladd as a rich guy, but it was all lovey-dovey until the murder at the end. A handsome Robert Redford and a wan Mia Farrow took a stab at it in 1975, probably the most nearly successful attempt.<br/><br/>But a generation has passed and it's time for another crack at it. The director, Baz Luhrmann, apparently believes that the previous versions were too slow and colorless, didn't have enough violence, and had no access to computer generated images. Boy, does he believe it.<br/><br/>The camera whooshes all over the place. There are Busby Berkeley shots from overhead. It caroms off the walls of New York City streets. It's fast. And the sound track is loud. Some of the musical score -- whether source music or overscore, and sometimes it's impossible to tell one from another -- are of the period. During Gatsby's increasingly public courting of Daisy, ""Ain't Misbehaving"" slides into ""Let's Misbehave."" But that kind of musical echo is uncommon. It's 1926 and the bands play rap music while the camera takes a tour of Times Square. Later there is a disco dance scene with the appropriate beats. The bands never seem to shut up. It's pretty jarring, whereas the Redford version, though sluggish in comparison, at least stuck to lush period tunes like ""What'll I Do?"".<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan, as Daisy, doesn't look bewitching but that's okay. She handles the part well, and after all the point isn't that Daisy is such a terrific knockout. It's that she's got some men in her thrall, mostly through her appealing delicacy and whatever pheromones she's flinging around.<br/><br/>Hers is probably the best example of casting and acting. Tobey Maguire is the narrator and observer, Nick. (Quick -- name a seed you put in the garage! Sorry. I had to get that in. It's from a crossword puzzle in the London Times, invented by a sadist. The answer is ""Caraway"", a homonym for Nick's last name.) <br/><br/>Poor Maguire. He does what he can with the part but is awfully miscast. Let's face it. Maguire wasn't born to play Nick Carraway. He takes a leap at the role but winds up as Mister Peepers. His occasional narration is given in a weary croak. The writers have sent him to a psychiatric institution after the storm of crap he's been through. He does get to quote some of the more impressive lines of the novel. (""Blue gardens,"" etc.) Tom Buchanan, Joel Edgerton, looks brutal enough, more than Bruce Dern did. He's more physical and just as dumb. But Dern could have passed for a Yale man, whereas Edgerton looks like he was a feral child raised by wolves.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives it everything he has, maybe too much. The director must have egged him on. He uses the same intonations he did in ""J. Edgar."" He'd have probably been better off with a phony English accent to go along with the rest of his fictional history. And if Fitzgerald's Gatsby is nervous when he meets Daisy in that rosy picture-postcard cottage, DiCaprio is a complete neural shambles, drenched with sweat, knocking over furniture. It gets the point across at least as well as a crowbar across the head.<br/><br/>Most of all, what's missing from all of these adaptations is Fitzgerald's sly humor. When Daisy and Tom first come to one of Gatsby's soirées, Fitzgerald gives all of the guests the names of obscure animals, all in a long list. (""The Wildebeests from Cincinnati, the Dik-Diks, Professor Margay of Dartmouth, the Elands of Hollywood fame,"" and so forth. Those aren't direct quotes.) <br/><br/>The movie is a long and glorious pageant of color that almost swamps Gatsby. Maybe next time."
"ialex1","4","2","3","15 March 2014"," Not So Great Gatsby
","I honestly didn't know what to make of this adaptation, so I'll break up my thoughts likes this:<br/><br/>The Good: I really enjoyed the story and I found that to be one of the most interesting parts of this movie. I also thought the cast did a very good job acting. I thought Leonardo Di Caprio had a very good performance as well as Tobey Maguire. In a way it was worth seeing just for all of the performances. It also had some good visuals to look at at times, a pretty decent score, very good costume design and great production value.<br/><br/>The Bad: Although the story was pretty good, it just wasn't strong enough because the characters had no substance whatsoever, except for maybe Gatsby. You only knew a few things about a few characters in back story and that was it. You didn't know who the characters were as far as personality went. They were given no depth and were all just there to move the story along. I also did not like the pacing of the movie. I thought it felt very rushed most of the time. Some parts were happening so fast that I couldn't even get into the scene and I wanted to be invested. For example, when the film opens with a montage for Nick Carraray's story the camera wouldn't stop moving as it kept making fast these cuts. It was just so distracting and hard for me to focus. Also, I thought the modern day soundtrack was very unfitting. They did not fit any scenes whatsoever. I thought some of the use of the CGI backgrounds and green screen were unnecessary because it did not fit a film like this. I understand that that might be part of the director's style, but it could have been tastefully done. That type of style was properly used in some comic book movies (Sin City, Watchmen, etc.) it shouldn't be used in an adaptation of a classic novel like this. I really wanted to like this movie, but those flaws unfortunately kept me from enjoying it.<br/><br/>All and all I thought there was some stuff to like and stuff to dislike. I didn't like it and I didn't hate it. I'd say I'm in the middle for this one because I really didn't know what to make of it. In a way it's worth seeing because the performances were good, but other than that I wouldn't say it's that worth it. It's one of those movies you'll see once and never want to see again. 4.5/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","3","10 January 2014"," ""Gatsby"" dazzles but never truly resonates
","It should surprise no one to learn that Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is a towering achievement in art production, costume design, cinematography and music. Luhrmann proved himself capable of as much with ""Moulin Rouge!"" and first glimpses of ""Gatsby"" suggested he found ideal source material to match his style in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby.""<br/><br/>But for all the technical achievements and the emotion-filled performances from a spot-on cast including Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carrie Mulligan as Daisy and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway (who better to narrate your film? OK, other than Morgan Freeman ...), a definite emotional resonance is missing from Luhrmann's interpretation.<br/><br/>""Gatsby"" is the classic American story of hope, dreams, wealth, excess and love that defined the country in the Roaring '20s. Luhrmann unmistakably celebrates this era with his patented (and mostly tasteful, depending who you ask) exaggeration, and doesn't shy back on the fairy tale qualities of the story either. Nick Carraway is most intrigued by his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, known for his lavish parties that last into the wee hours of the morning. Gatsby soon befriends Carraway, who learns that behind the wealthy facade is a man badly wounded and driven by love and obsession.<br/><br/>DiCaprio in presence alone has the chops for Gatsby, and he uses it to his advantage as the shadowy figure in the early parts of the film. As we become more acquainted with Gatsby (and learn to tolerate his excessive use of the term ""old sport"" when referring to Nick), he becomes a bit more two-faced. Rather than peeling back Gatsby's soul, we get an timid, emotional side that doesn't quick click. Perhaps its the film's use of narration as a crutch for explanation rather than scene work that more visually demonstrates Gatsby's feelings for Daisy.<br/><br/>Maguire fits perfectly into the mix, but we don't truly get to access Nick as a character until the end of the film. Mulligan aces the tragic heroine, as you'd expect form Luhrmann. She has a certain strength to her despite of her character's inherent weaknesses from a feminist's perspective. Even Joel Edgerton as Daisy's unfaithful but prideful husband, Tom, excels in his role. It's surprising then, that the film renders us indifferent to them. It can only be ascribed to Luhrmann's style getting in the way of substance.<br/><br/>Luhrmann and frequent collaborator Craig Pearce identify beautiful and moving excerpts from the novel to provide Maguire with some excellent narrative work, but the stylistic choices don't gel especially well with Fitzgerald's reflective and much more serious prose. One can envision a film in which ""Gatsby's"" themes and story can coexist with such grandiose visual context, but for some reason, this film is not it. It engages it audience, captures our attention and scratches at the surface of what makes ""Gatsby"" a classic, but somehow it never takes the next step. in spite of performances that tell our brains to pay attention because the actors know what they're doing, the characters seem hollow, and as though all that happens to them is a matter of artistic choice rather than necessity.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" looks and performs like the best possible adaptation of the novel, but the feeling just doesn't cut deep enough.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","What can I say about a version of Gatsby that has rap music? There is literally nothing to recommend the latest version of Fitzgerald's novel. With the exception of Toby McGuire, who does a passable Nick Carraway, the acting is uniformly poor. The 1974 version is far superior. Perfectly cast, beautifully directed by Jack Clayton, and with great period music, that version beautifully captures the tragedy of Gatsby. The closing scenes with Gatsby's father are especially moving and heart wrenching. As with so many of today's movies, the digital tricks and the over-the-top production values overwhelm the film. The new version of Gatsby is a shallow mess that is an insult to the book !!"

","One wonders what English Teachers across the Country are saying to their Students when confronted with the inevitable...So Miss. So and So what did you think of the new Movie? How do they side-step that one.

The Melodrama unfolds and the Tragic Gatsby is Exposed and considering what came before it all seems rather Pale and Pathetic and the rest of the Movie kind of Sputters and Rolls to a stop. There isn't much Today's Modern Sensibilities haven't encountered and the Scope of Gatsby's 1920's Life will probably seem rather the Stuff of Teary Novels.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why all the insertion of what is Hip Today layers this thing and the coats of the new Millennium are so glaring. The Classic Story needed some kind of new Paint Job, or at least that was the thinking from these Filmmakers. Yikes!"
"Nothinggrandproductions","9","2","3","21 September 2013"," The best adaptation of the novel to date
","The Great Gatsby is a 2013 film adaptation of the classic 1920s novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he writes a novel portraying the events that happened in those months he spent in New York City with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), and his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). The movie has an over the top feel which not only fits the novel (which is over the top in itself) but gives the film plenty of energy. The parties are loud and have gorgeous set design as well as costume design that fits the 20s. <br/><br/>Although, there's one aspect of the film that was risky but in my opinion pays off. It decides to use a more modern soundtrack filled with artists like Jay-Z, Lana Del Ray, amongst others. It is usually mixed with jazz instrumentals and I think it works perfectly. It gives the film a great flair and style. And if anything, the hip-hop culture reflects the 1920s culture in multiple ways. Gatsby throws these huge parties to get the attention of Daisy and is trying to revive old love from the past. This leads to events that only end badly. But, I won't go any further, although, I'm sure most people have at least read the novel in school (and if you haven't, I recommend reading it before watching the film, because it's a fantastic novel). <br/><br/>CGI is excessively used in the film. Normally, I wouldn't enjoy this but it provides for beautiful cinematography and looking at it in a more artistic sense, it represents the disillusionment/fakeness of the 1920s American culture. The movie also pulls multiple direct quotes from the novel and you can definitely tell that sometimes, ""this obviously came from the book,"" but it's also a matter of that you can't leave some of them out. They are too important. The movie also manages to carry over the symbolism of the book very tastefully with the green light and Dr. T.J. Eckleberg used to perfection.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie are what really shine in this adaptation. Tobey Maguire is perfect as Nick Carraway. DiCaprio was always meant to play this role and did just as good as I wanted him to be. Edgerton carried the role of Tom and I think emphasized his character even better. Carey Mulligan (who on my first viewing of the film, I was lukewarm about, but on this viewing I feel differently), isn't necessarily perfect but she still does a sufficient enough job to the point were I have little to complain about. I have very little to complain about in general. <br/><br/>My only slight complainant is the first 10-15 minutes are edited somewhat strangely, very fast cutting that only seem to appear in that very beginning. It doesn't wholly bother me but it was a bit off, it's quickly fixed though. Regardless, I'm doubtful it'd be possible to get a much better adaptation then this one and I have my doubts that someone could possibly be better than DiCaprio in the role of Gatsby."
"cosmo_tiger","6","2","3","17 July 2013"," Much better then I was expecting. Slow start but makes you glad you finished. Never read book but I liked it OK. I say B.
","""When I came back from New York I was disgusted. Disgusted with everyone and everything. Only one man was exempt from my disgust."" Nick Carraway (Maguire) is a war veteran and aspiring writer who is working as a bond salesman on Wall Street. When he stops to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband he begins to see lies in the marriage. One day he receives an invitation to a party thrown by his millionaire neighbor Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his world becomes changed. This is a movie that I was really not excited about seeing at all. In spite of myself I am a DiCaprio fan and I have liked the movies that Luhrmann has made but to me the movie looked boring. I have never read the book so I wasn't really familiar with the story at all. I had an expectation of the style the film was going to be but that was about it. I thought the beginning was very slow moving and I was worried that the movie would not hold my attention. While it never really picked up too much I did find myself sucked in and am really glad that I stuck it out and finished it. To me this is not one of Luhrmann's best movies and it felt like a non-musical Moulin Rouge but it was much better then I was expecting. Overall, better then I expected. Starts off slow but does get better and better and makes you glad you finished it. I give it a B."
"stensson","8","2","3","10 June 2013"," Greatest Gatsby ever?
","Didn't have great expectations, but became surprised. Suddenly I think I understand what Fitzgerald's novel is about.<br/><br/>What Gatsby does is having a hope so extreme, that he even thinks he can not only stop time, but bring it back. That's reality to him. The green light far away but so near is the symbol, but God watches it all through the eyes of a dirty poster.<br/><br/>Not that Di Caprio is good, but he is the engine of the Plaza Hotel scene, which puts everything on the edge. Existentialism shines through all the flapper luxury. And the green light is still there, even after the party is over."
"mean_firebrand","8","2","3","28 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby, magic on its own
","""It was good, but not as good as the book,"" most would say after watching an adaptation film. In fact, even positive reviews somehow tie the film with its original content, which detracts from the movie experience. I say Ignore the classic Fitzgerald novel (for two hours at least), and let Baz Luhrmann take us into the magical world of The Great Gatsby. <br/><br/>From the gorgeous visuals to interesting choice of soundtrack, Luhrmann presents a refreshingly new environment. We see the glamorous parties, interesting people, and a roaring 1920s New York City accompanied by modern hip-hop music. This unique clash of elements blends surprisingly well because it is fresh, pioneering, and intimidating at the same time. These genuine feelings allow the audience to see through the lenses of Nick Carraway – innocence for the story. <br/><br/>""I had to block out all the noise about expectations, or 'Oh, he's doing it in 3DOh, hip-hop, it's all going to be flash and dazzle',"" said Luhrmann in an interview with Jake Hamilton. ""Listen, the film Gatsby is flash and dazzle. <br/><br/>At the end, the film still comes down to the actors and the story of their characters. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby was nothing short of brilliant. Aside from the natural confidence and enigmatic charisma DiCaprio has, his portrayal of the iconic figure was genuine and down to earth. He somehow managed to blend contradicting emotions into one package and instill it not only onto Gatsby himself, but also the man's dreams and aspirations. ""When you make a film version of a great novel like this, you as an actor – as a detective – you get more insight onto the character's thought process,"" said DiCaprio in the same interview with Hamilton. <br/><br/>DiCaprio will probably get another Academy Awards nomination for playing this great figure, but will he finally get the nod? We'll see. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was also very believable. Maguire's vivid narrative helped the audience maintain curiosity and the right amount of distance with the film and the characters in it. I would have loved to see Carrie Mulligan and Joel Edgerton as Daisy and Tom Buchannan a bit more. The relationship between these characters is a lot more complex than what was allowed on screen. <br/><br/>The overall pace of the movie felt a bit rushed, especially prior to Gatsby's entrance. There were a lot of scenes that would have been more suspenseful if they had more time to develop. With that being said, it is a difficult task to present all the intangibles of this particular story without losing a main focus and even worse, losing the audience.<br/><br/>Even with my premise, this production will always be compared with the classic novel. But why? Why deprive yourself of a chance to get completely lost in a cinematic ride. Whether or not the movie does the book justice is irrelevant. The acting was superb, the story was intriguing, and the visuals were breathtaking. Beyond the flash and dazzles, there is a beautiful story waiting to breathe on its own. <br/><br/>8/10."
"avonnie","10","2","3","27 May 2013"," A mixed experience for fans of the book - but the acting is worth the ticket
","Watching Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is an exercise in one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's best quotes: ""The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."" Before I watched the film, I reasoned with myself that I would do my best to hold the opposed ideas of The Great Gatsby - the essential novel, Luhrmann's version and my own interpretation - with reasonability and poise. After all, the film must follow the book, but it also must stand alone, and of my own reading, well, what does that matter?<br/><br/>I can assure you that all fell out the window once the movie had started. It is quite impossible for a fan of the book to sit idly as things are added in (or worse, taken away). At the end, I was left feeling somewhat empty at the changes to the text. One scene in particular, where Daisy shows her daughter to Gatsby, was omitted and I spent the rest of the movie fighting the urge to point out its significance: the shallowness with which Daisy treats her daughter, and more importantly, how Gatsby, positively rattled by the small intruder, decides to pursue his affair anyway. Why, Baz, why did you have to cut that part out? <br/><br/>It is unfortunate that at every tweaking of the text, a Fitzgerald fan is drawn out of Baz's dream-world, and has to recompose themselves before entering again. But, there is also an immense gratification to be had at the parts that Luhrmann gets right. Daisy emerging from a sea of sheer curtains. The awkwardness and absurdity of a reunion. The haunting pulse of the green light. There are actually hundreds of moments like these, and Luhrmann's faithfulness to the book is to be commended, especially when, as many critics will point out, the original is very light on plot and even character development.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire Maguire does a mostly excellent job as Nick Carraway, provided he doesn't talk. His adolescent drawl is jarring and boring. While I appreciate its inclusion, there are times when the narration kills the moment - for example, when Gatsby first introduces himself, Nick describes Gatsby's smile: ""one of those rare smiles ... it understood you"". While putting Leonardo DiCaprio to the impossible task of measuring up to this passage, it's also entirely unnecessary. Just let the man smile, for Pete's sake. Let the audience make of that what they will.<br/><br/>This Gatsby, however, comes closer to reaching the heights of Fitzgerald's text than any other (though Robert Redford was dreamy). He possesses that mysterious yet sincere quality that makes you understand why Nick would want to defend him from the doubts in his own mind. It's made clear his tireless desperation to prove himself, adopting a dodgy accent (Old Spore!) and affectations, buying an obscene amount of everything, all in an attempt to possess his symbolic lover, Daisy. His story is devastating in ways that have never been depicted on-screen before. He dies thinking he is inferior, reaching for that unattainable thing that will make him complete. I think Nick understands this, and as the final scenes lay out, I grasped alongside him, wanting to save Gatsby this ""rotten crowd"", his damning self-sorrow. It's no wonder Nick turns to the drink.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Carey Mulligan's Daisy gives some much needed depth to the simultaneously complicated and underdeveloped character (though after this movie people will still be calling her a ""b*tch""). Daisy Buchanan was only ever seen through eyes of men in the book, so it is no surprise that those diminishing sexist ideas often fall on her... delicate (virginal) flower, gold-digger, and Siren. While Mulligan portrays Daisy with a ""save me"" fragility and an enchanting voice, Gatsby's projections on her are wild and controlling. She is treated like an object by the men in her life, pushed and prodded and pursued, so it is easy to understand why she abandon's Gatsby's violent devotion (which had been fun and romantic until that fateful Summer day) in favour of security with Tom. Yet, she's also tragic, in the way that rich, healthy, white people can be tragic. She is perpetually bored and longing for the excitement that her life held before entering that faithless and possibly abusive marriage. To say she is weeping over ""beautiful shirts"" hides the sadness she feels that the best part of her life is over. Mulligan lets us glimpse Daisy's corruptible heart, but it is like staring through sheer curtains. The voice still ripples and delights, but her eyes tell a different story.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is strong, if not underused. Isla Fisher's Myrtle is underdeveloped, and her husband George appropriately seems to fade into the background until his ashy self wanders, starkly lit, through Gatsby's palace. Surely, Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) was as haughty and impassive as I remembered (and the perfect foil to Daisy's frivolity). Joel Edgerton really steals the show as Tom - controlling and protective, he is sublime as Gatsby's dark and taunting reflection. But his lack of screen time is woeful. It seems to be a running theme in Gatsby. None of the cast, including the three leads, are really allowed the room to act. It is a shame that it all has to be cut that way, with swooping camera angles and MTV-style musical interludes. The scene in the Plaza is electric, because for the first time in the whole movie, the symbolism and visual contrivance die down, and everything is allowed to breathe.<br/><br/>While I wish there were more moments like this, I cannot deny that I have come away from the film with some haunting visuals, deeper understanding of the characters and am enriched experience of The Great Gatsby. For this fan of the book, the achievement outweighed the distractions."
"LDCraig","Null","2","3","20 May 2013"," I give it a C+
","I saw ""The Great Gatsby"" last Friday night (May 17, 2013). While I enjoyed the storyline (I have not read the book), and the characterizations by the actors, I was hugely disappointed in the musical selections for the film. Hip-hop and rap music did not exist in the 1920's, and were jarringly inaccurate in this film. It spoiled, for me, what could have been an extraordinary film.<br/><br/>Also, I felt that some of the transition scenes, jumping back and forth across the bay through the green dock light, for instance, were unnecessary. While I understand the significance of the light, I felt it was smacking me in the face. The party scenes in particular were also jarring. I get that it was a wild time, but coupled with non-period music just made it all seem out of place.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I can only give this movie a C+.

","There is a lot that this film has going for it, and at first glance a 5 may seem a little harsh. Leonardo DiCaprio is as captivating as ever, and Baz Luhrmann has succeeded in producing an allusion to the 1920's that is undeniably aesthetically pleasing. However, this film warrants its low rating on two significant fronts.<br/><br/>The first of these fronts is that this film could've been an aural as well as visual masterpiece, but Baz Luhrmann's one dimensional insistence on specific aural themes throughout his filmmaking led me into overlooking any subtlety this film could've have had throughout the plot. Any emotionally significant moment in the film is accompanied by the dulcet tones of Lana Del Rey, resulting in any subtleties that any deft filmmaker would have kept as just that becoming so blindingly obvious it begins to hurt.<br/><br/>The second front is Tobey Maguire as a tortured soul. Maguire doesn't have to be so wooden, and indeed has proven in the past that he is an actor capable of starting in some emotionally resonant films. However, there is nothing emotionally resonant or even close to resembling tortured in this film. What could've offered us so much delivered so little."
"jayjaycee","8","1","1","4 June 2020"," It's true to the book and looks fabulous - isn't that enough?
","""The Great Gatsby"" is a 2013 drama directed by Baz Luhrmann starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. One and a half year ago years ago, I already gave this novel adaption a watch and thought it was good, but not as outstanding as I hoped it to be. Well, it was during a phase I always expected every single DiCaprio feature to be a masterpiece, so that is what probably shattered my expectations back in the day. Another factor that contributed to my confusion and misunderstanding of the film was probably that, at that time, I haven't even heard about the original novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald this film is based on. I don't even know what lead me to give the adaption a watch without having read the book beforehand, as it is totally antithetic to my general habit of reading the source material first. Mostly, I want to do it in order to be able to draw a comparison between the two and since I felt that the character of Jay Gatsby still fascinated me immensely afterwards and strangely even more recently, I decided to purchase the original novel by Fitzgerald and give it a read. Well, even though it was in the English language (as I said, I bought the original version) I was able to comprehend and finish it within only four days. From start to the tragic ending, I was absolutely absorbed by it and it was almost impossible for me to put it down in any way. What Fitzgerald created is legitimately one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century. The lifelike characters, the dramatic conflict, the way he puts all of this in words are just wonderful and beautifully formulated. Even if I finished the novel in less than a week, the characters grew dear to my heart and I miss them. It is strange what great literature can achieve, isn't it? With the impact it made on me still in mind, I then decided to give it a rewatch under those new circumstances. To my amazement, the film did not become worse to me, quite the contrary, it became even better. It was my advantage that I knew about the story this time and it shows. While it still isn't a perfect film, I am brave enough to claim that it is technically a perfect adaptation. The characters are exactly like I pictured them in my head (while Daisy looked more like Michelle Williams in my imagination) and the actors and actresses portraying them don't just play them, they embody them. DiCaprio is brilliant as the titular mysterious millionaire, Maguire plays the role of the observing Nick Carraway wonderfully and Carey Mulligan is magnificent as the irresolute twofold beloved. Also, Elizabeth Debicki was born for the role of Jordan Baker, but the biggest surprise is the man who portrays the antagonistic brute Tom Buchanan. You probably can relate when you have a few actors that you just can't bear to see onscreen for no particular reason, in my case, one of them is Joel Edgerton. Might it be his disastrous acting in ""Gods Of Egypt"" (where I encountered him first), but I am genuinely unable to stand him as an actor. Not him as person, I don't know him personally and he probably is a nice guy, but as an artist I just dislike him. That is why I am so tremendously impressed by him in this film, as he managed to make me reduce my aversion towards him with just one performance. What I am trying to say is that each and every role was perfectly casted, not only in terms of outer appearance, but also their talent. They all embody the characteristics of their respective roles seemingly flawlessly, as if they had just jumped out of my brain into the screen. The authenticity and perfect depiction of the protagonists isn't the only thing this film managed to adapt superbly, it is also they story that amazes me. Let's put it this way, the film is incredibly true to its source material and shows every single scene of the novel, just. It is getting to the point that roughly more than seventy percent of the spoken dialogue is taken directly from the novel and I am asking you: What more could you wish for? You get exactly what you know from the original source and you can see all of it coming to life - literally! For hardcore fans, there are also several small details to spot that were derived from the novel that are not mentioned directly by the characters, but were extensively described in the book (Gatsby looking at Daisy for thirty seconds - they made that shot exactly as long, for instance). I guess what probably many people couldn't deal with was the admittedly weird and frantic directorial style of Luhrmann, but as a huge fan of ""Moulin Rouge"" I am used to his weirdness. Of course, a few scenes are run through extremely fast, especially in the beginning and that made it uncomfortable to watch, but aside from this, the rest of the story is perfectly paced in my opinion - just as it is in the novel. If there is one unforgivable transgression in this movie, it without a doubt must be the music used in this film. From all the beautiful classic songs that Fitzgerald mentioned in his novel they had to use pop music from the twenty-first century. In the name of God, why? In the case of ""Moulin Rouge"" it was somewhat charming that they deliberately created anachronisms by including chart hits from the eighties and nineties, but that fitted in the context of the overall surreal nature of the film, in this case it absolutely does not. It was utterly ridiculous to see the people in a serious drama that takes place in 1922 dance to ""A Little Party Never Killed nobody"" by Fergie. It seriously disturbed the authenticity that was build up before. Fortunately, this atrocity happened to occur only in the beginning and fades to the background from there on. Well, at least the overall style of the film makes up for this massive misstep. I mean, come on: The visual, the costumes and the cinematography masterfully capture the pompousness and fabulousness, but also the hidden vulnerability and melancholy of the story and are exactly as Fitzgerald has pictured them. The Academy Awards for the best achievement in costume design and production design are more than deserved, least to say. It isn't only that, they also managed to capture the quintessence of the conflict of Jay Gatsby who glorifies the past, is obsessed with elusive ideas and eventually dies as a martyr. Like the novel did, the ending of the film made me incredibly sad as well and makes the same disillusioning statement as the author made: Money and wealth always prevail over personality. Yes, the same social criticism that Fitzgerald shows off in this adaptation as well and still hits at the correct spots. All in all, this romantic drama is not only exceedingly wonderful to look at and caries causing eye-candy, it also knows how to treat its complex source material with immense respect (except for the choice of songs, of course) and masterly adds enough to make it more conclusive for the audience of the film (like making Nick the author of the ""novel"", for example). It without a doubt is exactly the same as the novel and hasn't changed a bit, and in my opinion this is what makes it so incredibly enjoyable. The thing is, while reimagining something you can never please everyone. While adapting a literary source you will never be able to please all: There are some that say that adopting the source material one-to-one simply shows the lack of creativity, there are also some thinking that heavily changing it is an expression of disrespect. Whatever you do, you just can't win. I personally think that both ways are indeed possible to master and might create a great film and in this case it is just brilliant to see an exact realization. I mean, you also don't go to a Shakespeare play and complain that it is the same as in the books, you know? To someone who deeply loves the original novel, this adaptation is perfect and deserves more appreciation. It is neither too long, nor too short (the end credits run for almost 13 minutes (!), so don't be discouraged by the runtime) and doesn't feel boring at all. Not even once. It is a perfect adaptation but no perfect movie, still I think it is heavily underrated."
"stefannemanja7","10","1","1","31 May 2020"," Analysts...
","Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" isn't a disaster. Every frame is sincere. Its miscalculations come from a wish to avoid embalming a classic novel in ""respectfulness"" - a worthy goal, in theory. It boasts the third most imaginative use of 3D I've seen recently, after ""U2 3D"" and ""Hugo."" It's a technological and aesthetic lab that has four or five experiments cooking in each scene. Even when the movie's not working, its style fascinates.<br/><br/>That ""not working"" part is a deal breaker, though - and it has little to do with Luhrmann's stylistic gambits, and everything to do with his inability to reconcile them with an urge to play things straight.<br/><br/>If you've seen Lurhmann's ""Strictly Ballroom,"" ""Romeo + Juliet"" or ""Moulin Rouge,"" or watched ""Gatsby"" trailers, you know what you're in for: an epic melodrama that fuses old-movie theatrics and subjective filmmaking, period music and modern pop, real sets and unreal landscapes, psychological drama and speeded-up slapstick.<br/><br/>We see the book's Prohibition-era settings (East Egg and West Egg, New York City, and the sooty wasteland in between) through the eyes of the narrator, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), who's writing a memoir-confession from an asylum. This framing device is inferred from statements Fitzgerald made in ""The Crack-Up,"" and ""Gatsby"" often refers to itself as a book, so even though it isn't officially part of the source, it's hardly a blasphemous indulgence; still, it's one more buffer between viewer and story in a movie that already has more than its share.<br/><br/>All this busywork might astonish if Lurhmann's heart were in it-but is it? The guests at Gatsby's party are too obviously directed, and there's no sense of escalation in the gatherings. From frame one, they're Dionysian whirls of booze, lust and hero worship, minus the sense that that things are ebbing and flowing as they would at a real party. The CGI-assisted camera acrobatics feel obligatory. So do the anachronistic soundtrack mash-ups (modern hip-hop layered over ragtime piano and the like).<br/><br/>But in the film's dark second half, ""The Great Gatsby"" half-forgets its mandate to wow us and zeroes in on actors in rooms. Once that happens, the Luhrmannerisms distract from the film's true heart: the actions and feelings of its characters. Luhrmann didn't set out to make a PBS-style, bare-bones adaptation, but there are times when it feels as though he secretly wants to.<br/><br/>Once you get past the movie's opening eruptions of visual excess - hundreds of party guests boozing and hollering and doing the Charleston; CGI cityscapes that visualize 1920s New York by way of Warren Beatty's candy-colored ""Dick Tracy""; a long expository talk between Gatsby and Nick in a careening computer-buffed roadster that moves as believably as the talking cab in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" - ""The Great Gatsby"" settles into a traditional groove: scene, scene, montage, scene, burst of violence, moment of reflection. The movie wants to be a ""kaleidoscopic carnival,"" to quote a phrase from the book's description of a Jay Gatsby party, but Luhrmann's instincts seem more traditional, even square, and the two impulses cancel each out. Once you've spent time with his cast, you understand why he was torn.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's Gatsby is the movie's greatest and simplest special effect: an illusion conjured mainly through body language and voice. On the page, the character is so mysterious, so much a projection of the book's narrator, that you'd think he'd be as unplayable onscreen as Kurtz or John Galt; he eluded Alan Ladd and Robert Redford, the role's previous inhabitants. And yet DiCaprio makes him comprehensible and achingly real. The actor's choices drive home the idea that Gatsby is playing the man he wishes he were, and that others need him to be. We see the calculations behind his eyes, but we also believe that he could hide them from the other characters - most of them, anyway.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's acting evokes Nick's description of the human personality as ""an unbroken series of successful gestures."" Luhrmann cuts some scenes to make it seem as if the character really is omniscient - as if he can see and hear for miles and read people's thoughts and feelings - and DiCaprio plays these moments with a mix of inscrutability and delight, as if Gatsby knows something we don't, but is too clever to say precisely what. (He could play Superman.) When Gatsby's deceptions are revealed and his illusions shattered, DiCaprio becomes at once terrifying and pathetic, a false idol toppling himself from his pedestal. In his final moment of realization, DiCaprio's blue eyes match the blue of Gatsby's pool, and his anguished face, framed in tight close-up, has a ghastly beauty. This is an iconic performance - maybe his career best.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is nearly as impressive. Nick Carraway is almost as much of an abstraction as Gatsby - an audience surrogate, with touches of The Nice Guy Betrayed - but Maguire humanizes him, just as DiCaprio does Gatsby. It helps that he's played so many wry blank-slate types, but there's something else going on in his performance besides familiar notes - something deeper and sadder.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan is physically and vocally right for Daisy Buchanan - when she flirts, the famous description of the character having ""a voice like money"" nearly makes sense - but the film doesn't idealize her, as Gatsby and Nick often seem to. There's a contradictory, complicated person there. She's matched - appropriately overmatched, really - by Joel Edgerton's Tom. The actor suits the book's description of the character as ""hulking"" and projects the jovial arrogance of a thug impersonating a cultured man with money; he's scary but life-sized, and always comprehensible. The small roles are well cast, too, with Elizabeth Debicki's Jordan Baker as a standout. The director is genuinely interested in his actors' performances, and in the characters' psyches. When the tale's simmering resentments detonate (notably in a scene near the end that takes pretty big liberties with the book) the result is a more powerful experience than crowd scenes and CGI panoramas can deliver.<br/><br/>There were times when I wished Luhrmann had made a smaller, squarer adaptation, because he seems to have the talent for it; I never would have imagined saying such a thing after seeing his other films, which have their merits but are hardly standard-bearers for subtlety. Alas, this ""Gatsby"" is so immense and overwrought - lumbering across the screen like the biggest, trashiest, loudest parade float of all time - that its intimacies feel like shared secrets between the director and the viewer. The movie's like a guest at a wild gathering who finds the frenzy tiresome and would rather be at home reading, but can't let on because he's supposed to be the life of the party."

When the prosperity faded, summer left, the hot evening wind no longer blowing, Gatsby's mansion lost its owner, no more brightly lit banquet, no one will look to the lighthouse on the other side, waiting for his beauty to look back."

And this movie, which I otherwise loved, deserved better.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; I do like those songs, and I get why the soundtrack was a hit.

Toby Maguire was a mixed bag really, Ih haven't taken him seriously in other movies, but his performance was ok.<br/><br/>What really lets this movie down is the CGI and the music. Both stick out like sore thumbs and are hard to get by. The CGI was terrible, many of the backgrounds reminded me of the images you could use on Apple products in Iphoto. The whole movie had an odd translucent glaze over it and the quality of the CGI for 2013 was woeful. The music was also a huge let down. Why were they playing music from the 2000's? Rap and club songs in the 1920s? It looked and sounded more like a college fraternity house party, than what would've been a reality in 1920. It felt like giving machine guns to Ancient Greeks and expecting them to treat it normally. This did not fit, it was a missed opportunity to bring to life everything that a book can only do in imagination. The costume design was a better fit and did not distract as much.<br/><br/>I disliked the first half of the movie strongly for those CGI and music reasons alone, which were especially obvious during the party scenes. The movie was much more interesting, as was the book I found, when it came to the big conflict in what was Daisy going to do, and the fall out of the events that followed.<br/><br/>This was done much better and my opinion and saved the movie from being a complete fail.<br/><br/>Overall a missed opportunity on what could've been a great film."

"Artifam","7","1","1","8 November 2018"," The Glossy Gatsby
","Viewing with no knowledge of the storyline nor expectations, the Great Gatsby was an interesting and enjoyable watch and delivers visual delights that gloss over its flaws, but flaws it does have.<br/><br/>Firstly, if unfamiliar with the now 93 year old original novel, this vivid and slightly surreal adaptation presents a vision of 1920s New York that can lead you down a false path of wondering whether the tale is one big dream and if Gatsby is a figment of Nick's (our narrator and main protagonist) imagination or even whether Gatsby is perhaps some kind of conjurer magically manifesting his fantasy mansion and its entourage of characters into reality; notably as we first meet him flitting around his party sporting some kind of sorcerer's ring, which though the camera pans in on it on numerous times it receives no explanation other than latterly seeming to reflect with his obsession for the green light of the pier at Tom and Daisy's shoreline home. However, we should really take cue simply from Nick's first colourful experiences of New York City to understand that everything in the story is portrayed as larger than life and in the extreme. It is of course to be expected if (but only 'if') you know that Baz Lurhmann is at the directorial helm, with Moulin Rouge helping to explain the hallucinogenic hues of Gatsby's world, although this can be bewildering at times to the uninitiated viewer, especially when suddenly presented with Gatsby's yellow car darting around impossibly from West Egg to Manhattan like some cartoon car from Roger Rabbit (as others have suitably compared the scene).<br/><br/>Layered on top of the cotton candy dream-world is a modern soundtrack with notable use of Jay Z, Beyoncé and the XX. It's a bold move and challenge to established formats of period dramas being married to contemporaneous compositions. It's a fun rule to break, but the result is patchy in its application and the cynic within may wonder whether the score has been sold out to music execs pushing for that attractive soundtrack spin-off extra revenue. These things can be overlooked, as the ethereal feel of the film also somehow manages to mask a fairly substandard script (at worst when forced to listed to Gatsby's catchphrase of 'Old Sport' seemingly stuck on repeat, critical character underdevelopment (most notably with Elizabeth Debicki's intriguing but unexplored character of Jordan) and mediocre or hammy acting, of which nearly all the actors seem to be guilty of at some stage. When all is said done though, this is still a fun ride of a film and its imperfections are hidden with aesthetic distraction and its quick pace, despite clocking in at 143 minutes run time (although shorter if you deduct the soundtrack credit roll at the end)."

Carrey , one of the most annoying actors around, is at her peak in trying to make audiences dislike yet another one of her characters. She has no chemistry with DiCaprio and is unfit for this film.

Jay was once a poor boy who went off to fight in the Great War. He is now wealthy and made up tales about himself. Is he from a wealthy family, an Oxford man or a bootlegger?

He also has money of the old kind, inherited.<br/><br/>There is an interesting cameo from Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim, Gatsby's ally who has human molars as a tie pin and who never accurately gives the impression that Gatsby could be a gentleman.<br/><br/>Maybe DiCaprio overdoes the 'Old Sport' line and is in some ways is less aloof than Robert Redford from the 1974 version.

"charlie-37130","9","1","1","29 December 2017"," The Great Gatsby: Elegant, Beautiful and Dramatic! This film has it all...
","I have watched many great films in my short 16 years; however, none have caught my attention like 'The Great Gatsby'. Because of my age many people will be turned off from this review but young as I may be, I still know so much about movies and can spot a great one from a mile.
Baz Luhrmann uses his signature cinematography as well as fast paced story and edits to create a World in which anyone can be rich and everyone will always love a party. As well as some signature features Luhrmann put into this film, he also added his skill as a master of colour and light. The semiotics used here are perfectly placed with a touch of subtlety to reach down into the watchers soul and pick out all emotion previously hidden.
I have never cried at a film but watching this I couldn't help but well up as Nick Carraway - portrayed with such raw emotion and talent you will not see again by Toby Maguire - leads us to the climax that is heavily foreshadowed but still has the effect of making any audience member gasp in shock. As well as an excellent narrator, Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the title character J. Gatsby; he acts with such grace and elegance that no matter what happens you cannot help but fall in love as actor and character become one. But every great film cannot have just two stunning actors, it requires a host of talented actors and Baz Luhrmann does not disappoint. Along side the two leads we see incredible talent in: Joel Edgerton (Tom Buchanan), Elizabeth Debicki (Jordan Baker) and Carey Mulligan (Daisy Buchanan). 
With such an awe-inspiring cast and world renowned direct this film could hardly be anything but perfect, yet it - like any film - still has its faults. The minor faults this film does have do not compare to the films incredible coming to life and should not effect anyone's opinion on this beautiful story.
This film is about a man called Gatsby and how he changed so many lives but really I believe this film is about how ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning - So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" Gatsby's belief in the green light and his hope for everything is an inspiring message that we should all take deeply; it is said best by the film itself and cannot be easily forgotten."
"Jim-Eadon","6","1","1","26 November 2017"," Mixed feelings
","For me the most enjoyable element of the movie were the nostalgia-like reconstructions of the historical city. Sure some scenes seemed slightly fake in places but the CGI was generally remarkably good and I loved the feeling of going back in time. Of course watching Black and White movies really do take you back, but, and I hate to admit this, colour does add that extra dimension. The rest of the movie fails somewhat. Modern Hollywood movies are generally acted pretty well except for one vital element - chemistry. Chemistry is missing so often in modern movies I'm wandering what the matter is. The leads seem somehow miscast. Toby M. seems too wimpy, the lady was not charismatic and Gatsby lacked presence. Tom was the only actor who did seem genuine. As for music, that was horribly judged. They put all the effort into the visuals to make us feel part of an historical world, then yank us out of it by playing modern crap like Rap. Note to filmmakers, Rap is cliché now, pretentiously besmirching a movie with it does not make your film hip with the kids. It just makes you look desperate. After the build up the movie didn't really seem to have much to say and was not at all moving. But the loving reconstruction of the old City was incredible."

"dhf-60512","9","1","1","10 October 2017"," The Great Gatsby (2013)
","Importantly, in order for a piece of cinema to be successful it must have a great plot. The Great Gatsby uses different aspects to showcase the unique story by using symbolism and vibrant imagery. For example, the film showcases a town called The Valley of Ashes, and the town is filled with rubble and ash which makes the town look dark and desolate. Looming over this town is a great big sign that has two big eyes wearing round glasses, the eyes symbolizes the eyes of god because in the movie Nick who is also played by Tobey Maguire says ""Over the ash heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleberg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away. "" In the film we are told that there are two different cities one is East Egg, where people of ""old money"" live and West Egg is the place where people of ""new money"" live Gatsby lives in West Egg and so does Nick. Nick is intrigued by Gatsby because Gatsby lives in a ginormous mansion that holds the biggest and the craziest parties. Nick finally gets to meet the mysterious Gatsby by getting an invitation to one of his parties. Nick finally meets Gatsby who is played brilliantly by Leonardo Dicaprio, Gatsby asks Nick an important favor, which is for Nick to invite his cousin Daisy who is played by Carey Mulligan, to a tea party. We then learn that Gatsby and Daisy used to be in a relationship until Gatsby had to go back to fight in the war. In consequence, Gatsby has achieved many things, he's a war hero, he's wealthy, and he is popular among his peers, but he still yearns for the ultimate American Dream, which is for him to marry Daisy and live a happy life together.  For this quest Gatsby has to go through tantalizing and even deadly obstacles for him to finally grasp his ultimate goal.     The Great Gatsby uses an extremely amazing selection of music that directly relates to the film. ""100 dollar bill"" is a modern day song, recorded by rap-star Jay-Z, that talks about owning a surplus of money. This song was used to represent the amount of money being recklessly used at a gentlemen's club, as well as in the rest of the movie. Another song that relates to the film is ""A Little Party Never Killed Nobody"". There are multiple reasons as to why this song is related to this movie, the major reason being that there are a numerous amount of parties. ""Young And Beautiful"" is a song that has a great and epic meaning behind it. Gatsby is in love with another character in the movie, and he has oriented his life around hers. He is so wildly in love with her, and she to him. This song did an excellent job at depicting their love on screen, into words. Possibly the best relative song in the movie is ""Where The Wind Blows"", because it is a song of finding yourself. The entire movie is about how the characters are applying themselves to the world and how they use what they are given. The music plays a huge role in making this movie the great film that it is. Another aspect that makes The Great Gatsby such a great movie is its complex characters.  Arguably the most complex character in the movie was Jay Gatsby himself.  The initial mystery surrounding Gatsby's character serves to draw the audience to want to learn more about how Gatsby came to be.  The movie first presents Gatsby as a looming figure next door to the narrator.  This detail creates intrigue for the audience.  Then, when Nick first attends one of Gatsby's parties and meets him, the audience begins to see that Gatsby is a welcoming and friendly person.  He and Nick become friends, which helps urge the viewers to take a liking to Gatsby.  As more details of his life are revealed, the viewer begins to feel sorry for Gatsby.  For example, learning of his failed romance with Daisy five years ago causes the audience to feel sorry for him, and it helps to explain why he is taking so many extreme measures to get her back.  However, when it is revealed that he grew up dirt poor, it creates suspicion about how he became so rich, yet this mystery is never fully revealed in the movie, only hinted at.       The Great Gatsby is truly a thrilling movie that should be viewed by the world because of its epic plot, thoughtful choice of music, and very complex characters.  Every movie has a plot that follows the strict guidelines for making a movie but the difference between a good movie and a bad movie is how well it applies the scene to this guideline. In The Great Gatsby did an amazing job at keeping the viewers interested the entire plot by using vivid imagery and other forms of entertainment. This movie also implicates emotions through beautiful symphony of music. The use of different genres of music conveyed a wonderful feeling of involvement with the characters. The characters in this movie were simply a perfect fit for the scene. They allow viewers to relate to them and in turn develop a connections with them, and the movie. Overall this movie was beautifully crafted and definitely must be viewed by the world."

","Wasn't a big fan of the book but was hoping the movie would be a bit more gripping. Unfortunately it seemed to be very similar to the book. Maybe I shouldn't have been so hopeful but was looking for the movie to somehow incorporate a little bit more action and intensity. But if you liked the book you will probably enjoy the movie. I enjoy watching most movies but found myself wondering when the movie would end because I already knew the story and the movie wasn't very entertaining in my opinion. If you don't like action but enjoy a decent story line then you may enjoy it more than I did.

"dissident320","6","1","1","4 July 2017"," Spectacle over symbolism
","First off, I will fully admit to not really 'getting' the novel. I thought it was fine but it didn't really stay with me shortly after finishing it. I was somewhat hesitant to tackle this movie knowing it was directed by Baz Luhrmann who isn't known for much subtlety in his directing.<br/><br/>It does begin with an almost absurdly over the top scene showing one of Gatsby's famous parties. It's bright, loud and kind of obnoxious. It does eventually quiet down into a real movie. I might differ in opinion with a lot of reviewers on here but I feel as if Luhrmann does understand the book. The lost and found again love between Daisy and Gatsby is complicated and not unrequited on both sides. He built his entire empire in hopes to be with her and in that time she made her own life trying to forget him.<br/><br/>The last half of this movie mostly makes up for the unfocused first. Somewhere when going through the checklist of what needed to happen it finds some meaning in all the bright lights and fast cuts. It slows down and becomes a genuine movie. Or at least half of one."

Dramas and tragedies accentuated by kitsch - not for me, if the topics and appearance are meant to be serious and not like Tarantino's creations. The cast is uneven as well, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby is great, but the others such as Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton have had far more stronger performances. Less supporting actors are quite uninviting and forgotten before long.<br/><br/>Thus, just an above-average creation, improved by the presence of good/known actors.

","Probably the most lavish film production since Gone with the Wind. Wow, I could not stop thinking about how much this film had to cost, it was that outrageously extravagant(Liberace would have loved it!)Style trumped substance so greatly that the story was secondary to the production, and it resulted in a story that appeared to be more fairy tale than real life, which was just the way Gatsby wanted it to be in his attempt to be publicly accepted as a great party host and man of distinction, especially as he made his great wealth through hidden criminal enterprises that he painfully tried to keep very secret.<br/><br/>DeCaprio was more or less effective as Gatsby, as his strangely nervous and angry moods and behavior reflected more a mental case than they did a fabulously successful businessman. I thought he should have been, as he was in the book, much more of a mystery man and less personally exposed in his great flaws for the story to be as engaging as the F. Scott Fitzgerald book. I did enjoy Toby Maguire's character Nick's story narration done later from a mental hospital, as he appeared at the time of the story to be the one normal person in a roomful of damaged people who could say what really happened. Carey Mulligan as Daisy was cute but didn't add enough presence for the role.<br/><br/>Films change original stories a little or a lot to match what the writer and director want as entertainment, which is always more important in and to Hollywood than is adherence to source material, so this film result was not fully faithful to Fitzgerald's book as it was more a Broadway musical/drama hybrid extravaganza that was as over the top as it was an unrewarding story about the Great Man. If you love lavish productions and costuming, see it for that and forget about the flawed story relating to the book. It was as grand a show as they get but not much more than that."

It would still be worth seeing though, as the performances of DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan are quite convincing. I really liked how this movie emphasises the Fitzgerald's idea that nobody is perfect, no matter how rich or poor.<br/><br/>Now, if you have read the book, it's like adding pictures to it, voices, faces, depicting the most meaningful chapters of the book (not all though).<br/><br/>If Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' is making you doubt whether you want to see 'The Great Gatsby', this time he did a much better job recreating the original motive of the book."

","Yesterday I saw a film that will be nominated for about a dozen Oscars come Jan.'14. Some of the nominations will be Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Film. Leo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire in ""The Great Gatsby."" This in not just a great film but spellbinding from start to go.A Magnificent adaptation of Fitzgerald's book about a poor but very savvy young midwesterner who became a zillionaire thru shady dealings, living in a palace on Long Island and the effect he has on a totally innocent, naive and bashful neighbor whose recollections of events take place as a result of being in a mental institution. The cinematography is as good if not better than any film I've ever seen. The brilliance of lights, color and music set to a gripping passionate love story leaves one speechless. The viewer is riveted to his/her seat. It's because all of us are swept up into the imagery of opulence and life styles none of us can ever hope to attain. Good God, if each of had a friend like Jay Gatsby, what super-exciting lives they would be. Don't miss this film. It's breathtaking."

","Review on The Great Gatsby: The other day when I went to see this film I had high expectations. Past couple of months they have built such a hype that I fell for it. Well it was visually dazzling as one might expect. Once again no need for the 3-D experience as i saw none. The film did move at a fast paced and at times could lose the audience at what is happening, not to mention didn't really give that time to connect with the characters which is crazy as its a 2 1/2 hour movie. The characters though were interesting to watch as the film did catch that essence the book did when reading. Leonardo Dicaprio did a great job and stole the show (which he always seem to do) but in my opinion it was more Carey mulligan who shine more then everyone else. Overall great film for the summer, did give me that same thrill from when i saw moulin rouge ( same directer for both films) years back."

","Having never read the book myself I cannot really compare the two. I went into this film though not having any inclination as to the storyline and the film instantly gripped me. The visuals in this film are absolutely phenomenal and just add so much to the film, most notably for me where the parties, what a feast for you eyes, you really feel transported back to New York in the 1920's. Accompanied by the soundtrack this film is a real winner, and that is without even mentioning The Great Gatsby himself. Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a stunning performance for perhaps one of the most interesting characters I have ever come across, every scene is transformer by his presence and perhaps if it weren't for the absolutely gorgeous Carey Mulligan ,playing Daisy Daisy Buchanan, then my eyes would not have left Mr J Gatsby. All in all this film is a real must see and just is so interesting and different and insane, but in a good, if not the best, way."
"kcastro3","7","4","9","26 May 2013"," Phenomenal Novel, Spectacular Film
","It's hard to judge a film when it is based off of a novel. It is even harder when that novel is the spectacular, stupendous, highly acclaimed ""The Great Gatsby"". Granted this is not the first time the novel has been adapted, but I wasn't born when Robert Redford played the infamous Jay and so it has no bearing on my opinion. Consequently I had to force the notion of the text as transcribed in the book from my mind as I sat in the theater and though I didn't fully succeed in doing so I did so just enough to judge the film solely on its own merit. I'm happy to say that this film is aesthetically appealing and perfectly paced with amazing actors.<br/><br/>For those who have seen Baz Luhrmann's previous works (i.e. ""Moulin Rouge"") and have enjoyed his unique style, you will not be disappointed. His quirky and eccentric camera angles swoop from the individual out to the surrounding world. From the beginning of the film we see Nick walking through the streets of New York and in an instant we are staring at the whole of New York with its bright lights and tall buildings. Although sometimes distracting, it is very Luhrmann-ian and thus has to be appreciated. Another Luhrmann-ian aspect is his overlapping of animation-esque sequences. Nick is seen hovering over his typewriter, or looking into Gatsby's eyes, and across the bottom of the screen you'll see the transcript of the scene being described verbally from Nick (and taken verbatim from the novel). It plays off of the idea that what is being narrated to the audience is actually being written by the Character Nick (in the movie) for a future novel. We are peering into his world, a world that is very much real (and currently in development). To try to describe Luhrmann's film style to someone who hasn't seen it before is like trying to explain color to a blind person. All I can really say it that it does not fall short of what is expected. <br/><br/>I have two more points that I'll keep brief. First, the film was extremely well paced. The novel is not long, but there are many plot lines being explored and that alone can take hours to explain. The two hour twenty minute length doesn't drag the audiences into slumber nor does it do any injustice to the story. Second, the acting was tremendous. Of course nothing but excellence is anticipated when you throw in academy award nominee Leonardo DiCaprio (whom, on a side note, is so sexy in this film) as Gatsby, critically acclaimed Carey Mulligan as Daisy, and Spider-Man (aka Tobey Maguire) as Nick. Phenomenal performances all around. <br/><br/>I am not too proud to admit that I cried frequently throughout the film. But what shocked me was what proceeded after I left the theater. Slightly speeding in the rain on the freeway listening to Adele on blast, I noticed how I was still very upset. How could Daisy do that to Jay? He loved her. HE LOVED HER! It was she, not George Wilson, that killed the hopeful dreamer that was Jay Gatsby. How could she do that? But I knew this was going to happen. I'd read the book. I knew the end. So why am I still so frustrated? It was because this film kept to the heart of the novel and upped the ante. The best part of film adaptations is the ability to breathe life into the story. And that is exactly what Luhrmann did. He used everything at his disposal (great actors, a wonderful individual style, a great script) to make an enticing and heart-wrenching film. He could have easily ruined a classic novel, but I'm glad to report it was far from failed. <br/><br/>So see the film. If not for the crazy beautiful soundtrack, the splendor that is the Luhrmann style, or for the sexy DiCaprio then see it to feel. Hope. Pain. Love. Loss. What I had to realize is that there are two things this story can teach: 1. The world is full of spiteful and cruel people who will crush your spirits and make your hope nonexistent, or 2. Dreamers have to try to make their hopes a reality despite what the outside world says or does to prove them false. We must dream. We must hope. And above all we must try. Begin with this film and then be inspired to embark on the voyage of the dreamer."
"dancergirl19","10","4","9","19 May 2013"," Phenomenal movie! Absolutely brilliant!
","I've read the book and loved it. This a story with a lot of depth and I believe the symbolism is essential to one's overall comprehension of the story. This movie truly depicts these symbols accurately as well as the setting, case in point, the Valley of Ashes, West Egg, the green light etc. I think it can really aid a person in gasping the true concept of the story. Needless to say, it's visually stunning.<br/><br/>The music was a major concern for most people but I have to say, although I'm no Jay Z/Beyonce fan, it works extremely well. The lyrics reflect what is happening and is in sync with the pace and circumstances. The pacing of the film is great and the music adds to the excitement of the roaring 20s so it never feels boring. Luhrmann and the cast/crew made this movie feel contemporary while simultaneously staying faithful to the historical and classical context.<br/><br/>Furthermore, while it highly stylized, the actors put a lot of thought and emotion into their performances. I can tell that a lot of research was done because the cast seemed to really understand the people they were portraying from the inside out. Leonardo DiCaprio was spectacular as was Carey Mulligan (who was a concern for so many people). Mulligan gave insight into Daisy's motivations rather than just portraying her as a flat, weak, shallow woman. She really let us in on what was going on in Daisy's mind and Nick's narration assisted in those revelations. The rest of the cast did brilliantly with their material as well. I have no complaints.<br/><br/>I had goosebumps for the very start to the end of this movie. It was simply that amazing. It has the best of both worlds in terms of style and substance and contemporary and classic. A must see movie. I will say that it is important to keep an open mind and really take some time to think about the issues addressed in this film. I also would not take any negative reviews too seriously. See it or yourself and then be your own judge. It baffles me that some people dislike this masterpiece but to each his own. I think a lot of it had to do with expectations as some people were throw off by Luhrmann's past work. Multiple viewings may help as it contains so much detail. This is a pure and faithful adaptation to timeless novel and I believe that Fitgerald, who was a modern man, would have been proud to see his work of art come to life in a way that's never been done before."
"plectrum-1","9","4","9","18 May 2013"," Great adaptation
","This is a film that really captures the spirit of the source material. If Gatsby is a novel celebrated for above all else the way it's written, this movie is remarkable primarily for the way it's filmed. Like Fitzgerald's intoxicating prose, it's intense, lavish, and vibrant. The aesthetic of almost every shot embodies the glitz of 'the jazz age.' Clever use of music, digital effects and extravagant sets give you all the excitement of the mythical, roaring 20s while managing to avoid giving the impression of seeming 'old fashioned.'<br/><br/>The character of Jay Gatsby is somewhat like Shakespeare's Hamlet - people love to analyse the psychology, background and motivations of the character. There's plenty of mystery and ambiguity for critics to sink their teeth into. The movie intelligently portrays the character and plot, picking up on many of the subtle undertones and ambiguities, even suggesting something cohesive but resisting the temptation to boil it all down to a simple romantic love story. It also captures the overall light-hearted feel of the novel.<br/><br/>There are many details to relish here, like the aerial views of 1920s Manhattan, Carraway's narration (ie. Fitzgerald's prose) woven into the screenplay, beautiful costumes and vintage cars, the performance of the actor who played Tom Buchannan. Probably what I liked most was that many of the striking images from the original novel were preserved where they could so easily have been ignored/discarded - for instance the green light at the end of Daisy's peer, or the TJ Eckleberg billboard overlooking the TS Eliot-esque wasteland. It seems like the screenplay was prepared by someone who genuinely appreciated the novel.<br/><br/>My only real complaint about this film was that they omitted one of my all time favourite sentences from the closing statements of Carraway's narration. ""He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night."""
"Left-Handed_Liz","9","4","9","16 May 2013"," Beautiful adaptation that goes down like champagne
","Although I've only read The Great Gatsby twice, both in school, I connected with it instantly, and it's stuck in my mind ever since, which is something a lot of stories don't get to do. One of the most striking things about it, in my opinion, is how mercurial it is: the ecstasy of a party at Gatsby's mansion lit by fireworks is always measured by a profound sense of loneliness and despair. This is a world where happiness is fleeting and sincerity and truth are rare commodities.<br/><br/>So, with that being my impression of the book, I was thrilled to hear that Baz Luhrman was directing a new film version. Just as predicted, he lets the words of the book literally shine through everything else (as in, they're right there on the screen), and his decadent, hectic style is ideal for the world being depicted. The intro of the film is classic Luhrman, beginning in grainy black and white, before exploding shortly thereafter into tinted newsreels on fast forward, with Jay-Z's rhymes over the images. The party scenes are somewhat reminiscent of his opus, Moulin Rouge, complete with anachronistic music rearranged for a jazz orchestra. One favorite moment was the soundtrack fading from an anachronistic hip-hop/electronic jam, to Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" to accompany a fireworks display. Lana Del Rey is also a perfect fit for the movie's soundtrack, with her bluesy voice and lyrics about sadness in the midst of excess. The fast cuts that Luhrman is so fond of almost have the flickering effect of an old film reel on fast forward in here, and the over-saturation of colors is reminiscent of a black and white photograph with bright pigment added in. More importantly, the novel's visuals carry over much better in film; anybody sick of hearing about the green light while reading may appreciate it better when it's in front of their eyes. <br/><br/>As for the way the source material is treated, the only criticism I can honestly come up with is that, when it comes to past adaptations, i.e. Romeo+ Juliet, while the director kept the source material the same, he tweaked the setting and context of them in a way that made them interesting and new. With his version of Gatsby, he is faithful almost to a fault. Dialogue and narration are borrowed almost word for word, and the voice overs from Tobey Maguire's Nick, while an effective display of Fitzgerald's poetic language, become overbearing, and often redundant. When the audience can see the look in an angered Gatsby's eyes, they can interpret for themselves that he ""looked like he just killed a man."" <br/><br/>While there are some striking visuals in this film, it only feels like a Baz Luhrman picture for the first ten minutes or so. Our introduction to the Buchanans, Myrtle Wilson and her social circle, and to Nick himself play in that fast-paced, cartoonish style that the first half of Moulin Rouge had, which can give you a headache. Not that such a style is advisable for any film's whole running time, but as the story progresses, the film's pace slows down, and it starts to feel more like a mainstream movie than an art film. <br/><br/>In a certain sense there's not a bad thing, if the purpose is to focus on character development or story. But the story, while heavy with themes, is empty of much plot, and the whole point of characters like Daisy, Tom and Jordan is precisely that they ultimately don't have a lot of depth. The film solves this somewhat by imbuing Daisy with more warmth than in the book, and focusing on her relationship with Gatsby. In a strange way, at least for me, it almost became the story of her loss as well. Just as Gatsby is too stuck in the past to move forward, she doesn't see a way to go backward, and the audience sees her fear and uncertainty in everything she does. While ultimately still a shallow, careless person, Carey Mulligan's performance creates such a sweet persona that it's not hard to imagine how men could believe that they're in love with her. What I expected to be the weakest part of the film- the love story and relationships between characters- turned out to be the emotional core of the whole thing.<br/><br/>In addition to the visuals and script, the cast of The Great Gatsby is incredibly strong, embodying iconic characters on a spectrum of competent to amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jay Gatsby conveys both the charismatic showman (complete with an affected New England accent) and the nervous, awkward youth, delusional in his obsession over his lost love. I didn't find anything wrong with Tobey Maguire, except that Nick comes off much more snarky and self-aware in the novel, and here he seems much more naive and swept up in it all, which is supposed to make his eventual depressive state more poignant. As a framing device, it's highly effective, drawing a parallel between F. Scott Fitzgerald's life and the fictional life of his author avatar, which creates a synergy between source and adaptation. The title of the film/book even appears superimposed on the green-lit fog at the end. As a fan of the book and the director, I loved watching it, but I understand why it's so polarizing, since most people tend to dislike one, the other, or both. <br/><br/>The phrase that best sums up The Great Gatsby for me is the old chestnut, ""Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans."" It's a poignant and melancholy story about lost opportunities, and reaching for the moon before realizing how lonely it is at the top. Finally, an eclectic adapter of well-known stories has found a perfect match, in a gilded star-crossed love story with a hollow center that stays in your mind long after it's ended, like a forgotten dream."

That is so absolutely NOT TRUE. Leonardo DiCaprio was wonderful and his interpretation of Gatsby is really interesting and I think well thought out. Carey Mulligan as Daisy is PERFECT! If you thought about it all day, you wouldn't be able to think of a better casting choice. I have just now become a Toby McGuire fan because of this movie and he too was perfect for the part.

"madams552","3","4","9","13 May 2013"," An impossible movie
","It is now apparent that F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel The Great Gatsby does not translate well to the big screen. The acting was perfectly fine but the story, as classic as it may be, can simply not be made into a decent major motion picture. I will say that Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be the actor born to play Gatsby. Even though this is true it still does not make the movie a necessary film to have to be made. This may be the case with many classic novels going to the big screen. Some are done beautifully, but Gatsby is a case that has been attempted many times and every time seems to fall short of capturing the novel's classic allure."
"Mary444","9","4","9","12 May 2013"," Gorgeous, dreamy, and true to the little novel of beautiful prose
","Baz Luhmann hit this one out of the ballpark. I am almost 60 years old and this film was a thing of beauty and joy. It conveyed everything Fitzgerald was trying to say in his dreamy prose. I'd just love for Robert Redford to get together with Baz Luhrmann and Leonardo and chat about their visions interpreting a tiny novel about excess, hedonism, first loves, sacrifice, and Greek tragedy.<br/><br/>Read the novel first. Then watch the 1974 Robert Redford version. Then the TV version. Then this piece of art. You will be so pleased if you do those things in that order.<br/><br/>We read the novel in high school in the early 1970's, and were so excited to see the 1974 Robert Redford version. It was subtle, quiet, sweet, and delicate. Robert Redford conveyed everything about the Gatsby we envisioned. He was perfect. But the actors were generally too old, Tom was displayed as too possessive of this vacuous, simple, childlike creature named Daisy, Daisy got away with being stupid and unworthy, Bruce Dern was meaner than what we thought Tom was, and it did not clearly convey the idea that your can't go back in time, no matter how much you long for those times. <br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann is faithful to the novel and delightfully allows the prose to be read by Nick. Fitzgerald's words dance in your mind. They dance and swirl just like prose should. Just a few words convey colorful, powerful images.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio conveys the magnetism, desire, power, mystery, vulnerability, and pathos of the love-besotted Gatsby. Cary Mulligan is enchanting and beguiling as Daisy. You almost fall for her - until the movie moves along and you realize how empty she is. Her performance is equal or above Mia Farrow's. <br/><br/>Everything about Leonard DiCaprio's performance is perfect. The cocky confidence, craving yearnings, frustrated confusion, and beliefs in first love, are conveyed with perfection. His appearance on the screen just takes your breath away. <br/><br/>Leonardo will probably get Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the tragic Gatsby. Although he isn't really the main actor - it's Toby McGuire as Nick. I think some of the downer reviews are out of frustration as Leonardo isn't on screen as much as Toby and the screen time isn't as much as when he just dominated the screen with brilliant performances in Blood Diamonds, The Departed, Gangs of New York, Titanic, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape. But when Leonardo is on screen - he emotes every nuance of Gatsby.<br/><br/>One more thing about the score - it fits perfectly with conveying the idea of excess. A Benny Goodman score just would not cut it nowadays with conveying the idea of Robber Barron and Prohibition excess. It is well done and JayZ or whatever his name is - is to be commended for blending the roaring 1920's risky music with today's ""risky"" music. Well done!"

The graphics and effects makes It look like it was made in disneyland for disneyland. Nothing in this emotes or references the 1920s. The hair, music, moves, speech and clothing is so far off it is just a caricature of itself.<br/><br/>Fine to watch to laugh at. The adult version will be the goto as a better film.

","I think DiCaprio was only cast as J. Gatsby because of his looks. His affected accent was inconsistent throughout the film. Part southern drawl, part New England, and mostly just DiCaprio made it impossible to focus on any acting he may have been doing. And was he really supposed to look like a young, blond Orson Welles?<br/><br/>I also had a serious problem with the music in the film. Sorry, but there was no rap in the 1920's. Just guessing, but could that be the influence of ""Jay Z."" as a producer? Jazz was just being recognized as music in the early 1920's, and I feel rap was a poor substitution.<br/><br/>The outdoor sets also left something to be desired.

","I won't waste any time here talking about how the style wasn't suited to my personal taste, instead I will talk about the content rather than the way in which it was presented. I think that Baz Luhrmann tried to take a great American story and make it accessible and comprehensible to even the simplest of American teenage girls, and the problem is just that. They walked out of the theater pining for a love like Gatsby and Daisy's. It's almost like the point of the whole story was taken away by the ridiculously written (and delivered) dialogue (don't get me wrong, I love almost all of the actors in this film, there really was just no hope) and the overly embellished and unnecessary direction, and really, everything else. I honestly was wondering what Luhrmann was condoning and what he was being critical of once this movie was over. Maybe it's all a pan and he was really just poking fun at us. Or maybe he really didn't think it through and had washed out the real story to even himself. I also found myself having nostalgia for the old 1974 version with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, something I never thought was possible. Overall, this is a true example of style over substance and not worth the time it takes to watch it unless you think you can be adequately distracted enough by the lush cinematography. Maybe if it was an hour shorter. Maybe."

","This is a film that is a complete triumph of style over content - beautifully produced with absolutely no depth whatsoever. However, I'd go and see it again just for the beauty - both visual and sound. The sets' recreation of the art deco period is absolutely marvellous, and Lurhman's use of the camera to move through space is truly excellent. In addition, trying to show how current jazz was then through the use of modern music was quite inspired.<br/><br/>However, once again, we are stuck with the modern fixation in film and television on having absolutely no characters one can have any empathy, or merely sympathy, with. Gatsby is a totally deluded liar and crook, Carraway is a mere bystander and leech, Daisy is a vapid excuse for a human being who gets upset because someone becomes justifiably angry.<br/><br/>It is clear from the Redford version of the film that at least two of these characters can be made sympathetic, but, as I said above, it doesn't seem to be ""cool"" for film-makers to that any more.

"carlaiacovetti","4","3","6","15 May 2013"," Perhaps I like the book too much...
","Staged debauchery: Luhrmann's three-ring circus on the screen<br/><br/>There's no doubt that writing a screenplay adaptation of a literary masterpiece is a challenge that few can successfully meet. Let me begin this by saying, even though Zack Luhrmann is not the first writer to try and bring Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant literary classic, The Great Gatsby to life on the screen, he gave it a decent and somewhat impressive attempt. In typical Luhrmann style, he gives the classic story a modern spin, and while it is somewhat entertaining, it does not always translate well.<br/><br/>Somewhere amidst the overproduced, 3-D jazz-age extravaganza, it is easy to become weary with the incessant parading of bobbles, bangles and beads, unremitting decadence, and the brash circus of visual effects. Luhrmann sticks closely to Fitzgerald's storyline, with the exception of the beginning, where Nick Carraway, the author's proxy checks into a psychiatric clinic to deal with his alcoholism, anger, fear, rage, despondency, depression and a list of emotional responses that are reflective of his disappointment with life as he knows it. Even so, Luhrmann's interpretation of Fitzgerald's parallel worlds where he reveals not just the theme of hindered young love between a man and woman (Daisy and Gatsby), but the ultimate out-of-control corruption of the American dream, leaving gallant morality behind is inadequately translated. Admittedly, Luhrmann captures ""the parties,"" and obsession with extreme excess perfectly, however<br/><br/>If visual impression and panache are the measure by which we rate a good film, then I suspect Luhrmann would rank a bit higher for the effort, for his over-the-top cinematic production, with the elaborate costumes and sets define the word ""excessive."" However, given the fact that much of this film takes place in and out of excess, it becomes somewhat distracting, and certainly is a far cry from a story set in the 1920's. One of the things that Luhrmann does have going for him is that this kind of gaudy excess is precisely how Fitzgerald describes the decadence and moral corruption of that era.<br/><br/>In all fairness, I think this story is difficult to translate over to film. Why have all of these adaptations flopped? The novel is genius—there is no doubt about that, but there are problems with this newest version of The Great Gatsby. The actors are certainly well suited, and especially Leonardo DiCaprio. He did a wonderful job of portraying the heartsick, obsessively intent, mysterious Jay Gatsby.<br/><br/>In the novel, Fitzgerald purposefully delays letting the reader know the ""real"" story behind Gatsby's wealth, and why he weekly throws opulent parties at his mansion. In fact, it is the mystery itself about Gatsby's wealth and his life that drives the plot forward in the novel. Luhrmann reveals some of Gatsby's secrets early on, which tend to take the suspense away, and leave the audience feeling like we're attending one reckless, obscene, indulgent event after another.<br/><br/>Another ongoing issue in the film is that Luhrmann has characters ""explaining"" the action instead of ""showing"" us the action, i.e., like Carraway explaining to the audience the history and reasons behind Gatsby's motivation. You see, in a novel, using exposition to unveil history and a character's past is paramount, but it is something that should never be done in a film. Perhaps the fact that The Great Gatsby covers numerous weighty and complex ideas makes it difficult to adequately capture in a two-hour film. By the end of this film, I felt exhausted and unsatisfied. The heart of the story itself is somehow lost among the rubble of overproduced excess. It is ridiculously ironic, since the novel addresses the corruption of the American dream, by comparing and contrasting newly fortuned millionaires of the 1920's against old aristocracy. Fitzgerald is very intent on revealing the ostentatious, gaudy, crude lifestyles of the newly rich as being socially and morally repugnant. Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and Tom (Joel Edgerton) Buchanan represent pieces of the old aristocracy, and this is not emphasized in Luhrmann's adaptation. Because the emphasis is lost, the audience only gets tidbits of those important details that should amalgamate the characters to the plot and ultimately drive the plot forward.<br/><br/>So, once again, it's not the choice of actors, they were fineIt's the script and the way it was directed. There's a lot of flash, but no real depth—the audience is left feeling hung-over from the 2-hour debauchery and three-ring circus held at the great Gatsby's ""castle."""

","This is a spectacular story...(done well by Robert Redford's portrayal of Gatsby all those years ago when he was gorgeous!). Leonardo DiCaprio stood out and was impressive (gosh he's good!) and that's the only reason this movie was worth my time. OK, yes, it was pretty to look at when you were in the party scenes but I have to say, the music was way too distracting for me. How can you take such a loved novel and put in today's type of music and think it's cool? There were times where the music was better because it was ""period"" music. But frankly, when you get into rap or hip hop in a movie that takes place in the 20's, that's corny to me. It took me away from the storyline into thinking it was a concession to the music moguls who were part of this production. I also laughed at some of the dancing girl scenes, wondering if some of those dance moves were done in that time! (Maybe they were and Beyonce, et al, are just copycats!). All in all, it came off as corny to me and I'd tell folks to wait for the video and read the book or see Redford's version. Gosh, I hope this director doesn't take on Gone With The Wind!"

","I really enjoy Baz's other films, Strictly Ballroom being my favorite, because of the music. This one had good points, but the way it was done...the first 30-45 minutes seemed wasted on one big party that felt like a drunken fest. That may have been the intent, but I found it boring waiting for the story to start. The music choices didn't fit the times and really felt out of place instead of adding to the show. They were very distracting. It's fun to try new things, but in this case it didn't work. The visuals were rich, the cast great (though by the end Toby's narration was both droll and his voice annoying). If the music were better it's one of those things that could have changed everything, but between trying to find the story past all the alcohol and trying to enjoy/feel the show but getting pulled out by the music, I just couldn't love this one.

","After watching every movie, I always ask myself if I could have lived without watching it. Sadly, for The Great Gatsby, this is definitely the case. Having only basic knowledge of the original text, I cannot imagine that this vision would be accepted by the author. However, I am reviewing purely the movie.<br/><br/>The visuals are clever, but ultimately cluttered and unpleasant to view at times. The dialogue, whilst supposed to be snappy, ends up being rushed, to the point that it all descends to white noise. As such, your interest will quickly wane. The party scenes are so chaotic and 'oh-so edgy' that it is almost insulting to the era. It's very much The Clockwork Orange Lastly, and if you do not bother with any of the above, hip-hop and dance music infects the movie throughout.

","to put aside of the badly scripted screenplay, the over-the-top directing, the exaggerated acting, the dizzy and fuzzy camera handling, the not-too-good editing, the pretentious costumes and so on, the casting, in my opinion, was one of the worst casting jobs since movie was invented. none of the actors and the actresses in this film looked appropriately enough to justify the vivid characters in the novel. three actors, Tobey Maguire, Joel Edgerton and Adelaide Clemens, were just so obviously all wrong cast. among these three, Tobey Maguire was the worst of the worst, because his facial feature, especially his thin lips, his funny mouth shape and his physical compositions; too short limbs and small boyish size, simply impossible to match the Nick Carraway role in the least. Joel Edgerton squeezed together features simply couldn't reflect tom buchanan's filthy rich and cunning role. and Adelaide Clemens, just alike Tobey Maguire, just like a childish, not mature enough actor to match Catherine in the novelette. of course they are all good even great actors, but just not good enough and appropriate enough to play these three roles. they should have declined to sign on for these three roles in the first place, because they just looked out of the place in this movie and made me feel sorry and embarrassed for them."

"GenericBadGuy","3","3","7","30 July 2013"," What's with the excessive use of green screen old sport
","First things first, I have to start off by saying I'm not a fan of The Great Gatsby book. In actual fact it is the worst book I have ever read. The characters, with the exception of Tom, are bland and boring and the story is uninspired and predictable. I'm also not a fan of the 1974 Robert Redford version of the story. While I can say Luhrmann's attempt is better than the Redford version, it still by no means makes it a good film. However, that said I did go into The Great Gatsby with an open mind, and I don't think it helped one bit.<br/><br/>I'll get the good things out of the way first. The soundtrack is good for the most part with songs by Jay-Z, Goyte and Nero. The best song however was an already existing song by Flux Pavilion called I Can't Stop. Shame the scene it was used in is the most headache inducing scene in the entire film. Joel Edgerton's performance as Tom and Jason Clarke as George are good, however these are the only good performances in the film. Finally, the way Luhrmann decided to tell the story by sending Nick to a doctor/psychiatrist about his experiences with Gatsby I thought, at first, was quite clever. However, in classic Luhrmann fashion, he finds a way to ruin one of the few things he has going for the film by getting Nick to write The Great Gatsby book. And it's all downhill from there.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby has it's fair share of major problems. Possibly the most glaring problem of The Great Gatsby is the over use of green screen. This wouldn't bother me if the green screen was used in moderation or if it was used stylistically like in 300 or Sin City. While you could argue that Luhrmann uses it stylistically in some scenes, but when it is used for the backdrop for the scenes set at George's garage is down right unacceptable. What makes this worse is that all the jewels in the movie are 100% real and cost million upon million of dollars/pounds. Another glaring flaw of the movie is the iffy acting. DiCaprio as the illusive Gatsby isn't horrible and if he improved his accent, his performance might be passable. However, with the accent he went with does nothing but stain his performance. Also this might be just me but I thought DiCaprio would have been a better Nick than he was a Gatsby. Mulligan is even worse, there is nothing redeemable about her whining performance as Daisy. This just isn't acceptable as Mulligan is a great actress. Don't believe, just watch Drive. The person who play Jordan, Elizabeth Debick, wasn't good either and if she does have acting talent, you wouldn't know it from watching this train wreck. But the worst offender bar non is Maguire, but then again, that isn't a surprised as he wasn't that good in the Spider-man films either. <br/><br/>Overall, The Great Gatsby is the worst movie I have seen at the cinemas this year. The over use of green screen, the iffy acting and the stupid choices made by Luhrmann. I might be able to recommend this to fans of the book, but to fans of good movies, I would look elsewhere, preferably not another Baz Luhrmann film though."
"goat_nation","3","3","7","23 June 2013"," Terrible
","I came into the movie with low expectations, holding a glimmer of hope that it would exceed them...it did not.<br/><br/>It is a typical Baz Luhrmann film that overplays, over-thinks and overstates meaningless plot and cringe worthy scenes. It was a movie that should not have gone for 142 minutes (I would have been happy if it was done and dusted in an hour). The only reason that kept me in the cinema was for the girl who I was seeing that night.<br/><br/>I can't stand Tobey Maguire as an actor, that view did not change. I also did not care for Leonardo DiCaprio's overuse of the term 'old sport', It made me hate the movie more and more as it went on, and the ending to the movie was the only highlight (so I could get the hell out of there). <br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and I dare say to go find something more useful to do than waste 2 hours of your life."
"bm2759","5","3","7","5 June 2013"," Looks and sounds great with a boring story
","Baz Luhrmann's films each have a distinct visual and aural quality to them. We are witness to vibrant colours, sweeping camera movements, sudden zooming in, and mystery which is supporting by a suitable soundtrack. These features translate well into the 1920's setting to transport the viewer into a bygone era. However despite all these positives even they cannot make a really long, slow and dull story any more watchable. <br/><br/>You may argue with me that I don't understand the story. I admit I haven't read the book and went into this completely unaware of what will occur; from what I've read this film is the closest to translate the book into a film correctly. That being said my impression of the metaphors and underlying meanings is a satire of the 1920's; i.e. too much drinking and partying, people talk rubbish, the wealthy have more money than sense, you can't recapture the past, parties are a ruse, and not a lot of meaningful activities occurred (this is what I left the cinema thinking about). That being said I didn't enjoy the story or the characters and was never convinced really liked, cared for or loved each other (which I understood as an intention of the author). Therefore if I understand the story correct then this is one of the most overrated stories (and novels) I've ever encountered. Why is it so memorable? <br/><br/>Praise must be given to the use of modern music instead of jazz as it is a clever juxtaposition. Most of us don't enjoy jazz music like those in the film do; we enjoy modern music mostly and its use bridges the gap between us. Therefore we understand how they feel and the parties which ensue. All actors involved were convincing in their roles but no-one here stood out. One thing I did notice was Nick Carraway mentioned several times that Gatsby was the most hopeful person he'd met. We never really saw his hope because he was both cool and calm, scared, worried or lashing out. This is either a failure of the script or a translation of the author's intentions.<br/><br/>I applaud those involved for at least making this film watchable for the visual and aural aspects. This almost makes up for a long, slow and dull story."
"blanche-2","9","3","7","31 May 2013"," a visual feast
","Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Great Gatsby"" in this 2013 version of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, where the rich are different from you and me. The film also stars Toby Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Elizabeth DiBicki, and Isla Fisher.<br/><br/>Directed by Baz Luhrmann, with costume design by his wife, Catherine Martin, the production is an absolute feast for the eyes, brilliantly beautiful, exaggerated, over the top, and spectacular. The big screen is the only place to see it. The lavishness represents the '20s atmosphere, and I noticed that some of the female party performers were cast according to the look back then - bigger legs, curvier, which is correct for the time period. There was the flat flapper look back then as well which was also represented. Luhrmann again uses the conceit of anachronistic music. It didn't bother me in Moulin Rouge, and it didn't bother me here.<br/><br/>I'm an old timer, so I saw the 1974 version on the screen not once, but twice, because a friend of mine returned from Europe and hadn't seen it. Since it was extremely heavily publicized, he wanted to, so I went again.<br/><br/>I'm unclear as far as what people's memories of it are -- some people on IMDb seem to think it was a great classic. That isn't how I remember it, either seeing it or in the reviews. Robert Redford was terrible, too cerebral, and Mia Farrow was worse. It was a beautiful looking film, and it had Sam Waterston as Nick, who got the only good reviews. His performance completely stomps on the miscast Toby Maguire's here. Luhrmann's instinct, to cast both Daisy and Jay as very youthful and fresh, flopped when it came to casting Nick. As the narrator, he needs to be more mature and less homespun.<br/><br/>Both Mulligan and DiCaprio had an innocence in their performances, with DiCaprio giving a real powerhouse performance, embodying the idea of hopefulness, passion, illusion, and desperation. And he looks spectacular.<br/><br/>I haven't yet seen my perfect Daisy. It's not Mulligan, though she's a good actress and gave Daisy a naiveté and a frailty. Mia Farrow captured the airhead part, which was emphasized in that film, and she had the beauty. I guess I never felt that either one was portraying a southern girl during that period. I thought Joel Edgerton made an effective Tom.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann is a visual genius, and I love his films, going back to Strictly Ballroom. I felt here he was fairly reverent when it came to the material and if it was a touch over the top, it certainly makes for a theater-going experience. The emphasis here is on the mystery of who Gatsby is, but he doesn't neglect the poignancy and the message of the piece. The rich are different from you and me."

","As someone who did not read the books, I had no idea what to expect knowing little of The great Gatsby. However, finally sitting down in my tattered red chair of the local regal cinema I found the Great Gatsby was a bizarre and ugly story displaying the worst nightmare of human qualities such as, greed, corruption, selfishness, vanity and an ugly grotesque vision of the top 1%.<br/><br/>This is not a review for The Great Gatsby book lovers nor the disillusioned self minded individuals who wish to live the life of fancy excess. This is a review of the working class who, like me, sat uncomfortably and disgusted gawking at the mesmerized audience hypnotically drawn into the movie's illustrious fantasy. <br/><br/>The Great Gatsby was about the life of a young stock broker who specialized in bonds living off the city of New York. His humble small cottage was placed in between 2 massive mansions, one which was next to this ever-popular, but mysterious person who went by the name of Gatsby. Gatsby threw parties, big parties. Unimaginable, fantastic, unreal parties that in 3D, was actually a treat to see. What was not a treat to see however, were the lives of these unnaturally rich individuals who seemed to be living the American pipe dream.<br/><br/>I was not sitting inside a luxurious dream as so many people thought to be watching but more of a surreal reality of current life in America. As we live in a decade were the top 1% own more than 50% of the wealth, and the divorce rate is a staggering 50%, the movies peak into the top 1% disgusted my inside guts and made my stomach turn and veins fill with venom. My experience going to the exclusive clubs of Washington DC found more resemblance in this movie due to the douchbaggery and sick selfish twisted minds that so many of these people have. Why try glorify it by applauding the movie's excessive taste of life and champagne. Albeit, I understand its a fiction book and therefore a fiction movie, but I cannot help but realize the inside of my guts turning as I watch the audience approving and glorifying the character's poor choices and swallowing the dreams and fantasy to become or be with someone like them.<br/><br/>To be fair, there are some love elements to the movie and the most spectacular use of 3D I have seen seen used, yet those have been dwarfed by the amount of disgust this movie's corruptive and selfish nature manifests itself in."
"rooee","5","3","7","28 May 2013"," A dizzying dance, dramatically dead
","It's disconcerting to see an actor working at a different level to those around him, but that's what's happening in Baz Luhrman's shiny plastic adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's seminal novel. Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in the title role is one of range, detail, and pure star power - but Luhrman isn't able to up his game to match it. The director's trademark restless camera movement and hack 'n' slash editing works well for a while, when the party's in full swing. Fast forward two hours and the drama surrounding the maelstrom at the film's centre is inert.<br/><br/>This is a tragedy of the human condition filmed as a overwrought teenage love story. A love story depends on its central pairing, but the partnership between Daisy (Carey Mulligan, too often recalling her performance in Steve McQueen's Shame) and Gatsby never convinces - we're told of their love but it is never apparent, in reality, memory, or fantasy.<br/><br/>There are some fantastic individual scenes, pick of which would be Gatsby's ostentatious teatime reunion with Daisy. And as one would expect the party setups suitably capture the lust and excess of the period, with anachronistic rhythms from Jay-Z, which complement and aggravate in equal measure. But in the end the film failed to engage me on an emotional level, through no fault of the lead actor. This is a pity because it's a story that will, sadly, never not be relevant."

","With big names like Leanordo De Caprio and Tobey Maguire, one must expect an amazing movie experience based on a good book, sadly, this is not the case. the film was suppose to be a Romantic Drama, however, it lacked in both Romance and Drama. for starters, it failed to capture the love between Jay and Daisy, not a lot of light shed on their previous relationship, i really could not care less if she went back to Jay or not, in fact, i felt that Jay Gatsby is a wife stealing creep. the pace of the film was another problem, it was super slow, and dragged at times giving a feeling of boredom. there were also some technical problems with direction of the film, the sound editing was poor and several clips has poor synchronized sound to picture especially when characters are speaking.<br/><br/>Leaonardo's acting was also below his usual in my opinion, i felt like he just didn't live the role, something was missing this time in his performance, every time he said "" Old Sport "" it felt fake and obvious acting !! Tobey Maguire was better, and Carey Mulligan was OK.<br/><br/>the biggest problem is that the story seemed shallow and empty, mainly because of the lack of the sense of Drama and the feel of the spark or the obsessional love of Jay toward Daisy, i think the film failed to capture that. add to that a slow boring pace and it just failed to ignite. they even had to spell the words on the screen in certain clips to make the viewers understand,i mean literally they had words typed on the screen like some sort of stylish direction, if i wanted to read i would have bought book !<br/><br/>some of the positives were the costumes and set designs were perfect for a 1920s period. the music was also energetic and fun.<br/><br/>So to summarize, a slow, boring shallow and empty film with nice set designs and costume designs, nice music, decent acting."

","Those who like the director's quixotic approach will no doubt have enjoyed this film, but to me it seemed incoherent and lacking character development. The only genuine character seems to be Nick Carraway; everyone else, including Gatsby, seems a caricature, not a real person. I was immediately annoyed by the thumping rap music which Luhrmann inserted, instead of using original 1920s music, presumably to appeal to younger audiences. The whole effect of this was to remove realism and inject surrealism - it just didn't work. Similarly, the surreal rapid close-ups didn't add anything meaningful either. When watching this film, the whole impression was not one of following the storyline of a great novel, but rather of being constantly bombarded by a mosaic of incoherent and haphazard images, without any clear context. Gatsby seemed to be a nonentity, just a pawn in some mysterious chess game completely outside his control. Di Caprio, a superb actor at his best, was simply not given the opportunity to show his talents and develop the character; he muddled his way through the role as best he could. Carey Mulligan was awkward and unconvincing as Daisy. Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton clearly came out as the best actors - Maguire was particularly impressive as the dazzled Carraway. <br/><br/>In summary, I didn't feel that this movie was the right vehicle for Luhrmann, who is more suited to direct fantasies than screen adaptations of great novels. His visual pyrotechnics failed to impress me."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","7","15 May 2013"," Flawed Start, Beautiful Second Half
","The Great Gatsby (2013)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann's updating of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel doesn't needs its plot explained but I must admit that I've never quite experienced a film like it. I say this because I watch a lot of movies and most of them are either great, good, fair or poor. The strange thing about this movie is that the first hour is downright bad but like a miracle the second half is pretty much a masterpiece. I've never witnessed a film that managed to do such great things after getting off to a bad start. With Luhrmann you know that he's going to bring his own vision to the screen and for the first hour this style, fashion and glamor pretty much take over the story so much so that you really can't see any of the classic novel there. It seems that Luhrmann's main goal is to show off this CGI New York of the 1920s and the various ways that he can shoot a party sequence. I found these things to be rather boring and over-the-top to the point where there wasn't a need in called this The Great Gatsby as they pretty much could have just made a separate film about the Jazz Era. Even stranger is that I didn't care for Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire or Carey Mulligan during these early scenes. The only actor who can survive the crazy style was Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan.<br/><br/>Then, the really strange thing happened. When Daisy (Mulligan) is invited over for tea and has her encounter with Gatsby (DiCaprio) it's a rather magnificent scene full of romance, drama, tension and a bittersweet laugh. From this point on the film settles down with the style and turns to telling its story and this is where the greatness shines. Whereas the actors were buried in the style and CGI of the first half, now they're able to really show their talents and each of the four main ones fit into their roles perfectly. DiCaprio is wonderful as Gatsby as he just has a certain look in his eye that manages to show off the character's rage and passion at all times. Maguire looks really bad in the first half because of non-stop stupid facial gestures that the director makes him do but once he can ""act"" he does a great job. Mulligan perfectly captures the spirit and look of the 1920s Jazz period and I thought she fit the role just fine. Edgerton is the real standout and does a masterful job with his role. The music score, the much hyped music score, isn't nearly as distracting as one thought it would be but it doesn't mix well with the over-the-top style.<br/><br/>If you walked into this version an hour late you'd walk out feeling as if you've seen one of the best movies of the year. The second half of the picture really grabs you up in the terrific acting and the wonderful story and there's no question that the passion and haunted jealously of the characters really come to life. The final sequence inside the hotel room where all hell breaks loose is something truly thrilling to watch. With that said, you still have to wonder why Buhrmann would slow things down during the second half. For the life of me I can't understand why he ruined the first half with the non-stop style only to end it and let the story do its power. The final 80-minutes of the picture are excellent and would be Best Picture material but you still can't overlook or forget the flawed beginning."

Alcohol was illegal, morals were looser, women had their hair and skirts shorter and there was the haves (Rich) and the have-nots (Poor). It was all good for a moment and then just like that...it was all gone. So, strictly speaking, if you got yourself into the world of Fitzgerald with his third book that came out in 1925, ""The Great Gatsby"" (I know I have), then you wait and see what Gatsby has in store for you. By Gatsby, I do mean Baz Luhrmann, that visionary wild genius who brought us ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Moulin Rouge"", brings us ""The Great Gatsby"", but in a way you haven't even visualized it before with the use of mind-blowing 3D. Teaming up with his frequent collaborators, co-writer Craig Pearce and Luhrmann's wife Catherine Martin (who does the film's wonderful production design and lavish costumes), he gives us a ""Gatsby"" that may not be in your head, but it's everything that we wanted to see and more. Also, he frames the story differently but remains true to the spirit and the words of what Fitzgerald was writing about in the book. (They literally leap off the page and into the screen.) The narrator/observer of the story is Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a 29-year-old man who buys a house on West Egg, Long Island, New York (which was actually shot in Australia) while working as a bondsman on Wall Street. Set in the summer of 1922 during ""The Jazz Age"", Nick gets himself caught up in this whole new world where booze, partying and sex were not prohibited. One day, he gets invited to a party run by his next-door neighbor Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Turns out that this Gatsby has a lot of secrets. Are the rumors (German spy, war hero, killer) even true about him? Nick warms up to him a little bit, as Gatsby wants something special to complete his perfect world. Meet Nick's second cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). Gatsby has a strong connection to her, as he wants to continue with their relationship that happened five years ago, when she was a rich blossom and he was a poor soldier. Turns out though, she's married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), a racist and sleazy snob who cheats on her with a mistress named Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) whose husband George (Jason Clarke from ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and TV's ""Brotherhood"") is an auto mechanic. Once Gatsby and Daisy's relationship starts to bloom, it's all starts to go downhill, which leads to events and secrets that are...quite unexpected. ""The Great Gatsby"" has something to ask us: Does it look and feel modern, while remaining true to the time period? The answer is yes. Absolutely, yes. What Luhrmann does, amazingly in my opinion, is to combine the world of jazz into the world of hip-hop with help from rap star Jay-Z (who is one of the executive producers of this movie as well as contributing 4 songs to the soundtrack). It all connects somehow, purely anachronistically weird to put modern music in during the summer of 1922, but it works. The brilliant soundtrack also gets help from Beyonce, Andre 3000, Fergie, Sia, will.i.am, Florence + The Machine, Lana Del Rey, the xx, Bryan Ferry, Emeli Sande, Nero, Gotye and the perfect use of Jack White's cover of U2's ""Love Is Blindness"". As a fan of Luhrmann, I loved that he uses the images that were in the book and turned them into something magical. Images like the green light, Gatsby's yellow Rolls-Royce and the blue sign with the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg will stay with you forever. Plus, the cast is phenomenal. DiCaprio makes a great Gatsby, for sure. He keeps it cool and calm, and there's a fantastic scene in which this Gatsby ultimately snaps at Tom while trying to defend Daisy's honor. Mulligan is a great Daisy, she's a sweet girl on the inside without a doubt, on the outside she's emotionally fragile. Maguire still keeps his boyish charm and gives such a terrific performance as Nick. Edgerton is appropriately sleazy as Tom, Isla Fisher carries some emotions and high spirits in her small role as Myrtle and Clarke has some moments that will ultimately break your heart as George. Also, a wonderful newcomer from Austraila, Elizabeth Debicki is beautifully gorgeous as Jordan Baker and Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan is a solid Meyer Wolfsheim, breaking through the walls of typecasting. ""The Great Gatsby"" is another golden experience from Luhrmann, a endearingly tragic love story at the core of it, but at the same time, there is also some social commentary going on there too. It's the perfect summer escape from all the superhero movies and action films that are coming out at the movies throughout the summer. It's a wild, enthralling and captivating romantic drama that glows with moments of sheer enchantment. See it in 3D, as Jordan Baker would say: ""It kinda takes your breath away."" Fitzgerald would've been proud for sure."

","9.5/10 I went to see The Great Gatsby because Leonardo DiCaprio was there and he is a great actor who appears in many great films and it was MORE than worth it! The music, the New York 20's look scenes which left me wanting to live in those times, the parties they showed, the ACTING. I loved it all and I was completely engrossed in it, as also the people in the theater since everybody was quiet when the whole theater was absolutely FULL of people! Not a sound from the audience was heard! I could feel everybody entertained as I was and I cried like a little baby in the end because I was that into the movie and it was so tragic. <br/><br/>I just loved it, DiCaprio was an incredible Gatsby and the movie I found it so emotional and meaningful, it made me regret so much not paying attention when I was reading the book of The Great Gatsby in high school.I would only think why a person would criticize this movie is because they are going there with a goal set in their mind to compare it with the book and the old film and criticize it when it doesn't have an SPECIFIC detail that the book or old film had. If you do that, you sadly won't appreciate it as much as I did or fully enjoy it, my advice is go to the theater and don't expect anything from the book or old film, if you do that, be ready to be OVERWHELMED by how beautiful the film is! My boyfriend and I went there knowing the full story but not the details completely of the book and old film so we didn't compare the movie to anything, we just went there to enjoy it, and for us it was an amazing work of art! GO SEE IT! what are you waiting for?!"

","A visually stunning version of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, a precious gem of a movie. The Great Gatsby portrays with great clarity and intelligence that real life is full of inherently compelling drama and suspense.

"vincentga","1","2","4","3 January 2016"," The World of Rich
","The perfect world for the rich exist. This is the Capitalist. When you have money you can do anything. Commit murder, make slave work, hold all the media of the planet and make propaganda you want. For example, to say that it is a Capitalist is a democracy and that all are equal. Which is completely false.<br/><br/>But the rich are affected by the two (at least) greatest mental illnesses that exist: Lies and Greed. With both diseases the rich do whatever they want. And in this world what Capitalist are not diseases are the two main human qualities.<br/><br/>The People like them as Gods. The people have the same ""qualities"" that rich except it has no money. But he dreams of one day be like them and to be able to do everything. To crush others and to be applauded for doing so.<br/><br/>The film ""The Great Gatsby"" (2013) is just another propaganda film to show combines the rich are good. And the people are too stupid to find that the rich squander fortunes for fun - free since they pay neither taxes nor other things (these are the greatest experts of illusions ""giving $ 1 for one side save face and stealing millions from the other side well hidden) - while millions of people on the planet is starving.<br/><br/>The only thing ""great"" for the rich are their bank accounts. And even greater is their greed. These are black holes that absorb all the money in the world and will never be useless if not to satisfy their mental illness: Greed.<br/><br/>Ironically we take millionaires to play the role of a billionaire. And The People venerate them. This is quite normal because, for example, the United States, it ""educates"" (it's more of brainwashing) from birth, the people to venerate money and the rich. And tell them that all are equal, and that by working honestly and hard they can become a millionaire too. This is completely false because to be rich you have to be a liar, greedy, dishonest, hypocritical, sold, selfish, narcissistic, self-centered, etc. In short the ""qualities"" that encourages Capitalist.<br/><br/>Do you like the rich and their ""history"" (always the same, always based on lies)? Well this film is for you. If you are smart (0.0000000000000001% of the population) do not waste your time with this other rich propaganda film."
"veronicapranjic","6","2","4","29 May 2015"," Beautiful to look at...but not much else.
","The cinematography and costimography are beautiful. The houses,the clothes,the parties...it all gives you that ""good"" feeling when you watch it. It's style. Over substence. I felt that dialogue is only something that is in-between lavish parties. Luhrmann in his style put the accent and more thought in the way movie should look and how lavish parties should be than the real story and what that story means. The thing you will remember after you watch the movie is style. The story? I never felt that Luhrnamm thought about that much. Toby McGuire is widely miscast as Nick. To make it worse they totally changed Nick. In the movie he ended up in sanatorium and is telling the story to the doctor but because of this we can not trust his judgement and what he tells us about people he is talking about.The characters never impress and never seem that much relevant or complexed. It is like they are merely figures put in the grand clothes and grand houses. Di Caprio as Gatsby was good but the problem is that there was more focus on parties and houses and music(I'll get to that later) to appreciate the characters fully. He made the best he could from an underwritten script and role. I never fully felt that Gatsby is such a grand,mysterious but at the same time complexed character. It was all said in the build-up prior to seeing him for the first time but once that happens there is not much excitement.Carey was OK as Daisy but didn't impress that much.Again the focus wasn't on the characters that much so that's a part of problem. Now-the music. Just another proof how Luhrmann didn't wanna make a faithful adaption of the novel that will actually get a point of the story but a blockbuster. A soundtrack is a bold,original move but distracts from the feeling that these are gold 20's. It is even disturbing to watch a party that was supposed to be in the 20's and hear Jay-Z raping.There is some kind of a mix in some songs(will.i.am's Bang Bang or Fergie's ""A little Party"") between jazz and modern and while that's interesting it's a prime proof of what Luhrmann was going at.A loud,sparkly,flashy movie that is remembered primarly for that.Luhrmann uses his ""the more the better"" rule and puts all the attention to the parties while nothing comes out of a story. When you look under the surface this movie is bland and empty and gives no impression when it comes to storytelling and the characters. I like the scene where Gatsby throws his clothes down at the bed. It was beautifully shot. Also,Lana Del Rey's ""Young and beautiful"" captures the character of Daisy and I'll give a plus for that. But the soundtrack should have been made of primarly 20's music-not putting modern music in the movie-it detracts from the feeling that this is set in the 20's. Overall,I'll give it 6/10 simply for the visual beauty of the movie,a good build-up for Gatsby- shots of his back only,""Mr.Gatsby does not exist"",""You must know Gatsby""...etc. and a good songs from soundtrack-but for TODAY'S WORLD."
"mariacorderolovesu","9","2","4","5 April 2015"," Great Movie.
","I just got done reading the book, so first of all I would like to give my opinion on the movie compared to the book. Just like every movie that is based on a book, it is missing several key points of the story. But it still portrays the story amazingly well.<br/><br/>As a movie, it is a perfectly made movie. It has the perfect combination of a classic movie and a modern movie. Although the music on this movie is not my style, it represents the modern generation. And in my opinion, there is so much to learn from the story, depending on the person's point of view. The cast was better than what I expected, especially Leonardo DiCaprio since he did a wonderful job on his role as Gatsby. There is no other actor I would picture as Gatsby. I also loved the fact they incorporated all the crazy things that were happening around the 1920's, like jazz and the sky-rocketing stocks. I personally enjoyed this movie and it helped me understand some parts of the book I did not understand at first."
"justin-ismond","4","2","4","8 August 2014"," unimpressive
","As I watched this film I kept asking myself why I should care about these characters. Because this guy is rich? That seems like the only point to this movie. What are the stakes? The story of the little kid who wants to be someone is more interesting than the characters that keep parading around flaunting wealth while the film tries to distract with the visuals and awkward soundtrack. I found myself wishing for something besides partying and how great it must be to be rich white people. There is no depth to anyone in this film, it is more like a long music video for vapid pop music on the radio - real lowest common denominator stuff, all filler and no substance. Unlike other viewers who dislike the film, I never read the book so I watched with an open mind (I also really like romeo and Juliet from the same director, so I had some hope). <br/><br/>The music made no sense, at one moment its all jay z then the next it is period music. How about a little consistency? <br/><br/>The only good thing about the film is when it actually tries to tell a story instead of gratuitous partying."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","5","2","4","2 August 2014"," captures the opulence but little else
","A magnificent and beautiful film to watch, The Great Gatsby captures the opulence but little else.<br/><br/>I purposely did not reread the book prior to watching the movie, having last read it some ten years ago, wanting to give Baz Luhrmann as much leniency toward a successful interpretation as possible.<br/><br/>Even still, I recalled dialogue and characters torn from the book and it sounded wrong. The storyline is simplified into a doomed and tragic love story when it is, in fact, more complex. I recall traveling with Nick Carraway to the parties, at first drunk by the wealth and extravagance. But, then, like Nick, disillusioned as the characters' true faults become clearer as you are able to see past their lavish lifestyles, all the while feeling like an outsider due to the social divide.<br/><br/>This growth is virtually nonexistent in the Baz Luhrmann invention.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, captured the vulnerability and desperate desire for love without becoming some feeble caricature. Though I recall disliking Daisy because she was indecisive, self-absorbed and therefore almost seemed manipulatively aware of the trouble she centers. Mulligan is the only one who produces a fully thought out character; all other characters from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel are shells. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is an arrogant brute throwing his stature and prestige around, but there is little else. Tobey Maguire does a good job as a narrator but his Nick Carraway is half-formed; pliable and weak instead of easy-going and optimistic though slightly naïve. Jay Gatsby and Leonardo DiCaprio are mystifying, but not the ruthless man, startlingly, unwaveringly obsessive toward attaining what he wishes.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes are engrossing, intoxicating and wonderfully garish and I find reason enough to watch the film once. The music is fun and modern yielding a transportive film. It is a great story, great film, but not the one F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for more reviews!"
"melcher-2001","8","2","4","26 April 2014"," Getting it Right
","I was somewhat put off by the over-the-top trailers that made this version of ""Gatsby"" look as if it were in the style of a Busby Berkeley musical. Having recently reread the book it was difficult for me to envision the narrative with singers and chorus lines. I'd had mixed reactions to Baz Luhrmann's previous films, really enjoying his ""Romeo and Juliet"" while ""Moulin Rouge"" pretty much left me in the cold. <br/><br/>Finally I got around to watching it over HBO on a big screen television and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Of the various versions I've seen, including the 1949 version with Alan Ladd and the 2000 version with Robert Redford, I think this one captures the true spirit of the novel. Ironically the very qualities that had initially put me off are what made it work for me.<br/><br/>Essentially, Fitzgerald's novel embodies the Great American Fairytale. Instead of following the conventions of a period drama Luhrmann, by making use of over-the-top digital technology and a highly exaggerated color palate catapults us into a world of dreams that echoes the overblown expectations of the period that Scott Fitzgerald was portraying. One can readily see the imprint of the Gold Diggers movies of the 30's, the heightened criminality of the prohibition years and the hopeful delusions of a boom that preceded the great crash. Every frame of the movie virtually explodes with the tensions of an intoxicated dream, and this is exactly what Fitzgerald intended to convey in his tale of 'the most hopeful man' his narrator Nick Carroway ever met. <br/><br/>DiCaprio, Mulligan and Maguire are perfect fits for the characters of Gatsby, Daisy and Carroway, able to convey the romantic earnestness of people who are somewhat lost and bewildered by the world in which they find themselves. The most important characters are those of time and place, the vision of a city living in extremes, evoked by the bright furies of Time Square, the devastated wastelands of a Brooklyn slum and the feudal glories of Long Island. <br/><br/>Best of all, there are the most beautiful passages from the book itself, flashed across the screen like the letters on a Wall Street teletype."
"ellietumblrmail","8","2","4","21 April 2014"," This movie is a masterpiece.
","Unless you've read Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, you won't care much for what my review has to say of Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of it. Firstly, I must admit that I absolutely adored this movie; that is, I enjoyed it the third time I watched it and each time after that. It took several sit downs and multiple discussions with fellow Fitzgerald fans to come to the conclusion that despite the many elements of the movie that were either different from the book or at best portrayed poorly, The Great Gatsby is an excellent movie. However, I cannot praise the film until I acknowledge which parts of the movie irritated me. While the party scenes and the interior of the characters' homes were convincing and impressive, everything set outdoors or in fast movement was too obviously computer generated. I was personally bothered by every driving scene because the visuals looked so fake. Speaking of fake, I became more annoyed as the movie progressed by the obnoxious accent of Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Jay Gatsby. As a huge fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I was expecting an exemplary performance, and I truly was excited about his movie character! It was much easier to love than his book character, which made the film's ending more tragic. He perfectly portrayed his character as an innocent young boy in love with a girl who broke his heart. Everything he did was driven by his love for Daisy, which is presented as a much greater shock in the movie than in the book because of the lavish, extravagant style of its director, Baz Luhrmann. The symbolism was so beautifully laden throughout Fitzgerald's book, though, that the movie's lack of recognition for the ""Valley of Ashes"" and ""Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, Occulist"" sign's significance was disappointing. The subtle romance behind the green light was also lost, as the green light in the movie was nearly blinding- it was far from subtle. The most prominent problem I found with the movie the first couple times I watched it was Tobey Maguire's version of Nick Carraway. The Nick of Fitzgerald's novel was practical, passive, and stereotypically ""plain."" Maguire's Nick is simply not the same Nick that Gatsby readers know and love! Rather, this Nick is narrating the entire movie from a sanitarium where he is recovering from alcoholism. After interrupting his narration in the very beginning of the movie by stating, ""I don't want to talk about this anymore, Doctor,"" the doctor responds, ""Then write about it."" The remainder of the movie, then, is an illustration of the novel Nick Carraway writes as he attempts to regain sanity! That blow was too overwhelming to process until the third time I watched the film. At that point, I had come to grips with this new adaptation of Fitzgerald's brilliant masterpiece and was able to watch without predetermined hatred. That's when I realized what an excellent decision Luhrmann had made by giving Nick a legitimate reason to tell the story! It gave Nick's plain, almost boring character depth. It made him intriguing. And it made the entirety of the film more impactful. Yes, it gave me a slightly depressed disposition the first couple times I watched it, but I love this giant aspect of Nick's character that I hadn't even considered before watching the movie. Again, if you haven't read The Great Gatsby, stop reading now as I'm about to reveal the biggest spoiler of the entire movie: every major character dies except for Nick, who ends up in rehab, and the two people who caused the deaths. These two characters, one of whom was obsessively adored by Gatsby, seemed careless toward the fact that they had destroyed multiple lives. They leave town without so much as a condolence or farewell. I definitely felt hatred for these two characters as I read the book, but it was nothing compared to the overwhelming feeling I experienced as I watched the movie. As much as I'd love to say I wasn't rooting for an affair between Gatsby and the already married Daisy, I was heartbroken by Daisy's coldness and blatant disregard for the man who had spent his entire career attempting to be worthy of her. As her husband Tom cheated on her in broad daylight, Daisy remained tolerant of him for one reason: his wealth. She was hardly the ditzy, innocent, flawless beauty she was made up to be in the book and beginning of the movie. I greatly appreciated that her cunning nature was more exposed by the movie. One more aspect of the movie I loved was the soundtrack. Though many critics complain of the way modern music was paired with a movie set in the 1920's, I thought each scene's music was orchestrated perfectly and I was personally crazy about each song chosen for the film. In conclusion, I highly suggest this movie. I do think it would have been a more quality film if it had been less obnoxiously colorful and without DiCaprio's horrid accent, but I thoroughly enjoyed this interpretation of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby."

","Another entry in the Gatsby sweepstakes this is not a terrible film but strip away all the flash and it's an average affair.<br/><br/>For some reason Hollywood continues to fail to understand that the magic of the book was in its elegant construction and beautiful phrasing where the specialness resides. <br/><br/>The cotton candy excess of this version is very pretty but also unreal and adds nothing to the story. Another demerit is the controversial decision to use contemporary music in place of the appropriate jazz numbers that would give the proper sense of time and place. It's a nice try but distracting rather than enlightening and pulls you out of the story whenever one is played.<br/><br/>That leaves the actors to drive the story over all the pomp, in most cases they fail. <br/><br/>Leo is okay as Gatsby but only occasionally seems to get under his skin. Joel Edgerton cuts a fine figure as the boorish Tom Buchanan but the production swamps his few moments to shine. <br/><br/>In the most problematic role of Daisy Carey Mulligan, a very talented performer, is unable to make her come alive. More of a concept than a character the part has more or less defeated every actress that has attempted her. Requiring a gossamer glow as well as a tinge of tragedy there are few women who have the proper mix to succeed in the role, perhaps the young Jessica Lange but she has no contemporary equal who has both of those rare traits. <br/><br/>The characters of Jordan Baker, Myrtle and George Wilson have all been shunted to the side in favor of another CGI moment of showiness so the actors really don't have the opportunity to make much of an impact.<br/><br/>The weak link in all this is Tobey Maguire who is terrible as Nick the narrator. He neither feels part of the period nor does he make his commentary compelling as Sam Waterston did in the Robert Redford/Mia Farrow version. His task is to pull the viewer in and his flat delivery doesn't do that for a minute.<br/><br/>An ambitious failure but misses greatness by quite a margin."
"quetzalnf","9","2","4","24 December 2013"," Well I thought it was good..
","Well I just don't know why this movie hasn't been as greatly loved by all as it has by me. One thing is a certain, Leonardo Di Caprio have a stunning performance. Starring as J Gatsby, Leonardo really helped me to get lost in the film. <br/><br/>One of the major dividing points was the soundtrack. An audience may have felt that the music was distasteful and out of place. I have a different view. I feel that although the movie was based in the era of jazz and the majority expected the music to follow the same ilk, the movie had to be different to the original, and the music although modern it did have aspects of jazz littered throughout and I liked that. You may think that the music was a weak attempt to relate to youths. I believe otherwise it is such a generalisation that teens would go to watch a movie because Jay-Z is rapping in it. The music in the film is so much more than that it has had a lot of thought put into it and it is full of different styles all with jazz elements. <br/><br/>The acting was generally good but Leonardo was clearly the stand out performer. You could really get lost in the story because he played the eccentric gentleman in the way that any great actor could. The story generally kept with the novel and that was a good thing as it doesn't disappoint those of us who have read the book as most of the time it is very hard to make a film as good as the novel. Baz Lurhmann has done a fantastic job in directing such a great film he never fails to impress and and most of all be original. It upsets me that he hasn't go the recognition he deserves."
"tuhin94","7","2","4","20 December 2013"," The book seems a lot more valuable now.
","Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of the book. I do not completely hate the book, but I was waiting for the end pretty soon after I had begun. However, this movie has done so much in opening my eyes up to the beauty of the book. As such, I prefer the film over the paper version, something quite rare. Given this fine quality, there were plenty of aspects that were not pulled off quite so well, along with some that were quite brilliant. <br/><br/>To start off, the music playing at the parties had many modern songs. If that's what they had in the '20s, imagine the stuff we would be listening to in the present. But, while on the subject of music, they made almost the whole film have background music of some sort. One of my biggest complaints with the book was that it was too slow. It's almost as if the crew realized this and put in music for the sluggish parts. <br/><br/>Back to a con, if the producers are putting so much money into a film, would they not realize it is important to make sure a shot does not contain a mouth moving without sound emanating from it? It looks like they did not bother because there were plenty of camera angle switches that showed one character moving their mouths after having completed their set of dialog. That was quite frustrating. <br/><br/>Of course, there had to be a lot of CGI to give the impression that the audience was truly immersed into the 1920s. But, we are in 2013 and I should not be able to tell when a green screen was used. At least, it should be to a minimum. There were too many times when I compared the movie to stuff from last decade. But, the way in which the movie was shot and presented was quite surreal. I do not know the official term for it, if there is one.<br/><br/>Lastly, the whole cast does an absolutely terrific job embodying their respective characters and playing out each scene. It does not seem strained in the slightest. Additionally, the whole team did a marvelous job of keeping the 1920s world intact. Nothing out of the time period seemed to be present. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie covered every major event from the book and stuck true to the medium on which it was based. A great job, but not as perfectly executed as it could have been. Watched and written 12/20/2013."

","It's a story from a time gone by brought to life in modern terms. It's alive just as its characters and its scenes are. The only thing I noticed was that the music soundtrack may have been slightly out but this is forgivable when trying to create a contemporary version of a story. <br/><br/>I am not a Baz fan at all. Every movie before this, for whatever reason, I did not like. They just didn't come together for me and I can't help but view Lurhmann as an uber-narcissist who's subconscious creative will is to let his ego completely displace anything an audience may require from a film. But this movie is well worth watching because of how it makes you feel and the messages it delivers.<br/><br/>You don't need to know any more than that. Just watch it."
"rahmannoodles22","7","2","4","19 December 2013"," The Great Gatsby - Noodles Review
","American classic of literature... The Great Gatsby... can somebody please tell me why this movie needed to be in 3D? The Great Gatsby is a very character-based story; the story can only proceed through how well the characters are portrayed, not the in-your-face style. Thankfully, the characters are most great too. Anyways, The Great Gatsby is a pretty simple story. There's an awesome rich guy, Jay Gatsby, whose pretty much the Hugh Hefner of the 1920s (although they were probably the same age in the '20s). He's in love with the narrator's cousin, who happens to be married to a douche with a lot of inherited money. That's some simple and classy drama there, right? Well, let's just add an insane amount of noise and a lot of green screen and now we have a movie.<br/><br/>The first thing you gotta talk about with this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. The guy's like one of the best in the business right now and personally my 3rd favourite actor. You just can't help but root for him in whatever movie he's in (hell, I almost even rooted for him in Django Unchained... but that would've been bad) and ya root for him in this movie. He kills it as Jay Gatsby. One thing that was great was the subtle mystery of his character (one really great film aspect is that he wasn't even shown for the first 20-30 minutes of the movie) The rest of the cast is good; especially Joel Edgerton who plays the dick so well, helping us to appreciate Gatsby even more. Toby Maguire (who we've all come to know as Spiderman) is fine in the movie as the narrator but I feel his role could've been played by anyone. Carey Mulligan, who plays Daisy (the girl Gatsby is infatuated with) overacts a little bit but I feel that's good for the character she plays and the style of this movie.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is really one thing that's really crucial to its likability. For me, I like where they were going with it, but it's just too much.for the movie. Baz Luhrmann is the director of this movie. If you don't know who he is, imagine what would happen if Zack Snyder started making artsy movies. He's a very visual and striking director, which sometimes works but not always. They use a lot of noise and colors for this movie. It's, in a way, visually loud. So much is going on that its just like there's noise on the screen. And a lot of this movie is shot on green screen, with a lot of visual effects that don't really need to be there. I don't think there's much need for that in a drama about love. While it does work at some times, I didn't think it did much justice to the overall film. What I really liked are the scenes that take place in one room where people are just talking or arguing. You can feel the tension and emotion of those scenes really well.<br/><br/>Still, The Great Gatsby puts a little too much flair into a simple character-based drama, creating an imbalance of style over substance. The acting was great and the script seemed like it was probably great too; but the way it was conveyed was a little too much. The clash between the premise of the movie and the ongoing visuals really compromised the overall quality of it. While it's an interesting and, in a respect, a unique movie, The Great Gatsby is not as memorable as I hoped for it to be"

","It was a real challenge for Baz Luhrmann to make us forget the epic fail of his last film ""Australia"". But he decided to do it, with a spectacular show based on the Scott Fitzgerald's novel. It's telling the story of a young man who meets Gatsby : a mysterious billionaire. And like everybody, he's asking himself a lot of questions about Gatsby's so secret life ... After seeing the Great Gatsby, we can say it : this is one of Hollywood's best movies in 2013. WHY? First the book's adaptation is perfectly done because the plot is as gripping as the book's one. What's more, the costumes are amazing (like Leonardo's body!) and totally reflect our expectations of sparkling and glamorous things, which stick to the twenties style. the actor's performance"
"ovaltinejenkins10","10","2","4","19 October 2013"," A ""Great"" Movie
","Baz Luhrmann's newest movie, The Great Gatsby, is, to put it simply, great. From start to finish, the acting, screenplay, directing, and soundtrack were all played out and put together to perfection. The movie is based off of the book of the same title, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The book is regarded as one of the greatest works of American literature, and one of the best books ever written. Empire magazine listed it at number two on its list of the Top 100 Books of the Twentieth Century, placing it behind only the Ulysses (which appears in the movie Gatsby for that same reason.) It is a near impossible task to display the greatness of the book on the big screen, but Luhrmann is able to pull it off in the second major motion picture based off on Fitzgerald's masterpiece.<br/><br/>To summarize briefly, The Great Gatsby, set in New York 1922, is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), and is a story about the millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), who desperately tries to recover the one person he ever loved, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). She is married somewhat happily to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), also another very rich fellow. The other characters consist of professional golfer Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Dibicki), Tom Wilson (Jason Clarke), a gas station owner, and his wife Myrtle (Isla Fisher.) When Nick moves next door to Gatsby in West Egg, he is eventually invited to one Gatsby's famous parties and the story takes off. For those of you who have not read the book, I don't want to spoil much more, but I will say that there are numerous parties, an extremely haunting song by Lana Del Rey, grainy footage style flashbacks, and eventually death.<br/><br/>Is Baz Luhrmann's flashy, art deco movie worth your time? Well, if you like to watch good movies then this is one you need to see. If you want to be taken back to the roaring twenties then this movie will do that, and more for you."
"p-stepien","8","2","4","13 October 2013"," Excessive extravagance hits home
","Baz Luhrmann's excessive all-out retelling of the great American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, where the essence of the 1920s lavish parties is juxtaposed with hip-hop and dub-step music channelling the excess, is a surprisingly satisfying feature. Equally shocking is how the outdated story fits so seamlessly with the current Wall Street culture of greed and obnoxiousness. When a youthful writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) decides on a stock exchange career he rents a small beach-side place, hence becoming the unknowing neighbour of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Soon the duo become comrades with Carraway being pulled into the nouveau riche lifestyle of glitz and cascades of cash. However Gatsby has an ulterior motive to reclaim the love of his life: Daisy (Carey Mulligan), a high-life dame married to local class royalty Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). For her this small town boy has amassed wealth in the hope that one day Daisy's heart will be reconquered.<br/><br/>For once Baz Luhrmann's liking to the extravagant feels wholly at home with luscious expansive setting and mass choreography making the spectacle seem suitably epic for the story. A far cry from the autoparodic ""Australia"" Luhrman's style seems to mesh perfectly with the sensibility of the story and his decision to introduce contemporary black music works brilliantly - symbolically drawing similarities as the current culture associated with the overblown excess of rappers so aptly fits to the fatuitous societal bliss of 1920s wealth. Despite the screenplay being as faithful as possible to the source material, the outlook on America as a culture of mindless wealth seems ever so timely.<br/><br/>Leanardo DiCaprio is a tour de force in his own right, now fully formed as an adult actor drawing away from his youthful appearance, which made him once seem like the eternal boy-actor. Tobey Maguire seems the weakest point of the movie, as he fails to serve any sense of credibility to his character, overly reclusive and grey, not bringing a background impact as the narrator of Gatsby downfall. Given that this is essentially Nick's story to tell I couldn't help but feel that Maguire struggles with making himself a key figure in the proceedings, instead molding into the background of the deluxe surroundings, struggling as a first person perspective narrator. This does make the movie a bit more ineffectual in its impact, but mostly it just underpins DiCaprio's command of his role and diverts all attention to the Great Gatsby!"
"deirdre-mc","9","2","4","28 September 2013"," Great adaptation of a great novel
","I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this adaptation of the classic American novel. Lurhmann makes his mark on this without diminishing the central themes of the novel. Instead he brings forth a modern dimension to the near century old novel. He manages to deftly bring to the screen the major accomplishment of the novel which is the presentation of the Jazz Era. While Fitzgerald brings this forth through words, Lurhmann uses supreme cinematography. I saw this in real 3D and it was thoroughly worth it. The casting was excellent with Maguire and DiCaprio playing very well opposite each other. Maguire's Carraway was aptly mesmerized with DiCaprio 's Gatsby. Dicaprio pulls off Gatsby with his slightly smarmy deliverance of some of the lines, which I found to be true to the novel.I was most surprised at Mulligans portrayal of Daisy. I didn't see her as rightly cast put she is more than able to share the screen with DiCaprio and shows Daisy to be the smart but submission female that she is."
"wiseguymattt","9","2","4","21 September 2013"," Just as I expected
","The trailer had me hyped up for this movie more than you can imagine. I had no idea what the story of Gatsby was, nor had I read any of Fitzgerald's work save for a few pages from one of his books that I can't even remember. Visually, this film is stunning in every way. The bright colors of the city, the fireworks, and the sounds made it feel like you were there right next to Gatsby. <br/><br/>The love story between Daisy and Gatsby was a bit odd for my taste. Maybe odd isn't the right word but rather confusing. The characters were well developed and genuine and each had their own unique contributions to an overall exhilarating film. The creators of the film adaptation chose to use a selection of modern music which, in my opinion, fits perfectly for the newer generation. However, for those who are heavily invested in the book you may not appreciate the choice of music included in the film. I mean, it's the 1950s and they're blaring Jay-Z in one of the clubs. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt the movie was fantastic. Gatsby is such a wild, mysterious character. Tobey Maguire portrayed Nick Carraway as a sheepish young man. And again, I haven't read the book so I don't know how accurate the film is to the actual story. But if you're like me and enjoy movies, this is one that you're likely going to enjoy from beginning to end."

","Overall I enjoyed this movie for it's spectacular cinematography. Having read the Great Gatsby and enjoyed it for it's intelligent insight into the ""human condition"", I was pleasantly surprised that for the most part the movie delivered this in a visually stunning package.<br/><br/>At times the development of the storyline, the imagery and the music all combined in such a way that you could be forgiven for thinking that you were for just a few seconds watching a musical. Often these moments caught you by surprise and distracted you from the key messages that were being conveyed.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is completely credible as Gatsby and drives the movie from start to finish. The rest of the cast has good performances, but the gap between them and DiCaprio is clear.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie a higher score if it didn't live so dangerously close to becoming a musical, and if the rest of the cast had closed the gap to DiCaprio's performance.<br/><br/>Worthwhile spending your time and your money watching this movie."

","This film is about a Wall Street employee who recalls his days when he lived next to a very rich gentleman in New York.<br/><br/>I have not read the literary classic before, so I have no preconceived ideas about the story of ""The Great Gatsby"". I find this film tells the story of Mr Gatsby in an expert manner, in which it intrigues and engages the viewers throughout the film. Mr Gatsby is portrayed to be a man with manners and charm, but almost no one knows about him. This adds to the mystique of this character, driving viewers to want more.<br/><br/>The opulent settings and the extravagant parties are very astounding. Leonardo DiCaprio is so convincing as a well bred gentleman, while Carey Mulligan shows her delicate side as she is torn between to men. I enjoyed watching ""The Great Gatsby""."
"heatherlyblossom","10","2","4","30 August 2013"," Fabulous Novel Adaptation
","Unfortunately, I last read the novel in high school. I meant to read it again before watching this movie, and I hate admitting that I did not. I do remember many scenes from the book, however, and I remember the story making me feel uncomfortable, or sad, or a bit odd in some way. But I do not remember the novel bursting into a glorious rainbow of colors the way this movie did (which I enjoyed). Most importantly, I did not remember what made this novel one of the most resonating tragic works of our time. <br/><br/>Personally, I believe this story is told extremely well and the actors are superb. When Gatsby and Daisy reconnect for the first time in five years and they look at each other... be ready, their longing will move you. Then, in the end, when you realize Gatsby's whole world was built around, and revolved around, Daisy, is absolutely inspiring. Especially when you learn he was no more than an escape to her. All his dreaming and planning, and yes, evening his hoping, was for naught. Crushing, really. But at least he died thinking she loved him too. <br/><br/>This adaptation is breathtaking, yet heartbreaking; and one of the best adaptations I've seen in a long while."
"malexandria","9","2","4","28 August 2013"," The Great Gatsby - Best film of 2013
","I don't think I've ever read The Great Gatsby. I know it is required reading in a lot of High School English Lit classes, but I'm fairly certain, surprisingly enough, that I didn't take English Lit - not even in College (I took French and Spanish instead). Always the practical one, who knew that I'd end up being ""forced"" to read all the classics anyway?<br/><br/>After a string of misfires (I hated Shutter Island and Inception) Leonardo DiCaprio returns to form. He is perfect as Gatsby. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. Gatsby is a complicated, yet simple man. His entire existence is his desire to get the girl, Daisy (Carey Mulligan) that he foolishly let go of.<br/><br/>This is a role that was tailor made for DiCaprio. If DiCaprio wasn't already an A list mega star, this movie would have made him one. He just oozes off the screen and is simply radiant here (can I use the word radiant to talk about a guy?).<br/><br/>In any other hands, Daisy could easily be hated and come across as shallow, naive, and as someone just going through life, but Mulligan brings a lot of hidden layers to Daisy. You can see the inner conflict through her expressive eyes.<br/><br/>As wild and over the top as Moulin Rouge Director Baz Luhrmann usually is; The Great Gatsby is his most assured, straightforward, gimmick free (not counting 3D) film to date. From a pure story telling and directing standpoint it is by the numbers. There are very few scenes that made me feel like I took a bad acid trip. Even the party scenes are beautifully shot and framed here.<br/><br/>Much has been written about the modern mixing of Hip Hop with 20's era Jazz and how it wouldn't work. Luhrmann actually did an amazing job of not overdoing the gimmick. Yes, it is noticeable, but he uses it very sparingly, so it never took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>There was one scene when they were on the bridge and they passed a car that had rich black people in and they were playing Jay-Z's Izzo (HOVA). It was odd and random just to have rich black people appear out of nowhere. I loved Luhrmann use of various versions Lana Del Rey's song Young and Beautiful in the love scenes. It really added texture and emotion to the romance.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful moments in the movie comes when Gatsby is lamenting everything that he's lost, and Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) says, ""You can't repeat the past"" and Gatsby responds with an earnest ""Of course you can old sport,"" such a simple but impactful moment.<br/><br/>Generally, I'm not a fan of narration, but Maguire does an amazing job with the lyrical prose used in this movie. Maguire gives a mature, nuanced performance here where you can really see his love and infatuation for Gatsby grow while his distaste for his friend Tom Buchannan (a wonderfully evil Joel Edgerton) increases. At times it almost seemed as if Nick wanted to jump Gatsby's bones.<br/><br/>This is my favorite film of 2013. It hit all my buttons – beautifully shot, very hopeful (but with an ultimately sad end), and had some flashes of brilliant prose."
"slicedbread117","9","2","4","28 August 2013"," The Great Gatsby is better than great, it's amazing.
","When I first saw the trailer for The Great Gatsby, I don't know what got me so excited, but it did. I haven't read the book, and really didn't know what the movie was about, but the previews got me excited. Again, I went into the movie not sure what to expect, but I came out knowing full well what it was, and how good it was.<br/><br/>This movie is defined by a few things, one of the big ones being the story, and the artistic direction of the film. The story, told through the eyes of writer Nick Carraway, is a tragic love tale full of conspiracy, lies, and drama. The plot is very engaging to say the least, and the initial mystery behind the plot is entertaining. But what adds to the story is the film's wonderfully executed artistic design, portraying a captivating 1920's New York which is full of beautiful locations, colorful scenery, and an overall immersing atmosphere. High- energy parties filled with celebration and dancing, beautiful cars, and more. The movie displays a city in it's hay-day, and it is wonderful. The film's soundtrack also went in a different direction, opting for a modern day sound with modern day music instead of going 1920's with the music. And in turn, the soundtrack helps the movie more than hurts it, only adding to the sense of artistic beauty this movie provides. In an artistic sense, the movie is very captivating.<br/><br/>The other large reason for this film's success is because of the extraordinary talents of the cast. The best actor that has never won an Oscar, Leonardo DiCaprio, plays the lead role as Jay Gatsby, and boy did it seem like another Oscar-winning performance to me. DiCaprio's acting wonders are on full display here, portraying a truly phenomenal character. Gatsby is a complicated, mysterious, lovable, colorful, emotional, and powerful character, and Leo nails the role to near perfection. This is some of the best work I've seen DiCaprio do, and that's pretty good going up against heavy hitters like Inception, The Departed, and Titanic among others. The supporting cast is equally as wonderful as well. The aforementioned Nick Carraway is played by Tobey Maguire, and his importance is more than just telling the story. He is a great character supporting player to DiCaprio's stellar performance, providing some laughs, emotion, and being the middle man in the overall story. Carey Mulligan plays the love interest to two characters, and also displays a complicated and emotional character, providing a depth to the story that makes you want to care. All said, the acting was pure gold, and brought the movie to life.<br/><br/>I at times felt that the movie rushed a tad too fast, not giving viewers quite enough time to digest what was going on, but for the majority of the 143 minute run time, the pacing was solid. <br/><br/>The movie finishes with a shocking conclusion (for people who haven't read the book) that really ended in a much different fashion than I expected. It was refreshing to be able to not have the movie figured out within the fist 30 or so minutes, keeping me interested in the story and how everything was going to play out.<br/><br/>For me personally, I love nothing more than being immersed in a movie. I love it when I feel like I'm part of the story a movie is telling and I want to feel the emotions running through the film, no matter what they are. The Great Gatsby gives me my wish by displaying a fantastically beautiful and artistic setting, that has my eyes just wanting to see more and more of what's on the screen. The acting is sensational, the story is mysterious and interesting, the score is fun and powerful, and to reiterate again, the movie is simply captivating. <br/><br/>9/10"
"peterclements2004","10","2","4","27 August 2013"," Very stylish
","I don't care what anyone says, Baz Lurhmann is one of today's greatest directors. This is a stylish and well acted movie which never disappoints. There are echos of Moulin Rouge here, you just can't help but notice. I am not a big fan of DiCaprio, but here he is perfectly cast and really seems to get the character. Believe it or not I had never seen the original movie, so I had to sit down and take it in one evening. Almost the same screenplay, but throughout it left me wanting the 2013 cast. Redford in contrast to DiCaprio, did not seem to get the character and looked uncomfortable throughout. Mia Farrow as Daisy was just plain awful! So, the 2013 movie is certainly an excellent version of the novel. The scene where you first see Daisy is just wonderful."

The first 30 mins I was ready to shoot the Cameraman !! A lot of UN-necessary jumping and very fast paced. I think on the big screen perhaps more of a dazzle.. But I always look for more substance and less glitter effect in a movie. I felt the movie had some powerful images, scenes, actors etc. Music , let's not go there..well let's... Honestly ,the music I had been aware of and was dreading it, and yes I hated it. It does not belong ,perhaps 1 song by Jay Z somewhere in the movie to keep someone out there happy? But I was Not. I mean Really?? Anyhow, I actually lost interest in any and all of the characters by the end of the movie, and felt I either missed something or it was worse than I had even thought it could be. Have I been too harsh?? Perhaps I will watch again another time to see if second time round is better? But I nearly never watch a movie twice, especially one as forgettable as tonight. :("

Scott Fitzgerald to silver screen and portraying what can undoubtedly be regarded as the most visually appealing film of 2013 so far. Although, an average user would expect more drama and thrill out of the movie.probably as a consideration for sitting through a two and a half hour long movie. The actors and actress were implacable in their respective roles and were able to do justice to the characters of the original novel. For me, the individual who stole the show was Australian actor Joel Edgerton who gave one hell of a performance and should be considered for an Oscar in the best supporting role category. In addition, it would be an absolute crime not to include the movie in the best costume and best cinematography category in the Oscars. Overall, although an average user may feel disappointed with the ending, but the movie, being based on one classic piece of writing, turned out to be decent and intriguing piece of art ."

A movie that depicts a humble modest dream of a man, whose every decision of his future, had a perfect place somewhere for her. For someone who couldn't wait and left him, blinded by pearls and diamonds. A movie about someone who was humiliated but still cared for her, only for her to cause him lose everything he ever did to fulfill his vision and in the end his life. A funeral for a man, who welcomed everyone, was deserted, defamed for other's wrongs and bereft for the love of the woman who then left him again back to her money and royal life, with no regrets and remorse. <br/><br/>Yes , the Great Gatsby is no ordinary movie.

But all the actors apart from DiCaprio where just not good. They where overacting making weird faces and some spoke with the tong of the time then and some of the tong from our time. The difference between A-actors and B- actor was to good to see. But most off all the fact that during the movie you hear music from the last 4 years just threw me of the story line and that was upsetting. But forgetting all that the performance of DiCaprio makes much good. The way how he plays his character is amazing to see.

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","2","4","12 August 2013"," Beautiful!
","I do not find it hard to be objective while reviewing this movie because of the original Redford/Farrow movie. Since I am not a fan of the original (I find it quite long and frankly extremely boring) I can see the remake as a completely new vision, be absolutely frank and dazzled by what is shown here (unlike my mother who still finds the original better).<br/><br/>The acting. I dislike beginning with the negative aspects but since the acting is the only bad thing about this movie I have to point it out at the start. DiCaprio did not live up to the expectations. When I heard he would be playing Gatsby I was thrilled. I thought: ""Finally, a role that will suit him perfectly."" I was wrong. His acting is wooden, emotionless, at points a bit over-the-top, and at the point where he needed to explode, he does it more uncontrollably than necessary. His face shows no pain (something essential to this role), some of his moves are artificial and just not believable, and the ""Old sport"" is a little overused. Unfortunately, there is no other actor today that could be capable of being Jay Gatsby. So, we find ourselves at a crossroad: accept DiCaprio as badly/solidly acted Gatsby and move on, or simply thrash the movie because of his acting. I sided with the first option. Carey Mulligan is the other rotten apple. She is simply nonexistent on the screen, her acting is unremarkable, nothing she did is memorable or worth any compliment whatsoever. She is just a big blank on the screen that exists just because her character exists on the screen. Now, a question poses itself: how can a movie who's two lead actors who did not do their job be any good or even worth mentioning? Well, here comes Joel Edgerton. His acting is something I would never have expected. If Hollywood has a future, he is it. Every segment of his acting is marvelous and remarkable. His voice, his movements, his temper, his very being is absolutely Oscar worthy. If he does not receive an Oscar nomination, it would be a horrendous mistake! Edgarton stole the movie. Maguire was surprisingly good. He was exactly the character he needed to be, afraid, not knowing what hit him and why, where he is and barely understanding what is going on. But the landmark sentence he says to Gatsby is done just as it was supposed to. Another remarkable role is the one of Jason Clarke. Not a lot of screen time, but still, a great physical and vocal transformation and the emotions he shows are so powerful one just must share with him.<br/><br/>The visual aspect. What makes this movie so spectacular is the visual power and fullness of the screen. Every shot is filled with color, so much details and aspects one just can't fully catch all of them at first viewing. But the feeling and experience is remarkable. Luhrmann at his best. Also, the movie's shots are extremely fast. One could almost say hysteric. That also contributes to the general feeling and effect of the movie.<br/><br/>The music. At first I thought, how is it possible that hip-hop played in the 1920s. Than I started listening to the music itself and realized that not only does it fit the shots themselves perfectly, it actually increased the total atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>The story. Not much to say here. Almost a complete copy of the book with a few added scenes (perfectly fitted). But, the duration of the movie is a mystery to me. 143 min? The central part of the movie is a bit too long and could have been a bit shorter, dare I say, faster paced.<br/><br/>All in all, if you can disregard DiCaprio and Mulligan and just focus on the visual aspects, the music and Edgarton's superb acting, you will really enjoy this movie. It is fast paced (with the exception of the central part), visually beautiful, superbly directed, but lacking emotions and a real Redford-like Jay Gatsby."
"rahuljonathan-nair","10","2","4","12 August 2013"," Wonderful, mesmerizing, striking and a beautiful film!!
","The film retains a lot of the amoral energy of Lurhmann's Romeo + Juliet. With The Great Gatsby, he plays story teller to the hilt. Although the novel from where the film is adapted, (F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic) was set in the 1920's Luhrmann makes the film speak to the 21st century. And he does this by incorporating contemporary music which gives the film a familiar feel. The film does have an ending that'll suck you into nothingness. However this doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece, but only elevates it to higher levels of greatness.Verdict: The Great Gatsby is a spectacular film that pays a great homage to emptiness. Wonderful and striking performances by Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway!!!"

","Redford and Farrow was ultimately a much more satisfactory combination than the two leads in this remake.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is quite good as the driven Gatsby but Mulligan does not have the charisma or incredible beauty of Farrow. This means that the obsession of Gatsby for Mulligan's character seems rather unlikely to say the least.<br/><br/>The party scenes while undoubtedly visually impressive are ultimately far too overblown and again add a sense of unreality to the story. Tobey Maguire was unremarkable and not particularly sympathetic which again did not help.<br/><br/>It isn't a bad film, the essential storyline still holds some interest and the plot is excellent (as it should be given the source material) but the above flaws prevented the film from being anything special.<br/><br/>This version suggests that certain films are better left alone. The Redford Gatsby was already superb and there was no need to do it again."
"davidgee","6","2","4","29 June 2013"," An overstuffed armchair of a movie
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Casey Mulligan look terrific, but DiCaprio's performance is a bit puppet-like, though this may be Baz Luhrmann's direction, and Mulligan doesn't quite capture the shallow brittleness of Daisy the way Farrow did. Tobey Maguire is outstandingly good as Daisy's narrator cousin Nick, a character who may have inspired L.P Hartley to create the boy Leo in THE GO-BETWEEN. <br/><br/>The big fault with the movie - and it will always be there - is Scott Fitzgerald's fault: not enough happens. Will Daisy and Gatsby recapture their lost love? What's the truth about his past? These are the only two elements to the story. An already slim plot gets thinner with such an extended adaptation. And repeated overcrowded parties and long tracking shots soon begin to look like the padding is coming out of this overstuffed armchair of a movie.<br/><br/>It's visually glorious (and I only saw the 2D version) but it's a bit like a sweet with a hollow centre."
"l_rawjalaurence","8","2","4","25 June 2013"," Surprisingly Good Adaptation of the Fitzgerald Classic
","Having heard conflicting reports in reviews and through word-of-mouth, I approached Baz Luhrmann's version of THE GREAT GATSBY with mixed feelings. In the first half-hour I have to admit that I thought it was rather over-blown and operatic; the screen was filled with color and light; many scenes, although brilliantly staged and expertly filmed, seemed rather irrelevant to the purpose of the story; while the music - an anachronistic combination of Twenties standards and contemporary rock - jarred on my ears. As the action unfolds, however, so the film radically improves as Luhrmann becomes far more interested in his characters. As Nick Carraway, Tobey Maguire assumes a pivotal role in the action; he is the first person we see on screen as he recalls what happened to his psychiatrist. At once appalled yet attracted to Jay Gatsby's way of life, Nick comes to understand what lies behind it: Gatsby's perpetual desire for recognition in New York high society. Carey Mulligan comes across as rather colorless as Daisy Buchanan; however, in terms of Lurhmann's interpretation, this seems entirely coherent. Gatsby is prepared to go to any lengths to recreate his love- affair with Daisy; Lurhmann shows that Daisy is not really worth it. As Fitzgerald says in the source-text, she is ""careless"" as well as indifferent. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is quite simply brilliant; someone accustomed to a privileged way of life, who possesses little or no understanding of anyone around him. He believes he can pick up and throw away people at will, just like material things. Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby bears a striking facial resemblance to the young Orson Welles. At once confident yet suspicious, his eyes dart around from person to person, as if unable to trust anyone. His final confrontation with Tom in the hotel room is quite stunning - especially when Gatsby loses his civilized veneer and reveals his true nature. At the film's end we are left feeling terribly sad: Gatsby might have been a fraud, but as Nick says, he embodies the kind of perpetual hope that seems quite at odds with the material world around him."
"DareDevilKid","7","2","4","25 June 2013"," Surprise! Surprise! A Baz Luhrman Film that's both, Well Shot and Astutely Crafted.
","Rating: 3.5/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Besides being visually enchanting like most Baz Luhrman films, this is also one of his few offerings that's aesthetically beautiful, dramatically satisfying, characteristically emphatic, and sufficiently entertaining, as it is visually brilliant. The ensemble cast effortlessly coagulates any chinks in the multi-layered narrative. Most importantly, the movie resonates with one simple but true message: ""That nothing is too great or too small for love and if you really love, you should be willing to pay any price for it"". Come awards season, expect this movie to snag all the nominations for its intoxicating cinematography."
"dharmendrasingh","8","2","4","14 June 2013"," F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved
","F. Scott Fitzgerald would have loved this film. Baz Luhrmann stays true to the spirit of the book whilst preserving his directorial integrity. In some ways it's a perfect marriage. Both are men of style and lyricism, of romance and passion.<br/><br/>I read the book only a few days before my screening – the first time I have ever done so. I was expecting a tawdry adaptation but Luhrmann has actually made the best film of his career. I needed his imagination to fill the blanks in mine.<br/><br/>I quickly realised, as I followed every single detail with childlike awe, that this adaptation is piously faithful to the book. Perhaps it's better described as a literal translation. Words and precise sensory details – not just scenes – are lifted from page and pasted to screen, as when Nick Carraway first sees Daisy in her East Egg mansion. The 'coloured' references are appropriately kept in, and the party scenes are faultless.<br/><br/>The players are sensational. Carey Mulligan simply IS Daisy. Waiflike, elegant, beautiful, innocent – which man wouldn't devote his life to her? Amitabh Bachchan does much to bring Bollywood closer to Hollywood with his brief but key turn as shady 'businessman', Meyer Wolfshiem (a bold but brilliant casting decision).<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton also perfectly embodies his role as the macho philanderer Tom Buchanan. He's never been better really. Tobey Maguire is likewise excellent as Nick Carraway, the narrator from whose perspective the story is told. To be truthful it's a thankless role because he has only to look awestruck every time he sees Gatsby. Fortunately, Maguire and DiCaprio are real life friends, so the awe does not have to be feigned.<br/><br/>Highest praise is reserved for DiCaprio, one of the few great actors yet to receive an Oscar. His take on Gatsby wouldn't have been out of place in the time of Bogart, Cagney and Lancaster. Indeed his entrance is as memorable as the quick pan upwards to Bogie's face in Casablanca, or Welles's chair spin in Citizen Kane. When reading the book I struggled to see who could play Gatsby. Two seconds of DiCaprio's movements made it obvious.<br/><br/>Some question if the book is indeed a classic. Whatever the merits of the book (I think there are many) I believe the story of a boy who dreams of greatness, then pursues it to validate the love of a woman, only to die vainly, pitifully, should resonate with anyone with a heart.<br/><br/>Lana Del Ray's angelic vocals help to evoke pathos, particularly her moving track whose lyrics 'Will you still love me when I'm no longer yours' encapsulate the story beautifully. On the other hand, Jay Z's music, presumably only used because he's oddly an Executive Producer, is an awkward juxtaposition, but luckily it is too brief to be a major distraction.<br/><br/>In some places there is a bluntness to the storytelling which undermines the power of the book. The beginning feels very rushed as the camera darts from one shot to the next. But these are mere peccadilloes in what is otherwise a glorious film, which masterfully captures the wild hedonism of that enviable era."
"Le_Docteur96","6","2","4","10 June 2013"," Great Ambition for Great Gatsby
","Look, this film is one that is going to be divisive. Baz Lurhrmann is known to have critics before he undertook this film, with his lavish style either being loved or hated. One would suggest then, that with F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jazz Age classic, Lurhrmann would dovetail perfectly, right? Not quite. The film certainly does have some pizazz, and while I don't personally agree with the Jay Z music influence, I don't dispute that the film certainly had ambition.<br/><br/>The cast does its best to bring the novel to life, with Tobey Maguire a good choice as passive Nick, and Leo DiCaprio a Robert Redford reminiscent Jay Gatsby, but Carrie Mulligan and Joel Edgerton just a little bit too 'sympathetic' in their portrayal of the Buchannan's, which although not detracting from the film, leaves some of the novel uncaptured.<br/><br/>As a reader of the book, I felt that the film tried really hard to capture important thematic concerns, but what let it down was that it tried too hard to point them out, as if trying to prove to the audience how clever this was. Sometimes, I found this annoying, as it peeled back the Gatsby mystery too early, and made him seem too fake, when we shouldn't really find this out until the end.<br/><br/>All in all, this film tries to be something that it isn't, almost reminiscent of the sad figure of Jay Gatsby himself. The plot still holds well, and you can't argue that they didn't try."
"ravengraceu","5","2","4","7 June 2013"," Trust the Audience
","First let gets the initial visual spectacle out of the way. Its amazing. The scenes, the costumes and most if not all of the camera movements are expressive and creative. Its virtually impossible to have an issue with something appearing so beautifully. If this film we just a music video/art piece. A+ all the way. However.......<br/><br/>What I can and do take issue with is the fact that the filmmaker does NOT trust the actors or the script to tell the story.<br/><br/>I understand that it has become the standard fare to tell the story through special effects only. I feel that the movie makers here are afraid that if we are not continuously mystified by the visual effects then we will not understand the movie at all. However on behalf of movie goers with active brain cells I would like to see actual acting, character development and pauses amid the swirling SFX. There is a great cast here. There is an immense amount of talent here that was glossed over and not used.<br/><br/>We need to care about the characters you are showing us. You must ground them in some way. Everyone in this film feels too abstract. If all we see is them floating in the air then they will not matter to us, no matter how pretty or handsome you make them appear. There needs to be a contrast between the dazzling lights, loud music and actual people. There is great source material to draw from. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel has many layers that can be used.<br/><br/>This is one reason why the film suffers. We know we are being cheated. We know that somewhere in the editors office there is all this great acting that is not being seen. We hope that somewhere in the screenplay of the novel there is more depth to the characters.<br/><br/>If you have read the novel you know that there is. If not, go and give it a chance. What a shame for the actors. What a shame for us because honestly I walked in wanting to love this movie version, but I was given nothing to hold on to.<br/><br/>Now to the music. I will tell you honestly when I was in the the theater and heard the first few beats of the rap music I thought that it was bleeding in from the Fast and the Furious next store. Rap music has its place but not in 1922. This felt like a cheap trick. One it did not go with the time period at all. And two instead of researching the REAL music of the Jazz Age they decided to cheat. This made the movie feel more like a music video than a novel. It was highly distracting. I felt that the film makers had done no research on the era at all. The real music of the Jazz Age was immensely innovative, experimental, soulful... The Harlem Renaissance etc. It is a shame and insult that virtually NONE of the music of that era was used in this movie.<br/><br/>It is truly sad that so many people went to so much obvious hard work to create this movie only to have it suffer from poor editing choices and misguided soundtrack.<br/><br/>If at all possible go back and research some kick ass real Jazz Age music. Re-edit for character development. Trust the audience!!!! We want to love you."

","Baz Luhrmann has successfully created (along with his crew) the most exquisite portrayal of Gatsby I believe possible. His use of costumes and set for starters is show-stopping, going all out and dripping every inch of the film in the sparkling champagne of the roaring twenties.The music is inspiring. Jay-Z has managed to create a modern edge on traditional Jazz and bent and twisted it to give the effect of either the rough, dirty and crowded city of New York or the dazzling, priceless spectacle of the rich on Long Island. Finally the actors are spot on when it comes to the carefree (or careless in some cases) attitude of the new generation in the 1920's where life is one big party and money is essential to have (in large quantities). I was blown away and I hope the rest of the audience are too."

","This movie was very jumbled; it was cut very frantic and incoherent, leaving the viewer confused and dizzy. The scenes and takes are sometimes so fast strung together, you don't really know what just happened. Nevertheless it feels like forever as it is stretching towards the end. <br/><br/>This movie is a good example where the book to movie adaption went horribly wrong. Although with a runtime of 142 min Baz Luhrmann does not manage to pass on the spirit and essence of this rather short book. The visual style of the movie is great, but seems pretentious and 'plastic', which takes away the magic of the roaring 20's. And the choice of contemporary music truly destroys the atmosphere. Songs are playing all over the whole movie, even repeating, like a radio playing in the background, distracting from the story. Characters and their relationship are portrayed dull, superficial, and not credible in their behavior and portrayal, in a way like jesters on the screen, leaving no room for empathy or comprehension from the viewer. <br/><br/>Overall it's a pity that this movie fails on so many levels, because it had potential, but ends up only mediocre."

","I have yet to read the book, but this movie has bedazzled me and I am sure that the book is even more fascinating. However, putting the book aside, we're here to make our reviews about the movie and not comparing it to other works or even the novel. I know that from some of the reviews, many people were disappointed and unsatisfied or even thought the movie was trash. Though, from a fresh pair of eyes, I would think this movie was absolutely brilliant. From the acting to the music, settings, and even costumes had made this movie into a crowned jewel from my point of view. Having Leonardo taking the role of Gatsby was perfect. I have never doubted about his acting, and his performance has certainly assured me once again. The power, the mystery, to his passion, it was all very well portrayed. As for the music, I do understand everyone's dislikes toward the music that were featured in the movie. However, think of it this way, can you really bring out the feeling of an awesome party with just jazz and some retro music? The music featured during the parties were just an effect to capture the viewer's sense of excitement. Nevertheless, the song ""Young and Beautiful"" by Lana Del Rey was absolutely breathtaking and it was perfect for the movie. Perfect. Not to mention the settings and the costumes, they were very well displayed. They demonstrated a glamorous era in New York which was merely a mirage to many. It was beautifully coordinated. Overall, in my opinion, this is a wonderful movie. Definitely one of the best I have seen."

"manusanchez90","9","2","4","22 May 2013"," One of the best three movies in 2013 so far! 9!
","I did not expect ""The great Gatsby"" to be so good. I expected it would be another good movie with a great cast, but no so deep and entertaining. I had not seen the version released in 1974 and did not read the novel it is based on. The day after seeing the new version at a cinema, I saw the version released in 1974 starred by Robert Redford. I will begin to read the novel with the same title when I finish the novel I currently read. I already saw the most known movies directed by the Australian Baz Luhrmann. I particularly enjoyed ""Australia"", liked ""Romeo and Juliet"", hated ""Moulin Rouge"" and loved ""The great Gatsby"" in all aspects, except its lenght (it has to have some defect). This director has a personal characteristics present in all these films. The pace is excellent for a intriguing realistic romantic drama. As I explained, it would be better if it lasted 10 mins. less, but not important at all. The movie kept me amused during its entire duration, partially thanks to the amazing performances and backgrounds. The scenography is very colorful and beautiful. It is set in New York during the twenties. They took care with every detail: clothing, automobiles, architecture, vocabulary, etc. The soundtrack is very nice, too, with very well-known songs. This is one of the best points in the movie. The 1974 version is colorful and nice, too, but this is one is fascinating (partially thanks to technology and special effects). The cast is another strenght: Leonardo Dicaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton are the main components. They are all excellent. I particularly liked Dicaprio as Gatsby, who is always so believable and changeling (special attention to his voice). In my humble opinion, with Robert Deniro and Jonhy Depp, he is objectively the best actor nowadays (I did not mean he was my favorite). Maguire is not as expressive as other actors, but he is very good anyway. He did an excellent job as the coprotagonist and narrator. Carey Mulligan, who is not that veteran, plays the part of the girl. She is very believable, too, and promising... Joel Edgerton, who acted even better in the movie ""Warrior"", is the antagonist in this case: Buchanan. He delivered a solid performance, the second best I have seen in him. The rest of the cast has done a more than correct job. The movie is intriguing and dramatic at the same time. The intrigue is focused on the character of Gatsby. The movie presents profound characters and deep performances, so we know what moves each one. At the same time, the movie is critical with the U.S. society of those years. The character development is another advantage of this movie. In conclusion, the movie is fascinating in nearly everything. I cannot say if the fans of the novel can enjoy or not because I have not read it yet, but surely those who like good-quality-dramas and Leo's fans will enjoy it. 9."
"akash_sebastian","7","2","4","21 May 2013"," Pleasure-drenched Celebration of a Time Gone By - Best Adaptation Till Date!
","Gatsby, The Classic American Novel; when a movie is made on such a novel, which has gained so much popularity in the past decades and has even become a part of American high school curriculum, it is bound to get a lot a heat. Luhrmann's adaptation, though having some glaring flaws, is the best attempt till date.<br/><br/>The movie enthralled me with its spectacularly breathtaking visuals and strong soundtrack. Lana Del Rey's 'Young and Beautiful' is powerfully beautiful, and certainly deserves some awards. Coming back to the visuals, Luhrmann pays so much attention to the details from a character's dress to the carpets to the chandeliers - everything is colourful and extravagant. But this same attention to detail becomes a drawback as the emotional and intimate scenes lose some of their intensity behind these picturesque details. The interactions and confrontations feel like scenes from glitzy operatic drama. But other than that, the story is told quite well keeping with the pace and suspense of the piece; the mystery is maintained quite well.<br/><br/>With Leonardo DiCaprio's talent and persona, I could think of no one else who could have played Gatsby's role better; he sustains the shades and elements of the character quite naturally. Carey Mulligan plays the attractive, but self-centered and shallow, character of Daisy with such beauty and grace. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Carraway, and his brilliant narration helps in bringing the feel of Fitzgerald's lyrical prose.<br/><br/>No matter how much the movie is trashed, I can aptly say that it skillfully portrays the basic elements of the characters and the story - the roaring 'Jazz Age' of the 20's, self-reinvention, the great American dream. lost love, and unwillingness to let go of the past - and stays true to the book. Rather than being a completely conventional adaptation, it's more of a pleasure-drenched celebration of a time gone by."
"Staffenburgen","8","2","4","21 May 2013"," A Surprisingly ""Great"" Gatsby
","It's been almost a week since I saw this film, and it's been on my mind since I left the theatre. I went in with quite low expectations; I hated Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet adaptation, and to make it worse, most critics aren't exactly predicting this film to make a splash at the Oscars. With both of those things in mind, I was pretty much ready to have one of my favourite books be torn apart by incompetency. <br/><br/>But that didn't happen. <br/><br/>The movie starts with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) giving a brief introduction to the setting of Fitzgerald's classic. Even this early in the film, there are some alterations that will drive many fans of the book crazy. As the first act continues, we are introduced to the Roaring Twenties, and wow, Luhrmann makes them roar. During these opening sequences, we hear the now infamous Jay-Z soundtrack very frequently, and although I initially hated the idea of it, I actually found myself enjoying it during the film. I'm not really sure why, looking back, but it just seemed to fit really well. <br/><br/>As we are introduced to some of the main characters, a few of the actors really stood out. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan seemingly walks off the page; he IS Tom. I also really enjoyed Carey Mulligan, who seems to have divided critics. Now, as far as Tobey Maguire is concerned, I thought he was okay. It should be noted that I thought he got better as the movie went on, and I think this is because he's a better supporting actor than a lead actor. <br/><br/>As the first act closes with the same over-the-top crazy partying it began with, we finally meet the namesake of the novel. Up to this point, I had been quite entertained, but there wasn't anything that really snatched my attention. When Leonardo DiCaprio enters, he does just that. As someone who was actually quite skeptical about Leo in this role, I couldn't have been more wrong. While he's on screen, you see the person that Fitzgerald and Carraway describe, and he is exactly as they describe him. Wow. That's all that came to mind. <br/><br/>As the second act begins, DiCaprio takes over the lead role and Maguire moves to a more supporting role, and this is where Fitzgerald's story really begins. From here on, the movie is fantastic. Many people will be alienated by the alterations, the in-your-face special effects, the soundtrack, or whatever else people are complaining about during the first act, but if you stick through it, you will not be disappointed. I know some people haven't read the book, so I went get into details about this part, but if you have read the book, I really do think you will be impressed by the second half of the movie. <br/><br/>When the film reached its concluding moments, I was completely satisfied. For me, it really did justice to the book, and unlike Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, I felt this film showed a real respect for its source material, and told an accurate and thoroughly entertaining version of Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Looking once again at the reviews I've read, I have to wonder how many people just watched the first half, or maybe were so alienated by the time it was over they just completely tuned out the second half. For me, that's really the only explanation for the negative reviews. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a great movie. It's a beautiful film (with or without 3D), it's well acted, and it really does a great job with Fitzgerald's work. <br/><br/>So, I was wrong, and I'm really happy I was. Mark me down as a Luhrmann fan, and I'm looking forward to his next efforts. <br/><br/>RATING: 8/10"

","Let me get some minor stuff out of the way first. Even against high expectations, the lavish visuals of the Gatsby parties can still have you gasp (and they are complemented by excellent audio such as Gershwin's ever popular Rhapsody in Blue). The only thing that spoils everything is the criminally irresponsible decision to make the movie in 3D, an insult to the authors (original and screenplay), the art direction people, the actors, and everybody else whose effects deserve something better than distraction from this abominable gimmick. See it in 2D to minimize the damage.<br/><br/>The movie makers displayed good flexibility. The verbal introduction of Gatsby, from Nick Carraway's VO, was a faithful reproduction of the book's text: ""(like).intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away"". The visual introduction, on the other hand (no pun intended), shows clever re-imagination: while the book described Gatsby's outstretched hand in the dark only as ""trembling"" the movie shows us a hand that is reaching out, trying to grab something. Another example: the book's description of Doctor T.J. Ecklebury's eyes on the billboard is not blindly (no pun intended) followed – the movie's version, without the spectacles described by the book, is better.<br/><br/>DiCarpio and Mulligan's portrayal of the protagonists are better than just competent. While Daisy as a character is banality personified, Mulligan has brought to it more than it deserves: her own fragile charm. Purportedly an enigma, Gatsby is quite understandable when deconstructed. DiCarpio plays the deconstruction accurately. The detached observer role of Nick Carraway (which has a marked influence on writers who are Fitzgerald admirers, such a Haruki Murakami), ""one of the few honest people that I (Carraway) have ever known"", is best suited to Toby Maguire, with his child-like innocence and disarming faint smile. <br/><br/>The best character, however, is Jordan Baker. For this role, Paris born and Australia raised Elizabeth Diabecki is heaven-sent. In a magazine interview, this hitherto unknown but decidedly talented young women intimated about the exciting moment when, rehearsing a play in Australia, she got a call from ""an American number"" informing her that she has won the part of Jordan Baker in Baz Luhrmann's new film. In talking about her role, she paid tribute to Fitzgerald's writing that is ""so specific about the physicality of the characters"". Indeed, her physical portrayal of Jordan Baker is pitch-perfect. But Jordan Baker is not just a pretty face, or just an elegant, slender, poised, erect carriage for that matter. To bring her role to live, Diabecki had to go deeper.<br/><br/>Nick's early impressions of Baker are superficial, exemplified by how he perceives the way she walks, as if ""she first learn to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings"". But he gradually turns his attention to the enigma that is her: ""the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something"". This curiosity takes him along the path of mental as well as actual investigation until he finally believes that he has arrived at a conclusion. ""She was incurably dishonest. She wasn't able to endure being in a disadvantage"" Nick explains. This appears to be as far as Fitzgerald is ready to go in revealing Jordon Baker but this is only the beginning of the readers' tantalizing speculation of what really makes her tick. Why is this proud woman contented to be a mere sidekick and go-between for Gatsby? Equally tantalizing is the romance, perceived or real, between Baker and Carraway. This pair is far more interesting than Gatsby and Daisy, and we have so little about them, whether in the book or in the movie.<br/><br/>With little material to work on, Diabecki has managed to give us a Baker that is more than one-dimensional (THIS is the real 3D we want!). The most poignant scene, undoubtedly unnoticed by most, is the last time we see Baker and Carraway together, in front of Buchanan house after the fatal accident. This is the only time we sense in her a touch of tenderness and kindness, barely but definitely palpable: she put a hand on Nick's arm and said ""Won't you come in Nick"". Ironically, this is the only time when he brushed her off and this must have really hurt her, as she ""turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house"". That very brief moment is very difficult to act, and Biabecki did well.<br/><br/>The book has a final scene when he met her one more time, to say goodbye. The movie didn't show it and I perfectly understand as ""The Great Gatsby"" is not about Jordon Baker and Nick Carraway. But I do hope to have seen Maguire and Diabecki acting out this poignant scene."

Perfect pictures of wonder that you could never create, yet the more you look you see that the ice cream is mashed potatoes and and the lettuce is plastic. You see it, its nice but you soon see its fake. That's the problem. Gatsby is a good movie. fun, it has a voyeurs quality of the outsider looking in on the highs and lows. It was enjoyable, the acting was pale but good and the visuals luxurious. I am glad I watched it, but you see it was fake. It never draws you fully in. <br/><br/>It was not great. the Cgi is so over done as to be absurd. many times it looks utterly cartoonish. Very poor attention to period was maintained. Out of date skylines and cars, modern glassware and jewelry. modern suits for the most part. this is no trip back to the roaring twenties. The soundtrack was a travesty. little to no big band, little jazz. a lot of organ and orchestra and.. modern hip hop and rap. there was no reason for hip hop and rap in this movie at all. There is a scene where a group of black people are dancing in a driving car to Snoop dog playing while their white Chauffeur drives and watches their bucket of champagne. uhhhhmm. There was a lot of racism in the twenties, no rap, and prohibition, and brutal police. This film likes to forget the politics and social climate and give us a Rianna video instead. the dances were poor and not to period. <br/><br/>this is fiction, not a look into the past and don't go to it expecting to see what that age looked like. you will be disappointed. the classicist old money struggle is introduced and forgotten, so is the criminal element. this is a movie full of half tried attempts at greatness. <br/><br/>DiCaprio will probably get an Oscar. only because he is ""due"" from other great films not from his work here. ultimately The great Gatsby is just Toby Maguire telling a story that is not spider man."
"estella2","8","2","4","20 May 2013"," Luhrmann opts for Visualization over Narration in his version of 'Gatsby'
","--What I DID enjoy--<br/><br/>Luhrmann has a certain cinematic style that is instantly identifiable in all of his movies. It's almost dream-like and misty; reminds me sort of the style of directors like Adrian Lyne, who used certain colors, fog machines, lighting, camera angles, and lens effects to create an atmosphere on screen that would become almost a trademark. Luhrmann's style is reminiscent of a children's pop-up book. <br/><br/>I love the fact that this movie acted out scenes that other Gatsby films neglected. For example, Daisy's wedding. Every time I would read this scene in the book, or hear Mia Farrow's monologue (from the 1974 version) about how the letter fell to pieces in the bathwater 'like snow,' I would try to visualize Daisy in her wedding dress, on her wedding day, drunk as hell and crying; and now, I was able to actually see this. Baz's choice to include this scene brought different layers to Daisy's character. It showed that perhaps she really did love Gatsby, but she was conflicted. I think if you don't see this, and it is instead only narrated in film, you almost wonder if this is just a story made up by Daisy to keep Gatsby under her love-spell. Acting out the scene humanized Daisy a bit more, and wins more sympathy from the audience; at least, for a short period of time until we see more undesirable traits surface later in the story! <br/><br/>Another moment from the book I was happy to see come to life was Gatsby's past and how he came to be rich. This was a real treat for me, not to mention the cinematography was really beautiful with the horizon in the sky and Gatsby on the boat. <br/><br/>I also loved the scenes that showed Gatsby courting Daisy in their younger years; this was something I always wanted to see.<br/><br/>I loved DiCaprio's Gatsby. I know a few people who thought otherwise, like my mother who said Leo was too old for this. I'm sorry mom, but I found Leonardo very attractive as Gatsby and I didn't find it hard to believe. (Leo is 38, Gatsby was 32). When you see Dicaprio on screen, you can tell that this was the role that he had been waiting to play. You could see him transform into this character. He showed us the character's obsession, delusion, anxiety, fear. He also brilliantly gave us a taste of Gatsby's volcanic anger that had been bubbling beneath the cool exterior of a man who would otherwise be described by Daisy as always looking 'cool', mellow and transparent like the ""advertisement of a man."" <br/><br/>--What I DIDN'T enjoy--<br/><br/>The first scene in which we see Gatsby driving Nick around in the Yellow car; bring your motion sickness pills! <br/><br/>I didn't like that they were trying to infer that Gatsby had taken Daisy's virginity. That didn't happen, in fact, I'm not sure Daisy EVER actually had sex with Gatsby. Daisy was supposed to be a delicate flower, the 'golden girl,' the débutante. <br/><br/>I didn't like the choice in music. Usually I love Baz Luhrmann's choice for his soundtracks. His ""Romeo + Juliet"" used modern music--but that was because it was 'Romeo & Juliet' set in modern times-- and his ""Moulin Rouge"" also successfully used modern music, but with ""The Great Gatsby"" this didn't work at all for me. It just felt awkwardly out of place. I came to the movies to escape modernity! To be brought back to the time of the roaring twenties! And why didn't they include the ""Ain't we got fun"" song? That was a song actually specifically mentioned in the book, and it served a purpose to the story! Also, I didn't like the film's choice for the character of Klipspringer....he looked too much like a hippie version of Kenny G. <br/><br/>Baz did what no director should EVER try to do: attempt to change Great Classic American Literature. Luhrmann went beyond taking creative liberties when he made Nick Carraway the author of ""The Great Gatsby"", writing it out at a sanitarium for alcoholics. M'kay. We all know it was F.Scott Fitzgerald who wrote the book...... and as F.Scott once wrote in a letter to Hollywood director/producer Joseph Mankiewicz: ""For nineteen years, I have written best-selling entertainment and my dialogue is supposedly right up at the top, but I learned from the script that you've suddenly decided it isn't good. Oh Joe, can't producers ever be wrong? I'm a good writer——honest!"" - F.Scott Fitzgerald. I agree with F.Scott, leave the storytelling to him!<br/><br/>I didn't like Daisy's hairstyle, I think it should have been a finger-waved bob. There were a couple dresses she wore that I thought were the wrong choice, but there were also many costumes she wore that I liked. <br/><br/>I thought whoever was in charge of makeup fell short. One thing that really bothered me were the scenes involving Myrtle's death. When they pulled the cover off of Myrtle, the injuries (cuts, bruises etc) looked so fake to me; it looked like the work of a high school drama production. Another place where I saw makeup issues was with Myrtle's sister where there was a close up on her face and her lipstick was flaking off of her chapped lips, and then in the next frame it would disappear.<br/><br/>Continuity errors, for example: when Gatsby arrives at the cottage doors he is completely soaked from head to toe from the rain. Then suddenly we see him sitting in the chair and he is completely dry. <br/><br/>We never get to see Jay's father Mr. Gatz come after Gatsby dies."
"lyusako","10","2","4","20 May 2013"," Have never written a review for a movie, but people are starting to get on my nerves...
","I am going to begin by saying that I have no idea why people have these grand expectations when going to see a film based on a book. You should all get used to the fact that a movie will very rarely be as good as the book. It is simply impossible to address all the subtle details and emotions in film, whereas it is much easier done in writing. With that being said, I have to say that I did not expect this movie to be as accurate and as amazing as the book is. It is beautifully done film. It is a pleasure to watch and the soundtrack makes it interesting and different (even though in the first 5 minutes the modern music felt kind of awkward). But as the movie progresses, you get captivated by the characters, which are all so different.<br/><br/>One this I have to say is, you will never enjoy this movie to the fullest if you have not read the book. (And if you say you did, then you're just kidding yourself, sorry).<br/><br/>I look at this movie as a supplement to the book. Your mind can take you one that far...this movie helps to better visualize what F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to describe (This is especially helpful for those who don't know what America was like in that time period).<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie is cast very well. Not sure about Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher...imagined them sort of differently when reading the book, but it doesn't really matter once you are actually watching the movie. The visuals are obviously great and the music is also awesome! (Favorite is the last track of the soundtrack, just the violins).<br/><br/>Read the book. Don't expect a masterpiece, and enjoy! I sure did!!!! :)"
"tdub154420","9","2","4","20 May 2013"," Chaotic, frantic, and emotional with heavy handed imagery. Exactly how Gatsby should be.
","I hadn't read any critic's reviews on this piece before seeing this movie, I finally did the right thing and saw a movie for myself without letting pretense, opinion or bias of another individual interfere with my experience. But going into the movie I did understand that many critics' reviews were not favorable. After seeing this movie I am absolutely baffled at how this could be so.<br/><br/>First off, this movie is a fairly accurate representation of the novel. All of the key moments of the book are left nearly intact and if changed they are simply subject of stylistic interpretation. Which brings me to my next point: stylistic choices. I can only assume this is where this film lost favor with the critics. The style of this film is gaudy, hectic and downright blurred with chaos at some points. I found this to be a wonderful choice for the film as it compliments the tone of much of the film perfectly. The editing shows great attention to pace as the film dazzles with decadent splendor, taking care with appropriate segues of narration, and drawing out pace as the film's mood takes a dive into desperation. At times the film nearly bludgeons the audience with emotion and it attempts to brainwash you with the novel's famous symbolic images, but this was something I expected, however, as this was the experience I recalled from when I first experienced the novel.<br/><br/>The performances are not without their notability either. The charming yet tortured character of Gatsby could not be portrayed by anyone better than Leonardo Dicaprio. As for Tobey McGuire, he conveys Nick Carraway's self conscious journey amongst the nihilistic American bourgeois in a careful and precise manner. I cannot imagine any two pair of actors playing these parts better than these two.<br/><br/>In the end I believe that anyone who is a fan of the novel will be a fan of this movie. This movie does not suffer from any fundamental film making short comings. If one finds fault with this movie its most likely because they are at a disagreement with some of the director's stylistic choices. Heck, it may upset people to hear hip hop so often interjected into a period piece, but as it cross-fades with many interesting jazz tunes it must be recognized as yet another stylistic choice. I sincerely appreciated the entertainment value as well as the artistic endeavors of this film. It conveyed a unique interpretation of the novel that I found emotionally poignant and thought provoking. The film maybe a gaudy blur, but in the end it accentuated the most memorable images and lines from the original novel and it reminded me why the Great Gatsby is an American classic."
"vishal657","7","2","4","19 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby is a cinematic, dramatic & visual feast.
","One of the most awaited Hollywood movie this year. Based on a novel, its a story of Gatsby, more accurately a love story of Gatsby. Set in the New York City of 1920s, The Great Gatsby a cinematic, dramatic & visual feast. 3D effects makes it immensely absorbing and attractive. The grand sets, the attire, cinematography, music, dialogues & performances, everything together creates impressive scenery on the screen.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire-aka Spider man), who is the cousin brother of Daisy (Carey Mulligan) , who is married to one the richest man of America, Tom Buchanan, & is also the ex of Mr. Gatsby. <br/><br/>Mr. Gatsby is a mystery. Nobody has exact clue about what he does and from where he got millions of money. Some says he is a spy, some says a murder, for some he is an Oxford man, a war fighter, a drug dealer, a Mafia & interestingly some believes he does not even exist. But he does, he has money, depth in his mind, has desires, determination, passion & most importantly hope (as reminded by the narrator time and again). <br/><br/>Gatsby throws the most glittering party of NYC, time and again, but he invites nobody. Interestingly, in NYC, if it's Gatsby's party, it is understood that whole of NY is invited. Glamour, glitz, alcohol, drugs, girls, music (Jaz), dance floor, you can have all of them, as much you want, at no cost. He has bureaucrats, administrative people, wealthy people, celebrities and all, as guest, in his parties. He is respectable to all of them. Nobody knows (or even care to know) the reason for these parties. But he had the reason. Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's, his ex, love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man, Mr. Buchanan. He planned his reunion with Daisy and took help of her cousin, who is also his neighbour, Nick. <br/><br/>The first half an hour tries to baffle you in the name of Jay Gatsby. Director, Baz Luhrmann, unsuccessfully tried to create hysteria of Gatsby. But, when he really appears, some 30 minutes later, smiling, dressed elegantly & talking gracefully, you feel like on cloud nine. <br/><br/>I am a Leo fan and firmly believes that he is the best we have today. Leonardo Di Caprio, as Jay Gatsby, is a treat to watch. He is undoubtedly the most ( successfully) experimenting actors, who keeps balance of both commercial & artistic aspects, in the world today. Whenever you see him, you do not want to see anything else. After playing a cruel plantation owner in Django UnChained, he is immensely convincing as a baffling lover, who has a father like figure, who guides him in his works, played by none other than Amitabh Bacchan. Mr. Bacchan, in an special appearance (which according to him is not his Hollywood debut but a friendly gesture to the director) left his mark as an actor, unlike Anil Kapoor in Mission Impossible. He was raw. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire, the narrator, has in fact more footage than Gatsby himself. You see the film through his eyes & heart. But that's where films negative point lies, if there are any. Carey Mulligan, as Daisy, and Joel Edgerton, as Tom Buchanan are good. Particularly Joel Edgerton played MR. Buchanan, a rich American, polo player & flamboyant to the core. <br/><br/>Script is a delight. NYC going through changes, post World War I, in 1920s is, off course, a work of imagination but it works like magic. Screenplay and cinematography are top notch. Dialogues are impressive, & the best part is you don't have to see dictionary to understand them. They are simple but have sole and wit in them. <br/><br/>Overall, The Great Gatsby is a love story of selflessness which has some really good looking dishes on the supper table with an average starters, but good main course and desserts. Anything less than 7/10 will be an underestimation of this charming tale. What say ""old sport"" ??"
"lisamaria142","6","2","4","19 May 2013"," Misses on subtlety, scores on lead
","Let me start off by saying I have an automatic bias: I've read the original novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, so this review is coming from the standpoint of someone who knows and enjoys the story. <br/><br/>Now let's talk about some good things in this movie. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job as Gatsby, he was perfect for such a complex role. He never overdid it or underplayed Gatsby which I appreciated. He played the character very well and you could feel his hopefulness and blindly romantic personality radiate from the screen. Carey Mulligan wasn't too bad either. I've heard complaints about Tobey Macguire's performance, but I honestly didn't mind. None of the actors were awful, most were either OK or did really well. I also loved the costumes and the actual parties of the movies. I don't know how accurate any of it is (although I suspect some of the party scenes were a little too modernized, but we'll get to that in a minute), but it was visually pleasing. The changes to the story were obvious but didn't distract.<br/><br/>Now on to some of my complaints. I think a million people have said this already but I want to say it again: the symbolism. Fitzgerald was a master at weaving in subtle symbols and parallel metaphors with each of his stories. In the book, the green light is talked about maybe once and then at the end. Here, it's every five minutes. I know the director must have wanted everyone to understand it, but shoving it in our faces is not the way to go. The audience can think for themselves, so it's up to them to draw their own conclusions. The end result of Gatsby's blind ambition is detracted somewhat because the green light isn't as powerful as in the book. Some of the music choices I completely disagreed with: Kanye West, Jay Z, and some form of Dubstep in a movie set in 1920's? I understand the need to connect with a modern audience, and it worked in Romeo and Juliet. But it only worked because Romeo and Juliet is a story that can be told at any time (seriously, does anyone actually know off the top of their head what year it's set in?). The Great Gatsby is suppose to be set in the 1920's and can only be set in that time period because that decade created these characters and those circumstances. There had to be a stock market boom, there had to be a war, there had to be a shift in the way people lived their life. So to try and modernize it with 2013 rapping is kind of an insult to the book.<br/><br/>My final major complaint is the editing. I don't know how many times the focus switched sporadically between Daisy and Nick in that one conversation at the beginning of the movie, but it was distracting. It felt like the movie was going much too quickly, it kept jumping here, there and everywhere.<br/><br/>My final review? Other then the subtlety, the editing and the music, it's a pretty good movie. The atmosphere is solid and you get drawn into this world quite easily. I say check it out, if not for the sole reason of DiCaprio's performance, because he is indeed, the Great Gatsby."
"yaldish","6","2","4","16 May 2013"," The typical Hollywood version of the 20's - 6/10
","Nope, I have not read the novel, but I hope that is a good thing compared to what I saw. Jay Gatsby, played by Leonardo DiCaprio who I've had some problems with in his past movies; I always thought that the movies he's been in are better than what he brings to the table as an actor. I couldn't see the character he was playing, I always saw DiCaprio doing the same thing but with different clothes and different names, and believe me when I say this, a lot of people patronize me for not liking him as an actor even though I do think that he has given us somewhat good performances (not great and Oscar worthy). But in this case, it was actually the other way around, the movie was actually a lot worse than what he was (not saying that he was bad), or let me put it like this, every actor in this film was much better at acting than the director Baz Luhrmann, at directing.<br/><br/>The reason for that is one reason, and one reason only; F. Scott Fitzgerald. I think it is an actors dream to play one of his well written characters, therefore, all the actors could do their best and get lost in their characters. Whenever I found myself liking the movie it was thanks to the actors and their performances that felt real. There is a scene in it where Buchanan reveals Gatsbys real identity in the hotel room and Gatsby just goes mental at him, not only did it feel as if Buchanan was pushing Gatsby to his limit, but it felt as if Edgerton was pushing DiCaprio to his limit and that's what made this movie work for me, the chemistry between the actors. <br/><br/>If things were a bit more physical and ""real"", I would've liked this movie somewhat more (I'm very happy that I did not see it in 3D), but if it was his intention not to do so then I guess he got the vision he wanted. I loved all the characters in this movie, but the movie itself was at times very annoying to watch with all its special effects and 2012's music (which by the way didn't fit in at all). The movie also had this typical Hollywood version of the 20's which I absolutely hate, where everything looks fancy, dreamy and colorful and makes people wish they had lived back then, when the reality is that it's all just the other way around. All the special effects changed the whole tone of the movie and made it into a fairytale, and there I was, who actually found the story quite depressing and sort of dark. This, in the end left me a bit annoyed because I know that had the movie been a bit dark as the story itself, it would have left me a lot more troubled - instead, Gatsby became that guy that no one cared about, not even me."
"clausrobert3","8","2","4","13 May 2013"," Better than I expected
","1. I don't like the director or his previous work. 2. I have never liked Leonardo DiCaprio. That being said I went in with very low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the book when I first read it, and to me this movie captured it perfectly. Everyone was perfectly cast, and it followed the book almost completely, something some movie adaptations of books refuse to do. I thought the rap soundtrack would throw me off, but the decadence of the modern culture matches up well with the decadence of the roaring twenties.In fact, a lot of parallel's could be drawn between the 1920's and the more decadent elements of the modern world, Gatsby's house is something you would see shamelessly displayed on cribs, though Mr. Gatsby has far more class and humanity than any modern imitators. It is also a wonderful condemnation of the party lifestyle that is omnipresent in our modern world. This is one of the best adaptations of any book to film that I have ever seen."

","A man and woman fall in love, but due to their circumstances they can't be together, due to lack of security that he couldn't give to Daisy, or he didn't feel he deserved her because he couldn't give her the material happiness, security that she needed. Gatsby spends his life making things for her, to make her happy gaining all material needs and comforts so that finally they could be together in peace. This sort of understanding made Gatsby to be someone, to have something in order to receive love. Yes sometimes when you meet love of your life you don't feel like deserving the person and take sometime for each other to develop the trust, test and ability to value each other, or the circumstances might not let them to be together. But in this situation Gatsby has gone to gain material possessions also lot of fame and finally he has it all just to share with daisy but things don't go that way and he finally dies having lived for her and owned so much of possessions. Considering all these, for one to deserve, or accept, or receive love, should one own the possessions and riches to share with the beloved, or is there another motive to self approval or validation needed in order to receive love and accept?

","I was honestly in a trance for about 4/5 days after seeing this in the cinema - it was all I could think about, and I'm still obsessed.<br/><br/>Every single frame is exquisite, the attention to detail of the costumes and the set design is insane, and it feels almost immersive - like you are slap bang in the middle of all the opulence. The music choices were impeccable, particularly the songs from Watch the Throne (Jay-Z / Kanye West) which didn't seem out of place whatsoever. The songs by Lana Del Rey & Florence & The Machine were truly haunting, and I still get chills whenever I hear them.<br/><br/>No other actor could have mastered the role of Gatsby quite like Leonardo DiCaprio. The scene in the Plaza hotel is breathtaking - the tension created between Gatsby & Tom is heightened massively by the stifling heat in the room, and I found this actually quite claustrophobic to watch. After Tom deliberately antagonises Gatsby, you can physically see DiCaprio's entire body convulse. The horror in his eyes when he realises he has let Tom get the better of him is so heartbreaking to watch - though is a testament to DiCaprio's acting skills.<br/><br/>The narrative style is excellent, and I particularly loved the way some of the words were written on screen as Nick said them.<br/><br/>Gatsby's origin story was beautifully shot, and almost comes around full circle with his younger & older self still grasping for more. Though I feel he was way too much of an idealist, and expected a little too much of Daisy at times, his hope for a better life for himself was quite inspiring.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is a TREAT to the eyes, and Gatsby was definitely ""worth the whole damn bunch put together"""

Yes, it's gorgeous, fast and dazzling. Maybe it's the embodiment of paper intoxication in Chinese. However, it's not Gatsby as we understand it, or Gatsby as Fitzgerald.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the novel, Fitzgerald's description is calm, motionless, or there is another famous saying, which is ambiguous. This style runs through the whole novel.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It's the distance between the novel and the film that makes me not dare to say how well the film is shot. I can only say, well, it's also an interpretation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Both Mulligan and DiCaprio are my favorite actors. Daisy's appearance is still amazing. Of course, Mulligan's performance is satisfactory to me, and Leonardo has no obvious flaws.<br/><br/><br/><br/>But it can't hide the clumsiness of computer technology in expressing a feeling. That kind of technology is gorgeous sometimes and fake big empty is just one meaning.<br/><br/><br/><br/>And Lana diori's voice is just like that of a computer. No matter how gorgeous and retro, it's still a plastic face, which is not in line with our impression of the great prosperity of the jazz age. Although I like this soundtrack and am very happy with the rap and wall street bull market, I can't help but remind myself that this is not an MV after all, it should be a movie."

The movie does best when slowed down, the scenes between Jay and Nick are splendidly emotional and sincere. (I Beckie getting two childhood friends to play friends was a excellent idea). As well as Leo's portrayal of Gatsby being excellent. He seems to understand the character and it's intense outsider ness. He can easily poetry the rich and feeble having everything prepared for him, but also shows his hidden understanding for simple life. Gatsby original poor life can seep through his wealthy persona. Almost as if he's, in his pursuit of wealth and fame, forgot how to be normal. It shows a great progression or should I say depression of character to the point that his character is sympathetic, no matter how random or childish he acts, you understand his reason.<br/><br/>Overall the story is great, one of the classics but the editing can come off as annoying and sometimes ruins parts of the film.

","This romantic drama is based on the well-known novel, 'The Great Gatsby', which was written by F. S. Fitzgerald in 1925. It is the most vivid representation of the Jazz Age novels. The production of the movie started in 2011 and it was shown on screen in 2013. It is set in 1922 on Long Island and was directed by Baz Luhrmann. Some of his famous works include Moulin Rouge! (2001), Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Australia (2008). Jay Gatsby, played by the brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio, is the best possible fit for this role. Tobey Maguire, who is known for his role in Spider-Man (2002), plays Nick Carraway.

That will soon change.<br/><br/>This is a very beautiful and refined movie, executed in exquisite taste. The beauty of the visuals defies the imagination.

","Once again Baz Luhrmann proves that his philosophy of film-making is surface deep. This is all about excessive visuals, to the degree that it just looks vulgar and tacky, and at the expense of every human aspect of the story.<br/><br/>As with almost every Baz Luhrmann-film, I sat through this one without feeling anything for any of the characters."

","It's Baz through and through, it's wild and zippy and kooky and incredibly entertaining and creative even when it's completely and unnecessarily OTT.<br/><br/>In 3D the film really comes alive, it's been designed expertly for it and at its best it fully draws you in, holds up throughout and is complex and considered. At worst it throws you amidst Baz's typical disorientating editing.<br/><br/>Like many adaptations of classics, it will always fail to represent the elements and moments of the books that I personally connected to. But it makes many other moments crackle and shine and take on new life. And while the casting is all wrong, DiCaprio as Gatsby is elegant and perfect.<br/><br/>The framing device is clever and the fall of Carraway's character is well realised. Baz's way of bringing the roaring 20's to life with crisp high def visuals and modern music creates a unique and extremely enticing flick. The background fidelity and VFX are among the best I've ever seen and almost feel like a graphic novel. Somebody give this man a good comic property to adapt.<br/><br/>The photography, design, choreography and sheer bravado and sureness is a thing of wonder and while it can't save it from being a tonal mess and a relentless study in following weird editing and in excess and bizzare adaptation. But every frame pops in scintillating detail and creative wit."

With great use of set decoration, costumes, and special effects, he has turned the film into great entertainment.<br/><br/>The timing of the film is appropriate as well. The indulgences of the rich in the 1920s and their indifference to the rest of society is not unlike our current times. The themes of secret love, old money vs. new money, and ironic tragedy make this a fine journey although the lack of informing the audience of the fate of some major characters seems to leave a hole considering the story is told in flashback."

She tells everybody what they wish to hear and stole Gatsby's, Tom's and everyone's hearts by her magic.<br/><br/>Realistic: Her famous quote about her daughter was ""I hope she'll be a fool; That's the best thing a girl in this world can be, a *beautiful little *fool."" *Beautiful to marry a rich man and live a luxury life (like herself). *Fool (not like herself) to ignore the boredom, the affair of the rich man (like Tom), and living in the lie.<br/><br/>Materialistic: When she found out about the fortune of Gatsby.

Great Gatsby-Final Project
Artistic Value- The Great Gatsby is a film that has many artistic values, which makes the storytelling very good. Its use of innovative style is what has made it such a great film. The use of modern and high-class clothing apparel throughout the film makes it interesting for the audience. Along with different use of camera angles, it provides the audience to really catch the emotions of the character. With these camera angles, it makes the audience feel as if they are part of the film. Artistically the camera is always zooming in or out really fast to capture all of the chaos and parties. But when the camera is on Gatsby it is very still and focused, to to show his deep purity and internal secrets/thoughts that he's holding on to. The Great Gatsby also has done a good job, with its style of music, it has a very modern twist to the 20's style of music. Every song throughout the film has played an important part because it helps the audience get entertained, and puts them on a dancing mood.
The film also has great use of color and lighting, from the warm and cool colors of their clothes to the lighting to capture all the parties and close up scenes. This film had more of non-diegetic style rather than diegetic, because of the music playing on the background and the cast talking to each other.
Entertainment Value- The popularity of this film is the storyline, the writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald's, The Great Gatsby captures and reflects America in the 1920s, shows how the corruption and the obsession of the American people through wealth and status, however it also tells us a love story; Gatsby is in love with someone who he thought loved him back. Gatsby never stopped loving her and he always did things just to see her and be with her. This has made this film to be known as a Classic; a film that won't get old throughout the years. It has become a film that many people have enjoyed and they continue to do so. A couple of scenes that have stood out the most were when Gatsby is shot from behind as he's coming out of the pool, he was waiting to receive a call from Daisy. A very powerful scene was when Gatsby's last words were "" Daisy,"" this proved just how much he really loved her. He never lost hope and his love for her even though she wasn't the one who called the day he got shot. Another scene would have to be when Gatsby and Daisy are gathered with everyone in a room just hanging out and it was a very thrilling scene, because Gatsby was about to tell Daisy's husband who he truly was.
Literary Value- Throughout the film Gatsby has always been a very confident man, he has a lot going on but still manages to show those around him that he is doing fine. One of his internal conflicts would be the love he has for Daisy. He just can't seem to let her go. She was the love of his life when they were younger and before he went to war. He had high hopes that when he came home he would be reunited with her, but came home only to realize she was already with someone else. But this didn't stop him from trying to be with her. Gatsby did many parties in high hopes that one day Daisy would attend and could be with her once again. This all has been a huge conflict with himself. But one of the people who was truly there for him and could see who he truly was; someone who was in love and just trying to get things in his life back together was Nick, he looked up to him, he was one of the few people that Gatsby impacted in his life. Nick was there when Gatsby passed away and no one of the many people who would attend his huge parties were there. He realized just how Daisy truly was, because she wasn't even there when Gatsby passed away.
Educational Value- In this film there are so many scenes that we can learn from and use it in our own type of lifestyle. For example in the film Gatsby does so many things for Daisy but did she ever thank him for everything he was doing for her? Gatsby would throw parties for Daisy hoping that one day she would show up, but never did. This film also shows us that no matter how much we love someone, if they don't already love you for who you are, then it doesn't matter how many changes we make because you will never win, you will never be satisfied. Another thing we can learn from this film is that you can't buy someones love with money. That's simple a phrase; you can't just be spending money everywhere, and whenever you want because that person might not love you back, but we gotta live through it, we can't give up on love. Gatsby didn't give up, he kept going after Daisy, he even ended up passing away but with his last words being Daisy.
In conclusion, I liked The Great Gatsby film. The film was really good, I just didn't like how it ended on a tragedy. I would recommend this movie, I say 10/10. I loved the characters, color and very lighting that was created with the parties or when they would make the camera angles move and how they would make it look like we are there experiencing everything with them."

","Before watching The Great Gatsby, I was wondering to postpone watching it. once the film started, for the next 143 minutes I didn't understand the passage of time.
It is a 2013 American romantic drama film based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel of the same name, directed by Baz Luhrmann. It is the story of a mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby (by Leonardo DiCaprio) and His only Love of Life. the cast were perfect, Leonardo DiCaprio had an awesome performance, and he was completely successful in showing the complexity of his character. The visual effects of the movie were also excellent, colors, designs and costumes were wonderful.
Mixing modern music with 1920 music was maybe one of the weaknesses of Baz Luhrman great Gatsby. (really disappointing)
After all, if you're going to watch the movie with the idea of comparing it with the book you will spend an awful 2 hours and half, but if you watch it like every other film which are telling a story it is definitely worth seeing."

","I think this movie will suit anyone who loved Moulin Rouge. Unfortunately I didn't and this movie suffered from the same drawbacks for me. It was too garish, loud and modern in it's soundtrack. I love the era of the 1920s and love the music as well, so I would have preferred some suitable music. Baz Luhrmann's flair is well known and he is very talented. The cast are very good and the story (as far as I know) was shown well. But it didn't suit me and so I can't rate it highly. I love Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire, and I liked most of the other cast members. Leonardo DiCaprio is now an established mature actor and having recently seen The Aviator, his Gatsby reminded me of Howard Hughes in terms of his excesses (although not in his paranoia). Just a cautionary note that the visuals are very hectic and this is not your typical costume drama, but the anyone who know Luhrmann's style should know that."

","I never had read the book but because of Dicaprio and Decki's birthday, I thought of giving this movie a try. But to my dismay, there was no character development at all. I mean no matter how hard did Maguire tried to elevate Dicaprio's status, it all remained flat and served no purpose. Even the writers didn't cared for showing Mulligan displaying any regret after DiCaprio's death. <br/><br/>Where was the greatness in Gatsby? He could have run an orphanage in the later half of the movie to show that: a) the movie and the book differ in each other. b) how really the movie ends in a satisfying note and surprise the audience that Gatsby was not materialistic after all.<br/><br/>The only positive part was the soundtrack and DiCaprio's romance in the cruise boat with Mulligan."

Leonardo gives a great performance as Gatsby and so does the rest of the cast. The cinematography was outstanding and made the film alluring and graceful. However better direction could have made the film more dramatic. Perhaps the film could have been arranged differently with the use of voice overs or other techniques to heighten some parts and not others. The Great Gatsby is a classic novel but bringing it to life in a different medium is a different story altogether. Still a great watch and entertaining."

The characters are not sympathetic or interesting - more like caricatures. The depiction of Wolfshein is bordering on anti- Semitic and the Wilsons are without any depth at all. Sorry, director but Fitzgerald is simply not your forte, I will not be watching this again unlike some of the earlier film versions which I have watched over and over and still get something different each time."
"RossRivero99","6","0","0","20 February 2017"," Decent, but not good or great
","The reason why I say that Baz Luhrmann's adaptation is terribly overrated is because this movie is supposed to be based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel but the movie doesn't stay true to the book more than book to film adaptations normally do even though I am not normally a person to criticize a movie because of those factors, though I won't give anything major to this film away in this review. This time around the movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby who is a well known businessman and is one of the richest if not the richest person where he lives. There are a lot of key major differences between this movie and the Robert Redford version that was made 39 years earlier. This movie also depicts Gatsby as a man who has parties in a modern fashion but another key problem I had with this movie is also that it didn't completely stay true to the period in which the story was supposed to be set in.<br/><br/>Also this movie despite having such a good cast the movie is horribly over-acted, and the only thing I liked about the film was the production design and the costumes.<br/><br/>Also in this movie are the accurate characters such as Daisy (Carey Mulligan),Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton),George Wilson (Jason Clarke) and his wife Myrtle (Isla Fisher), as well as Gatsby's good friend that he met in the beginning of the movie Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire).<br/><br/>However there are some things that director Baz Luhrmann actually got right, such as the love affair between Gatsby and Daisy, the ""old sport"" exchange between Gatsby and Tom, and many other scenes.<br/><br/>In the end I didn't like or dislike this movie but even though the movie deserved the two Oscars that it won three years ago. I happen to think that if it stayed true to the period, and wasn't over-acted, that it could have been a better movie (even though it was good) with a hell of a lot better storytelling it was an OK movie even though I do agree with what Roger Ebert once said about accuracy in movies to Gene Siskel in which he said that ""A movie doesn't have to be accurate in order to be good."""
"vasco_cid","6","0","0","16 January 2017"," Razzle-Dazzle Gatsby
","Luhrmann is an exceptional director. Not in the sense that he is extraordinarily competent, consistent and deep, but rather he is a one of a kind visual pioneer. His fast paced, unusual, anachronic dazzling and lush visual signature though are not suitable for every material.<br/><br/>With Moulin Rouge! he gave us an extraordinarily unusual film where his ecstatic style could exist and had more than enough room to grow. While The Great Gatsby material allows for some of such liberties to exist, Luhrmann lacks editorial notion: while the partying flair is on point, all the rest is taken either too far or too short at times. The characters motivations and inner struggles are completely overwhelmed by the overbearing sets, cinematography and score (all of them amazing truth be told) and music video-like editing that never allows us to delve or empathize with them. Luhrmann even manages to make DiCaprio feel flat and out of place and Mulligan miscast. What we are left with is a 2-hour-plus long music video with talking passages, that while visually stunning and musically memorable, feels frustrating considering the source material's potentials and the talent involved."
"ronincunningham","6","0","0","15 December 2016"," A story of love nobody truly cares for
","Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" was an interesting mix of a bunch of parties, CGI, and a love story. Gatsby's longing for his lover, Daisy, seemed too forced and shallow for one to care for. The film seemed too over saturated with the CGI and fast cuts. Too much relocation of the eyes were required to figure out what was going on in a particular shot. It's as if I was watching the new Jason Bourne action flick with every shot being less than 2 seconds, which really hinders the film's feeling of a grand spectacle. The sound was off as well. There was too much unnecessary sound effects, especially with the ringing hymn of the green light/ring every 5 minutes. I went into this movie expecting a traditional story and feeling of the roaring 20s, not an old story adapted with an overly modern score to replace the amazing jazz music of that era.<br/><br/>Eyes play an important role in the Great Gatsby. Eyes are a symbol of the rich overlooking the poor, almost as if they own the large working class. The haunting feeling of one person sitting at home enjoying life with all of their money bossing around the other 95% of the people which makes up the working class. The billboard was situated to be erected right in the middle of the bad industrial part of the town (The Valley of Ashes). It can also be interpreted as a higher being looking down onto American society as a whole, and it being disappointed of how shallow people are in the context of the rich people covering up their act with all of their glamorous items of pleasure, and in return, they demoralize the common person. People lost their true moral values to get external pleasures, and the eyes can see through this fatal flaw of mankind.<br/><br/>The opening lines of the film relate to these eyes because Nick's father gave him the advice of always trying to see the best in people. This reflects how the eyes see through the people, but the difference is is that at that time (20s) there was no best in most people. It mostly just consisted of humans partying and not contributing anything important or worthwhile. This opening line says it all ""And none of us contributed anything new. When I came back from New York, I was disgusted....Disgusted with everyone and everything."" Another symbol is the green light. It's as if Gatsby was always looking at it because he wanted to reach further, and advance his life even more even though he should just look back onto his life and notice that he has it pretty good already. The green light is situated away from his house across the water, while all of his life and his big house is situated behind him towards his back.<br/><br/>Daisy and Tom represent the old rich. They have their status and their wealth through family history. They are the stereotypical rich, high class people. On the other hand, Mr. Gatsby is the new rich. Although he seems at first to be just another rich person, underneath he stands out from the rest of the population in that he comes from humble beginnings and he is a truly caring person. Daisy goes with Tom instead of Gatsby because he has status. If Daisy leaves him, she loses that status and all of the wealth that goes with it. This is why she went with him in the first place. When Gatsby was in the war, Daisy wrote Gatsby a letter saying she has no money. Therefore, she married Buchanan, following a shot of him wrapping a plentiful amount of pearls around her neck.<br/><br/>There are four main locations in the film. The first being West egg, then East Egg, then New York, and The Valley of Ashes. West egg represents the new rich, which encompasses people such as Mr. Gatsby. East Egg represents the old rich, which includes Tom Buchanan. New York represents the action and the central location where most the fun happens. And The Valley of Ashes represents the poor working class of the population, where people like George Wilson reside."
"Paul_Punch","2","0","0","27 June 2016"," The 1974 film disguised as a 2013 film
","Baz Luhrmann is an accomplished Hollywood director, no doubt about it. However, when he created this movie he really must have had his fingers crossed that no one out there actually watched Jack Clayton's 1974 adaptation of The Great Gatsby because it is 92% a scene for scene rehash of the same exact movie(which btw wasn't well received which makes me wonder why originality was not discussed in the boardroom meetings). Quick copy checklist between the 1974 and 2013 films..Opening filming sequence introducing Tom and Daisy Buchanan along with Jordan Baker to Nick Carraway in the living room at the Buchanan household, COPY CHECK√ ..The Jay Gatsby logo JG, COPY CHECK√ The first meeting between Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby at the Carraway house, COPY CHECK√ even the dirt road with the forks outside Tom and Myrtle Wilson's gas station where the billboard of the ever-watchful eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg lay, COPY CHECK√. Lots more, but I like to keep it short+sweet. Call it an unfair review but when you translate book to film you create magic the first time, and the only way to duplicate that magic a second time and so on is by being bold, daring and fresh. In an era of crowd pleasing movies where the audience begs and cries for originality (Inception, TY Mr. Christopher Nolan) I am not sure how this movie made it past the green light phase. Leonardo Dicaprio's name and presence alone probably is the only reason why you or anyone else in 2013 who watched it, watched it. Thank goodness he is an intellectual actor and went on to star in better and greater films and Oscar glory (Wolf of Wall Street and The Revenant). Sorry Mr. Luhrmann, I'm sure it's not your fault this movie came out, bad pieces of celluloid are usually the brainchild of many.

","I read the novel ages ago and agree it is a literary classic, though I also still believe it is *not* a ""great American novel."" Actually, it is F. Scott Fitzgerald who convinces me that there probably is no such thing. There are great works, great writing, great stories, &c., but no, no such thing as a great American novel. However, I *do* believe there is such a thing as a great (American optional) movie, er, film. Australians do qualify.<br/><br/>2 stars for production, set & scenery, costumes and makeup. Minus 1 star for CGI scenery & blue screen. Even in one scene when they are sitting indoors (I forgot which, maybe the waiting for 4 o'clock one) and there's a window in the back to the right showing the outdoors, I almost felt that what I was seeing out of the window was CGI. Even if I'm wrong, that's the impression I get, which is a bad impression to give to the viewer. The long lens overhead shots and so on of the city, Long Island,&c.--totally CGI and unnecessarily so polished that they actually look fake and ugly, ugly in a bad way not in an artsy fartsy way. Gatsby's palace belongs at Disney World. The smaller sets were better than the overall design. Nice pool.<br/><br/>1 star only for the screenplay. It lost a second star due to the awful dialogue and lack of narrative cohesiveness. The musical interludes, party, horn player on a balcony, &c., really interrupt the storytelling for flashy social commentary that don't really work for me. I think they were trying to make that part of the Fitzgerald story subtle but I think they failed. No, those elements did not entertain. The story flatlines for at least the first 30 minutes and doesn't get a heartbeat until we meet Leondardo Di'Gatsby.<br/><br/>1 star for music & sound. No second star due to the awful use of contemporary music. It's one thing to say that truly great music is timeless and one can almost lift this music here from this era and plop it into that spot there in that era. But to go backwards is not always a smart idea. Jazz can easily stand on its own TODAY, even in its early times like the Roarin' 20s, so why not just let the music of the era shine? Rapping on the soundtrack--sorry guys, the pieces selected are not going to stand the test of time, so I felt they were inappropriate. Dubstep: yeah, right. Have you seen them try to do the swing and Charleston to that stuff? Doesn't look as energetic or fitting as the original dance music, eh? no matter how hard they tried to get the music thumping. That type of dance is not about thumping, folks, it's about quick-stepping and swiveling on the balls of your feet, not a fist pumper.<br/><br/>Two stars for the acting, each owned by Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). No more stars due to bland Tobey Maguire. No stars for the rest of the cast; they were merely adequate. Edgerton is deliciously unlikable yet sympathetic to us in the portrayal, not over the top but shows why the story must end miserably due to the privilege (but not prestige) of the haves against the have-nots that inevitably ends in carelessness taken to its logical conclusion. The mustache does most of the acting for him. DiCaprio is brilliant. It's not his fault the awful dialogue has him saying ""Old Spor'"" every other line--ugh! His body posture is nearly perfect, body language in motion is nice. Look at that seething face and the deep lean-in towards the end when they have that argument out in town and the place is sweltering hot. His seething, like a hot iron, is even hotter than a flame, not so much in terms of temperature but for what it does to the psyche. No additional stars for lack of romantic chemistry b/w Gatsby and Daisy. She actually has more on screen chemistry w/ her husband, against the story's wishes--can you believe that?<br/><br/>Editing: zero stars. I don't even want to say.<br/><br/>1 star only for the directing. I give up to 5 stars for the directing alone (Oscar quality, possibly an all-time classic). 4 stars: I highly recommend as a ""should watch"" for the year. But no, B.L. is so bad at helping out the cinematographer, especially in tight spaces like dinner/tea/lunch dialogues, his ""vision""--blech--overshadows the fluidity of the scene. Can you say too many chandeliers getting in the way at the table? Is this supposed to be some subtle hint? supporting material of the physical world mimicking/supporting the emotional and psychological world? If so, it is too heavy-handed. If not, that's just an awful distraction of glitz and glam on the screen. It is everywhere sparkly and lush, even when dust is supposed to be settling on the furniture. But no, B.L. doesn't know how to shoot a scene straight. I am neutral on the over-the-top set pieces: grand party scenes, car accident scene w/ victim slo-mo hurling through the air, &c. &c. He is directing like he's ordering around all those folks in maid & butler costumes and calls it vision, like the psychological motivator of Gatsby. One sees what Fitzgerald thinks about all that... 'nough said.<br/><br/>Production, the rest of it: zero to one stars. I took one star away from the costume and set design, &c. above. Here, I'm talking mostly the post- production and overall feel of the picture (not its look). The jewelry and hat designs outshone the sweeping gray downtown New York landscape and cut-ins and overlays over the stars and clouds and the green light. Ugh. I could go on. Point is those types of production tricks take away from Fitzgerald's nearly lyrical prose. It felt ""tricky"" not artistic.<br/><br/>OK, total something like 6 stars, which feels right to me."

","Review: How can you make a movie about the 1920's with Hip Hop music? Anyway, I thought that the original was a much better movie. You can definitely tell that this film was made by the same people who made the Romeo & Juliet remake, which also started Leonardo DiCaprio, because the director really tries to make the all time classic, hip with the music and the CGI, but I didn't think that it suited this type of movie. The original storyline was great and it really didn't need any tricks or fancy shots, which was why I they should have just left this film alone. As for the actors, Leonardo DiCaprio done a great job playing Robert Redford's part as Gatsby but I'm not a big fan of Tobey Maguire's stiff way of acting. Anyway, the film is watchable, but they should have stuck which the original content.<br/><br/>Round-Up: I can't help thinking that the love of Leonardo DiCaprio's life throughout the movie was a bit of a bitch at the end because she didn't come clean about what really happened. She didn't even turn up to the funeral, knowing that the whole thing was a lie. Anyway, Leonardo is still making people rush to the cinema to watch his movie, judging by the money that it made, which just shows that it's all about the choice of movies. I don't find him the most versatile actor, but he has definitely has great screen charisma, which directors love working with. Carrey Mulligan has this innocent way of acting were she could be committing a murder but she still looks like she can't do any wrong. Throughout the movie she can't make up her mind if she is coming or going, which causes so many problems with all of the characters, but she still manages to look like she is the guilty party. Anyway, the party scenes looks amazing but the music was a bad choice by the director.<br/><br/>Budget: $105million Worldwide Gross: $349million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there who are fans of the original and who enjoyed the remake of Romeo & Juliet. 5/10"

","A shockingly bad adaptation. Given that I haven't read the book, but as is always the case with classics, 1 knows the story fairly well without ever having done that. The fault with the movie is mainly the direction, the book and the story has a certain vibe to it, a vibe that the movie tries to capture, but the tricky thing about vibes is that they are quite hard to create on screen, and even harder to maintain. 1 simply doesn't feel the flow of this movie, it tries, but scenes and the shots and the cutaways just don't line up as they should. Added to which the acting is very bad, yes it's true, despite the all star cast the acting is very bad. Everybody is bland and empty, it's like watching people recite lines, there are a few good scenes but most of it is dull. I'm keen to blame this on the director, clearly there was a sense of miscommunication somewhere. Or perhaps it was the sets that failed to pull them into character, they certainly failed to pull me into the movie.The whole thing looks like it was done in a sound stage with cheap CGI to fill in the cracks. In short, it's a bad adaptation of an interesting novel."
"piersfoleyphotography","10","3","8","4 June 2013"," ★★★★★ The Great Gatsby
","@PiersFoleyPhoto: Gatsby shines through all the diamonds, extravagance and high class that is portrayed with a longing hope #PFPreview<br/><br/>I went into to this not really knowing what to expect, I'd read the book back in secondary school and have seen a few of Luhrmann's previous films. I was intrigued how they could work together. Knowing what he'd done with Romeo and Juliet it could safely assume that it would be modernised somewhat and would be a visual treat. Instantly you are greeted with an absolutely visually stunning film. Luhrmann's artistic direction, the stunning sets, costumes and cinematography and the seamless editing keep a high energy through the first twenty minutes or so. The modern soundtrack beautifully complements the visuals and fits strikingly seamlessly to the era. It's all a bit like a music video, and you really want to be a part of it all and you begin to feel like you are. On meeting Gatsby mid party Luhrmann slows the pace right down and you then float through like the drapes in the scene we first meet Daisy. Still with the fireworks in the background he zooms you in to the lives of the three leads and continues at the pace of Twenties slow, smooth jazz.<br/><br/>There are two occasions however when I felt thrown out of the escapist world I was immersed in on hearing reworkings of Beyoncé's Crazy in Love and Amy Winehouse's Back to Black seep in. It just inappropriately brought to mind Jay-Z (the otherwise enlightened choice of producing partner and songwriter of the film) and his wife. The two of them are hidden round the corner behind camera. Stood watching Gatsby and Carraway awaiting Daisy, Jay-Z pulls an early birthday present on Beyoncé, the promise of getting her in the movies again. And then Carey Mulligan pulls up in a car and Leo gets wet and we're back into the film. Back to Black (sung again by Beyoncé) has a somewhat more delicate working into the soundtrack but again it momentarily threw me out of the film.<br/><br/>The themes and morals of the original story could to some seem to get lost in the indulgent aesthetics but the outstanding supporting cast do play them throughout with such commanding subtlety. The tension of class and race divides, the criminal and social corruption of the prohibition era, the mania of First World War veterans drinking away their memories and 'shell-shock' is all there if you care to look for it. Luhrmann just chooses to concentrate more on the humanity of one man, and his love, and us as the audience perceiving it. This decision works and it's just as powerful as the social commentary of the era.<br/><br/>I wasn't too keen on the somewhat clichéd story telling device of Carraway writing for his therapist, not, to my memory, present in the novel. It does however serve its purpose and get the ball rolling. Tobey Maguire is fantastic as Carraway the narrator, he is the everyman, he is the audience. He like us witnesses everything that happens and similarly in powerless to change anything. What happens to Gatsby is ultimately inevitable, and he and we are the only ones left feeling the worse for it, and Maguire really does do the filmic Greek chorus justice. Carey Mulligan is mesmerisingly beautiful as Daisy; flirtatiously floating in and out of every shot. Her subtlety of emotion is extremely captivating. At times you can see her every thought process, of inner turmoil, on which path to take, all in a fleeting glance. The supporting cast are all unquestionably outstanding too but the two standouts really are Leonardo DiCaprio and Joel Edgerton. Edgerton does really well to show glimpses of sensitivity and vulnerability in Buchanan, the otherwise hard faced man of self believed righteousness. And then there's Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, once again, does not fail to bring his incredible talent to this role. Perhaps not some people's obvious choice for Gatsby after the Redford film, but for me he is so much better. Leo takes this character to a whole new level of mystery, secret and ultimate humanity. The way we as an audience witness the plot and story of Gatsby's past unfold, we witness the mastery of DiCaprio unwind and reveal the character's emotions and desires. A strong symbol throughout is Gatsby staring out towards the green light across the water from his palace; a symbol of his longing hope to be with Daisy. The shot of DiCaprio's hand reaching for the light, for me, perfectly sums up his mastery of this character. You can see that it is a hand that has worked hard to get to where it is, to impress his one true love, yet it is well taken care of by the wealth it has acquired in the process. You can see the hand desires more than anything the touch of his love, yet it is evident that he is afraid of the rejection of that love and the difficulties of gaining it. It shows infinite hope of reaching that light. That's just his hand in one shot. The rest of his performance from the secretive swagger, to the welcoming grin he gives to Carraway, the way he plays with Edgerton and the last words he utters to his love are done with sheer mastery. Leonardo DiCaprio is without a doubt in the running for the Oscar and many more awards for this role. As indeed should be all involved in this production.<br/><br/>This is one of those rarer films that you walk out of the cinema and you feel you've had the full all round film experience. Visually stunning, immersive plot and soundtrack, perfect cast and above all affecting. My favourite film by far this year. Go and watch this film while it's still in the cinema! Go and see it in 3D!"
"kluseba","3","3","8","17 May 2013"," The great boredom
","""The Great Gatsby"" is a movie that convinces with well done visual effects even though they weren't worth a 3D adaption at all. The soundtrack of the movie was also decent as well as costumes, light work and locations. Leonardo DiCaprio did another convincing job but he has also done far better before as well.<br/><br/>These are the only positive things I could tell you about this boring movie based on a horribly overrated novel. There are so many bad points that I honestly don't really know where to start. The story is extremely lame and predictable. The main love story never managed to touch me even though I'm a rather emotional and romantic person. Even the disgusting and evil characters didn't evoke any kind of emotion in me. The only moments where something finally happens in the movie are maybe the last thirty minutes and it's not all too breathtaking neither. The first two hours are almost event-less and there isn't any character development neither. The acting is superficial and simply forgettable. It has been a while since I have seen a movie with such a bad and exchangeable acting. Especially the narrator and main character didn't give me anything at all and remained absolutely faceless. The movie tried to criticize the mindless life of the roaring twenties but its attempt remained dull and vague.<br/><br/>In the end, I was close to leave my local movie theatre several times and the film was really hard to sit through after all. This drama has a lot of lengths, includes mostly faceless actors and focuses on an ordinary story line that could be told in three lines and that doesn't carry a movie with an overrated length of two hours and a half. The costumes and effects are okay but not worth your money for an expensive 3D screening.<br/><br/>In the end, as a fan of many movies centred around the roaring twenties and the depressive thirties in the United States of America (from ""The Godfather"" over ""Once Upon A Time In America"" up to ""Gangster Squad"") and also as a fan of Leonardon DiCaprio in many of his movies (""Titanic"", ""Inception"", ""Shutter Island"") I was really disappointed by this flick. I wouldn't watch it again and would recommend you to avoid this content-less piece of glam and glitter at all costs."

","The worst movie I've seen in a long time."
"bryank-04844","8","2","5","23 August 2015"," 'The Great Gatsby' is worth seeing and might just be the best adaptation yet of the iconic novel.
","This is far from the first time someone has tried to adapt 'The Great Gatsby' to screen. Previous attempts include a 1926 silent film, a 1949 version directed by Elliot Nugent ('My Favorite Brunette'), the 1974 film with Robert Redford, and a 2000 television movie that starred Paul Rudd. I've seen the latter two, and while I enjoyed some of the performances, both came up weak in the end. Now we have Luhrmann, who seems to have blended Fitzgerald's novel with his own 'Moulin Rouge!' and given it a good wash. While its grand 3D visuals, techno-inspired epic parties, and a soundtrack by Jay-Z, Jack White and Beyoncé might strike a bitter chord with fans of the novel, rest assured that Luhrmann stays fairly faithful to the book.<br/><br/>'Gatsby' starts off in grainy black and white, as some dull music rolls out during the opening credits, which morph into highly colorful 3D as if the theatre curtains were drawn up to show us that green light from the end of Daisy's pier. We cut to Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a therapist's office, trying to explain what went down in the summer of 1922 when he lived in West Egg, New York. As he begins, we get a montage of New York being built and the city's successes and declines. The archival footage mixed with the CG footage looks great with an impressive view of 1922 New York City. The only other film I've seen that has matched this detailed recreation of the old Big Apple was Peter Jackson's 'King Kong'.<br/><br/>We learn that Nick was a young graduate of Yale and wanted to try his hand on Wall Street. He moved into a small house smashed between two large riverfront mansions. Across the river are his old Yale buddy Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and his wife Daisy (Carey Mulligan). One of Nick's wealthy neighbors is the reclusive and impressive Jay Gatsby, who throws excessive and expensive parties almost every night, where politicians, gangsters, celebrities and socialites show up. However, none of them actually knows Gatsby or has even seen him before.<br/><br/>Not until 35 minutes into the film do we even get our first glimpse of Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), with a brilliant entrance and introduction. He simply owns the world with his smile and confidence. On the other side of the lake, Daisy still longs for her long-lost love (Gatsby, of course), whom she had last seen five years earlier, before he left for the war. While he was away, she married Tom, who's a pompous bully, to put it lightly.<br/><br/>DiCaprio really puts his heart on his sleeve and bares his soul to be embraced or rejected by Daisy. DiCaprio's performance, as he awkwardly tries to talk with and move around the love he hasn't seen for many years, should win him an Oscar. It's endearing to watch this coming from a person like Gatsby.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, during the affair between Gatsby and Daisy, Tom has an affair of his own with Myrtle (Isla Fisher), the local wife of a man who runs a down-and-out garage on the outskirts of town. Their friend Jordan (Elizabeth Debiki), a golf pro and socialite, tries to keep Daisy happy and Tom unaware of what's transpiring until everyone ends up at the Plaza Hotel, spilling their guts about their feelings. This leads to car wreck, and then to Gatsby's pool, which might be the best shot scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Luhrmann really slows things down after an hour into the film so that we can see Gatsby's love for Daisy grow as he tries to recreate the passion from when they first met, even though Nick tells him that he can't repeat the past. It's here where we lose Nick in the story. He only serves to narrate from time to time and becomes a bit tedious as the other characters are far more interesting.<br/><br/>Maguire does a great job as Nick as far as that can go, being that he's more of a fly- on-the-wall and sides with Gatsby throughout, even though he might not have in the book. Edgerton plays a mean Tom to a tee. You hate the guy, but that's a good thing and he gives an amazing performance. Fisher and Debiki are solid as well whenever they're on-screen. Mulligan is charged with the difficult task of Daisy. Daisy is different for everyone. She is the American dream girl, which could be bad or good for some people. Mulligan does an okay job here, but I felt like I wanted more from her. She seems to tone down her role a bit, which leaves her relationship with Gatsby something less than desired. Truly shining above the rest is DiCaprio. He is Jay Gatsby. His persona, charm and character are flawless. He's truly larger than life here, and one of the best parts of the film. Every time he's off-screen, you want him back on-screen.<br/><br/>The picture itself is incredible with its detailed sets, lavish parties and amazing costumes. The film is also in 3D, which I found less than thrilling. Sure, it has some added depth, but it's mostly unnecessary and took me out of the story. I think the story could do just fine without the added effect.<br/><br/>With Luhrmann's beautiful direction and Jay-Z's music contribution (which is a breath of fresh air and I think coincides with Fitzgerald's love of modern music), 'The Great Gatsby' is worth seeing and might just be the best adaptation yet of the iconic novel. I can't wait to get my hands on this soundtrack and watch the movie on Blu- ray in glorious high definition."
"paul_3-960-896774","8","2","5","1 July 2015"," Mesmerizing and captivating movie
","The simplicity behind the story is almost laughable, it's been done, and it's déjà-vu but The Great Gatsby plays its cards right. It's starts with the execution, the directing, the photography and the acting is impressive. You can see Baz Luhrmann's stamp throughout the film, it's colorful, loud, and a bit in your face but it works because it fits Nick (Tobey Maguire)'s point of view. Nick's the one telling the story, so the excess, the sensory overload, the overwhelming aspect of the fast life of the roaring 20s New York is exactly how a guy like Nick would experience it.<br/><br/>The director knows music and how to use it, and did an interesting job with it. The music of the past and the present are intertwined and it works. The familiarity of the present song are there but the 1920s beats takes you back and deeper into that lavish world.<br/><br/>The film is in its core a human story, with romance, drama, and a hint of mystery. The direction captures the themes and morals of the story really well but the actors' performances bring it home. Tobey Maguire's voice over and performance is nuanced, he's an observer and a participant at the same time in the film. Leonardo DiCaprio is at the peak of his powers, in full command of his acting abilities, he's brilliant in this film. Joel Edgerton, Elizabeth Debicki, and Isla Fisher should be mentioned because they were very good. Carey Mulligan is the one I wasn't completely sold on the first time around - she looked too young - but watching it again I get it and understand how she could have been cast in this film.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is entertaining and quite captivating, Baz Luhrmann knows how to shoot grand epic love stories. <br/><br/>Written by @wornoutspines"
"blaijonj","7","2","5","29 May 2015"," On balance...better than I'd expected
","I was happy to consider this movie because of DiCaprio and the source material; but I had some nervousness too, because I'm not a great fan of Baz Luhrmann's previous fare. Indeed, there are times when the counter-contemporary music takes away from the experience, but it's not constant and didn't leave me with lasting disappointment. It is all a bit 'Busby Berkley' at times with some of the set pieces looking a little too staged and unbelievable for my liking. I get the creativity and splendour of what was in Luhrmann's vision, but with a period like the 20's - I don't think we need too much more glitter than was the case anyway. The positives outweigh these concerns though - DiCaprio is mysterious and enigmatic throughout and the supporting cast perform perfectly and compliment the visuals to create an eye-catching experience. Toby McGuire plays a cautious character, but grows in stature as the plot progresses - eventually standing as the only principled individual of the piece. So Baz - I'm not convinced that everything you do adds to the plot in a positive way, but on balance the experience of watching The Great Gatsby is one worth having."

","Well, I've read a lot of Hemmingway and I would say that the original tale illustrates the futility of wealth when it comes without wisdom or virtue. Whereas, ""Jay-Z"" maybe hard pressed to agree, his sister in law is trying to knock him out in the elevator. <br/><br/>So, what you have here is a dichotomy that eventually gives up on itself and delivers the Robert Redford version verbatim for the last 30 minutes, giving you no reason to have ever mentioned Jay-Z or creepy pedophiliac new characters. <br/><br/>It sucked so hard, i think Leonardo is a demon... a really child-like demon with a penchant for sociopathy delivered through terrible movies. Every time he said ""Ol' Sport,"" fingernails splintered on the chalkboard. <br/><br/>I wouldn't say I hope he dies, because I don't really give that much of a shi**, but, I will say I hope his character in his next movie dies because the aliens came back for their sh** and they don't need his body anymore."

","""The Great Gatsby"" is an epic love story, not a party. While the main characters attended Gatsby's parties that were portrayed as illustrious and accurate to the time period, the parties were not the main point of the story. Gatsby used his parties not for the sheer amusement of hosting them, but in hope that Daisy would wonder in one night. The soundtrack of the movie missed the mark completely and is centered towards Gatsby's parties and the wild, elaborate life styles of the 1920s, rather than the love saga of Gatsby and Daisy. One song in particular that stood out was Fergie's ""A Little Party Never Killed Nobody"". Lurhman's ""right hand man"", Anton Monsted is quoted by the Hollywood Reporter saying, ""It appears during the very same party scene as will.i.am's Bang Bang. It's one where we looked to create a song with very contemporary rhythms and beats, in conjunction with some period elements that remind us of the Jazz Age setting. And hopefully, again, in the final film, people will hear the weave between 1922 and 2013."" (Trakin) While at times it has a hint of the 1920s, it is consist mainly of technology fabricated rhythms and rap sections. The premise of the song is focused on partying and depicts how Baz Lurhman wanted Gatsby to be represented. The irony is Gatsby did not even attend his parties; they were not for him or the guests, but instead for Daisy. The song simply does not go with what the story really is about nor does it add anything to the movie. Beyoncé and Andre 300 arranged a cover of Amy Winehouse's ""Back to Black"" specifically for the movie. First of all the song is completely irrelevant to the movie. The lyrics are disjointed from the story line and hold no significant meaning. Its purpose in ""The Great Gatsby"" is a mystery. Furthermore, it is painful to listen to and an overall poor reproduction. MTV criticized the arrangement of ""Back to Black"" saying, ""All that remains are sparse wubs and synth cowbells, like a dubstep generator running out of gas, and a guitar line from a Nine Inch Nails deathscape. André comes corrupt, the villain of the piece, flipping Winehouse's words into audible taunts, pitch-shifted shrugs."" (St. Asaph) The cover also has absolutely no indicators that would lead the listener to think the movie was a 1920s based setting; it is simply too modern. However, there were two songs that, while they were more modern than necessary, complimented ""The Great Gatsby"" and the main point of a love story. Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" is a love song. It is talking about a future with her lover and how she wants to be with him forever, even after death. Gatsby wanted to be with Daisy until died, and do everything in the world with her. Del Rey captures that love in a modern way that is appealing for the audience but also appropriate for the time period of the movie. The other song is Florence + The Machine's ""Over the Love"". The tone of the song is mournful, and morose. It talks about tearing a dress, crying, and doing other things over the love of someone that is unattainable. That is how Gatsby and Daisy's love is because they cannot repeat the past or be together. The song also mentions the green light that was the beacon of hope to Gatsby and his driving force for quite a while. The movie beings and ends with the green light and talks about its significance throughout the story. These two songs hold more relevance to the main point of the plot. Baz Lurhman intended for the songs of the 2013 adaption of ""The Great Gatsby to have a twenty-first century twist and appeal to this generation of people. Similarly, F. Scott Fitzgerald incorporated the musical stylings of his era, jazz, however his book was based in that era; making the music choice less repulsive. Lurhman tried to merge his era with Fitzgerald's; but in the broad spectrum, he missed the mark completely. By focusing on the extravagant and illustrious life styles, parties, and affairs Lurhman deprived his viewers from the under laying story that was far more beautiful than was he portrayed on the screen. The music followed along with his plot and was distracting. Lurhman's attempt was in vain and his contributions were not acceptable to use in an American Classic."
"FrederickWit","4","2","5","17 August 2013"," I don't know what I expected...
","Baz Luhrman style is quite unique, in a bad way. I didn't like Romeo+Juliet or Moulin Rouge, but at least I could understand why other people would like those films. When I heard that he would direct a new version of ""The Great Gatsby"", I already had mixed feelings.<br/><br/>The main idea behind the story is that people like Daisy, Tom, Nick and Jordan are ""old money"" and have a sober, unexciting and monotonous life; but ""Gatsby"" is supposed a pretentious ""new rich"" who ends up being flamboyant, tacky and vulgar. Honestly, I thought that Luhrman was going to portray Gatsby's lifestyle like in Moulin Rouge and the others lives like a common film to make the contrast. However, the whole movie was over the top and extravagant. No homophobia intended, but this was probably the gayest mainstream film ever made. Characters like Daisy and Jordan seemed just as flamboyant as any other person at Gatsby's parties. This was probably mentioned a million times, but a movie of this genre shouldn't have this kind of editing. Not a single scene in the whole movie was static, there was movement and cuts every 3 seconds. I don't know what's the idea of spending so much in a film if you won't even let people enjoy the scenes.<br/><br/>On another point, I thought that all actors were great and talented. However... they didn't have the proper look. Dicaprio is obviously a handsome man, but he definitely doesn't look 32. Carey Mulligan is quite beautiful, but it is quite a shame that she didn't look that nice in the film; Elizabeth Debicki seemed much more beautiful than her as Jordan.<br/><br/>Finally, about the story itself, I think it is a shame that they just forgot about Jordan's character in the middle of the film. She just suddenly stops talking at some point. I also didn't like the fact that they took out the 2 of the most memorable parts of the novel: Jordan and Nick's break up (in the film it doesn't seem like they even break up) and when Nick finds Tom in New York again after all the events.<br/><br/>And well, I would like to say that this film was a big disappointment, but honestly, it was absolutely expected from Baz Luhrman to direct the film exactly like this. I don't even know what I expected... maybe I wanted him to redeem himself from all his other terrible films... but well, that's just too idealistic."

","This movie was so unexpected, It gave me so much inspiration as an actor! I was blown away! The visual effects were so so GOOD!

The answer is nothing, because that's true. They did such a fantastic job in the movie! The script together with the visual effects and the actors/actresses input in the movie was all a good mix.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend who ever you are to watch the movie, it's contains a dramatic love story for anyone over the age of 15. <br/><br/>Give it a chance, it's worth it in the end! 8/10"

"rob-virnig","3","2","5","15 July 2013"," Voice over dominates the film
","First time I've felt compelled to review a movie, because I totally disagree with the very high ratings given to this movie so far. My complaint isn't about the movie being a hacked up version of the book, because almost all movies made from books involve compromise during the process of condensing a novel into a screenplay. <br/><br/>My issue with this movie is that is narrated all the way through with the actual movie just being a piece here and a piece there. I don't go to a theater to be told a story; I go there to watch a movie. The actors and actresses are great, but the way this screenplay was written and directed they have little opportunity to actually act. It is like an illustrated book, but the story is read to you and accompanied by snippets of video. <br/><br/>One might say that the use of narration is an artistic way to present the original book, but it is in my opinion taken to such an extreme it simply becomes a reading of a story rather than a movie."

"TheMovieSnob247","6","2","5","8 June 2013"," While undeniably flawed, this film is not be totally dismissed
","First off, this is one of my favorite novels. I read it back in high school and haven't read it again since, so it's been around 15 years since I originally read it. I found myself mostly torn throughout the movie, so I definitely understand why it's been so polarizing for film critics. It almost impossible to write this spoiler free, so I eventually gave up. So here's my earlier SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>It's the roaring 1920s, the stock market is thriving and so is New York. A fairly unknown, yet highly publicized, wealthy man Jay Gatsby (Leonardo Dicaprio) appears seemingly out of nowhere in a wealthy Long Island suburb. He lives in a lavish mansion and throws wild, out of this world parties. Nick Carraway (Tobey McGuire), who's drawn to big city and the lifestyle of the elite, happens to move in right next door to him. Nick grows very curious of his new neighbor and is eventually invited to one of his parties where he meets Gatsby. He learns that Jay is interested in meeting his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) who lives directly across the bay from Gatsby's mansion with her blue blooded, unfaithful husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Nick becomes emerged in Gatsby's world of nouveau riche and witnesses first hand Gatsby's hopeless optimism, larger than life persona, obsession and ultimately, his doom.<br/><br/>To talk about this film, I have to discuss it in halves. The first half of the film really brings the movie down. I found as the characters were introduced (outside of Nick) they were mostly over the top and really outlandish (almost laughably so). I also had issue with the soundtrack. I mean, it's the 1920s and it's set to Kanye and Jay-Z music? I mean really? It didn't make any sense to me at all as it didn't fit the era and made those scenes really bizarre. I get trying to modernize the film, but this was not the way to do it (and this is coming from a huge fan of both of those guys). Most of the time, the special effects were really subpar (the car driving scenes were really cartoonish) and 3D for the film was completely unnecessary and is a blatant cash grab. If there ever was a film that didn't need 3D, this was it. <br/><br/>Now for what the movie got right (the second half of the film mostly). I thought the film was really well paced. It certainly didn't feel like a 2.5 hour movie and there was plenty to keep you interested in the film. The costumes were very well done and captured the era well (compared to similar films of that era). At times the cinematography was incredible and really brought you into Gatsby's dream like world (the way the director captured Daisy's mansion across the bay and the green light was really well done and it reminded me of the novel).<br/><br/>I really loved Tobey McGuire as Nick Carraway! He always seems to have this quiet naivety in his roles and it was a perfect fit for Nick (another example that comes to mind in Keanu Reeves as Neo in The Matrix). In fact, I can't think of a better performance by Tobey and I hope he gets some recognition for this in awards season. Carey Mulligan gets Daisy about as well as you can, as a young woman who is completely oblivious to the real world and how her actions affect it. Joel Edgerton portrayed Tom adequately, I remember him being much more of a detestable person in the book (I thought this was the character that would've been really over the top). Dicaprio was good as Gatsby, but clearly not his best work. There's a deep sense of loneliness and longing for acceptance that personified Gatsby and outside of a few strong scenes, I felt he was a bit lacking there. <br/><br/>But most importantly, I think they got the story right and that's half the battle isn't it? As the major aspects of the plot unfold in the 2nd half, the characters are more believable, the events more meaningful and the film just gets better (mirroring the novel fairly well). As this point the story took over and the earlier flaws of the film seems less significant. The final scenes were gripping (I knew exactly what was coming) and were clearly the best part of the film. At the end of the film, I felt the novel was brought back to life (this is the main reason why I feel the film has been harshly dismissed by critics). I remembered just how detestable Daisy and Tom were. I remembered just how fake the people around him were and how sad it was that none of them came to say goodbye to him. The profound sense of remorse I felt for Gatsby when I read the novel, some fifteen years ago came flooding back and it affected me hours after I left the theater.<br/><br/>There are some important lessons in the novel that are still relevant even today. You can't change the past, no matter how much wealth, power and influence you obtain. And sometimes some things just aren't meant to be and no matter how hard you try to make it so, you can't change that. That is the great tragedy that is Gatsby; he was a character you admired, sympathized with and cheered for. But he was inevitably doomed because he couldn't let go of the past and his obsession drove him beyond reason. In this regard, the film was successful in my opinion. I'll conclude with my overall impression of the film (and the novel) by quoting Nick Carraway, because he illustrates this perfectly near the end of both the film and the novel:<br/><br/>""They're a rotten crowd... You're worth the whole damn bunch put together"".<br/><br/>@the_move_snob<br/><br/>www.themoviesnob.ca"
"paoct96","9","2","5","4 June 2013"," The Great Gatsby
","Movie: The Great Gatsby By: Baz Lumberman<br/><br/>Those years of the roaring 20's the flappers were something difficult to understand for the people who believed the past was really unexciting, who would thought that about 80 years ago people would be so alive and interesting. While watching the movie ""The Great Gatsby"" you can see how it portrays the way people lived in that era. Baz Lumberman did a great job making the movie as beautiful as the book itself. Very important to mention the music presented in the movie because it gives it a modern twist that makes the movie more interesting and fun to watch, because the music changes drastically the mood in the movie its gives it a more fun and pleasant mood. <br/><br/>The movie is set long island and it's divided between east egg, west egg and town, which are the 3 main places in which the movie focuses on. The story takes place during the 1920's. The main characters of the story are Jay Gatsby an amazing man, Daisy a beautiful women, Tom Buchanan a laying and mean person, and nick caraway and innocent and honest men. The story is about a man name Gatsby who has always been in love with beautiful women named daisy, when Gatsby is to leave to war for 5 years, daisy marries another man called Tom Buchanan a millionaire man who does not appreciate daisy as much as she should. When Gatsby comes back from war buys a huge house across the bay to have daisy near throwing huge party's every weekend waiting for her to show at one of his party's. Nick caraway Gatsby's neighbor is Daisy's cousin therefor Gatsby asks him to please help in bringing her for tea so that he can casually pass by and see her as much as he wants to. After they meet for the first time many feeling and memories are brought up<br/><br/>The main characters of the movie made a great job, they made it believable and that's what made the movie great. I wanted to remark DiCaprio's work due to the fact that he made an amazing job, we worked his paper really well and acted in a really good way, as in my opinion he was always been a great actor because he believes his paper and that is what maintains the movie interesting. The other characters as well did a great job, because every single one of them had the appropriate part of the movie. Therefor the casting itself to choose the characters was brilliant because they made a great job choosing them. <br/><br/>The whole movie was great and there is no part I hate about it, I may not have been convinced with the ending but that is up to my criteria but actually I would like to congratulate the movie because it's awesome it's a piece of art, a very good film of the book. It's a movie I'd love to see again because it's totally worth it. It truly convinces me and it may be in my top movies because it actually touches people feeling and changes people's point of view of that era's mood. <br/><br/>This movie left various lessons; such as chase your dreams because you may not know what will happen if you don't it. Is all about taking risks because it may lead you to something great. But in some way is good to know that you may try but you cannot pressure or ask for too much. Therefor the movie teaches too many important things especially Gatsby is the one who has more feeling you fights for his life and his love. <br/><br/>I believe it's a movie everyone could be allowed to see the movie, from all ages. I think kids should go with their parents, but it's a really good movie and it teaches many important things. While watching the movie and looking at the audience in the theater they are a lot of old people that want to watch a memory of their young life but it some it would be a shock to those old people because it's totally different way in which there era is portrayed. I recommend it to everyone who has the chance to see it. Even more too young people because I believe they would give more thought and they will enjoy it even more. It is a great movie; it brings up everyone's feelings in the way the characters relate to each other. <br/><br/>In my own opinion the movie is excellent and I would give it an excellent rating. A 90 and above would be the rating I would give it because in my personal opinion it is a piece of art. And amazing movie and the characters did a splendid work, making the movie real and making the receptor believe he is in the movie.

","A film with some great set pieces; I found the party scenes particularly spectacular. It's beautifully shot and I'm quite glad I saw it in 2D as I couldn't see how 3D would have enhanced it much. I found the music interesting with the big set pieces being handed over to rapper Jay-Z (also an Executive Producer), but it was the original music by Craig Armstrong that I found most enthralling. There are several well known themes subtly placed in the soundtrack and I found both refreshing and interesting. All the performances were great with DiCaprio and Mulligan getting top billing; but I thought Tobey Maguire was equally good. I guess I'll have to read the book to be able to decide just how good an adaptation this is; but for now I found it quite a satisfying watch with plenty of drama to keep me entertained. If I was to be super critical I would have to say I found the character of Gatsby a little one- dimensional, but having said that it's still well worth a look if you get the chance.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 7.5/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"marina33","10","2","5","3 June 2013"," Cinematography at it's finest
","The Great Gatsby goes ""all in"". An example of great modern cinematography, re-telling a timeless story that has been told many times before yet now finally in an age where it's magnitude and glory can truly peak. <br/><br/>Visuals are absolutely mesmerizing to the finest detail,timed perfectly,delivered by some exquisite camera work and goose bumps giving shots,completed with suitable costumes and decor,bringing the ""Charlestone"" era to life with such good taste, accenting it's luxury without over doing it. What's also praise worthy is how they managed to make modern music work for that period of time. Lana del Rey, Gotye, Fergie, Will.I.Am and Jay-Z sure did light up the party!! - speaking of – party scenes choreographed an edited to it's finest – so well it leaves you wishing you were there cause them people knew how to have a good time,regardless their age.<br/><br/>As for the story – those who have red the novel say the film is quite authentic and follows the book nicely, even the dialogs. Film kicks off in a narrative form, it's first 20min or so being an introduction into a greatness that follows but you don't see it coming. Don't judge the whole film based on the beginning because it does come over a bit slow and I did have to remind myself that it is a DiCaprio film so it must be more to it than this. But it's purpose is to introduce the characters and set in the mystery around the great name Gatsby and relationships running under the water surface. <br/><br/>Personally I liked when narration was followed by letters on screen (although some found that detail tacky) – to me it fits in in the new modern look of the whole story and yet gives it kind of a fairy tale feel.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann like a pro builds it up from nothing, slowly allowing the viewer to get tangled in the glamorous net and let's you enjoy all the pageantry and pomp, filling your heart with music and laughter ( yes it was also funny) , making the key moments as spectacular as glorious fireworks itself, just so it would hurt all the more when the tragedy kicks in.<br/><br/>As for the cast – everybody delivers with such authenticity of emotions and character depth, it's absolutely mind blowing to watch their work unwind before your eyes.<br/><br/>Even the ""small"" characters like the organ player, butler, the mistress, the mechanic – surprise with the amount of presence they have in their scenes. Jason Clarke, small yet so important owns his scenes – like a first class actor would. <br/><br/>Carey Mulligan -this rising star is going places for sure!!! Well done young lady – well done!!! Gracious and innocent in her portray of Daisy she wins your heart from the moment she appears on screen only to brake it and leave it bleeding on a stone cold floor .<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire – got an opportunity that every actor that hides more in him than is able to show – dreams of!! Although he will never be the great gentleman (because of his boyish childlike appearance – even though he is DiCaprio's coeval) – as his sidekick he simply nails it. Calmness and warmth of his voice make him an excellent narrator. Naivety of his persona and goodness of heart make him the perfect toy for all 3 parties, as he tries to please and help – and yet he himself is much irrelevant to everybody. From the beginning till the end – he is a kind soul, his heart in the right place, tragically affected by the events that took place – and none of that would be the same has it not been for Tobey's charm – set in his eyes and warm smile. He gave this role all he head – and can stand proud and tall next to his friend  the one and only <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio!!!!! As much as the directing and editing had to do with his grand entrance in this film I can't think of anyone who would claim the moment they introduce Gatsby to the audience in a better way. He owns the camera, he owns the special effects – he owns YOU from the get go. This man as no other I have ever seen has the power to control me and my emotions by simply switching a look in his eyes. His tears water up my eyes, his joy puts a smile on my face. He doesn't play Gatsby – he IS Gatsby – and I don't think after him there will ever be anyone worthy of playing Gatsby again. Greatness of this actor goes beyond my words. He has that talent to bring a character to life and show you that persona in all it's layers with merely a look and a smile or a gesture. What he did with Gatsby is putting the rest of Hollywood to shame. A great gentleman, a business man, a romantic fool, scared boy dying to impress the love of his life, a crook, a raging animal, a man sick with obsession  a humble man with a dream determination and imagination like no other and most of all – strong enough will to never lose hope... He is one and only  and alone  with only one friend in this world that really cared for him - as the rest of the world was to consumed and corrupted with fear and urge to take the easy way out – in stead of fight or at least admire truly those who did.<br/><br/>The colors, the music, the shots and Leonardo DiCaprio made this film for what it is – painting of a sunset  Edgar Allan Poe's poem  and THE GREAT GATSBY made my night, my week – my month – reminding me why I love movies as much as I do."
"atlasmb","7","2","5","2 June 2013"," The next-to-best Gatsby
","First, I want to say that I did not see the 3D version of this movie, so my review is only for the 2D version.<br/><br/>I read the book years ago. I saw the 1974 movie the year it came out. I am a fan of both. But I am also a fan of Baz Luhrman. One could tell this new movie was a Baz Luhrman product within 3 seconds. And the remainder of the film has his signature all over it. Even though I might criticize this 2013 version, I want to say that I liked it.<br/><br/>I preferred the music in the 1974 version, but I did not find the modern music of this version annoying at all. The 1974 film was slightly more faithful to the book--which is a good thing--but this version was fairly faithful. The main difference was the invention of a back story concerning Nick's health. I found it distracting and, more importantly, an invalidation of Nick's reliability as narrator (and our guide to the world of Gatsby and environs).<br/><br/>I also preferred the actors in the 1974 version. Redford is more reserved--a man in control, a man of mystery who does not wear his heart on his sleeve. Mia Farrow's Daisy was much more fleshed out and more believable, not to mention a sadder victim of her society. In similar ways, I preferred all of the acting choices from 1974.<br/><br/>Some have called The Great Gatsby a love story. From Gatsby's point of view, that is true. But from the reader's point of view, TGG is a mystery. As we read the book, we are trying to understand the man, and solve the mysteries of his past. <br/><br/>As others have said, the quick cuts that drive the narrative of the 2013 version are annoying and, worse yet, impair the viewer's ability to immerse himself in the lavish richness of the visuals. <br/><br/>One reviewer said she really enjoyed the ""beautiful shirts"" scene in the 2013 version. For me there was no comparison. I would use that scene as an example of where the 1974 film was much superior. When Redford tosses the shirts, the viewer feels he is in a rich, colorful, extravagant shower. And Farrow's Daisy is positively overcome by the experience.<br/><br/>In closing, I recommend this film, but I recommend that viewers first read the book and see the 1974 Gatsby. May you be lured to West Egg as surely as the jazz-age celebrants were drawn to the flame of Gatsby's determination."

","The acting, writing, direction, and cinematography is phenomenal, and I believe it will be a classic for a long time. I loved every moment of this movie. Leonardo, Tobey and Carrie outdid themselves in their roles and suspended disbelief. As for the style of the music, I am in love with Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"", it set the perfect mood for romance. A heads up, if you ever seen ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""Moulin Rogue"", some modern music is mixed into the movie even though it is a period piece, and I know some people tend to be put off when the classic is mixed with the modern, but Baz Luhrmann knows his stuff, and his choice of music is actually done very tastefully. As for his direction, LOVE IT!!!!!!Give yourself a treat, and if you are a F. Scott Fitzgerald fan, this movie did him proud. ~+~"
"lmontague3","9","2","5","2 June 2013"," Leonardo DiCaprio was a GREAT Great Gatsby
","LOVED IT! Leo was fabulous as Gatsby who starts as mysterious then slowly reveals his disillusions. I was expecting this director to give us over-the-top glamour and glitz... and it fit the 1920's. The scenes when Gatsby is revealing the past (e.g., when he is describing what he is thinking just before his first kiss with Daisy) - excellent. <br/><br/>Trivia: in the book, Daisy has dark hair and Jordan is blonde. In both the 1974 movie and this one, their hair colour is reversed. Generally, I would say don't change a thing that Fitzgerald wrote, but I have to admit, in my mind, Daisy is blonde, Joardan is a brunette. <br/><br/>What I did not like: Toby Maguire as Nick I did not think was a great fit. Some of the music. Listen to the soundtrack of the 1974 movie ""what will I do..."" evokes the feeling of lost love really well."

","The Great Gatsby from Baz Luhrman is a truly magnificent film.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway is absolutely wonderful, he does a great job narrating and has a wonderful calming presence throughout the movie. Leonardo gives an outstanding portrayal of Gatsby, not only does he portray the character as warm and likable, he shows us the underlining sensitivity and insecurity of Gatsby so perfectly. Both Tobey and Leo work beautifully in their scenes together, you sense a real bond that forms between the characters and the comedy that comes from the Tea for Daisy scene is highly entertaining. Carey Mulligan as Daisy was another wonderful performance, she portrayed her just as I had imagined from the book. All of these character's were actually portrayed to be likable and this really drew me in to the story. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was perfect, the music was used wonderfully! Always keeping it alive and bringing such an energy to the film. The production design was stunning! Though I would expect no less from a Baz Luhrman and Catherine Martin production, I was expecting great but really nothing can prepare you for what you see on screen. Visually it was beautiful and really took you away to this other world. This is easily my favourite movie within the last five years. It is Classy, Sophisticated, Warm, Funny, Dramatic and simply a wonderful entertaining film which I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed! I have read the book and seen the other movies and I have to say this was the most wonderful portrayal in my mind thus far, the most entertaining and very true to the book. Every page of the book that comes to life on screen was in my mind the absolute best Spectacular version of everything it could possibly be. <br/><br/>Thank you to Baz Luhrman and everyone involved for bringing this portrayal of the book to our screens. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have seen it twice already at the theatre, maybe I will even go again, and I can tell you I haven't felt this way about a movie in the past five years. <br/><br/>This movie has everything that seems to be missing from most films today, it contains almost no profanity, minimal violence and vulgarity, but focuses on Elegance, Class, Sophistication, Beautiful dialogue and drama, some humour, warmth, and just Visually Stunning, I encourage you to watch this film. <br/><br/>(I preferred to watch the film in 2D, so my comments are based on this viewing)"
"Likes_Ninjas90","5","2","5","29 May 2013"," Gatsby makes for a forgettable movie
","Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is big, loud and lavish, more of an event than a film, and a substitution of essence for grandiosity. From the moment it was announced that the Australian filmmaker would adapt F. Scott's Fitzgerald's 1925 classic novel did we expect anything else? What Baz fails to cement is genuine purpose for his filmic style and the very reasoning for filming this story again. There have been three previous film adaptations, including a 1974 version with Robert Redford. The novel itself also possesses its own cinematic qualities, which further asks why it needed to be made into another film. Modernist writers, authors from the post-WWI period like Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot and Faulkner, were influenced by the power of cinema in their work.<br/><br/>In his essay ""T. S. Eliot and Cinema"", David Trotter draws symmetry between the techniques of the written text and film: ""The literary text, we are told, is structured like a film, in whole or in part: it has its ""close-ups,"" its ""tracks"" and ""pans,"" its cuts from one ""shot"" to another. Writers and film-makers were engaged, it would seem, in some kind of exchange of transferable narrative techniques"". Trotter's essay reveals a broader question about why a novel needs to be adapted to film. Some film adaptations achieve heightened immediacy and atmosphere and expose more people to the source material. The producer of Gatsby, Douglas Wick, said that they wanted the story to be relevant to a new generation and make it less like a period film. Yet by utilising dizzying filmic techniques, including a superfluous 3D layer, Baz is selling a new generation a broader, faster but simplified version of this story that doesn't understand the novel's intentions.<br/><br/>As a filmmaker, Baz has fine technical knowledge but he never knows when to call cut. With his first film Strictly Ballroom, he showed careful selection in his direction, building a small, contained but hugely entertaining crowd pleaser. Now he is part of a Hollywood studio system where directors make their films increasingly more elaborate and grander so that they can sustain their own relevancy and bankability. His worst film Australia revealed his irrepressible kitchen sink syndrome by mixing jarring acting styles, dramatic and comedic tones and undisciplined cinematic choices. Despite drawing a rich, powerhouse cast for Gatsby including, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton, some of these erratic stylistic choices and habits come back to haunt Baz.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie feels rushed and hollow. Baz's primary technique is rapid cutting, so scene transitions and beats between set pieces become so frazzled that there is little time spent on substantiating the notion of old and new money - a core element of the novel. The camera movements are needlessly speedy, dipping and zooming wildly from the top of skyscrapers so that the few times they are allowed to pause is for a brief freeze-frame. Baz also treats the party scenes as though they are an elaborate music video, with bodies constantly in motion, as waiters and servants file into rooms with perfect synchronisation. This is all high kinetic movement but ultimately wasteful energy as these formal choices fail to connect themselves to a theme relating to class or materialism.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also narrowly geared towards a younger demographic, instead of the authenticity of the Jazz Age or the novel's thematic core. Modern singers like Jay-Z and Beyonce are used in the film and the familiarity of their voices is distracting. In a crucial moment where Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) prepares to reunite with Daisy Buchanan (Mulligan), a remix of Beyonce's song ""Crazy in Love"" plays over the vision of servants marching into the house together. It's a terribly directed scene that mistakenly treats Gatsby like a slapstick comedian. There is a lot of overstatement like this, particular when Nick Carraway (Maguire), who narrates the film through a voice-over, regurgitates observations already made clear by the camera.<br/><br/>The second half is mercifully slower, providing more time for the actors, but it fails to inject itself into the novel's thematic interests. DiCaprio suits the role of Gatsby because he gives the character a slick air of believable confidence and composure. There are some also gentle moments where he reveals an internal sense of longing through his face, without any intrusive flashbacks. Yet Baz's worst sin is that he buys into Gatsby's idealisation of Daisy. Their relationship is treated like a conventional sugary romance rather than a question of class or the social order. The casting of Daisy is problematic. Mulligan has been directed to play the part soppy, instead of darker, frivolous and superficial, so that the materialistic nature of her character is softened until the end.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire seems uncertain on how to approach Nick because of his elusive characterisation and new material, including a thread where he is recovering from a breakdown and is told by a doctor to write the story out, does not have any emotional impact. Crucial female characters from the novel, including Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) and Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher), who is having an affair with Tom (Joel Edgerton), are also marginalised so that their importance barely registers. I hope Baz can rediscover his restraint as a filmmaker and remember that purpose and intent are the foundations of great storytelling and filmmaking so that his narratives can linger after the glitz and the technique have faded. Despite how lavish and busy it is, Gatsby makes for a forgettable movie - a label you couldn't even apply to Baz's worst efforts."
"bsujan2007","Null","2","5","26 May 2013"," Totally Overrated
","Leonardo by now, agreed by most is an exceptional actor. This movie is carried primarily on his shoulders and without him this film would not be watchable. Mr Bachchan as Wolfsheim remains on your mind even after the movie has ended. Superb acting. Other actors could easily be replaced and it would not matter in this film. Carrey Mulligan as Daisy is an awful choice of lead actress. The movie could have been so much more exiting had a better actress been cast as Daisy. Wearing different head accessories and same expressions does not necessarily mean the lady can act.<br/><br/>The choice of music is hurtful in most of the movie. In certain scenes the music overpowers the dialog. The direction is mostly alright in the 1st half and lags/stretches towards the end. Better editing would have helped. The story is interesting, but that should be obvious as it is ranked among the greatest works of American literature. All in all its a romance movie and if you are going to watch it in the cinema, see it with your better half."
"silvetka2001","6","2","5","24 May 2013"," If you really want to grasp the notion of Gatsby, 2013's adaptation is not the one to watch – somehow by and between all the glamor they've missed what it was all about
","My first watch of The Great Gatsby of 2013 did really raised some doubts but the general impression was not bad. Unfortunately it lasted only until I recollected the book as well as Clayton's adaptation as of 1974 (initially read and watched more than 15 years ago). The intro and the storytelling approach in general were simply devastation - whoever thought of such ""improvement"" to the story has desperately and hopelessly mistaken. About the directing – usually I tend to fall for some extravagant and bold directing but in this case such ""fast and furious"" and ""we are so over the boring old retro"" approach is definitely ruining the story – obviously it has its followers but I find it quite inappropriate. Also, the 3D format, whatever its purpose was, didn't upgrade the movie to a masterpiece.<br/><br/>During the whole time while watching the new version I was wondering what was so wrong with the contemporary Daisy and finally it hit me- the point about Daisy was not like being blond and mediocre but in the emanation of the whole notion of ""rich girls do not marry poor guys"" on which Mia Farrow actually got an amazing grip. Our new Daisy was innocent and almost naive like a sweet little girl and one is never sure until the end what her choice would actually be. She's gaining spectator's compassion, making everyone dubious whether she is the good girl or the bad girl instead of leaving the firm impression that she's just not the right girl – said in other words, Farrow's Daisy is vulgar to the bones and never misleading whilst Mulligan's is almost a victim. And now to J Gatsby- is there anyone even slightly convinced that DiCaprio could successfully challenge Robert Redford with this part?! Don't think so. Really, the older he gets, the better he plays but what he generally lacks is this aura of nobleness and the distinguished appearance which one Gatsby should possess; instead, while playing Gatsby our Leo looks like he has not developed much since we had him as the adventurous tricky boy from Titanic. Finally about Nick –who on earth thought to represent this reflective wise spectator as a boyish ""I'm such a freshman and so surprised with everything"" folk?! Truth be told, there were actually some good points - the costumes and the decors demand for applause – the designers have performed an awesome job and deserve all due respect. Also, the new Jordan truly excels the old one. But honestly, between the whole glamor, luxury and pompousness turning into grotesque, somehow they've lost what the story was all about."

","Visually splendid and the film has a fun soundtrack although doesn't really paint an accurate image and capture the atmosphere of the 20s. The characters were bland and even though you were meant to dislike many of them, there was nothing fascinating about them or particularly interesting or lovable in their characterisation, let's not even talk about development.<br/><br/>Furthermore all Tobey Maguire does is often stare into space having no variation in his acting and seeming bored through most of the film and he makes Fitzgerald's great narration of the book become dull and cheap dialogue, thanks to the script writers. Also the Wilsons who are an important part of the story are met briefly two or three times in the movie despite the fact that more attention should be payed to them instead of non-stop Baz Luhrmann-style parties and funky music.<br/><br/>Gatsby, the most important character seemed much more unsympathetic and unlikable and is portrayed as an asshole who just rubs it in Tom's face that Daisy didn't love him, instead of portraying him as a more heroic, likable mystery figure searching for a lost love.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan was really pretty but that's all that can be said about her character, oh and to add, a comment I saw in a Star Wars prequel review that's quite relevant - you can't just put beautiful people in beautiful locations and expect them to love each other and the audience to connect with it, this is how the film portrayed their love and it agitated me. In my opinion, Joel Edgerton as Tom was one of the best performances as well as DiCaprio who both did pretty well on a fairly poor screenplay.<br/><br/>Overall, a quite poorly written film with weak characters for the most part and a story doesn't focus on the beauty of the time period at all or possesses the heart of the original material but instead has lots of shots of parties, colourful cinematography and a nice yet uneven soundtrack, although have to admit it was fun at times. As an adaptation, not too great at all. 5.5/10"

","I saw the 3D version of The Great Gatsby yesterday and it was such a beautiful movie. The costumes, the music, the views and the general atmosphere of the movie were just amazing. <br/><br/>I did have some prejudice against this movie because 1) This is one of my two favorite novels and I didn't want to see it ruined, and 2) The IMDb scores for The Great Gatsby are relatively low for that kind of movie. Moreover, reading the reviewers ratings, gave me the impression that this score should be corrected downwards. However, my girlfriend , who didn't read the novel, wanted to see The Great Gatsby more than other available movies in the cinema.<br/><br/>I can't say the movie lived entirely to my expectation from the novel, because the novel has some depths that the movie doesn't possess. There is a sub-context and a meaning that F.S.Fitzgerald had gave to the book, and it's slipped from Baz Luhrmanns' adaptation.<br/><br/>Someone noted here that the director has managed to cover about 75% of the novel. I think I could easily give it another 10 and say that the movie was true to about 85% of the book. All the characters, except for Nick, were perfectly matched and played amazingly. The only complain from my side was about Tobey Maguire, who looked slightly immature for the role of Nick. It was very visible at the beginning, but it got better as the movie progressed. <br/><br/>It's not only that the director has matched the novel well, he has mostly matched my imagination of the views, Gatsbys' castle, Nicks' rented house, character look, cars and so on. In cases he didn't match my imagination, he outdone it. Some scenes were so beautifully done I couldn't even imagine it. And the 3D experience has only augmented my joy of watching The Great Gatsby. <br/><br/>Some context has been lost, but it's very true to the story and there is also value added (the visuals and the sound). Beautiful movie."

GATSBY 2013 is an astonishing visual achievement. I reluctantly saw it in 3D and within 10 minutes was so pleased I did. The 3D is utterly breathtaking. The 3D clarity and the steadiness of the photography allows for 3D clarity unlike any I have seen before. Yes I balk at Baz, and I was worried that this was just going to be Baz' flapper dance party, and yes, for a few minutes it is that but 99% more. I sincerely hope this heralds a new era in gloriously beautiful stylish and intelligent film making. Gatsby's Leonardo entrance, about 25 minutes in, is an emotional thunderbolt of sheer beauty. I defy anyone of any age and gender not to gasp. Toby Maguire is utterly accessible and charming, Carrie Mulllgan an ideal Daisy and Joel Edgerton a terrifying Tom. The art direction and set design and costumes are superb. I know I am raving but I want to. I am genuinely enthusiastic and shocked at how thrilling and beautiful this new GREAT GATSBY is. Reward yourself and see it in 3D in a good cinema."

","Sheer intensity and OTT approach lose a sense of carelessly drifting through lives that is so prominent in Fitzgerald's work.<br/><br/>That Baz decided to institutionalise Nick to facilitate the story-telling is unfortunate as it is an ill fit with the character. The storyline and plot was otherwise accurately depicted.<br/><br/>There was a great party scene at Tom's city apartment which embodied the ugliness of tastelessness. Unfortunately Gatsby's parties looked as if a lucky packet threw up on them. Any romanticism of sitting under that lilac tree was destroyed.<br/><br/>In terms of set, the architecture was OTT, even for the nouveau riche. Beautiful costume design, thanks to Tiffany's and Prada, was one of the films greatest achievements. The soundtrack unfortunately layered too many tracks and cut too often to lend meaning or depth to a scene. The 3D added an extra layer of unnecessary distraction from the heart of the story.<br/><br/>Reducing the references to the green light of hope, Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's omnipresent gaze and Gatsby's ""old sport"" tagged onto every sentence could have been an easily cut the indulgence down by 30 mins.<br/><br/>Leonardo and Carey were a well cast Gatsby and Daisy, and Joel a convincing enough ""villain"".

"ajmcginnz","9","2","5","18 May 2013"," Captivating stunning and extremely entertaining!!
","The Great Gatsby isn't receiving the praise it deserves from critics. I personally disregard what critics say nine times out of ten and this is one of those nine times. What do I care if a self proclaimed deep, intelligent, artistic critic thinks the movie is ""empty""? <br/><br/>I felt the movie exceeded my expectations.. it was colorful, bright, filled with good music and beautifully acted. So many times films set in the early-mid 20th century have a dreary, dull feel to them. The Great Gatsby's bright optimistic presentation of the era is a breath of fresh air and has made me thoroughly appreciate Baz Luhrman's directing style. He took risks and they paid off.<br/><br/>Something that seems to beer skewing peoples thoughts on the movie is its relationship with the classic novel. I have not read the novel and I think that made it more enjoyable. So if you are going to go see the movie don't sit there and draw comparisons or think of the story line, just relax and don't over analyse. That is what the critics did and it was they're downfall.<br/><br/>DiCaprio chooses his projects carefully and almost never disappoints and I think this was a home run. Box office Numbers don't lie. His acting was electric as per usual, how he does not have several Oscars already is beyond me. <br/><br/>I was concerned about Carey Mulligan playing the role of Daisy Buchannon at first because she's not exactly beautiful. She is okay but when other truly beautiful actresses like Kate Beckinsale,Blake Lively, Olivia Wilde and Natalie Portman were considered I could not comprehend why Carey Mulligan was chosen to play this role whose primary job is looking beautiful. <br/><br/>However she did a pretty good job and surprisingly did not look out of place. I was quite impressed with performance in the end. Joel Edgerton was excellent as well, the tacky mustache was a great call it really fit the part. <br/><br/>Ultimately you should definitely go see the movie! You shouldn't be disappointed."
"TheFilmFanatic1","7","2","5","17 May 2013"," The 'Good' Gatsby
","Well, after a much awaited and anticipated release of the adaptation of the classic F.Scott Fitzgerald novel, The Great Gatsby was finally released into cinemas after being delayed for a number of months. The Great Gatsby is-in novel form- considered one of the all time American classics, and Baz Luhrmann's movie had a lot of hype and build up about it's own interpretation of the novel, and how it would compare to previous versions such as the one in 1974 which featured the in-actor of the time, Robert Redford.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann's Gatsby is in many ways faithful to the novel, and different from the 1974 movie. Luhrmann is not one of my favourite directors, but he pulls of a visually stunning aesthetic look to Gatsby's parties and the setting of New York and even with the Valley of Ashes. The cast all played their roles particularly well, but the outstanding actor was the one in the titular role of Jay Gatsby, Leonardo DiCaprio, who is the best actor to have played Gatsby. Tobey Maguire has good on screen chemistry with DiCaprio and this helps to convey the friendship between Gatsby and Nick Carraway. Carey Mulligan plays an excellent Daisy and suits the part from the description of her in the book.<br/><br/>However, many enthusiasts of the Fitzgerald novel, such as myself, will feel as though Luhrmann overdoes some of the subtlety of the book. The novel is a classic as I have said before, but the movie fails to hit at some of the key themes such as the corruption of the American Dream. The symbolism of the book such as the Green Light and the eyes of Dr. T.J Eckleburg are manifested brilliantly on screen but they are supposed to be subtle, yet Luhrmann overuses camera techniques which make the audience feel nauseous, like they are watching a first person movie.<br/><br/>This adaptation of The Great Gatsby is the best one by far, but for those who love the novel they may feel disappointed as they walk out of the cinema. However, those who haven't read the book, will probably enjoy the movie, despite it's imperfections. So we beat on, boats against the current, still waiting for a 'Great Gatsby'."
"neil-476","8","2","5","17 May 2013"," An Event worth experiencing
","In the roaring 20s, Nick Carraway moves into a small rented Long Island house, across the Sound from his cousin Daisy and her wealthy husband Tom. Nick's house is next to a mansion where the mysterious and somewhat reclusive Gatsby hosts massive parties. Nick gets drawn into the lives of these three people and finds that there are secrets to keep.<br/><br/>As a Brit, The Great Gatsby is not on our school reading lists, and the Redford film version had never appealed, so I came to this with only the vaguest idea of what it was about. Despite the running time (nearly two and a half hours) I was absorbed throughout: I will mention nothing about the events of the story in case anyone reading this is also in ignorance.<br/><br/>Which leaves talking about the film itself. Well, the performances are fine, although poor Tobey Maguire loses out somewhat - as narrator and observer he is on screen throughout the movie, but Nick is a thankless part, being necessarily neutral and colourless until towards the end.<br/><br/>The production design is very good, and it wouldn't take you long to work out that this is a Baz Luhrman film if you didn't already know. I sometimes think that ""Luhrman"" should have been ""Lurid"", his visuals are so vivid and in-your-face. Which is not to say that the visuals aren't effective, because they are, but I'm not sure that the air of camp which they lend is entirely fitting to the story. Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/>Oh, and see it in 3D - Luhrman is one of only a handful of directors who, on the basis of this, understands how to use 3D as an artistic tool."
"pabs1967","8","2","5","16 May 2013"," Just enjoy a great film.
","I have read too many reviews about how this movie isn't as good as the book or this movie isn't as good as previous versions. Well to those people I say why not just rate the movie on what it is intended for; a couple of hours enjoyment and even to maybe ask yourself what's possible with a bit of hope.<br/><br/>Now I have never read the book or seen any of the other adaptations but I can gather that maybe Luhrmann strays a little from the details in the book. But does that really matter if the film is genuinely entertaining to watch. I found myself eager to find out who Gatsby really was. And I think this was down in no small part to Leonardo Di Caprio. He played the character brilliantly oozing confidence and really stealing the show. In fact it wouldn't surprise me to see the term ""old sport"" making its way back to popular culture thanks to Leo.<br/><br/>Another area which has took a lot of criticism is the soundtrack. However I have to say I loved the contrast of 1920's New York and the recent music of jay z among others. I really felt this worked in emphasising the grandness and showmanship of who and what Gatsby was portraying. The scale of the movie was also really impressive and I'm sure that anyone who sees it would love to have attended any of the parties that were brilliantly shot during the film.<br/><br/>However the movie isn't perfect. Tobey Maguire's character comes across as a little bit too much of a lap dog. I found myself getting frustrated at his lack of grit to make his own decisions whether this be with Gatsby or Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan. <br/><br/>All in all though this is a really great film. Di Caprio is at his brilliant best ( but to be honest when is he not) and the grandness of the event just has to be enjoyed. Luhrmann s imagery really does make you appreciate what the cinema can offer as opposed( or along with) the novel."
"moviexclusive","8","2","5","16 May 2013"," Visually extravagant and yet more moving and poignant than the classic novel, this is a bold and impressively original interpretation that is both reverent and refreshing
","To the reviewers who have criticised Baz Luhrmann of being disrespectful, or worse, sacrilegious to F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, we have this to say – this is not your grandfather's 'Great Gatsby'. Rather, this is through and through a Baz Luhrmann interpretation of the novel, which by his previous works – most notably, William Shakespeare's 'Romeo + Juliet' and 'Moulin Rouge' – suggests that this will be a visually pompous post-modern pop-rock makeover of high art. Now if that sounds disturbing to any of you purists, then our warning to you is to steer clear of this.<br/><br/>For everyone else open to a less book-bound adaptation, we can reassure you that despite claiming the artistic freedom to interpret the material according to his sensibilities, Luhrmann remains very much in reverence for his source material. Together with his regular collaborator Craig Pearce, he has stuck close to the details of the story, lifting lines of dialogue from the novel's pages even if they come very close to sounding unwieldy. And perhaps most tellingly, he retains the outside-in perspective through a certain Nick Carraway's running first-person narration, which in the novel was a thin veil for Fitzgerald's own voice.<br/><br/>So as with the book, the story kicks off with Nick (Tobey Maguire) moving into a small house he rents next to the lavish mansion of the enigmatic Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a millionaire known for the flamboyant parties he throws for the who's who of society. Before Nick makes Gatsby's acquaintance, we are introduced to other key players – his distant cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), her husband and Nick's college buddy Tom (Joel Edgerton), and Daisy's good friend Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki). At first, Gatsby remains but a mystery to Nick, but a surprise invitation he gets from Gatsby opens his mind to the wholly different world that goes on behind Gatsby's doors every weekend.<br/><br/>There, Luhrmann spares no expense in portraying every manner of Gatsby's extravagance, a kaleidoscopic circus – as Nick describes – of glitz and glitter set to an anachronistic musical score that includes the likes of Jay-Z, Kanye West and Lana Del Rey. With some able assistance from his producer/wife Catherine Martin's lush costume and production design, Luhrmann aims to wow his audience in the same way Nick would have been stepping into this entirely different world of gaudy excess, the endless movement and music photographed with the same sense of restlessness by cinematographer Simon Duggan's swopping and swirling camera movements.<br/><br/>There's no mistaking Luhrmann's indulgence in filming the big party scenes, nowhere more evident than in Gatsby's first full entrance almost a half-hour into the movie complete with a burst of fireworks in the sky and the climax of Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue' on the soundtrack. And yet, contrary to the impression you might have gotten from many other reviews, Luhrmann doesn't simply embrace the very hedonism that Fitzgerald's book casts a critical eye to; instead, he uses that to add heft to both Gatsby and Nick's characters, or more specifically to explain how two individuals not from such a world of wealth and pomp would ultimately be deceived by its promise of gratification.<br/><br/>Like the book, that becomes plainly evident in the second half of the movie where Gatsby's true identity and motivations are laid bare in a tragic love story. Similar to Luhrmann's previous works, this is at its core a tale of impossible love; and more so than in the novel, Luhrmann romanticises the proceedings through painting Gatsby as the hopeless romantic who will meet his ruin because of his obsession for a love once lost and his false optimism of reliving an unforgettable past. It is a more sympathetic portrayal of Gatsby than in the novel, but also a more fully formed one that goes beyond mere artifice.<br/><br/>Indeed, Luhrmann's adaptation succeeds because he enhances the emotional core at Fitzgerald's story and makes it deeply heartfelt. That isn't limited to just Gatsby - you'll feel, more than you would reading the book, for the wide-eyed Nick who is powerless to stop a terrible chain of events he eventually feels responsible for as well as for the debutante Daisy who is too afraid to lose the kind of life she has grown up with to love in the way her heart calls her to. Fitzgerald's use of symbolism is also retained and enriched here, in particular the green beacon at the end of Tom and Daisy's dock that signifies how near and yet so far Gatsby is to his object of affection.<br/><br/>And really, who better to play such a Gatsby than DiCaprio, whose reteaming with Luhrmann 17 years after 'Romeo + Juliet' harks back to the kind of swoon-worthy roles the heartthrob was known for. DiCaprio makes what could easily have been a melodramatic love story credible and poignant, perfectly embodying his character's romantic idealism as well as his insecurities, his natural movie-star good looks lending Gatsby both charisma and magnetism. Next to DiCaprio, Mulligan is utterly bewitching, exuding the sort of sass and vulnerability that needs no further explanation why Gatsby, or any other man for that matter, would fall so hopelessly in love with. <br/><br/>You might also wish to take note that Luhrmann doesn't aim for historical accuracy in portraying New York in the Roaring Twenties, yet another one of the creative liberties he takes. Yet it's hard to fault the creative license he adopts, his treatment a curious but always refreshing mix of straight-up reverence and postmodern art. But there is ingenuity in his unorthodox method, and – much as other reviews might try to convince you otherwise – he doesn't lose the heart and soul of Fitzgerald's novel, so we urge you to keep an open mind and appreciate what we think is a visually bold and original vision of a contemporary American classic literature."
"emily-polko","9","2","5","13 May 2013"," The Great American Novel Becomes A Great American Classic!
","It's hard to review a movie based on a novel and not feel compelled to compare it to the novel. The intricate details that fill the pages of any novel can't always be portrayed on screen. Most screenwriters are saddled with the burden of deciding which pieces of the novel must be cut out to avoid creating a movie that is too long to keep the moviegoer's attention. The Great Gatsby is a short novel and seems to have been a novel written for screen. In Luhrmann's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, few pieces are left out. <br/><br/>Most people would criticize Tobey Maguire's Nick Carraway as being too vanilla. He is Gatsby's minion who indulges Gatsby's whims. However, that's precisely the character that Fitzgerald created. Watching the movie, it was no surprise why Nick Carraway was so fascinated. Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby was charming, elusive, captivating, and dark. Nick couldn't help but be drawn to Gatsby like a moth to a flame. No man, of this generation, could portray the poise and brilliance of Jay Gatsby on the level that he was portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. <br/><br/>Carey Mulligan encapsulates all that is Daisy Buchanan. The most pivotal quote in Fitzgerald's Gatsby is ""...I hope she'll be a fool - that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."" She utters those words about her daughter and in that line, the reader is meant to understand that Daisy wasn't a fool, she was merely a woman acting foolishly. Carey Mulligan has a charm about her while playing Daisy. She likes being the center of attention and we, as the audience, don't mind giving her that attention. She is beautiful and soft-spoken. Her words and movements are chosen with such precision as to elicit the exact response she desires from whomever she chooses. Few actresses could embody the cruelty and selfishness that is Daisy Buchanan with the beauty Carey Mulligan maintained. <br/><br/>The chemistry amongst the actors in this picture is nearly flawless. The chemistry between Daisy and the mild-mannered Gatsby is breathtaking to witness. The intimacy between the two is marvelous and the emotional distance created by Tom's (Joel Edgerton) presence is heartbreaking. However, Daisy's chemistry with Tom is sensational. The words they say to each other are often cruel. However, the manner at which they say them to each other is meant to cripple, but never to kill. The two are callous towards each other and then transform into caring companions without causing the audience alarm. Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki are beautiful pieces of furniture in the elaborate house that is Luhrmann's Gatsby. Each of their characters individually sets and undertone that isn't to be missed. <br/><br/>One of the biggest flaws in this picture is its use of quotes from the book. Luhrmann didn't fully commit. He chose to take lines directly from the novel and then failed to use the actual quote. <br/><br/>The reason that Fitzgerald's novel is such a rich part of American literature is because the story can be interpreted in so many ways. Gatsby can be seen as a hopeless romantic, an obsessive mad man, or a greedy mobster. Daisy can be seen as selfish and cruel but also as a victim of her circumstance. The beauty of the novel is that it lets its characters be seen from every angle and allows itself to be interpreted in whichever way the reader deems necessary. Luhrmann has created a masterpiece that affords his moviegoers the same luxury as Fitzgerald's readers. The characters and scenery and costumes are so elegantly made that they could have been created entirely in Gatsby's imagination."
"cultfilmfan","10","2","5","13 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby
","The Great Gatsby, based upon the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is probably a book a lot of you, or at least most of you, probably read in one of your high school English classes. I was in a split class one year, where one grade was taking the novel and the other one was not, so unfortunately to this day I have never read the book, but as a treat for the class the teacher showed both grades in the split class the 1974 film version of the novel by Jack Clayton, and starring Robert Redford, and Mia Farrow. Most of the class, well pretty much all of it, really disliked the film, but I was one of the few who really enjoyed it. To this day the only Fitzgerald novel that I have read is Tender is the Night, and I also saw the 1985 television miniseries of the novel with Peter Strauss, and Mary Steenburgen, and I quite enjoyed it. Part of me was somewhat concerned about this new Gatsby version with it's pricey budget and the fact that it was shot in 3D and also delayed in release a couple of months for re-shoots. Fortunately, the film met and surpassed all of my expectations. What, I really loved about the film was not the 3D look, or feel to it, which was okay, but I found neither added, or really took anything away from the film, but what I really loved was the general message that Fitzgerald and the screenwriters were trying to say with this film and I suppose with the original novel as well. Gatsby, is such a mysterious person who throws huge lavish parties that must cost a fortune and all the big names and socialites in town are there, partying it up and having a great time, but few really know Gatsby, or even what he looks like. How, Gatsby got through to an average everyday man like Nick Carraway, is in it's own way fascinating and kind of heartfelt as well. We see Gatsby, as a mighty man with a vast fortune and power and he can pretty much do anything he wants, or acquire, or buy anything with a price tag on it, but the one thing that he does not have and which I think is sorely lacking in his life and he knows it, is love. He puts on heirs, dresses in the best clothes and throws these huge parties, but I think in a sense this is all trying to compensate for his loneliness and to buy approval from others. He is never really thanked for his parties and nobody ever really seems to make too big a fuss about him until Nick comes along. We can see why Nick is so much in adoration of Gatsby. He learns of Gatsby's tales and how he made a name for himself in the world, but is humble and kind deep down and really in need of friendship and love. There was one scene in the film, that I can not say too much about because I do not want to give it away, but it revolves around the reunion between two characters in this film and just the way the scene is set up with the direction, acting, music and the way it was scripted really hit home for me. Not so much because I have been in a similar situation, but because this situation that the characters had between each other felt real, somewhat awkward and at the same time, beautiful. I was extremely moved on several different occasions during this film and I do not think the tender emotion, or some of Fitzgerald's philosophies and character critiques were lost here in translation with the big budget and with the 3D. The film in it's own way is very sad in it's own right as well and what is especially sad about these scenes and events are because it is so typical of mankind and society, not just at that period of time, but throughout the ages and even happening this very day. How some people just crave money and living the life of luxury and fame and wealth and how they do not care who they hurt, or how they go about getting there. Gatsby, with all his wealth and fame, still remains humble and an exceptional human being, but the others around him are all unfortunately in it for themselves and nobody else, which ultimately ends up with the sad part of the film and the heartbreak. The Great Gatsby, works so well because even though it takes place in the 1920's it could really take place anytime because it's theme and message is one that still rings true to this day. Heroes, antiheroes and everyday people are shown here, warts and all and I loved that about the film. The film looks epic and lush and is pleasing to the eye, the acting is all very impressive as is the direction and adapted screenplay. It shows the downside to America at that time and time over the decades and that unfortunately sometimes nice guys do really finish last. An excellent expose of human nature as well as an emotionally moving and entertaining journey through that. One of the year's best."

","After reading the Great Gatsby last summer, I really enjoyed it. The themes were powerful, the characters were compelling, and the plot was really well thought out. I really recommend it if you haven't read it as a freshman year novel study. Now, I thought Leonardo DiCaprio is the perfect choice for Gatsby, he is a great actor that really has the range to take on the role. However, the writing makes what made Gatsby endearing, awkward and homo erotic, and somewhat mentally handicapped. Tobey Maguire does a fine job as Nick Carraway, and Joel Edgerton does well as Tom Buchanan. Yet, the real letdown for me was Carey Mulligan as Daisy. No one wants to see a weak female character, well at least I don't. She does OK performance wise but, yet again she was written awkwardly. It makes her unlikable, plain and simple, you want her to die at the end, not Gatsby. I have to admit, I'm not a fan of Baz Luhrman's directing. I have not seen Moulin Rouge, but I do not want to, mostly because his 'modern twists' are a major distraction to the time period the theme is supposed to be set in. I kept hearing mellowed down pop songs. However, the one thing that he gets right are the visuals, this film is visually stunning, which is the best thing I can say about an adaption of such a compelling novel as the Great Gatsby. If you want a more rewarding experience-read the book."
"jess277","8","2","5","12 May 2013"," Overall an entertaining film
","First of all, I want to say that I have not read the book or seen the original movie for The Great Gatsby. I am writing strictly from a movie- goer's perspective.<br/><br/>This is not one of the best films I have seen, but it is definitely not a bad film. The film immerses you into the plot and character relationships, all revolving around the same person: Jay Gatsby. I think the best casting decision in this film was having Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. He did an excellent job conveying Gatsby's hope, passion, and borderline desperation as he plasters on fake smiles and hosts extravagant parties to attract the attention of the woman he is in love with, and the whole film basically rides on his performance. Of course, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Tobey Maguire were great as well. <br/><br/>The visuals and soundtrack are amazing. Even if you don't find this movie very good, you can't deny that it's beautiful to look at. It really pops out at you. <br/><br/>I will say that I enjoyed the middle and end more than the beginning. There was something about the beginning that I didn't quite like. I found it strange and a little slow. Luckily, it really improved as the movie went on. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film and certainly an entertaining one. Please don't go in to the theater ready to compare this film to the book, and just look at it as a film. My friend, who watched the movie with me, has read the book but pushed the book out of her mind as she watched the film, and enjoyed the film very much. This one is definitely worth a watch."
"williemajeska7","8","2","5","11 May 2013"," A Visually Stunning Roller-Coaster Ride.
","Baz Luhrmann's version of the epic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a visually stunning roller-coaster ride. <br/><br/>The story follows bond salesman Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he meets his illustrious next door neighbor Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). He quickly learns that Gatsby is looking to meet up with his long lost love, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), who also happens to be Nick's cousin. <br/><br/>The movie starts off in an abrasive, loud, overwhelming manner that at the time seems confusing, yet as the movie goes on it becomes more clear. It features lavish party sequences at the Gatsby mansion that are beyond the wildest imagination. The realization is made that these wild scenes are merely to set up the legend that is Jay Gatsby. <br/><br/>As the story continues we learn some things about Gatsby's past. We learn of his love for Daisy and how it dates back 5 years. A man like Gatsby with such wealth and fame could have had any woman he wanted yet the only one he ever had a shred of interest in was Daisy, and to me that is what makes it such an intense, emotional love story. <br/><br/>The performances in the film are mostly phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job playing the Gatsby character who is constantly toeing the line between edgy and calm. He makes it very easy to believe that his character Gatsby has a great deal of love for Daisy and that he very much cares about her each and every thought. Tobey Maguire does a solid job portraying our narrator and co-main character Nick Carraway. His nervous acting style works perfectly for this role as the character he plays is one that hasn't seen much and still doesn't know or understand much about the world he is being thrust into. Carey Mulligan plays Daisy very convincingly often being forced to show strong emotion, whether it be nerves or fright and so on. Joel Edgerton does a good job portraying the womanizing and intimidating Tom Buchanan.<br/><br/>The modern soundtrack works here and there, it certainly doesn't match the time period but it does spice things up.<br/><br/>All in all this latest version of The Great Gatsby is a success. The goal of any movie is to entertain and this certainly does that with mesmerizing visuals and strong emotional performances. The Great Gatsby is no 100% of what it could be but it is undoubtedly very close.<br/><br/>8/10"
"capmoonbeams","10","2","5","11 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby is Terrific!
","This film is Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of the famous and celebrated novel The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. I have never read the novel version of the Great Gatsby however I can tell you this is a must see film. The plot follows Nick Carraway(Tobey Maguire) a New York stock broker who is drawn to the past and lifestyle of his wealthy neighbor Jay Gatsby(Leonardo Dicaprio). This movie is set during the roaring 20's and features excellent performances, music, costumes, set design, and special effects. Leonardo Dicaprio gives an excellent performance along with the rest of the cast that includes Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and Joel Edgerton. The film runs at 2 hours and 20 minutes however it doesn't feel that long due to the fact it keeps you interested with its performances and story. Everyone in the theatre loved it and said it followed the novel pretty closely which I now want to read. Perhaps the most enchanting thing about the Great Gatsby is the message that it leaves, which is one that is truly timeless. So whether a fan of the novel or someone interested in the movie by itself, watch the Great Gatsby and let its story, performances, and message move you."
"khanbaliq2","9","3","11","7 June 2013"," An absorbing, delightful, tragic and reverent adaptation of a seemingly unfilmable story.
","Watching The Great Gatsby was a pleasant surprise for me. It's the best film I've seen so far this year, and it's easily the best adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's celebrated novel. The first two things that stand out in the film are the masterful art direction and set design. There are gorgeous costumes galore but even the backgrounds are detailed and beautifully shot. Director Baz Luhrmann mentioned that he wanted the period to look fresh even by today's standards. The 1920s was certainly a booming period, but in the film it's so lush and vibrant that it's as though we're looking at another world. This is a good thing though. It's one of the film's strengths. Western Civilization was still expanding at that time. I recommend that people read historian Carroll Quigley's great books. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an excellent performance as the mysterious, charismatic and handsome Jay Gatsby. Though Gatsby is a tragic character DiCaprio exudes his pure enduring hope perfectly. In this film DiCaprio just is Gatsby. But in addition to DiCaprio's central performance we have commitment from every other actor too. Joel Edgerton is particularly effective as Daisy's brute husband Tom Buchanan. Carey Mulligan, who burst into tears when she got the part, was an interesting though good choice for the role of Daisy Buchanan. In yet another good role Tobey Maguire is perfect at playing Nick Carraway. But there's also the captivating performance from Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker. The soundtrack features the talents of Jay-Z, Beyonce, Lana del Rey, Florence + the Machine, Bryan Ferry, Jack White and Gotye. The choice of these performers may seem odd but their music works well in the context of the film. Some of the biggest names in today's music industry were contributors, but I would even say that the choice of music was sometimes inspired. The film is simply beautiful as well as entertaining. Luhrmann and Catherine Martin have to be praised. What I liked most about it, however, was it's chain of impressive scenes. In my opinion the film's pacing is similar to Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985). That is, almost every scene is an infectious episode that can be seen again and again. This again shows that Luhrmann is a great director. No doubt about it, The Great Gatsby is must-see cinema. Even if you didn't like Moulin Rouge! (2001) and Australia (2008) you should see this film. I highly recommend it."

","""The Great Gatsby"" tells the story of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a secretive millionaire who is in love with a wealthy woman named Daisy Buchanan, played by Carey Mulligan. When Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire, moves in next to Gatsby, he doesn't hesitate to use Nick to get close to his lost love. With the publicity constantly involved in his life, Gatsby finds it hard keeping his love for Daisy hidden from her husband. When Daisy's Husband, Tom Buchanan. Played by Joel Edgerton, discovers his wife's affection for Gatsby, he is quick to make sure it doesn't last. When Jay Gatsby's past is revealed, his entire life begins to unravel. Can Gatsby and Daisy make a life for themselves or will the past control the future?<br/><br/>I am in love with this movie! Words can't describe how incredible the entire film is, but I'll do my best. This film is in 3D, which makes the incredible set and costume design come to life. The visuals in this film could have been a movie of its own because they are so breathtakingly beautiful. The rich colors and textures make the cinematography pop. This film is set in the 20s, where life for the wealthy was lavish and over the top 24-7 and the wardrobe really shows that off. The entire look of this movie is so rich and lavish that it sucks you in and you feel as if you can grasp the fabrics and streamers of Jay Gatsby's parties because everything is so full-bodied with color. I feel like you could take a screenshot of every frame in this film and then send it off to a photography museum because it is just so striking.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is another thing of wonder in this film. It features modern songs such as Jay-Z and Kanye West's ""No Church in the Wild"" as well as Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" and other artist such as Florence + the Machine, Beyonce, Will.Iam and even a few dubstep mixes, however all these modern hits are meshed with 20s rag time, giving it an authentic feel with a modern edge. It took me a few scenes to get used to because when I first heard modern artist Frank Ocean singing while a 20s-themed trumpet tune played, I was a little shocked. Once I warmed up to it, I fell in love with the unique sound. I actually think it is a very clever way to make the younger generation become more enthralled with the movie because the music we are used to at parties is the more modern sound. I think it is a clever way to make the festivities of this movie more appealing to a younger crowd. <br/><br/>My favorite scene would have to be when Nick goes to one of Gatsby's massive parties. People from all over New York and from all walks of life would flock to Gatsby's house weekend after weekend to indulge in his lavish lifestyle, even though none of them knew Gatsby or had ever met him. In the very first party scene you really become engorged in the luxurious accommodations of Gatsby's palace. His house is filled with streamers, dancers, outrageously dressed guests and vivid decor. The entire scene is so visually pleasing. I also really enjoyed the scene where Gatsby plans for Daisy to visit Nick at his house and then ""coincidentally"" stop by so he can see her again after 5 years. I like this scene because Gatsby always seems like such a confident man who is on top of the world but, when he is faced with seeing his true love after so many years apart, he gets the demeanor of a squeamish school boy. It is so cute how he obsesses over Daisy in the beginning of the scene and it is touching how nervous he gets before she comes over. Leonardo's acting in this scene is truly astounding and his subtle display of emotions accents the fact that he is frantically trying to conceal his emotions.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Jay Gatsby because he is such a complex man. He builds his entire dream life to impress Daisy. He builds his home across the lake from her house so he can see her, throws parties hoping she'll attend, and does everything in his power to be near to her which is very humbling considering he could do virtually anything with his riches. Leonardo's performance in this film deserves an award because of how realistically he portrayed Gatsby. I truly respect Leonardo as an actor because no matter what role he is playing I never see it as Leo playing so and so, but I see him as the actual character. He full-heartedly embodies Jay Gatsby and shows the depths of the character in such a remarkable way. I loved every second of his performance.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film 5 out of 5 stars, I would give it more if I could! ""The Great Gatsby"" has everything I look for in a film - well executed plot, excellent visuals, unique music, and a brilliant cast and crew. I recommend this film for ages 13 and up for excessive drinking and mature situations. I can't wait to see this film again.<br/><br/>Video review available at kidsfirst.org."
"st-shot","4","2","6","8 April 2014"," The Luhrmann Touch displays its crass heavy hand.
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's words continue to stymie filmmaker's attempts to present a decent rendering of his classic 20th century novel The Great Gatsby. The 26 and 49 version gave it little respect while the big budget 74 treatment suffered from the miscasting of long in the tooth Redford and too wispy Mia Farrow as Daisy, though rumored alternatives Ali McGraw and Sibyl Shepherd may have made it even more of a perilous effort. Enter the 2013 failure under the over baked heat and light direction of Boz Luhrmann's wretched excess.<br/><br/>Given the same application as his insult to the Belle Epoque in Moulin Rouge Luhrmann slaps on the divine decadence of the Jazz Age at a furious pace while attempting in surreal fashion to remain au courant with an ill fitting hip hop score amid his flashy and noisy compositions populated by wind up flappers under car lot lighting.<br/><br/>While the 74 was a disappointment this abrasive lout of a picture is far more of a mess with Luhrmann's response to everything bigger and louder. Even the Valley of Ashes is expanded to the size of Akron. Matching the overall bombast of this carnival (albeit the midway and not a sideshow) are scenery chewing performances led by Len DiCaprio as Gatsby and the rest of the cast following suit with the exception of Tobey Maguire's limp wishy washy Nick Carroway who seems blinded by the light from the outset.<br/><br/>Along with Peter Jackson's botched King Kong, Gatsby is another example of Hollywood's passion for eye popping technology at the expense of story telling and human interest. Unfortunately with the failed 50s gimmick of 3-D catching on these days meretricious offerings like this will probably be the rule for years to come."
"YabbaDabbaDabba","3","2","6","25 September 2013"," Fitzgerald Must Be Rolling Over In His Grave
","As I watched this 2013 Great Gatsby I had the impression of a melding of Roger Rabbit and bad set design from a Broadway musical. Maybe it was Dick Tracy and the musical. It was very cartoonish, and my early concern about Leonardo DiCaprio's ability to pull off Gatsby was confirmed. In fact, I saw shallow characterizations from almost everyone.<br/><br/>Why was it necessary to utilize computer generated scenery? And, the car scenes were definitely from Dick Tracy (you remember that 1990 cartoon, don't you)? The Great Gatsby is serious literature from one of America's greats. I am embarrassed for everyone involved in the production. Wow, this really represents the worst in entertainment, but I was charitable and gave it a 3/10. My recommendation is to rent the 1974 movie, or even better read the novel...it's not that long."

","OK, so I am not a fan of either of the 2 male leads in this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire are both famous Overactors, and it shows once again.<br/><br/>The story is sound but I instantly knew that the director had to be the same one that made the movie Moulin Rouge. I was right. The difference? That movie was new, fresh, sexy and fun. This movie is not that. It's cheesy, annoying, and a waste of film as they were just trying to capture the magic of that past film. I should have looked to see who the director was first instead of wasting a couple hours watching it. It combines the same type of musical style as Moulin Rouge, but there was and added horror of watching the overly dramatic feel of the equally stupid movie ""Australia.""<br/><br/>Look, this movie would have been fine if it was on stage, on Broadway. As a feature film it just blows. Keep the overly dramatic soap opera crap where it belongs. I can see why this movie was pushed so hard. Because otherwise it would have completely and totally failed. Another slight of hand, they gave DiCaprio top billing when he was really just a supporting actor to the equally cheesy Tobey Maguire. Dicaprio as predicted, overacted to death, and flashed his equally fake smile in every shot he was in. Please tell this dude to tone it down. As for Maguire, well let's face it, every character he plays comes off as some sort of 15 year old naive Disney character from one of those old movies like ""chitty-chitty bang bang.<br/><br/>A movie's success should not be made on how much they make at the box office. A movie's success should be measured on how long it takes for the person that scraped together the $20 to buy a ticket to look at their watch or cell phone begging for a reason to leave after it starts<br/><br/>It's a 5..."

","Once again Leo is flawless in his acting, words simply fail when trying to describe how well he performed his role. Toby was definitely keeping up with Leo's speed in the film.. he pulled of Nick Carraway perfectly. I'd say the casting was pretty spot on except for Daisy, Carey Mulligan just does not have the potential to pull off Daisy's vivacity or ""angel like good looks"".<br/><br/>Cinematography was amazing, Baz Luhrman certainly pulled out all the stops however, I do feel that he got a bit lost trying to make the film a visual spectacle and lost the importance of the plot along in doing so. I feel like he could have pulled it more tightly together rather than having the setting, special effects and scenery overwhelm and overshadow the story line of Fitzgeralds classic.<br/><br/>Also having rap music rather than a classic jazz age soundtrack.. a total fail on his part.<br/><br/>But all in all, it is worth the money and time to see it in theatres. But it did have more potential as a film."
"zachlovesmusic1","7","2","6","11 May 2013"," Well... the Second and Third act was good.
","Soon after I read the novel I knew it was among my favorites. The depth of a 200 page novel was quite impressive. The film does it best to capture this depth, but generally falls short.<br/><br/>However, that doesn't mean I didn't like the film, overall did, I felt the director generally was able to nail the atmosphere of the novel, and effectively integrate the symbols and motifs that are in the novel. Sometimes it was a little too much, with harsh camera movements and ridiculous color schemes, nevertheless, I think Luhrmann was the right for man for the film. <br/><br/>Now, the first Act. Very close to dreadful and made it seem the film was going to continue down this path and make this a very disappointing film. This has to be the most shocking and inappropriate use of music in a film to date. Understand that the bulk of your audience isn't going to be teenagers, rather middle-age and up. You are making a period piece and at many times it felt like a rap or dubstep music video. Not to mention they beat Lana Del Rey song Young and Beautiful into the ground. Which doesn't even make any sense, it didn't even reflect the action of the film in any way. The lyrics really have no coloration with the characters situation. Another major issue in the first act was the pacing. It was way to rushed, things happened in split seconds, if you hadn't read the novel it would have been difficult keeping things straight. Thus the first act had very little things going for it.<br/><br/>Now the second and third act were able to pretty much make up for first act. It was paced very well, the story finally became compelling, and no more majorly out of placed music. Aside from a few times Tobey Maguire Character came off dry, and the fact Jordan character was very insignificant, the final two acts were very good. DiCaprio's acting was quite impressive, wouldn't be in his top 5 performances or anything, but as always he gives a very great performance.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you can get passed the first act, then any Gatsby fan should generally be satisfied with the film. It is a fairly faithful adaptation, and the visuals at times are very stunning. Thus I would hesitantly recommend the film, despite its glaring flaws, it still is a fairly solid film.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"Christian_Dimartino","9","2","6","10 May 2013"," If you like Luhrmann and haven't read the book, you will enjoy it.
","Critics are annihilating Baz Luhrmann's flashy, dazzling, and ambitious adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, one of the years highly anticipated films (it is what I've been waiting for all year, and last year). Here is the reason why: Luhrmann's style does not appeal to all. His films are an acquired taste. Most of the population that saw Luhrmann's modern day Romeo + Juliet was divided. I liked the movie, because it was a unique blend of Shakespeare and flashy ghetto. Each of his movies are like a circus on cocaine, and not everyone is into that. I am, and that is why I was easily enchanted by The Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>Set in the 1920's jazz era, Nick Carroway (Tobey Maguire) has just moved to Long Island, across from his cousin Daisey (Carrey Mulligan) and her cheating husband Tom (Joel Edgerton). Living next door to Nick is a mysterious guy named Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), who hosts these glamorous parties that Luhrmann is an expert at. Nobody has met Gatsby, the guests just arrive uninvited. Soon, Nick meets Gatsby, and the more that he speaks to him, pieces of his past are brought to the surface.<br/><br/>I am going to be honest: I have not read the book. I tried it, but honestly it was a little difficult to get into. Not to sound illiterate but it is true. I think another reason why critics are tearing it apart is because, like many, they have read the book, and do not like the Luhrmann touch to it. I love the Luhrmann touch. I love the soundtrack and the atmosphere, particularly in the party sequences. The film has got a great energy, and terrific cinematography. It is as if the movie is being adapted by Coco Chanel. DiCaprio is such a good actor, it is almost a crime that he has not been nominated for more/won an Oscar already. I wasn't expecting any love for him in this movie, but I was expecting this to be the best movie of the year. It is not quite the best movie of the year. It is one of them though. It has been a slow year at the movies, and with the summer season on the horizon, it is nice to have a movie without an explosion. That said, I had a great time at last week's Iron Man 3. <br/><br/>I suppose that if you have read the book, you will probably despise the movie. But I have not, and I had a good time. If you hate Luhrmann and love the book, you will hate the movie, which most people have. Luhrmann appeals to only a certain few, myself included (not ashamed to admit my admiration for the visual darling Moulin Rouge! and the long but gorgeous Australia). That said, it isn't perfect. It is a little too long, and DiCaprio says ""old sport"" too much. Just sit back, relax, and get consumed by Luhrmann's vision. It's a good one.<br/><br/>A-"

It's so unrelentingly boring that I found my self having to take breaks at 20 minute intervals because I simply couldn't sit through it all at once. The worst part is when it isn't just a boring, uninspired montage of expository dialogue, it becomes a loud, obnoxious mess of misplaced modern music and really really terrible editing. I'm aware that a lot of films based in older settings use modern music as a sort of juxtaposition but in this film it's abused to the point of annoyance. Also why does Gatsby have to say ""old sport"" at the end of every single sentence? I get what they were going for and I don't know if that's how it was in the book, but for god sakes why does he need to say it so abundantly? If you took a shot for every time Gatsby says that phrase, you'd be dead in 30 seconds, if you hadn't already died of boredom.<br/><br/>Honestly what a waste of time, I'm amazed I actually managed to force myself through to the end of this snooze fest.

The flashy yet dull Moulin Rouge toned down my early enthusiasm for Baz Luhrmann, and the descriptions I heard from friends suggested this might be more substanceless flash. Many of my friends are also 1920s aficionados who complained about the music.<br/><br/>But when I finally watched the movie, I really, really liked it.<br/><br/>The movie is quite flashy, especially in the early parts, but it's not substanceless flash. Gatsby is in large part about ostentatious, unthinking wealth, and the flashy camera-work and frenetic cutting and R&B soundtrack all emphasize that this isn't a period piece about attitudes of the 20s but rather is about wealth and the desire for wealth that permeates our culture. The flashiness is also very well done, and the film is often visually stunning, whether it's showing a crazy party, a gorgeous vista, or a gritty slum.<br/><br/>The movie is also notable for its low-key but insistent underscoring of racism. Black people are continually seen in the background as servants and entertainers while the white folks' dramas play out. It's nice to see a movie about rich people that offers that sort of context.<br/><br/>The casting is interesting, in that I felt unsure about a lot of it at first but warmed up to pretty much everyone. None of this was based on the book, which I barely recall, but simply on my impression of what each character should be.<br/><br/>The one character who seemed perfect from the beginning was Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan. He felt exactly right for the part. Tobey Macguire seemed odd and out of keeping with his world, but I eventually thought that was appropriate. Carey Mulligan seemed a bit less likable than I would have expected, but it made perfect sense as the movie progressed. The casting only felt odd at first because I didn't really know who these people were or understand the complexity of the story.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is the perfect example of someone who seemed slightly off in a way that turned out to be perfect. There was an odd mix of charm and falseness to him when he first appeared, but it turns out that's pretty much exactly what the part needs. And DiCaprio does a wonderful job of showing you what's going on under the facade, most notably in the lead-up to tea at Nick's, where he is funny and vulnerable.<br/><br/>I read The Great Gatsby a million years ago - I was probably in high school - and I was really underwhelmed, unable to see why it was considered a classic. But the movie, which pulls a lot of great lines from the book, makes me think I should really re-read it. And I think any movie that makes viewers curious about the book is worthwhile.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn't care for at all was the framing scenes involving a psychiatrist and the writing of a book, which for me felt extraneous and slightly distracting. <br/><br/>I wasn't expecting to like this movie. My girlfriend and I began by saying, well, if it's awful we can just stop. But we were both pleasantly surprised by what an excellent movie it turned out to be."
"Irishchatter","8","1","2","5 March 2017"," A good colourful film with Leonardo DiCaprio!
","I swear, this movie was just really colourful and at the same time, it was rather sad. The saddest parts I experienced the most while watching this were Gatby's lover is already married to somebody else and the fact, in the end, we see him being killed by the husband of the woman who got runned down by Gatsby's lover and him killing himself after killing Gatsby! I swear, Gatsby's lover was such a coward for not saying it was her, its like she didn't want to be arsed in getting involved. I mean she might as well blamed Gatsby for this instead of her. I couldn't even believe that she didn't even say a proper goodbye to him at his funeral, that was pure cold and mean! Seriously, Gatsby was wasting his time with her, it pretty much was too late that Tom got there first to marrying her! <br/><br/>I absouletely love the acting, the colours, the scenes and the storyline even if it was sad! I give this a 8/10!"

","Several times i tried to watch this movie. sometimes i could not gather the courage other times i could not get passed first 10 minutes but this time i am glad that i made may way though the first 30 minutes. Tobey Maguire was brilliant and Leonardo was marvelous. The love is in the air. Whole film passed as a fairy tale. Leaves me smiling with tears in my eyes at the end. The end of the film was as it should be. I think that these type of persons only exists in the tales and not in real who put everything on the stake for the love. Brilliantly filmed and acted, my thanks for the director who made such a nice romantic movie. One of the best romantic movie I have ever seen, I would compare it with sleepless in Seattle."

","Baz Luhrmann produces an amazing film with his production of the novel, ""The Great Gatsby."" From the vibrant sets, the platonic chemistry of the characters, and a soundtrack to fit the scene, Luhrmann nails this one right on the head. This film redefines the possibilities of the ""classic novel movie.""<br/><br/>This film is about the irresistible love story of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). The once lovers are reunited and that is where the real story begins. Gatsby's neighbor, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), just so happens to be Daisy's cousin and that is Gatsby's connection back to her. But the biggest obstacle of all throughout the movie? Daisy is not a single woman, she is married to the wealthy and powerful Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). This film portrays the story of Gatsby and Daisy and how it their love was destructive to everyone involved. <br/><br/>One epic scene was the extravagant party scene thrown by Gatsby at his palace of a home. Thousands of extras and thousands of costumes were sewn just for this one scene. Not to mention, Luhrmann won two Academy Awards in costume design and production design. The chaotic feeling of it all makes you feel as if you are part of the party. With all the dancing, streamers, add fireworks, you are left in awe from Luhrmann's amazing visuals, which sets a spectacular precedent for the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Jay Gatsby is absolutely captivating. DiCaprio can pull off the mixture of pathetic vulnerability and confident charisma that is known as the Gatsby character. With urgency in his voice and an ever-so charming smirk, DiCaprio steals your heart in this film. He commands the audience with every presence and keeps you on edge of your seat with his dazzling performance. <br/><br/>Carey Mulligan could not have been a better fit for the role of Daisy Buchanan. She floats throughout the film with this type of innocence that leaves you questioning how innocent she really is. Mulligan takes on the sad-eyed role of the narcissistic Daisy, and plays it perfectly. Every scene she appears in, Mulligan light voice leaves you wanting more. She is more than any Dais Buchanan, she is the Daisy that F. Scott Fitzgerald would have wanted to play the role. Mulligan plays his role to a tee. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire's on screen performance as Nick Carraway was also utterly inspiring. The way he is pulled into Gatsby's world and then back to his own leaves you asking yourself if anyone else could have pulled off a better performance. The answer to that is no, Maguire's performance was one of a kind. His facial expressions help describe more than any other actor's words could. Overall, Maguire makes you feel the emotion of the truly devastating tale. <br/><br/>The soundtrack of the film is the cherry on top. The anachronistic soundtrack will leave you hypnotized with amazement. Jay-Z, the producer of the soundtrack, pulls together the hectic-ness of the party scenes with jazz with a beat along with the having the lustfully beautiful Lana Del Rey and Beyonce to depict the romantic urgency between Gatsby and Daisy. The music is a mix between yesterday's Jazz and the modern world of pop; and it most definitely works. The contemporary approach was a huge hit. <br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann pulls through with this one, making this novel into an epic love story. It is a terrific adaption that succeeds as a great film. In this jazz-inspired film, you will get a glimpse of the frenzied life in the 1920's. Between the Grammy-nominated soundtrack produced by Jay-Z, a cast that captures your attention on-screen, and a director that makes you feel a part of the extravagant party scenes, you will fall hopelessly in love with the story of Jay Gatsby's and Daisy Buchanan's love story. Baz Luhrmann treats this novel with a modern playfulness and his approach definitely works."

","As a foreigner, I've never read or even heard about the book. Neither saw the first movie about it. I was on a long flight looking forward to something to watch, and I came across The Great Gatsby. Duration: about 2 hrs 30 min. Staring: Leo Di Caprio. Instant double click. Little I have to say about this movie. Plot is nonsense and slow. Tobey Maguire's performance is tyring (In my opinion, he's not meant to be a main character). And the modern music scenes finished it off. I do highlight the picture and costume designs though. Di Caprio's performance tries to pull this movie out of the mud, but his character is too dumb and complex at the same time, two features that should never merge. I came in to read some reviews as to check if I was the only one thinking like this. Honestly, only people quoting the book have appreciated this movie."
"reppep","6","1","2","3 April 2015"," Interesting but frustrating
","I haven't read Gatsby in years, but my reaction at the end felt familiar. Despite Nick's love, this isn't the tragedy of a man who is better than everyone, destroyed by a cruel and uncaring world. Gatsby sacrifices his life to protect his love. He accomplishes everything he wants, except her divorce and remarriage. Despite being a criminal and a fraud, Gatsby enjoys his affair, wealth, and fame. Unreasonable Gatsby does better with his (married) girlfriend than he has any right to expect. He dies successfully protecting Daisy, believing he won the game, once again thanks to good old Nick.<br/><br/>It was very odd to hear such *modern* music by black musicians, alternating with Tom ranting about the necessity of keeping the 'inferior' black population suppressed in front of his small army of black servants. As a friend pointed out, there is a huge amount of great Jazz Age music that would have worked perfectly, so there was no need to bring us out of the period that way.<br/><br/>The first third was all about huge dance numbers and set pieces, which was fun but felt a bit orthogonal to the plot. Clearly Baz is one of the many people more into ambiance than I...<br/><br/>Before I even saw the movie I was wondering why Baz was effacing Fitzgerald as the creator of this story. At the end the story is credited to Nick and the credits talk about Baz, but there's nothing about Fitzgerald. Could the creator of such a huge and successful piece really be that insecure?"
"martaborows","9","1","2","14 March 2015"," Hardships of love, manipulation, and media
","The love story in this movie and the depths Gatsby goes to in order to be with the woman he loves and who loves him reminds one of what it means to live. Not just to be alive but to really live. <br/><br/>As Gatsby follows the pursuit of one of the things that really makes us human (the ability to love and fall deeply in love), he has to go against the rules set out by humanity (pursuing a married woman) which highlights a beautiful yet saddening truth of the institution of marriage, and an even more beautiful and saddening truth about being in love. <br/><br/>This movie reminds me that people tend to remember the bad instead of the good in people and their actions, bringing up an important issue that if only people understood and ""walked a mile"" in Gatsby's shoes, they would understand where he is coming from and perhaps would follow a similar path. However, because of manipulation and media, not all the facts are disclosed, nor are they disclosed honestly, and typically the public eats it all up, as they do in this movie. In this case, the only person who knew the truth beyond the parties involved was Nick, and without his account of the inside scoop, it is possible that we would have pegged Gatsby as more of an antagonist than a protagonist.<br/><br/>Though the movie portrays elegant, rich, and boisterous parties with beautiful people, cars, and homes (all which made for great movie aesthetics), it reminds me of the saddening truth that these painfully heartbreaking situations happen in real life and affect real people, even if they are not so dramatized."
"amr905-254-678257","10","1","2","3 March 2015"," Brilliant film
","The Great Gatsby is a terrific film for its beautiful replica of the book, and the amazing quote usage. <br/><br/>The scenery is amazing, the placement and arrangement of everything tells you so much about who everyone is. The way it is scripted and shot makes you feel like you are there with Nick, experiencing his life and what is happening between him and everyone else. The way the scene is packed with so much information, I think, is very good. The characters clothing revealed so much about them, and the lighting was nothing special.<br/><br/>The colors are so astounding, they really are. Everything in this movie symbolized something and they did a great job with it.<br/><br/>Now, there are some complaints I have; I wish this movie did reveal more of everyone's character, like the book did. They left out scenes I believed would give you sympathy for all the characters, but overall was an amazing movie."

","Finally had the opportunity to see this. I can certainly see why it cost so much to make. Although the story is typical, the costumes and set design are really fantastic. I mean super fantastic. The scenes of New York in the 20's, are wow. A lot of work went into producing this film. I liked all the performances as well. Many people complain that it isn't like the book. Well, they never are. You can't take a full length novel and turn it into a two hour movie. You have to cut somewhere and merge other scenes. That's just the way it works. As always, a good performance by Leonardo DiCaprio - love this guy. As well as Toby McGuire. Love him too.!"
"anthonymichaelbangert","7","1","2","7 February 2015"," A Love Story Like No Other
","I was not a fan of the book this movie was based on. So I was already going in with extremely low expectations. I was not completely unfounded in my thoughts. Jay Gatsby is a rich war veteran in the 1920s. He wasn't always this way but he is now. Mr. Gatsby throws lavish parties every weekend from his home in Long Island. People from all over go to these parties. Mr. Gatsby's neighbor (a writer who works on Wall Street) is the first person to get an actual invitation (the rest come uninvited) from Jay himself. He immediately becomes good friends with Gatsby, and learns a few things about him. First, Jay Gatsby's life is not all law-abiding. Second, Mr. Gatsby throws his parties for one reason: a woman he met 5 years before that he holds on to hope will show up at the party and they could fall in love. This girl happens to be his neighbor's cousin. This is a love story like no other. However, I wasn't the biggest fan for many reasons. The script was strange, told from a narrative of Nick Carraway (Mr. Gatsby's neighbor) as he writes the story within the mental institution he is in. The cinematography was surreal, and it seemed like a good chunk of the film was in front of a green screen when it wasn't needed. And worst of all was the soundtrack. This is a score filled with hip hop in a film that takes place in the 20s. It doesn't fit, and doesn't work.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 6- Certain portions of the soundtrack worked, and the hip hop songs did capture the feeling of the portions of the film they were in, but it did not fit the time period.<br/><br/>Script: 6- Too much time went into visuals, and not enough went into the script. There were some things just didn't work. However I did enjoy the idea of the narrative element (something I usually cant stand). It just worked here.<br/><br/>Originality: 10- When doing a review on a well known movie adaptation of a book, you have to think of the originality of the story as one part as well as how the director created their own unique vision. This was definitely an original piece.<br/><br/>Cinematography: 7- This movie was very visually appealing, with bright lively colors. The cinematography gave a surreal feeling to the film, which was nice. However, there were times where the film felt like I was watching actors in front a green screen, which took me out a little.<br/><br/>Casting: 10- The cast was well made, all the actors are very capable.<br/><br/>Acting: 4- Baz Luhrmann has a specific style when he asks his actors to do something. He likes the art of heightened acting. However, these actors seemed to go too far in some parts, and not as far in others. The inconsistencies led to the low score.<br/><br/>Overall: 7.2"
"christinejones89","9","1","2","10 January 2015"," Overall a very enjoyable film!
","I must confess that I haven't read the book, but soon will do after watching this film. I wasn't entirely sure whether I'd enjoy this film or not, having read the synopsis and plot, it didn't excite me but I went ahead and watched it anyway. I enjoy Baz Luhrmann because I feel like he brings a modern outlook to his films. He used a modern day soundtrack with music we recognise today, for a film set in the 1920's which is one of the main features I enjoyed throughout this film. Secondly, I have to say that the sets, props and costumes that made the film, were literally stunning. I've always loved the 20's but this film made me quite envious to have not lived during that period. Toby Maguire was truly excellent. As someone who hasn't seen him in much other than Spider-Man, it was quite refreshing to see him in this quirky, light hearted but at the same time, serious role. Carey Mulligan, looked beautiful the whole way through and portrayed Daisy wonderfully. I think I was most impressed by Leonardo Dicaprio, as always with his films. I had no idea what Jay Gatsby was like, as I haven't read the book, but he came across to me very troubled, insecure about himself and his wealth and it was clear he put on a show to be the gentleman he aimed to be. He played the part extremely well!<br/><br/>Overall, it was a really enjoyable film, if not a little long. I'd definitely watch again, recommend to others, and I'm going to purchase the book so I can review the story from a different perspective!"
"shanebeacham","7","1","2","25 November 2014"," A Great Movie Downgraded By Its Focus On Spectacle Rather Than The Story
","I didn't (and still haven't) read F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, which many consider to be the epitome of the great American novel. However, I have seen some of director Baz Luhrmann's work, being Romeo + Juliet, which I thought was absolutely atrocious and a failure at what it was trying to accomplish. Luckily, walking out of the theater I was not displeased or annoyed, but I felt like I had just watched what could have been one of the best movies of the year...had a few things been changed.<br/><br/>First off, I got to mention Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. I know it is a clichÃ© to say that DiCaprio nailed it in a movie, but I felt like he really took over the role of Gatsby and breathed life into it. Every time he's on screen, he completely holds your attention. I'm not sure how his performance matches with the character from the book, but as far as I'm concerned, he killed it as Gatsby. I also have to give credit to Joel Edgerton as the antagonist Tom Buchanan. You absolutely hate his character and root for Gatsby to win in the end.<br/><br/>There's also a really great script here. The dialog is fast-paced and well written, and the way the story goes and comes together is definitely well done. And it had characters that I was invested in. I was interested in seeing where Gatsby came from and how the main character (played by Tobey Maguire) dealt with being around all this madness. It also ends really sad too, and it definitely felt effective in many ways.<br/><br/>Sounds like a pretty fantastic movie, right? Well, a lot of these things I enjoyed about the movie are often masked by the focus on the visual aspects. This movie has great visuals, sure. The costumes are excellent, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the visuals, when needed, look great. But they completely take over and feel so bombarded in your face that it took me out of the movie at multiple times. This felt very loud, in sound and style, and the modern rap songs played when the film is set in the 20's felt completely out of place. It feels like Luhrmann was trying too hard to make this modern and a spectacle, and in the process forgot to focus on the already fantastic script and actors in order to drive the movie.<br/><br/>However, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy The Great Gatsby. It was fun, well-acted, and had a great story and dialog. Even though I complained about the visuals being loud and distracting, they're still fun to look at and look spectacular. So while it may not be a perfect film, The Great Gatsby is one that I would recommend checking out, even if you're not a fan of Luhrmann's previous work."
"lizk2017","Null","1","2","24 September 2014"," The Great Gatsby review
","Once again F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic The Great Gatsby is brought to life on the big screen, but this time with much more flare and pizazz. This movie has definitely made its way into my top 10 favorite movies. It flawlessly brings the 1920's to the 21st century. The music, costumes, and casting play a huge part in making The Great Gatsby one of the best movie renditions of a book I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Director Baz Luhrmann transports famous artists such as Jay Z, BeyoncÃ©, Lana Del Ray, and Fergie into the 1920's. These dynamic performers add a modern day twist to the common jazz music of the twenties. Their up-beat bass line combines with the brass instrumentation to create some sort of musical magic. The song ""Crazy in Love"" (originally by BeyoncÃ©) remade by Emeli Sande and the Bryan Ferry Orchestra was one of the songs I though was remade very well. I almost like 1920's version better than the original. The whole soundtrack was actually really phenomenal, I know I went out and bought it when it came out and I can't possibly be the only one who did. I also can't be the only one who was in love with the costume design.<br/><br/>The costume design for Gatsby was phenomenal. I couldn't have pictured a better rendition of the roaring twenties than feathers, fringe and classy suits. The first time we see a party at Gatsby's, we see the costumes in full swing. I have never seen so many fabulous costumes! I was in dance class for 10 years so I've had my fair share of sparkle and fringe. It seemed every woman was either decked out in feathered head-dresses or long scarves tied around their head. Don't even get me started on the short hair, I have never considered chopping off all of my hair until we were exposed to Daisy Buchanan for the first time.<br/><br/>The casting of Gatsby was overall pretty well done. First of all we have Carey Mulligan, who plays Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin. Mulligan with her short hair creates the spitting image what I imagined Daisy to look like. I couldn't have picked a better actress to portray her. Next we have Tobey Maguire as the main character Nick Carraway. Maguire does a great job of playing an innocent man caught up in the life and luxury of the upper. And finally we have none other than Jay Gatsby. My absolute favorite part of The Great Gatsby is when the host of the party is revealed to Mr. Carraway. Nick is trailing behind an unseen face talking to him about who he thinks Gatsby is when, right at the peak of the music and the fireworks start exploding, (drum roll please) the amazing Leonardo DiCaprio turns around raising a glass, smile spread across his face revealing that he is none other than the mysterious Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio is still a heart throb and his portrayal of Gatsby was spot on. I wouldn't expect anything less from the wonderful Leo. Ultimately the remake of The Great Gatsby was very well done. It was very enjoyable for someone who, like me, loved the book and was skeptical of the movie. Even though some of the parts of the book like Nick and Jordan's romance was barely covered at all, I still give a huge thumbs up to Baz Luhrmann, the old sport, for creating this remake and not completely butchering the novel. Like Jay Gatsby said, ""Can't repeat the past?Â…Why of course you can!"""

"amsby17","Null","1","2","7 September 2014"," The best story of obsessed love done by Baz Luhrmann
","Director Baz Luhrmann stuns by telling the story of The Great Gatsby actually, quite well. Although Luhrmann's previous work includes the unfortunate Mulin Rouge; fear not - there's no over the top musical here - only a truly respectable representation of Fitzgerald's most famous novel. Now over 88 years old - its themes of greed, celebrity and power are still strongly relevant and affirms The Great Gatsby as one of America's great classic stories.<br/><br/>There are four main characters including: air-headed Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and husband Tom (Joel Edgerton), docile and innocent Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the ever-intriguing Jay Gatsby. Nick finds himself in a quaint little cottage surrounded by New York's lavish millionares when the story begins. He visits his silly cousin Daisy and brutish Tom while peering dreamily at his neighbor's huge and expensive parties. The party scenes are just as they should be - glitzy, wild and impressive. Gatsby is of course the neighbor, and by way of a unique invitation Nick finds himself wrapped up in Gatsby's world of excess and riches. The man is shrouded in mystery that only Nick is privy to exploring - including his history with Daisy. Gatsby is a determined and hopeful man whose polished manners and wealth were hard won. Viewers will admire Gatsby and pity him at the same time. With Leo blazing the way, all three male leads play their parts well throughout the film.<br/><br/>The casting of the female characters is where the film truly suffered. Despite the exquisite costumes and hair-do's - plain and sweet Carey Mulligan just cannot be the enchanting Daisy Buchanan and Isla Fisher is definitely no Myrtle Wilson (Tom's lover). Allowing this critique, Luhrmann did make some interesting choices with this film - including story-book visuals that work well with this piece. He also stayed true to the original novel and honored particular details readers of the story will appreciate. Watch (or read) The Great Gatsby if only to take a short glimpse at the shiny and tragic world of the 1920's."
"lisafordeay","7","1","2","30 August 2014"," I thought I was going to hate this movie as it was directed by the man that brought us Moulin Rouge.
","The Great Gatsby is based on a 1925 novel by F Scott Fitzgerald and tells the tale of a writer named Nick Carroway(played by the original Spiderman star Tobey Maguire) who is at the doctors and tells the doctor the story of a penniless man who became a millionaire as he had a wide imagination and was in love with a woman who is already married. So Nick talks to the doctor about it and we see Nick staying in a house where next door Jay Gatsby(played by Leonardo Di Caprio from Titanic and his best friends with Maguire in real life)in the year 1922. Every night Jay would throw a party where there's singing and dancing taking place,and of course hopes that his former flame will return to him again called Daisy(played by Carey Mulligan) who is already married to a man named Tom(played by Joel Edgerton)for the last 5 years or more,as Jay left her because he was a war veteran. Daisy however is actually Nick's cousin so when she and Jay are reunited can the two love birds be together,and will Daisy leave her husband for Gatsby?<br/><br/>SO what did I like about this film well the visuals are stunning as well as the costumes as the film is rather old-fashioned,also I thought Leo Di Caprio was great as Gatsby the charismatic billionaire who is actually a penniless man who inherited some man's fortune as he met the man on a yacht who wanted Gatsby's help when Gatsby was a teenager. Also in this film is Isla Fisher(from Confessions of a Shopaholic) who looks barely recognizable with her 1920s outfit and sporting a strong New York accent.<br/><br/>And now for the bad. Actually two things I have to say. Now this maybe a spoiler so I'm not gonna say what charcther dies or the person playing the charcther but I will give hint. So first is the music,now don't get me wrong some of the songs worked but what on earth is Kanye West,Jay Z(who is the executive producer for this film),Will.I.Am and Lana Del Ray as well as Jay Z's wife Beyonce got to do with the 1920s ? Shouldn't the director of the film get old fashioned music like Ella Fitzgerald,Louis Armstrong etc on the soundtrack and not these pop stars. <br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was that one charcther dies and the actor that plays him ALWAYS get killed in his movies. Now I am not saying the name of the actor as it could be any actor in this movie but why is it that the filmmakers kill this person off for? I would have liked if it was someone else that died,but since this is based on a novel we can't change history can we.<br/><br/>Overall The Great Gatsby is a stunning film to look at. A bit too long as it somewhat drags in the middle of the film but for 136 minutes its a great movie.<br/><br/>Winner of 2 Oscars and won other awards too mainly for the Costume Design I give it a thumbs up."

","Rarely do you find a love story told from the perspective of an outsider. This gives it an honesty which gives the romance a much greater rawness. Credit for this can only go to the great F Scott Fitzgerald, but who could deliver it better to our screens than Baz Luhrmann. I will never cease to understand how he creates false worlds on the screen which ooze greater beauty than real life. He manages to mesmerise us time after time, from seeing Gatsby in perfect definition despite the fact he is so far away, to the beauty of Daisy and Jordan in a room full of floating white curtains. The selection of modern music for a 1920s setting is so wrong but at the same time so very, very right. Another flawless performance by DiCaprio, Maguire and Mulligan. A star studded cast which brings both its talent and experience with it. Many a scene passes when the combination of sound, emotion, colour and definition makes you audibly say ""Wow"". As if we are looking at a majestic landmark; But we are in fact watching a moving picture which has, without our knowledge, become art."

","If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be ""beautiful"". I was never really a big fan of the original. It was just a movie you got forced to watch in English class. Baz Luhrmann's adaptation on the other hand drew me in and held my interest for the entire film. The dancing, the music, the costumes... this movie was a performance piece and it shinned.<br/><br/>I am aware that the film is quite unrealistic but I would like to think that would be how the billionaires of today would behave. It's about romance, fantasy and dreams. If you had all the money in the world how realistic would your life be. Besides; the cast were so incredible that you forgot about this fact.<br/><br/>While I truly enjoyed The Great Gatsby, I still don't really love the original story. But that would be my one and only negative. It's still a fantastic movie and I applaud Baz Luhrmann for creating beautiful films that are timeless."

","I'm not normally a huge fan of Baz Luhrmann's work but I really like this movie. Not only was it tastefully done while still giving F. Scott Fitzgerald's story a chance but the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard it years! At first I really wasn't happy with Carey Mulligan getting the part but when I saw her in the movie I thought she did a lot better job than any of the other Daisy's that's been portrayed (especially Mia Farrow's Daisy). There is really only two of Leo's character's that I've ever had massive sympathy for and one of them is J. Gatsby (the other is Teddy Daniels). He plays Gatsby in a heartbreaking way. A gentle, warm and lonely man who is just looking for love and a second chance to a woman who has ever meant anything to him. It's a real sad character that Leo plays off beautifully with Carey"
"CinemaCocoa","8","1","2","12 July 2014"," Probably my FAVOURITE film from Luhrman
","With director Baz Luhrmann comes a great deal of flamboyance and embellishment, something I usually dislike with his work, but with The Great Gatsby not only does he have a requirement to mellow out, it actually benefits from his gaudy cinematography.<br/><br/>Unlike the 1974 version, the film is from Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire)'s perspective after the book's events as he speaks to a psychiatrist after his experiences. This feels inconsistent with the book as there was no real suggestion Carraway was so badly traumatised, and feels like an excuse to differentiate from the previous film. Like it or hate it, this does lift Carraway out of the rut of audience surrogate; I did feel as though I were watching a character and not a story device.<br/><br/>Admittedly all of the characters in Luhrmann's version feel more lively than in the Clayton film. Coupled with the cinematography the actors burst and beam with all the encouragement and shallowness that the book suggested. While Carey Mulligan's Daisy doesn't have the same clingy ignorance that Mia Farrow gave the character, the portrayal of both her husband Tom and Gatsby himself feel more genuine. A lot of the conflict is between these two characters, and Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio carry this off with great ferocity! A lot of time is given to Gatsby and his mystery. This is an improvement on the original film as we see a lot more of the gossip and chatter about him before we meet him (his reveal is also exact to the novel this time, very well underplayed) and there a lot more to understand about his recluse nature and about his need to put Daisy on the proverbial plinth and how shallow and misguided he really is. But, with all the time dedicated to this, some elements are missed out. Possibly the worst scene missing is Gatsby's discovery that Tom and Daisy were with child. Its omission (until an offhanded reference later) makes Gatsby seem more forgivable in his actions overall. This and the relationship between Tom and Wilson is lacking; indeed Wilson and Myrtle are pushed to one side, as secondary as they are, they are still critical to the conclusion to the main characters! Jay Gatsby ultimately comes out of this film lighter still than the 1974 film, despite Luhrmann's excellent attempt at showing every character's weakness.<br/><br/>Lurhmann's desire to have popular music mixed through the scores of his films feels even more out of place here. This is the 1920s, Baz, they didn't have beat boxing and rap or modern songs. It isn't overriding by any stretch, in fact for Luhrmann it is positively made as undertones, but simply removing it would have improved my immersion greatly! I can partly forgive this though, as Luhrmann's cinematography and lavish colour palette does give the story so much life and creativity to the proceedings.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the portrayal of the characters in this interpretation; they all have their moments to shine and to be dragged through the gutter, despite a couple of strange oversights. If you can see past Luhrmann's excess, you should find something here that even the 1974 version didn't cover."

"kira02bit","7","1","2","15 June 2014"," Visually stunning
","Full disclosure: I have never read the legendary novel The Great Gatsby. Although I did have a very good friend who got stuck taking a class where the instructor literally spent the entire semester having the class read and analyze this novel, so from her gripes I feel that I almost have read the book. Unfortunately, I have also watched the moribund 1970s film adaptation. So it was not without some hesitancy that I embarked to watch the latest film incarnation of this novel.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann actually remains faithful to the source as pretty much all of the key sequences known from the novel are present. The events are related through the eyes of young Nick Carraway, whose naivete is pretty much annihilated upon his arrival in 1920s New York. He witnesses the stormy faithless marriage of his cousin Daisy Buchanan to the loutish Tom Buchanan, whose only qualification in life seems to as an example of the idle rich. He first becomes curious about and then is invited into the world of the enigmatic and elusive millionaire next door, Jay Gatsby, which slowly leads to the inexorably tragic denouement.<br/><br/>First and foremost,the film is one of the most visually stunning I have ever seen. If nothing else worked, it is the kind of film where one can still just sit back and let the gorgeous imagery flow over them. I initially thought that Luhrmann's trademark over-emphatic visual approach would be all wrong for this project, but given the over-the-top lifestyles of the players involved, it actually fits perfectly. When Tom whisks a reluctant Nick to a secret apartment for a carousing party with Tom's mistress Myrtle, the visuals take on the quality of a fever dream. The fleeting meetings between Gatsby and Daisy in the garden accompanied by Lana Del Rey's evocatively sorrowful tune makes one think of things forever lost. Our first introduction to the legendary parties held by Gatsby is both overwhelming and yet oddly inviting, making us wish we could step through the screen and become one with the orgiastic celebrating. I have less of a problem with the setting inappropriate music than most people as I find it used fairly well to reflect the debaucheries of the characters on screen, although the most effective use of visuals and music occurs when Nick first meets Gatsby to the transcendent swells of Gershwin accompanied by fireworks and Leonardo DiCaprio never looking more dapper. The moment is almost camp in its adoration of its subject, but it works.<br/><br/>Whether it is Luhrmann's approach or the performances, this is also the first time that I actually felt some sympathy for the characters in this story. DiCaprio has rarely been better playing a nearly unplayable part. Gatsby must be charming, enigmatic, romantic, tragic and larger-than-life. The latter is a quality that most actors cannot master, but DiCaprio makes it seem effortless. Forget Wolf of Wall Street, this is the performance he should have been nominated for. Tobey Maguire is solid, if unspectacular, as Carraway, somewhat shackled by being shoe-horned into a passive observer role, although his outrage in the final moments is fairly palpable. Joel Edgerton captures the right amount of lizard and brute as Daisy's conniving husband. Isla Fisher and Elizabeth Debicki make strong impressions in supporting roles. The one performance on which I am torn is Carey Mulligan as Daisy. Like Gatsby, Daisy may well virtually be a near unplayable part. Whereas DiCaprio succeeds against the odds, I find Mulligan less successful. She makes a lovely entrance and initially captures Daisy's frail, passive nature with her husband. She also does fairly well when we get the back story on her relationship with Gatsby and reunites with him - their first meeting in Nick's cottage is quite expertly handled. There is also a pleasantly unreal quality to their romantic encounters. However, when Daisy starts to require more dramatic heft, particularly in the last third where she reveals her true selfish nature, Mulligan too often adopts the look of someone who just twisted her ankle and is unsuccessfully trying to hold in the pain. Mulligan, for better or worse, reminds one often of a young Mia Farrow here, who unsuccessfully essayed the role in the 1970s. I often found my eyes wandering more towards Debicki when she was on screen with Mulligan, because her character somehow seemed to be hiding more interesting secrets and emotions.<br/><br/>In the end, purists will probably complain about Luhrmann's approach, but the film is compulsively watchable and features some outstanding visual work and acting, and I think it comes closest to capturing the spirit of the story than any of the earlier screen incarnations have. I certainly would not recommend it to everyone, but I think there are a number of people who would find worthwhile."

We are slowly dragging in to those era with loneliness, desperation and sometimes with a depressive feeling.<br/><br/>The emphasis given by those soundtrack are fantastic.

","Well, first I dare to admit that I don't remember seeing such a great photography as I saw in this film. The scenario is magnificent, with beautiful colors and the highest definition I've ever seen on blu-ray. However, the movie as a whole isn't that ""great"". First off, Gatsy isn't an interesting character; there is nothing palpable in his personality. Also, we don't get to know much about him, or why he acts the way he does, delivering a vague main character. Maguire's character isn't anything to be remembered; he seems to be just a Gatsby wannabe, and I don't see a reason why-- and neither does he. The plot is very crazy and nonlinear, turning the story into pure fantasy without many reality. The soundtrack can be considered good. Also, the soundtrack is authentic; there are some weird covers of ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Back to Black"". Maybe just too much of Jay-Z. In the end, I couldn't say if this film was comedy, drama or romance; it has everything but, at the same time, it has nothing! However, I give it a 6 in respect of the wonderful scenario and the dynamic direction, which the lack of would turn this into a great deception!"

","The movie is never as good as the book. ""Remakes"" are always retrograde. Those movies with anachronistic soundtracks are more distracting than interesting for ""serious"" films. Baz Lurhmann has proved all these truisms (to which I had more or less subscribed) wrong with this film. It may be my love of the source material, or the fact that I rather like Jay-Z and Frank Church, even when they're scoring a screenplay that references the Jazz Age with every page. But the music respects the Jazz Age even if it is not particularly constrained by it, the same way Gatsby is not constrained by the social pecking order in which he was expected to live & love, even if the film-maker was not constrained by FSG-era interpretations and projections of the author's vision. <br/><br/>As a native East Coaster I find this film nostalgic. As an ex- Californian I find it bursting with optimism and energy. As a transplant to the Midwest I sympathize with nearly *all* the characters. This is a superlative adaptation for the screen of the Great American Novel of the 20th Century. I love it, and look forward to sharing it with others so that I may enjoy it over and over again."

","I have read the book 'The Great Gatsby' and thoroughly enjoyed it adding to my anticipation to this film. The majority of the performances in this film are really good especially Toby Maguire as Nick Carraway, Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan and especially the great Leonardo Di Caprio as Jay Gatsby. This character is one we are truly meant to root for and feel like we want him to succeed whereas Buchanan is meant to be a bad guy that we very much dislike against our favourite Gatsby. I also feel without Maguire's solid performance then this film would probably fall apart as he is an essential part of the film as well as Gatsby. However, I felt there was a few issues with this film such as some overacting and overdramatic performances especially from Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan who just felt like this overacted woman. But the main problem sometimes is the craziness of some of the set pieces of this film which sometimes takes away from the narrative of the film even though the party scenes were impressive and the best looking parts of the film. Also I guess knowing the ending of the film did hinder my experience even though it was done very well in my opinion. This film is a true representation of the novel and is great with its story but there is some problems with it and is not perfect but is still very good."
"Dan1863Sickles","7","1","2","29 December 2013"," So Much Better Than I Expected!
","I refused to see this movie when it came out, because I'm still having nightmares from seeing the Robert Redford version ""in my younger and more vulnerable years."" I also saw MOULIN ROUGE and I could imagine only too clearly what Baz Luhrmann was going to do -- two hours of kaleidoscopic madness in day-glo color.<br/><br/>Much to my surprise, this new version of THE GREAT GATSBY, while not great, is far from terrible. Oh, there were a few horrible slips that made me grind my teeth. Like when a cheerful flapper says ""Gatsby's cousin to the Kaiser -- you know, the evil German king."" Thanks for the history lesson, Hollywood! Or when Klipspringer is changed from a poor, hungry boarder who plays the piano to a glam-rock version of The Phantom Of The Opera. That was horrible! And it was exactly what I was expecting from Baz Luhrmann.<br/><br/>But there was so much that I didn't expect. I never thought Leonardo DiCaprio would nail Gatsby so completely. He didn't get stuck on the handsome war hero stuff, like Robert Redford. He went deeper. He got the nervousness, the restlessness, the sense that this guy knows he's a fake and is scrambling to keep up with a dream that's getting farther away from him by the second. I thought Carey Mulligan was wonderful as Daisy, too. Every time she seems too shallow and silly to be interesting there's this flash of terrible sadness in her beautiful brown eyes that shows us that this Daisy knows she can never have Gatsby. And that she doesn't deserve him. Oh, and when Daisy delivers her famous line about crying over Gatsby's shirts, Carey makes that work too. It's not her fault idiot-boy Baz has Nick rush in to explain that she's sad over ""five lost years."" Thanks for clearing that one up too, people! I also want to mention that Joel Edgerton was an amazing Tom Buchanan, if anything maybe a little too sympathetic and likable. The fact that he breaks Myrtle's nose is given much too little attention in this version. But Tom's racism is handled with grim frankness and is totally authentic. Newcomer Elizabeth Dabecki is perfect as Jordan Baker -- the moment when she tells Nick ""but it wasn't a coincidence at all,"" is really heartwarming and hopeful, just like in the novel. I wish we'd seen more of this Jordan. It's interesting that Baz changes the ending so that Nick ends up babbling in an asylum like a refugee from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, but he can't rustle up a happy ending for Nick and Jordan.<br/><br/>That would have offended me a lot less than having Nick explain what Daisy means by saying ""it makes me sad because I've never seen such beautiful shirts."" I got what she meant just fine.<br/><br/>Oh, and why does Klipspringer have to play Bach on the organ instead of ""Ain't We Got Fun"" on the piano? Because it's cooler? Please!"

Whilst Tobey Maguire was brilliant as Carraway, without any issues of reminding the audience of his Peter Parker role. The casting for the whole movie was indefectible. <br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is a must see film. The storyline is a world famous phenomenon.

"mail-261-516117","7","1","2","26 December 2013"," A somewhat peculiar adaptation...
","7 because both Toby Maguire and Joel Edgerton were very, very good in this...<br/><br/>Peculiar, because it completely moves away from the POV of the narrator in the novel; Nick Carraway. The novel has the narrator, although first person, telling the story in almost a third person POV; he is rarely seen in the story at all. He is the outsider looking in, and it is quite detached; it is this that makes it such an interesting and unusual novel.<br/><br/>Baz has chosen to do something quite different here, and unlike the novel, and the first cinematic version starring the great Robert Redford as Gatsby (I love DiCaprio... but not the same), Nick Carraway's character, the narrator, becomes much more centre stage. In fact, this seems to be a study in what the viewers/readers would see, if this character was much more visible, rather than narrating from the sidelines. <br/><br/>I thought that was an interesting perspective and idea, which worked well because Toby McGuire is so fine in the role... but it did focus on him so much, that it detracted from the original plot quite a bit. It stands alone as a good film, but loses some of the original depth, especially the enigma that is 'The Great Gatsby', because it's really Nick Carraway that takes the main role here... and there's no real reveal of Gatsby (and what is shown, seems rather trivialised). In the original (and the novel), a sense of pity, or at least empathy, is easily elicited for Gatsby – who is, in the end, a rather forlorn character... I didn't feel the same was induced at all in this production, and so it seems to have missed the point.<br/><br/>Unlike Moulin Rouge... I hated the music choices here; there are so many fine jazz choices that the decision to use rap, house, and other inapt music really, really jarred. It was a wasted opportunity to include some of Australia's finest musicians (Goytye, my friend, Wally, in the closing credits, the exception, of course!).<br/><br/>Overall enjoyed it, but far from a masterpiece..."

"kskirthana","8","1","2","27 November 2013"," Baz Luhrmann takes a tragically beautiful novel and adds visual drama. The result is delightful.
","Two years ago, I heard that Leonardo DiCaprio would be cast as Jay Gatsby in Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby', I rushed to the nearest bookstore and obsessively pored over the book several times. As a die hard fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, DiCaprio and Baz Luhrmann, you cannot imagine my excitement at the prospect of these three beautiful fellas coming together. However, I had my doubts. Fitzgerald's signature brooding style, which centered around the tragic hero, was in essence straightforward and without frills. This is what makes his work so special, so different from the dramatic 'Shakespearean' retelling of tragedy, which, to me, brings to mind Luhrmann's love for drama, both visual and in terms of storytelling. It was my hope that my dearest DiCaprio would be able to bring together both these sentiments. Early in 2013, when I watched the trailer, I have to say I was enormously disappointed. The Great Gatsby in 3-d!!! (I think I might have wept right after.) It just seemed to be so at odds with the original book. It seemed to have none of the ingenious subtlety of performance that I had come to expect, nor did I feel any of the authors' quiet desperation. Instead I was bombarded by kaleidoscopic, golden, flying images of revelry, their version of the roaring 20's. I immediately decided that watching this movie would only put me off, and so i didn't, until recently. I must admit that the horrible misleading trailer is my only major critique of the film. I was not disappointed, far from it. The film opens with Nick Carraway (Maguire) a young New Yorker narrating the traumatic events that have lead him to this juncture. Through his narration we are led through the wildly exciting streets of 1920's New York. The lavish lifestyles of the young and rich, the unimaginable extravagance and the futility of the prohibition. Arriving in the city to further his writing, he is swept away by the roaring lifestyle, and the booze fueled revelry, and here we are introduced to the mysterious Mr. Gatsby, an amazingly rich gentleman, who has very recently achieved notoriety in New York society as an affluent businessman, famous for his extreme extravagance. Nobody seems to know who he is or where he is from, consequently several conspiracies emerge. As the story unfolds we truly appreciate Luhrmann's cinematic skill. The lavish sets and incredible color palette compliment the silent drama of the actual storytelling, which remains appropriately understated. In this sense he deserves praise for staying true to the book, and yet managing to infuse the experience with his own signature style. DiCaprio is completely instrumental in bringing this production together and does a breathtaking job of portraying the love-stuck, desperately ambitious Jay Gatsby. He is full of silent hope and conviction, but at the same time is riddled with insecurities. Carey Mulligan plays the role of Daisy Buchanan beautifully. Her approach to the role is not what i would have expected, but is refreshingly unique. We love to hate Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, and he delivers another great performance. Isla Fischer is unexpectedly great in a challenging role, she has it down to a tee. To me, the only weak performance was Tobey Maguire. Although he plays the role of the Daisy's meek cousin, he is not as convincing as i would have liked. Although, I will say, he wins points for playing the part of the narrator beautifully. Luhrmann has once again done a wonderful job on the cinematography, although making it a 3-d movie was completely unwanted, and was too over-the-top. Watching the movie brought back fond memories of Moulin Rouge. Although they were each very different in terms themes and story lines, they both won me over with outrageously wonderful sets, which added to the urgency in the plot, and the heart breaking, beautifully captured romance. All in all, I would highly recommend a watch."

","THE GREAT GATSBY – 1974<br/><br/>To really understand this film, or the novel behind, you have to keep in mind the alternative story that D.H. Lawrence tells us in Women in Love. In the same way we are dealing with love in the upper class of the very rich before the First World War and then after before the big crisis of 1929. I will not compare the two here but the two films also came out in the same period, the early 1970s after the 1968 political and generational crisis. They both carry the denunciation of the upper class.<br/><br/>We are telling the story from an outside point of view but yet close to the protagonists. The story teller, Mr. Nick Carraway, is a neighbor of Mr. Jay Gatsby and a bond seller in Wall Street, New York. Nothing to do with present time golden boys, the traders in Brokerage firms. Well-off but definitely not rich and anyway with no rich parents. Yet he is the cousin of another woman who is from an extremely rich family, married to an extremely rich man. Gatsby is the black sheep in the neighborhood. <br/><br/>He is from an extremely poor family. He managed to get an Oxford education after 1918 because he became an officer and was heavily decorated during the war and he then took advantage of veterans' privileges. He had also the chance to fall in the hands of a certain Meyer Wolfsheim who introduced him to business, though we are never told what that business really is. We can imagine, due to the speed with which he became rich (less than eight years) that it had to be in some financial speculation in the 1920s. That period is clearly identified with the paraphernalia of the time and with the music, including the dancing, including the famous song Charleston. Note that Jay might not be a real first name, but an initial and that the name Gatsby is not the real name of the man who was the son of a certain Mr. Gatz we see at the end. Note too that the name Wolfsheim is of course meaningful and the main principle of this man is ""we can be a friend of a man when he is alive, but not when he is dead.""<br/><br/>At the end of WWI, Jay Gatsby, alias Major Gatz, fell in love with Daisy, a rich girl. But he was a poor man. She fell in love with him on a short-lived whim and he fell in love with her forever. But a rich girl does not marry a poor boy, as she says so well. So he disappears to build a fortune and she got married to a rich boy and became Mrs. Daisy Buchanan. She had promised to wait but rich girls never wait. <br/><br/>When he is finally rich he manages to get close to her and then to be introduced to her by her cousin, Nick Carraway, and before he had tried to attract her attention by having enormous garden parties every week end in that summer of 1926 or 1927. She eventually falls in the trap.<br/><br/>The rest is to be discovered in the film, or the book.<br/><br/>The morality, bad word, the immorality of this film is that in spite of the American Dream, rich people attract and mix with rich people and poor people can only eventually be accepted when they are rich. The second lesson is that rich people with a rich pedigree can always manage to get through any crime or accident or whatever particularly by pointing at another of their class but that does not have the rich pedigree they have. This immorality can even be worse: rich men can have as many poor mistresses they will furnish with some luxury as much, and as many, as they want or can afford. But a rich woman is not supposed to have any affair with a rich man of any sort, and she will not condescend to have an affair with a poor man. It would not be in anyway anything but a short and exciting sexual episode that would be doomed even before it starts, and like the praying mantis she would destroy the poor lover after using it.<br/><br/>In other words a woman is the property of her husband but in no way the husband is the property of his wife, and social inequality is absolute in the USA, just like in Great Britain, in the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before. Nothing has changed.<br/><br/>[...]<br/><br/>This older film shows these elements with great care but at the same time it is obvious Jay Gatsby is not natural as a rich man. He is not able to play the game properly: he is awkward, he is shy, he is inconsiderate in his presents and in his lavish help he may give to someone who is trying to make him realize one of his intentions or desires. One hundred white roses are not even enough in such a situation and he very well may send one thousand. The dialogue is good too in the fact that Jay Gatsby is the only one who has a linguistic idiosyncratic tick and he calls every man ""old sport"" and such an Oxfordian tic shows in him a rather recent integration in the class of the super rich: he cuts a role, a character, a behavior and sticks to it: he believes in a way the tuxedo makes the money aristocrat. And he is wrong: the money aristocrat is in the careless and nonchalant way he wears the tuxedo and that cannot be imitated. <br/><br/>All together a beautiful but cruel film on the egocentric selfishness of the super rich born super rich.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","The party only really ends when the woman of your dreams becomes your reality. ""The Great Gatsby"" centers on the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and illustrious man who throws extravagant parties and who has a sort of mystique set to his name - nobody really knowing his past nor where his fame and wealth truly came from. It is the mysterious past of Jay Gatsby that drives the film forward and what keeps the audience in dazed wonderment as the story unfolds. <br/><br/>In Fitzgerald's own words from the novel, ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" The film ""The Great Gatsby"" has been one of many representations of the novel, each one having different feels and imagery, but in my humble opinion this has been the best. The depiction of society gave me the impression of an exciting lifestyle marked by a rapidly growing market and degradation through cheap alcohol. Society, at the time, couldn't have seemed more alive and booming. It is through this period that the story of the great Gatsby is revealed.<br/><br/>The novel, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was written in the year 1925 and soon became a legacy, an inspiration, a novel of great value. It centers on idealism, resistance to change, change being an enemy unto mankind, as well as the American dream that ""we can have it all."" It paints a vivid picture of the 'roaring 20s' and the beautiful jazz age in the great Big Apple. This picturesque period is the subject of many novels and films, having no shortage of unique stories and myths.<br/><br/>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Joel Edgerton, and the beautiful Carey Mulligan, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a colorful and intriguing take on the novel. The film was directed by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia), who is well known for his use of bright colors and fast-paced editing. He created a visual symphony to represent this thrilling story of love and riches, but, unfortunately, Luhrmann's distinctive taste has made the film subject to some negative reviews as well as low numbers in theaters. <br/><br/>But can I say the same as those film critics who claim that the film is too flashy or too contemporary for a fictional story based in the 1920s? No. To me, the story was told as it should have been told to audiences of today. The actors generated personalities similar to that which is found in the novel, the story was gripping and told by the character named Nick Carraway as it is also done in the novel, and the imagery and symbolism was portrayed just as it was to be imagined. A novel of such caliber deserves to be visually told excitedly and thoroughly and should not suffer from lack of imagination."

All actors are amazing, Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan are perfect choice for the role of Nick Carraway and Daisy Buchanan also other stars, but i have to point out Leonardo Dicaprio. He plays Gatsby so well one of the hardest Character i was impressed. The emotion that comes from him shows how really great actor he is and how can he fit in any kind of character. It's sad that he did not have the Oscar. It will be awesome to see him on the stage for the next Oscar Nomination as the best man actor from the The Great Gatsby.

","The following is unlike my usual reviews for IMDb and other Internet movie sites, but the comments that I emailed to a friend right after watching Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"":<br/><br/>""Dear M-----,""<br/><br/>I just got back from watching ""The Great Gatsby"" tonight. The excessive, exhibitionist style tendencies of director Baz Luhrmann that I had feared were plainly evident. Surfeit of everything: flowers, decor, set details, but fortunately often gorgeous. Rap hip-hop party music in the 1920s? Please, that's the sound of today's disco clubs, exactly.<br/><br/>But Luhrman's deep respect for a dead man more than saved him and made the movie one of the best I've seen in the past two years. That man is of course F. Scott Fitzgerald. So respectful that the literary great's texts at times float dreamily on the screen.<br/><br/>Luhrmann co-wrote the screenplay, which delivered the spirit of the novel despite the over-the-top production. The ""be impressed!"" sets and overall design, and the re-imagining of New York in the 1920s were certainly impressive and sure credentials for Oscars.<br/><br/>The Aussie director's another weakness: the actors. Nobody connects emotionally to anybody in this movie, except perhaps Tobey Macguire as narrator Nick Carraway, who sensitively connects to us. It was painful to watch fidgety Leonardo di Caprio in the first half needing the right cues and clues for acting. And whoever tailored his unflattering suits should be sent to .....<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan's assumed persona is too strong for the part. Wanted: another Mia Farrow out-daisying the delicate Daisy Buchanan. (Did you notice that Mulligan does a dual role as one of the whorehouse girls?)<br/><br/>Cesar"""

","Coming into this movie, my impression of DiCaprio's acting ability was trending toward dislike and negativity. His over ambition with his attempt at J. Edgar irked me, so I was excited to see him playing a role as the young Gatsby.<br/><br/>And he did not disappoint.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has a gift when assuming roles that closely match his natural age. The Great Gatsby showcased some of DiCaprio's best skills with his ability to keep the audience glued to the screen despite the high level of conversation and speech. <br/><br/>Having never read the novel, the movie was my introduction to anything Gatsby, and i felt the story did the hype justice, and explained in detail who what where when and why this mysterious lad was indeed GREAT.<br/><br/>The movie is an overarching love story between a young lad ever so hopeful and filled with spirit and life striving for greatness and a madam who married into richness rather than waiting for the young man to prove himself worthy. <br/><br/>Five years pass since the last they spoke, and Gatsby has ventured into war and stumbled into apprenticeship for a millionaire. His acquired knowledge would pave the way for opportunity to build his own millions and amass the power and wealth he had always dreamed of. <br/><br/>His life remained incomplete, having fallen in love years earlier; gatsby thus befriends a cousin of his former love and mingles his way into a rendezvous with his Daisy. <br/><br/>The uniqueness of this movie integrates early 20th century imagery and flamboyance with modern day hip hop as the story unfolds into several love triangles and the decisions that ultimately must be made. Events unfold and the narration by Spider-Man continue to the very end. <br/><br/>Gatsby is initially portrayed as a mysterious yet unique individual, throwing vast parties and engendering various rumors about himself. The movie drips additional information about the character very slowly, and by midway, the attractive mysterious element has faded. Towards the end, the human imperfection nearly obscures the greatness of gatsby, before it is once again polished through a total confession to spider-man. The picture delves very deeply into character development, and takes up the majority of the 2 hour movie.<br/><br/>In short, this is a picture about a lover who returns after 5 years to find his lover married, and tries to woo her into joining his egotistical fantasy. Things pretty much go horribly wrong for the great Gatsby, and by end only has spiderman attending his funeral. For this story to have taken over 2 hours to tell is inexcusable, but there is a reason The Great Gatsby exists acknowledgably in the public consciousness, and therefore is justified in its grandiose tale. <br/><br/>The love story falls short of Titanic or the Notebook, but the imagery and uniqueness offset any negatives to solidify an 8 / 10."
"tapio_hietamaki","8","1","2","16 June 2013"," Not perfectly true to the novel and not a perfect film
","The most prominent feature in this adaptation is its flamboyant style, which throws all caution to the wind and mixes 20's-jazz-aesthetics with modern pop music. The parties, with their expensive fireworks, performers and all-around over-the-top recklessness, would drive the Queen of England to a quick bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is an OK Gatsby. It's a difficult role to play well but I think, ultimately, that he succeeds. I have my own views about the character of Daisy that don't always go hand in hand with Carey Mulligan's version, but mostly she does a marvelous job. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan steals the show, especially in the climactic hotel room scene near the end. You really understand these characters and, sometimes, relate.<br/><br/>The effect with the green light seen across the bay looks cool but is milked way too much, I got bored of it halfway through, it should've been used sparingly. The framing device with Nick Carraway in a mental institution is completely unnecessary, and I wish Luhrmann would've spared us the typewriter text filling the screen as Tobey Maguire quoted Fitzgerald's lines, like in some emo music video."
"helena-debnam","9","1","2","12 June 2013"," Great Gatsby Review
","I think that Baz Lurhmann's The Great Gatsby is getting mixed thoughts because as Baz himself said in an interview ""everyone has their own version of The Great Gatsby"" which is probably why people love it or hate it. I am currently reading the book and I think the critics and the people who don't like movie are people with a different vision of how The Great Gatsby is than Baz sees it. I think that Baz wanted to show the film as a tragic love and he then surrounds it in his vision of the roaring twenties or the jazz age ( I personally like the roaring twenties ). But really the novel is showing how the 20s corrupted the American dream, also the change in lifestyle during the twenties because the economy was better and the war had ended. Really the novel The Great Gatsby was more than just parties and a love story, but Baz wanted to capture the crazy parties and the eccentric lifestyle people had then with the parties and such. That is how Baz saw the story and it is not wrong it is what he saw. He also didn't really show how the old money did not approve of the new money with the whole west and east egg situation. <br/><br/>As I see it Baz wanted to tell a story that would please audiences not make them think of the deeper meaning which is okay I mean it was advertised as one of the first big summer blockbusters with good new music and amazing visuals. Really the visuals are great but nothing to waste money on the 3D version of the movie. I am assuming that the critics wanted a movie that would show us the deeper meaning of Gatsby but they got a summer blockbuster that they were not expecting so they judged it harshly which in my opinion is unfair. I mean it's a Baz Lurhmann movie he is known for cool visuals and outrageous costumes I assume critics would remember from Moulin Rouge ( it was better than Gatsby ). <br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed in how Baz showed the 1920s I mean I watch his movies that take us back in time in history I don't feel as if I have gone back in time but gone to Baz's alternate universe, a mix of history and modern day which is cool but not for movie like Gatsby where it is centred in the real past 1920s not some mix of the future and the past. I felt the same way when watching Moulin Rouge but less so because in Gatsby the 20s is such a pivotal point to get right. <br/><br/>Overall if you want to go to Gatsby to see an interesting romantic, fun love story then you're going to get what you want but if you want to see a fantastic remake of a classic novel that is intelligent and shows the life of a person in the 1920s maybe you will not totally get what you want. I think Gatsby deserves a pat on the back for making an enjoyable love story of a novel. Do I see any awards for the movie, not the music..... Well no but it is still a great movie I definitely say it is a must see even if you're just going to see it so you don't have to read the book for class."
"fabriziodoninelli","10","1","2","11 June 2013"," Critique about ""The Great Gatsby""
","The Great Gatsby<br/><br/>This outstanding film by Baz Luhrman, is an adaptation from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. In this film, a man named Nick Carraway, played by Tobey McGuire, moves to New York during the early 1920's to start a new life working in wall street. And he tells the story, as he narrates it to what seems to be his psychiatrist. He starts off by telling when he first moved to New York and rented a small house big mansions in a town where many rich people lived. Jay Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) is his neighbor and he consistently catches him looking at him from his window until one day he receives an invitation to go to his home. When he gets there, he sees thousands of people in there and he realizes that he was the only guest who received an invitation and he learns that nobody really knows who Gatsby is or if he even exists. He ends up meeting Jay Gatsby and they become ""friends"" with a particular interest from Gatsby. This interest is a favor that Gatsby wants Nick to do for him, Nick agrees and he sets Gatsby on a path that would eventually gets him innocently killed, to save the love of his life.<br/><br/>This movie, is directed and produced by Baz Luhrman and as I mentioned earlier, it is an adaptation from F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous novel ""The Great Gatsby"". This movie features stars Leonardo Di Caprio playing the role of Jay Gatsby, Tobey McGuire as Nick Carraway, Jason Clarke as George Wilson, and Elizabeth Debicky as Jordan Baker. The budget for this movie was $110 million, and this film was mainly filmed in Sidney, Australia. ""The Great Gatsby'' fits into the Drama and Romance genre, for its plot and its characters' motivation.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""The Great Gatsby"" has some of the best acting done by its actors and it is a very catching film that makes you feel like you are in the 1920's and it makes you enjoy every bit of it. The film's main characters are played by outstanding famous actors, such as Leonardo Di Caprio, and this makes everything in the movie seem more realistic, which makes viewers feel like they are witnessing something real and it makes them believe the scenarios and situations that take place throughout the film. My favorite part of this film was the ending, which was quite an unexpected ending for someone like me, who had not read the novel. The ending of the movie is also very ironic because of reasons I will not tell because it may ruin the film for those who have no yet watched it, but this irony leaves viewers impressed because of the reasons behind the actions with which the film ends and because it is also very unexpected and it is very contradictory to what any viewer would expect to happen, which would have been very cliché.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend watching this film to almost anyone that has a good two hours and twenty-two minutes, because it is one of the best films that have been produced lately, not only because of its amazing quality of production but because of its intriguing plot. The film's main conflict is that Jay Gatsby wants to get back with the love of his life, the only problem is that she is now married, this motivates Gatsby to become friends with Nick to ask him to reunite them in a way that Gatsby considers to be casual. Nick is motivated to do as Gatsby asks him because of his friendship with him and because he realizes that even though she is a married woman, she used to love him and he truly loves her so much, he would be capable of sacrificing his own life, reputation and integrity for her's. This is an excellent example of an inter textual motivation due to the fact that it alludes to the novel ""The Great Gatsby"". This film is of great social importance, because it accurately depicts the United States during the roaring 20's right before its decline with the Great Depression and World War II. This movie is also of great entertainment value because, despite the fact that it is a quite long movie, it never gets boring or predictable, which keeps viewers interested in it throughout the entire movie and leaves them impressed with its unexpected, ironic and quite sad ending, as I said before.<br/><br/>There have been few movies longer than two hours that I have actually enjoyed and been interested in it entirely, because I tend to get bored after a good 120 minutes of watching someone struggling to solve their problems or to get what they want, and this is something that only makes me realize how good this film actually is, by keeping me curious, thoughtful, and worried for more than two hours, and this is why I recommend watching this film and enjoying a great plot, acting and production. However, despite the fact that I consider that this is probably one of my favorite movies, in my opinion it is not a film to be watched twice because if you know how the film is going to end, everything will seem stupid and the magnificent end to this movie would not be fully appreciated to to the fact that is not a mystery, which would keep the viewers engaged.<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" is one of the best movies that I have watched recently and this is because of its engaging plot and conflict, it unexpected and ironic ending, and its superior acting and production, and I would recommend anyone to watch this movie as you wont regret it, and it will probably leave you thinking about it and reflecting or maybe even feeling empathy for a few days after watching it, definitely a film to watch before dying."
"alexsnet97","8","1","2","11 June 2013"," Make it through the first 30 minutes and then enjoy a great film
","I read The Great Gatsby and could not wait for this film to come out. I went and saw it last night and, I must say, I really enjoyed it. However, the first thirty minutes were almost unwatchable. The parties were ridiculous with the modern music (I enjoyed the music later on in the film), and I almost walked out of the theater. I decided to stay, hoping it would get better, and I'm glad I did, because it truly was a good film and I liked it a lot by the end. Now that I can reflect on the beginning, I think that the director possibly wanted the start of the film to be ridiculous and obnoxious to show how crazy and vulgar the roaring twenties were... Stay through the beginning, and you will be glad you did. The acting gets better and more intense, the storyline comes more into play, and it's a really good watch. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as always, and Tobey Maguire is great in his role (once you come to accept his droning narrative). It's a great movie and I recommend it! Force yourself to sit through the awful beginning and you won't regret it because the film gets a lot better!"
"mrfish5000","6","1","2","10 June 2013"," Baz Luhrman's style restrains the true drama and meaning
","The Goods The visuals were nice, the party being a highlight of course. The wonderful Carey Mulligan was superb at the best of times, the highlight for me being her garden. Some of the music touched on parallels between modern day and the past, and worked on occasion.<br/><br/>The Bad The obscure vision kept an uncomfortable distance between the audience and the true potential of the film, grinding down to a shallow 'Virginia Woolf' style train-wreck, which has it's merits, but pales in contrast to the true point of the story. For me, what the film should have been trying to do was put more emphasis on 'decent men in an indecent time' and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Nick Carroway's perspective carried little weight from the opening scene, being almost nothing more than an empty spectator/ a device of storytelling. And the distance between the characters and any real definition created a domino effect, making attempts at intimacy bizarre, and every 'old sport' pathetic. From the point of Tom Buchanan's house, things were clearly not going to change - making a large novelty-esque sketch of life in that period, rather than approaching the characters in a noire gritty style, with Gatsby's fascade as the relief.<br/><br/>The musical ideas brought some interest, but were ultimately poorly conceived, and simply added to the chaos. Luhrman's Moulin Rouge was evidently perfect for his style, but trying to apply the same 'lense' to a dramatic piece like this simply distorts what could have been a much better connection to the true themes of the original story. Reading the book will give you a much more refined sense of the personalities which were to a large degree lost and jaded in the film."
"st_lizzie","9","1","2","10 June 2013"," I wanted to get up and slap Baz Luhrmann on the back.
","For giving us an almost perfect adaptation of The Great Gatsby while being a very fine film on its own, and yet people still complain and the critics keep being too hard on him.<br/><br/>For those who say Luhrmann's Gatsby is ""style over substance"", did we even watch the same movie? Luhrmann certainly has matured since his Romeo+Juliet days. This is something else. Somehow the music works really well. I have never seen music being used this effectively in a movie before, it really sets the mood and it actually helps the storytelling. I'm ready to call Baz a genius for the choice of music alone. The camera work is stunning. The visual is, no question, beautiful and breathtaking and everything. But most importantly, the script is neat. The pacing is tight. I personally love the decision to put Nick in a sanitarium and make him tell the story from there. You see, it's not easy to translate the book The Great Gatsby into a movie. Just look at how disappointing the previous attempts had been. When it's trying to be faithful following the structure of the book, it came out dull and boring (the 1974 version and the 2000 TV movie version belong to this category). And when it succeeded to be somewhat entertaining, it had to transform itself into a gangster film and basically alter almost everything that's in the book (the 1949 version).<br/><br/>I saw The Great Gatsby because I was anticipating Tobey Maguire's big come back to the big screen (beside the fact that I love the book) but ended up giving all the credit to Baz Luhrmann. You must know, I can't stand any Luhrmann's work before. So when the light was dimmed and the Warner Bros logo appeared on screen I fully realized I was in for something different. This time, though, it is different in a very good way. It is one of those rare movies that have the charm and grandness that you have never found in any other movies and which it is not likely you will ever find again. Kinda like Gatsby himself.<br/><br/>Well done, Baz."

","Firstly I'll say I'm reviewing the movie alone and I will not contrast with the great novel since I have not read it.<br/><br/>So what was I expecting from the movie? I had no idea, no background knowledge of the book or its storyline. The trailer did not give anything really, nothing was clear cut.<br/><br/>So when I went to this fairly long movie I was waiting for something special because of all the hype.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me say, Leonardo Di Caprio has stamped his name in history for being one of the best actors ever. He literally made this movie, made it memorable and was one of the finest acting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The storyline is grim in many ways (especially the ending), almost depressing, but it has themes that are so strong that makes you think long after you have watched the movie.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby's usage of CGI is excessive, but its one of those rare occasions of the more the merrier, it is beautiful and breathtaking. The actors all portray their roles excellent and fitting, except two. Daisy and Nick weren't exactly up there with Leonardo or Gatsby in this case, he belittled them just from his talent of acting.<br/><br/>The Usage of new era music was fantastic and fitted almost perfectly. The Director simply wanted to give his audience what it felt like back in the 20's, back then or the ""Jazz era"", the music was different and new. Thus the input of the new generations of songs fit in amazing, especially at the parties.<br/><br/>There are some faults however, mainly some small plot issues, which I cannot complain about since the movie is based off a novel.<br/><br/>I haven't explained ANYTHING about the movie, but I really don't want too, if your reading this, go to the movies (if you want to appreciate class A acting, amazing script and a beautiful twisted love story that's all tied in with strong themes) and enjoy it.

","It's hard to give a numerical rating to this film, because Fitzgerald deserves a 10 and everything else about the film is almost irrelevant. The screenplay preserves much of the dialogue. I haven't read the book in decades, but I did read it twice, and it all came back to me while watching this film.<br/><br/>The movie is not ""over-the-top"" as some have claimed. The party scenes are extravagant, but they provide an effective contrast to the later scenes that are dark and scathing in their social criticism. The costumes were meticulous, beautiful and seemed period-authentic. I didn't like the hip-hop songs, but they were brief. Most of the music is supplied by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.<br/><br/>I have two complaints about the film: The painted backgrounds are a bit too obvious (as they are in most movies) and the acting was a bit of a letdown. DiCaprio is brilliant in some scenes and seems a bit confused in others. Maguire overdoes his facial expressions. Mulligan is convincing in her sad scenes, but it's hard to believe her as a woman who inspires desperate love. I couldn't understand why the Jewish gangster is portrayed by someone South Asian. In the end though, I didn't care about these quibbles."

","I had heard quite a few bad opinions of The Great Gatsby, and also a lesser number of good impressions, so I wasn't sure what to expect from it. For me, Baz Luhrmann has been mildly hit and miss, though mostly when it comes to his films I find that they're hits, for me personally. I do know that I can generally expect some wackiness from him, and Gatbsy didn't surprise me in that regard. But I'm pleased to say that all in all I did enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I thought it was beautiful visually, and compelling in terms of storyline. I can't say that I adored the soundtrack, unlike some of other films of Luhrmann's, but I didn't hate it or think it ruined the movie either, as some other people seem to feel.<br/><br/>I love Leo and thought he was great in his role. It was a little strange seeing Tobey Maguire trying to be a ""wizened, washed out drunk"", but I still enjoy his acting and thought he was good in this. I love the world that he ventured into but found it pretty sad how things wound up - I could really feel the ""haunted"" vibe that he was talking about by the end, and felt the same way myself, as if I was actually there experiencing it.<br/><br/>All in all I think it was a great cast and well-executed. I wouldn't say it's one of my favourite movies of all time, though."

","I just saw The Great Gatsby, and enjoyed it, though it went on a bit longer than I might have liked. Go anyway, regardless of what you might have heard both to be exposed to one of the great novels of American literature, and to see it on a large screen. The book's reputation matters, and size matters.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann has finally learned how to incorporate his style of music into his movies, and while the score may not have been '20s authentic, it fits. No one today would get the same feelings from the music of that era that music of our own can conjure.<br/><br/>Another point to keep in mind is that while the morals of Fitzgerald's era were evolving (one of the points of the book), they are by no means up to today's standards. Both racial and sexual equality were distant dreams in the '20s, keep that in mind while you watch.<br/><br/>There are so many trashy movies that are just an excuse to display violent special effects, it is a pleasure to see a film in which they are driven by a plot. Enjoy!"
"smartjosf-george","8","1","2","27 May 2013"," Unexpected
","I just want to make it short and all I think is that the movie was totally unexpected. I knew it was a little romantic movie but it turned out not to be a little romantic but very romantic movie. I as a person is not much of a fan of romance, so it hit me quite a bit to see something unwanted and unexpected. The best part that I personally liked was the integration of all the rap music with the 20th century environment, it really worked. Through out the movie I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and I really thought that there was something more coming later, but unfortunately it didn't happen. The role of Leo was a little out of the place, he really does not suit this kind of roles. He is better off with some kind of con roles or some secret agent kind of roles. The best performance I think was given by Tobey, he really had the control over his character. Overall the movie was good but looking at all the commotion it created among the people, it wasn't worth it. so if you are a romance lover you will surely love this movie. thanks for reading"

Tobey Macguire delivers what is one of his best performances and Leo as usual ends up dead and does not get the girl.I guess he was just asked to put on a bunch of clothes and look good and apart from that for Leo it must have been just another day at the office. Amitabh Bachchan has a small and handy role.The visual effects are stunning. Sets,Props,cinematography,costumes and the whole lot is beautiful. Simply put Baz Luhrmann's Epic masterpiece yet!!!"
"Laakbaar","9","1","2","26 May 2013"," Beautiful recreation of an American classic
","This is a beautifully shot film from beginning to end.<br/><br/>The music (mostly modern) and party scenes were both excellent. The movie brings New York City of the 1920s to life. It is worth seeing for this aspect alone.<br/><br/>It was a pleasure to experience this retelling of the story. I have to admit that it's been over three decades since I read the book, so I enjoyed becoming reacquainted with it.<br/><br/>I'm hardly in a position to assess whether the movie agrees with the book in every detail. I don't think it matters. However, the movie does seem true to the spirit of the book.<br/><br/>I liked the way the filmmakers honoured FSF's beautiful and profound prose. They didn't have to do that, and they don't do it with most movies based on great fiction. I thought this aspect was integrated beautifully into the film.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is excellent, especially Di Caprio's Gatsby. This man has developed into a great actor and a fine movie star. It's to his credit that he can carry a movie like this. (Indeed, who else could have played Gatsby?) <br/><br/>The relationship dynamics between Gatsby, Daisy, Tom and Nick (as shown in the movie) worked completely for me. Nick's fascination, Tom's arrogance, hypocrisy and repulsiveness, Daisy's confusion and turmoil, and of course Gatsby's lovesick despair. The performers delivered all of it.<br/><br/>On the downside, I wasn't particularly moved by the movie -- and I am easily moved. (One exception was the electrifying scene where Gatsby meets Daisy again.) Some iffy aspects of the movie's plot, character development and dialogue are actually more attributable to the original book than anything else. If anything Luhrmann may have stayed too close to the original novel.<br/><br/>A few aspects are stylized (i.e. not quite realistically portrayed), but this did not ruin the movie for me.<br/><br/>In making this fine movie, Luhrmann et al. have done justice to FSF's American classic.<br/><br/>I hasten to add that you will enjoy the film even if you haven't read the book, and even if the thought of going to a film based on a work of literature seems boring to you. It isn't a boring movie at all."

","The Great Gatsby is a mind-blowing movie with all its glamour, its visual effects, and some great soundtracks. What I liked about the Great Gatsby is the fact that the whole movie has been narrated out as though one were reading the book. The narrator uses such vivid descriptions to describe something as trivial as a sunrise. It is as though someone were reading the book but the magic here is that the vivid narration is coupled with the most extraordinary visual affects thereby beautifully creating a master piece that can be appreciated by all. <br/><br/>The movie is set in the 1920's in New York. This adds to the whole beauty of the movie. New York has been very well portrayed. The direction of this movie deserve an A+, there is so much to be portrayed so much to show and the director does it all without you realizing that he has shown you almost each and every aspect of that time (1920).<br/><br/>This movie has a very touching theme of Romance, a must see for all romantics. If not for the Romance and drama leonardo Dicaprio's acting as Gatsby should be able to compel people to watch this movie. He has very well portrayed the character of a rich man living lavishly with all the comforts anyone could dream of but at the same time of a modest and charming man.<br/><br/>Over all this is how I would rate the movie:<br/><br/>Theme- 8/10 (though a clichéd theme-romance, its not just any ordinary romantic movie) Direction-9/10 Visual effects-9/10 Soundtracks-8/10 Acting-9/10 The End of the movie-9/10(to me the end of a movie has a big impact on the impression it makes on me)<br/><br/>Over all- 8.7/10 ☺ Have a good day!"

","As Leo fan, who believes currently Hollywood are left with him and Ryan Gosling as two giant romantic heroes, I found Great Gatsby the best love story ever told after Romeo & Juliet. Hardcore fan of the book might disagree but it was how the movie's approach comes down to, the come back of Gatsby for the woman he loves and his emotional ride through out the course of events to win her back.<br/><br/>First of all, Leo together with main cast offered their superb performance. Even ""superb"" seems like an understatement as Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton pulled their career best acting indeed. Leo, despite the mark of time, turn maturity into one of his strengths, on top of sweet smile, haunting blue eyes and irresistible charms. His performance reminds me of himself in a series of previous titles like Titanic's poor Jack, Romeo& Juliet's madly in love Romeo and mostly Catch me if you can's Frank the world class con artist. In short, Leo managed to pull off a powerful combination of the all three characters with maturity and intensity The other amazing thing about the story was how it make you feel towards the other character in the love triangle. I myself walk away feeling for both Tom & Daisy and understand how things end the way it ended. Having said that i believe Joel Edgerton (Tom) was incredible in delivering a alpha male character throughout especially in challenging situations like the head-to-head sequence with Gatsby or the way he deals with his mistress being exposed. Also, Daisy by Carey was so lovely innocent and fragile that when she made the choice, whatever it is, you feel for her If there's anything that might have pulled the movie back was the camera movement and some of the soundtrack. The opening was a bit too fast with frequent flying camera angles that make me feel very sick. I understand the idea could be showing audience the size and awesomeness of the environment where the film is set, but it was really overused. Then the music was not felt 1920s. We can easily recognize hip hop, disco beats all over the place, which kind of feel off and disconnect viewer with the story. However, Lana De Rey's Young & Beautiful is out of this world wonderful. It reaches out to the story and heighten every sense of connection we have with Jay & Daisy All in all, Great Gatsby is a beautifully made drama, with astounding performances and glamorous design. It brought me the feeling of watching Romeo & Juliet in the set of Moulin Rouge"

","True to Fitzgerald, and I think one of DiCaprio's best performances, this luscious, lavish production of The Great Gatsby is by far better than others and a must see. Not only great entertainment and acting, it is an in depth exploration of the man Gatsby as we get to know him as never before in breadth and depth, what really made him tick. The complex interplay of relationships and desires of the four characters are depicted through the eyes of Nick, who is writing about this in hindsight, and works as a vehicle for telling the story of Gatsby, with whom he has a fascination. My one complaint is in the music chosen at times that brings in contemporary rhythms in a period piece which is out of character to me. It's minimal, but jarring. Overall this is worth the price of admission."

","I believed in this movie from the very first moment I saw the trailer and was, therefore, very surprised to see all the negative reviews it received upon its release. Today that I have seen it, I believe that all the points people have been criticizing all this time, are actually the strong points of the movie.<br/><br/>It is obvious that it is a super- production with much emphasis on the audiovisual extravaganza and many externalities. But that is not a bad thing. The movie exposes different elements than the novel, while all the while staying fairly true to its source material, highlighting Fitzgerald's' subtle writing style and presenting the ""madness"" of the Jazz Age. As for the music, it seems strange indeed to listen to Jay-Z in a period film, but here, the way Baz Luhrmann incorporates it, it actually works, or it worked for me at least! <br/><br/>As it has been pointed out in other reviews here, the direction is great, the cinematography flawless and the actors all do a splendid job in bringing the characters to life. Especially Leonardo Di Caprio, who proves once more he is a quality actor and deserves recognition. (The Oscars committee seems very reluctant when it comes to all things Baz Luhrmann, as they proved in Moulin Rouge, but I do hope Di Caprio receives a nomination).<br/><br/>All in all I believe that this is a masterfully filmed movie, magical in its presentation and thoroughly entertaining if one approaches it in its entity. Anyhow, I think Baz Luhrmann deserves to be applauded for taking on such a challenging mission as transferring Fitzgerald on screen. He does what he likes, what he knows best, and he does it WELL!!"

From the production design, the costumes, sets, photography, music, etc. it's all top-class. One senses this is a movie that was years in the planning and the special effects are stunning--especially the director's trademark ""look"" of the camera racing from one point to a dizzying distance away. I go to movies to be entertained and hopefully emotionally touched when the movie calls for it.

","First off, I haven't read the book. The movie started off horribly. Very boring, melodramatic and hollow. Even the acting didn't feel up to the mark. There was a demand to emotionally connect without any basis to establish that connection. It wasn't a total nightmare thanks to the good visuals and a better than average 3-D but it was pretty dull.<br/><br/>Something changed halfway through, everything became a notch better, the plot quickened, acting suddenly seemed not melodramatic but skillful and due to the droll first half there was now enough substance to immerse oneself into the story.<br/><br/>On the whole its an over the top romantic drama, with a not so happy but entirely predictable ending but a strong performance by DiCaprio and Maguire.

"Hellmant","9","1","2","23 May 2013"," 'GATSBY' good but not great!
","'THE GREAT GATSBY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Director Baz Luhrmann's lavish adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel about a bond salesman who finds himself captivated by the life of his millionaire neighbor during the 'Roaring Twenties'. Leonardo DiCaprio (who also starred in Luhrmann's 'ROMEO + JULIET') and Tobey Maguire star in the film and it's their first time appearing in a movie together since 2001's 'DON'S PLUM' (despite being longtime friends since childhood). Carey Mulligan also stars in the movie as the millionaire's love interest, caught in a love triangle with another millionaire (played by Joel Edgerton). The film is a visually breathtaking epic period piece (like all of Luhrmann's films). It's also a tragedy (like most of Luhrmann's films as well). I enjoyed almost every aspect of the film except it's conclusion (having never read the book or known the story), which is just too dark and depressing for me.<br/><br/>Maguire plays Nick Carraway, an alcoholic (as the film opens) telling a man in a sanatorium his story about his times with a millionaire named Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio). Nick met Gatsby when he moved into a house next door to his mansion in New York in 1922. A Yale University graduate and World War 1 veteran, Nick was moving from the Midwest to New York to take a job as a bond salesman. He met the mysterious millionaire when he was invited to one of his huge parties, despite the fact that no one else was ever invited to his parties (they would just show up) and no one seemed to know what Gatsby really looked like. Nick soon discovered that the millionaire wanted to get to know him so he could arrange a meeting with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Mulligan), who Gatsby had a romantic affair with five years earlier. Daisy was (at the time, in 1922) married to another millionaire though, Tom (Edgerton), who was an old college buddy of Nick's. This of course caused lots of complications as Gatsby wanted to steal Daisy away from Tom, who she had fallen out of love with anyway due to his constant cheating ways.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Baz Luhrmann fan. I've enjoyed all of his films, especially 'MOULIN ROUGE!' (which is my all time favorite musical and one of my all time favorite films). That's a tragedy, like almost all of Luhrmann's movies, but it's still a beautifully moving story that's end feels justified. Like I said I haven't read the source material for 'GATSBY' (so I don't know how well the story played out in the book) but here I was disappointed with the overall feel of the film (by it's conclusion). I loved all of the performances (especially DiCaprio, who's amazing in it), the look of the film, the music and the first two acts. I really did like the story of this mentally ill millionaire who built his fortune from nothing and is now willing to throw almost everything away for his love (and obsession) with this untrustworthy girl. Like I said I just didn't like it's conclusion. Luhrmann did write the screenplay (with his usual partner in crime Craig Pearce) so he's to blame for it's shortcomings as much as it's success. It is a visual masterpiece that's a good film but not a great one.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw"
"Lejink","6","1","2","20 May 2013"," Not great Gatsby
","Almost 40 years on from the last Hollywood adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's modern classic comes Baz Lurrmann's take on the tale. To my eyes, the movie stays close to the novel as indeed did Robert Wise's 1974 version which starred Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, making me subconsciously compare actors as well as scenes which were similar in both movies.<br/><br/>I have to say, I prefer the 70's version. It would be easy to chide Luhrmann's use of modern music for so much of the background music, so chide I will, I certainly don't want to be thinking of Beyonce Knowles in a too obvious stab at a younger audience, when watching a film that tries so hard in many other ways to capture the hedonistic ""Jazz Age"" era of post-War, Prohibition-bound.<br/><br/>Thus the director goes to town in the party scenes at Gatsby's home, but a lot of it seems like window-dressing. I have casting issues too with Tobey McGuire's simpering goofiness at odds with his character's crucial part as a detached witness. I also felt that Carey Mulligan failed to convince as the impressionable Daisy Buchanan and that as her husband likewise struggled to adequately counterpoint Leonardo DiCaprio's title role.<br/><br/>Much will be made, no doubt of his pivotal portrayal of the doomed Gatsby. For me he acted naturally and with some style but failed to cast off an air of boyishness which for me was at odds with the deeper demands of his character. Nobody else leapt out at me either from the supporting cast, leaving me with the overall impression that the film, though pretty on-the-eye is let down by its actors who steadfastly refuse to leap off the printed page and imbed themselves in the memory.<br/><br/>The shifting narrative view-point didn't help much either so that in the end I was forced to the admittedly obvious conclusion about the film serving the eye better than the brain."
"moviescoundrel","7","1","2","20 May 2013"," The ""So-So"" Gatsby
","There is a lot that happens in this movie before Buchanan and Gatsby ever meet up. I found a lot of this boring. Some of the scenes that take place in this 1920's New York setting were interesting. Some of them were definitely full of eye candy (thanks Luhrmann). Gatsby throws many parties. Gatsby is not usually visible at his parties at first. When Carraway first gets an invitation he tries to find him and many people at the party say, ""you don't ever see Gatsby."" But later in the film, he's at many parties and people know him so this was kind of odd, especially since it was a 10 min. charade early in the film making a point of how anonymous he was. We see many parties that take place at Gatsby's house and eventually learn, they are all for Daisy. His house is near hers, and it was his hope that once he made something of himself and made enough money, she would stumble upon him and find him worthy and that she can't live without him.<br/><br/>Jay and Daisy do eventually reunite, and this is when the movie gets good for a bit. The soundtrack gets kind of eerie and the tragic foreshadowing makes you wonder if and when this rekindled romance will end. The relationship between Gatsby and Mr. Buchanan gets tense and caused me to wonder when these two men would throw down and fight for Daisy's heart. Unfortunately this doesn't happen. I'm not sure how true the movie is to the novel, or if the ending is the same, but I did not like the road the film traveled down once Tom Buchanan knows that Jay Gatsby loves his wife.<br/><br/>There were a couple of things that bothered me in this film. Since Carraway is in a mental institution, he probably had something pretty severe happen to him, and after watching the entire movie I'm not sure why he actually went crazy. Another thing that I didn't buy into was that Carraway said multiple times in the movie that Gatsby was one of the most hopeful men he's ever met, and will probably ever meet. While I would pencil Gatsby in as an optimistic I didn't see the hope that he was talking about, to me it was more obsessiveness. He didn't have a positive outlook on all things, he more just believed that no matter what, he and Daisy would be together and be okay. I would classify someone full of hope as optimistic or a glass half full type of person, and Gatsby didn't seem like he was that necessarily, he just obsessively gripped the notion that he and Daisy would be happy together, yet Carraway said he had the most hope of anyone he'd ever met.

"TyRawrrnosaurus","6","1","2","19 May 2013"," Style Over Substance Only Goes So Far
","Like Baz Luhrmann's previous works, Romeo + Julie and Moulin Rouge!, The Great Gatsby is given a contemporary spin while attempting to maintain the the source material's roots.<br/><br/>Right from the start, Lurhmann strays away from the text where we find our narrator, Nick Carrawaay (Tobey Maguire), a self-administered patient in a sanatorium. Carraway is seeking a psychiatrist's aid to rid himself of alcoholism and depression – neither of which is ever shown into detail throughout the film.<br/><br/>Nick hints at his troubled past and the summer he spent in 1922 where he meets Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), but has difficulty expressing his inner-feelings. He is told that he should write down his thoughts to better collect himself; a completely unrelenting and unnecessary bookend approach to tackle this literary titan. And thus begins the story of how we meet the Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>What The Great Gatsby attempts to convey in this adaptation only scratches at the surface of many of the themes it tries to take away from the book. Luhrmann's main focus seems to be solely on the unrequited love that Gatsby latches on to so desperately. It's all fun and games as the film builds rapport with its audience to understand Gatsby's desires, but it takes way too long to establish any sort of interesting conflict or tension to keep my attention.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is a spectacle to behold. Surprisingly, the 3D is well done, given a great amount of depth, and is bright enough to see what's going on at night. With beautiful sweeping shots of New York and the incredible attention to detail with the production design, The Great Gatsby has set itself up for Oscar gold – something Luhrmann is quite familiar with. But where the grand scale visuals succeed, Luhrmann fails to create any sort of depth within the characters or build any immediacy to this tragic tale. The whole movie feels very linear and most of the time uninteresting.<br/><br/>Don't bother giving much attention to the secondary characters such as Jordan Baker, Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan), Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher), and George B. Wilson (Jason Clarke) because Luhrmann doesn't deem it necessary to expand their roles past the five minutes of screen time he offers for each them, no matter how important they are to the plot or how they relate to the main characters.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio can make any character he embodies fascinating to watch, and gives it all with what is written for him. The funny thing about Gatsby though is that his lifestyle bears similar resemblance to that of Alien from Spring Breakers where he cannot help but show off his s%#t to impress the ladies. I don't think this will be Leo's chance at Oscar once again. He is way overdue though.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton who plays Tom Buchanan both do a remarkable job at what they are given too, but these three characters are so bare bones it's hard to care about any of them. Edgerton fills the shoes of Tom wonderfully as the skeezy, rich snob that he is, while Mulligan works innocence and naivety like clockwork.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire performs well, but again it's within the writing that we cannot grasp any of the emotions or feelings toward the situations he is put in. This makes him an unreliable person to tell the story. Sometimes it is best to show rather than tell; especially when they scroll written words across the screen as if we are unable to understand the importance of what is being said by Carraway.<br/><br/>The 142 minute run time does not help the cause either. Because nothing ever seems important, the movie feels like it goes on forever. Even the main climax of the movie is very underwhelming and I felt absolutely nothing. If you want to save yourself over two hours of your time, you can watch the final trailer for The Great Gatsby because it practically reveals the entire story in one neat little package.<br/><br/>Aside from the decent amount of acting from three quarters of the main cast, the only other thing that earned my attention was the soundtrack. My body was unprepared as to how well I would take the jazz infused hip-hop music. At first I wasn't too fond of the sounds of Jay-Z blaring while 1920's flappers danced to the beat, but it worked and grew on me. Because everything felt so clean with the digital photography and Baz Luhrmann's style, it felt right.<br/><br/>While The Great Gatsby has many issues trying to establish any sort of intrigue, it isn't a failure or completely boring. It could have been far worse if not for the incredible cast of actors and stunning visual flare that Luhrmann chooses to shove in our faces."

It was a long movie, we went late AND I stayed awake the entire time. It was visually stunning -- the cinematography, the costumes, even the opening graphics; the 20's were brought to life in all of it's glory and grit. The entire cast did a beautiful job -- very well cast and acted. The movie stayed true to the book in all ways; my husband's never read the book, I have, we both were very satisfied. The teenagers all came out saying they wanted to read the book; can't get a much better review than that! I just don't know what was not to like. If critics think it was too fantastical?; the book was written that way and much like HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"", it brings to life my family's fantastical stories of the northeast in the days of prohibition, flappers and the Charleston. The movie very much delivered what I had hoped and then some. I didn't want to see it in 3D; I couldn't understand why it would be necessary. Now I understand and may have to go see it again in 3D."

","For starters I have always loved Luhrmann's work. He has a unique sense of style and isn't afraid to go off the beaten one track mind set. I have watched the original movie and read the novel. By far I think Luhrmann's version of Gatsby is much more engaging and offers more finesse.The philosophy behind the film rang with truth and the characters were well developed. There were deeply inspirational moments and the lifestyle during that time era was captured well. A beautiful film for audiences of all ages, anyone who is not socially inept will end up feeling deep empathy for Gatsby and Nick Carraway.If you want a beautifully engaging, lavish movie with heart, then go see this film and keep an open mind.

"tribal_trudy_04","7","1","2","18 May 2013"," Optimistic yet inevitable tragedy. A good film!
","I watched the Great Gatsby last night and I really enjoyed the film. I think the superficiality and shallowness experienced while viewing the opulent and extravagant parties in the film were to be expected. If you consider your own individual experience of a party, you always end up leaving a party feeling a little bit more empty, and somewhat let down. The hype of a party never really lives up to the expectation. (Well, perhaps that is just me). Or, if it does live up to your expectation, then the party always has to end.<br/><br/>I thought the most interesting thing about the film was the underlying hope that permeated throughout it. Beneath the shallowness and opulence lies real heart. This optimism is juxtaposed with what I can only describe as an existentialist crisis, and that inevitable realisation that follows the pain of human disappointment. This disappointment feels more acute when a character is betrayed or disappointed by a fellow human being.<br/><br/>I thought Leornardo Dicaprio gave a phenomenal performance as Gatsby. I think this film reinforces how underrated an actor he is in Hollywood. From watching Leonardo in Django, playing a character who I absolutely despised, to playing this tragic hero who I loved; it is shocking that he is recognised so little in the industry. In my opinion, he nailed both performances.<br/><br/>I thought Tobey Maguire also gave a great performance. I must admit that I have always been a fan of Tobey since I saw him in Pleasantville. I appreciate his acting style; I understand that many do not. I thought Cary Mulligan was OK. I have not seen what is fantastic about her acting style yet, but she did do a great American accent, and her character appeared somewhat ethereal until she turned into one of those predictable and unlikable characters who chose society's approval instead of her individual and romantic integrity.<br/><br/>The music was OK/good. I did feel that there was too much Jay Z and Beyonce in the soundtrack, but I guess that was to be expected if Jay Z is an executive producer on the film. I enjoyed hearing Lana Del Ray's music on the film as I like her music and I felt it was fitting for the scenes used in the film.<br/><br/>I should add I have not read the book, but I am intrigued to read it now."
"benniboy93","9","1","2","18 May 2013"," Fantastic adaptation
","I absolutely loved this film. I studied the book in school a few years ago and loved it then, and Luhrmann really does it justice. <br/><br/>The cinematography is spectacular, as you'd expect if you've seen Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet, and the first stages of the film really immerse you in the fantastical illusion that Gatbsy has conjured up through his parties and lavish lifestyle.<br/><br/>As the story moves on, the stellar cast comes into its own. DiCaprio is, unsurprisingly, immaculate, giving the perfect mix of optimistic hope and downright naivety and delusion. Each of the other main actors manages to generate just enough sympathy for his or her character that you remain torn between who the good and bad people are. Edgerton is a prime example; an unpleasant character for sure, but somehow Edgerton made him human enough for me to not despise him. Tobey Maguire is a revelation. I had my doubts about him going into this film, but he suits the role down to the ground, and actually manages to be pretty funny, acting as the source for most of the film's humour.<br/><br/>All in all, I think the film does a great job of portraying the central message of Fitzgerald's novel. There are no out and out villains, merely a host of ""careless people, who smash things and people and then retreat into their money."" And one man who dared to dream, one Gatsby."

The exposure of the gun in the drawer is humorous. Baz, ""Old Sport"" if they take a hydroplane ride, show it, don't just cover it in voice over. What's one more CGI effect?<br/><br/>Interesting use of music, even if it is contemporary and wasn't written yet during the time period of the film. Great costumes, interesting sets and cars add to the fun. Good performances all around. <br/><br/>The ""Daisy"" uttered in the style of ""Rosebud"" seems to sum up the intent. It doesn't come close to a masterpiece but it works as a visually feast. Not sure if the 3D is worth the up charge and loss of brightness."

","I've literally never seen more people divided on a film as people are on the Great Gatsby. Having seen it last night, I liked it. First of all, it was true to the book. When a moment happened in the movie, I felt the exact same way as I felt when I read it in the book. That, to me, is a successful adaptation. The sets was amazing and so colorful and gorgeous. I have never, ever seen sets like that. Some might say they were excessive, which they were, but I think the reason they were was to convey the time period's tone of excess and greed, which it did effectively. The cast was very good. Leonardo was a very good Gatsby, McGuire is perfect for the awkward, 3rd wheel narrator Nick, and Mulligan is solid as Daisy. Finally, for all people dissing Jay-Z's music choices, the soundtrack worked. The music fit the moods of the respective scenes and also fit with the colorful excess of the sets. Ergo, it did not feel out of place.<br/><br/>My conclusion: It wasn't trying to be exactly like the book. It was trying to put a slightly 21st century spin on it, which I understood and appreciated. Was it excessive? Without question, but I almost feel like by being excessive, it properly conveyed the emotions the story is supposed to convey. In the end, I felt the way I was supposed to feel and while I probably wouldn't have chosen to remake the book quite this way, I thought this adaptation was interesting, colorful, emotional, and a solid film in its own right. Not great, but definitely good and worth seeing in theaters too. (This is coming from someone who hardly goes to any movies in theaters)"
"buiredintime","7","1","2","14 May 2013"," The Roaring Twenties old sport
","Yes this movie wasn't really a surprise to me, more of a oh it's another Baz Lurman film. One that seems to take all the kinetic energy and throw it in your face with a cannon. It's a movie like Speed racer that is full of high octane energy and cg on over drive. What makes this movie so well done and so interesting is it's take on the source material. The Story is well known and has been read by more people than seem to live on this planet. If you don't know well it's the story of one mans obsession to get back the woman he left behind and still longs for and the effects on the world around both of them. Now I haven't read the book, luckily it wasn't a required reading for me but I can see why this book is so well revered. It takes a topic like long lost lovers and throws in the roaring 20's and all that jazz. It makes you realize that even though the world around us changes, we all yearn for that someone and cling onto that perfect on the outside high culture figure. Whether it be Justin Bieber or Elvis or the Beatles or Hugh Hefner or Great Gatsby, all were loved and all were adored or still adored. It's in this fashion that I think Gatsby works well enough, it takes people that we can idolize and turns them against one another in glorious fashion. Now this isn't a perfect film and is extremely long for what is only a 160 page novel. It drags in spots, so much so that I was checking my phone. Some of the characters are great Dicaprio and Edgerton some are not (I'm looking at you Maguire). It doesn't mean there not good, just all not well cooked in the oven. With that though and with any Baz Lurman film, your going to get razzle dazzle and this movie does it well. It's fun to watch the drunken debauchery on the parties Gatsby throws and even fun to see New York Before a hell broke loose with the stock market crash. I think it would be fun to spend a day in this era of time. In the end The Great Gatsby is fun but not perfect. It's a movie that I enjoyed but won't see again."
"maurice_yacowar","9","1","2","13 May 2013"," spectacular responsible adaptation of classic
","After all the reviews to the contrary, I was surprised to find Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby to be (i) an inventive yet faithful adaptation of the narrative, themes and values of the original novel; and (ii) a responsible, meaningful use of 3-D.<br/><br/>The heightened depth becomes a perfect means to expose the partying horde's shallowness. With so many people and so much luxury crammed into a frame the self-absorbed hedonists shrink into anthills. It also quietly confirms the uncrossable gap between Gatsby's new mansion and his dream Daisy's, her emblematic green light seeming to flash Go but really saying Stop. In the early party scenes the camera swooping down and across from on high shrinks the humans but also implicitly suggests a god's eye view, a higher judgement. That connects to the old optician's billboard of the eyeglasses staring out on the coal-hell and the maddened mechanic's murderous confidence that God sees all, which itself recalls Gatsby's childhood sense of himself as an omnipotent son of God.

","Redford & Mia Farrow were the Gatsby & Daisy of their day. Leonardo & Carey Mulligan take over for a new generation & for the most part succeed. The costumes & music add a lot considering the expense paid. While Leonardo is excellent as Gatsby he is almost upstaged by Joel Edgerton who gives a memorable performance as the villain of the piece. When I heard that hip hop was the musical soundtrack I wasn't sure how that would work. I didn't care for the soundtrack of Moulin Rouge but I have to say I think the music in The Great Gatsby fit into the movie flawlessly. I was hoping for a classic like Orson Welles or David Lean but this will have to do. Eye candy."
"theredraylives","8","1","2","13 May 2013"," Glitz and Glamour with beautiful Subtext!
","The Great Gatsby is explosively vibrant from its beginning to its end. Baz Luhrmann takes his stunning artistry to F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, projecting the lavishness and decadence of the roaring 20s onto the screen with a modern soundtrack. A bold choice, perhaps, but make no mistake, Luhrmann's Gatsby is a wonderfully deep and poignant picture about love, lust, and greed that bursts onto the screen in vibrant detail.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jay Gatsby, a reclusive millionaire living in a lavish mansion, who dazzles all of New York with opulent parties weekend to weekend. Yet, for all of this, Gatsby himself is a bit of a recluse- few of his party guests even know who he is, fewer still know anything about him. DiCaprio gives a splendid performance as the enigmatic Gatsby, always hinting that there is more to him beneath the surface and always seeming that, despite the opulence that he surrounds himself with, he is a smaller man with smaller dreams. No, not necessarily smaller- but closer to heart.<br/><br/>The film is told through the eyes of young Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), who moves in next door to Gatsby after graduating from Yale. Maguire, too, gives a good performance here, and he was perfectly cast for this role- he has a great wide-eyed, always-in-wonder stare through which the audience can be introduced into the decadence of Gatsby's world. He always seems a bit out of place and a bit blown away by what's going on around him and the character is better for it. He is captivated not by the money and status that surround him, but by the humanity of the people living it- Carraway is by far the most ""human"" and relate-able character in the film.<br/><br/>Gatsby's story, ultimately, is a story of love, whether it be the love of another person or the love of wealth, status, and power. Luhrmann contrasts the two beautifully against one another in Gatsby and Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Both are wealthy, but in terms of set design and even in the performances, it is obvious that it isn't wealth and status that are important to Gatsby, while these are everything to Buchanan. Their beautiful mansions, on opposing shores, are a reflection of this.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Luhrmann's use of modern hip-hop music as a backdrop for Gatsby's tale, with Jay-Z serving as an executive producer on the film- this is a stylistic choice that works for a few reasons. One, it gives the film and the story a timelessness- not many people alive today can relate to living in the Jazz age, when American decadence reached its pinnacle. Two, it draws a parallel with the decadence of the modern day, particularly in the hip-hop culture- whether this was intentional or not is anyone's guess, but the correlation is there. It gives the lavishness of the life lived by Gatsby a fantastic musical backdrop and gives the film a vibrant signature all its own.<br/><br/>The whole film is, of course, a slow unraveling of the mystery of exactly who Jay Gatsby is. Leo plays Gatsby as coy, carefully guarded, never fully revealing anything about himself to anyone. His is a tragic tale, a man who lost the woman he loved and would do anything to get her back- in the end, of course, Daisy (Carey Mulligan) has forgotten all about him, more in love with status and money. Real, human love is tossed aside and left behind in the wake of money and power- Luhrmann's film does a great job of exploring this theme, most particularly the loss of humanity and the battle for love. Carraway describes Gatsby as being filled with a limitless hope. His tales of his amazing exploits at war are echoed in his quest to reclaim Daisy- fighting single-handedly against impossible odds to defeat a powerful enemy. His hope is indeed limitless, and his is the hope to reclaim his lost love and live forever in romance, a hope that is dashed by the greed and want for status, money, and power. Gatsby is rich, but his money, ultimately, means nothing to him.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's direction is meant to lose the viewer in the tumult of Gatsby's world (and heart)- indeed, there are times when it seems rather directionless, and the over-the-top production seems about to crash down on itself. This choice feels deliberate, as Luhrmann wants the audience lost in the world as Carraway is- his vision is fantastically realized, and even if it comes off a bit stagey at times, it is still larger-than-life and layered deep. At the center of it all, in the chaos of the opulent parties and the wealth literally poured away, stands Gatsby. DiCaprio easily shoulders the weight of the film and gives a great performance, begging the audience to look closer and peel back the layers that encompass him to get to the ultimate truth."
"ferguson-6","8","1","2","13 May 2013"," Touch the Green Light
","Greetings again from the darkness. Movie versions of beloved books are always a risky proposition. Devotees of the written word recoil in disgust when a filmmaker dares re-imagine a character or scene, while critics take delight in itemizing each and every stray from the source material. Director Baz Luhrmann is an artist. His canvas is the silver screen, and he thrives in presenting his interpretations and visions. When he agreed to take on F Scott Fitzgerald's 88 year old masterpiece  one that consistently lands on the lists of top ten novels of all-time  he most assuredly prepared for the onslaught of criticism and outrage that would follow (and has). He must have also known that his work would delight and entertain those open-minded viewers not shackled to thoughts of a single ""correct"" form (it has).<br/><br/>If you have seen Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! (2001) or Romeo + Juliet (1996), then you are prepared for a Gatsby vision significantly different from director Jack Clayton's somber and oft-dreary version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Taking a different route altogether, Luhrmann worked with Jay-Z on the soundtrack that mixes Roaring 20's jazz classics with contemporary hip-hop. He worked with award-winning Costume Designer Catherine Martin (his wife) on creating a kaleidoscope of colors for dazzling outfits that range from Gatsby's pastel suits to the glitzy and sparkling party dresses at his over-the-top parties. Additionally, Luhrmann invoked the newest 3-D technology to add even more emphasis to the visual spectacle that included free-flowing champagne, high-gloss and high-powered automobiles screaming down narrow roads, sky-filling fireworks, and enough glittery confetti to stop down a parade. Jay Gatsby may know how to throw party, but so does Baz Luhrmann.<br/><br/>Knowing this movie was coming soon, I re-read Fitzgerald's novel back in January. While I was once again struck by the depressing feeling it leaves you with (it is after all a tragedy), I was also reminded of what stunning prose the writer lays out. At times I find it borders on poetry. You may agree with many of the 1925 critics who claimed the characters are unlikeable and the plot has little to offer, though you must also acknowledge the work acts as a timeless reminder that the vast majority of us could never come close to writing something as beautiful.<br/><br/>The cast members are talented and game for Luhrmann's world. Leonardo DiCaprio infuses the Gatsby character with the uncertainty and teetering balance of secrecy that Redford never could. His obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan) may be difficult to understand, but then why should obsessive love make sense? Joel Edgerton (as Daisy's husband Tom) is a womanizing brute who sets his own inherited wealth and culture as far apart as East and West Egg. Tobey Maguire's Nick Carraway is our lone claim to normalcy. He is thrust into the Gatsby world and never really understands it  but then who could? The Carraway character is my single biggest complaint in regards to the movie. The framing device of Nick writing the story down for his psychiatrist as part of his therapy, means we get entirely too much Tobey Maguire and Nick Carraway for my tastes.<br/><br/>It's also a bit disappointing that we get so little of the strong supporting cast: Isla Fisher as Myrtle, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband, and especially Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim and newcomer Elizabeth Debricki as Jordan Baker are seen and heard from entirely too few times. In fact, the Nick and Jordan connection from the book is mostly ignored. These are all fabulous actors who did what they could with the characters, but we should remind ourselves that Fitzgerald's book was always more about the prose than the characters or plot. He told us what he wanted us to know more than have his characters show us. That was his art form. Baz Luhrmann's art form is showing  and his show is quite a treat!"

Jay Z is an amazing artist and I have great respect for him as a musician, but the flow and mood was completely disrupted at times.

Anyone who tells you this is a great movie is just trying to get someone else to drop money on a middle of the road flick at best.

It's a great waste of a great cast but NOT a great anything else. What a large scale mess of a film that honestly ends VERY badly. The final act's final message is that hope is for suckers.

"xristosdomini","7","2","9","7 June 2013"," The Great Gatsby...... The Great
","Just saw Baz Luhrmann's ""Great Gatsby"". ((note: for a fun drinking game, take a shot every time I mention Moulin Rouge)) Thought I might just throw out a review for the heck of it. First things first, it isn't perfect--though, if you expected it to be, you were expecting too much of an adaptation of a book. The script came down with a bad case of ""Titanic Syndrome"" ((those with angst about the liberal use of the words ""Rose"" and ""Jack"" in that film will know what I'm talking about)), to the point that if I hear someone called ""Old Sport"" again, someone is going to get punched. For the record, Harry Potter has a lot of the same problem with the script... it's almost like the writer forgot that this was going to be filmed (allowing us to see who is being addressed) and seen in one sitting (so we know that the person called ""old sport"" in shot 4A is the same person in shot 12B). Apart from that small shortcoming in the script, the acting was pretty good and the action was well paced.<br/><br/>Now, the real reason for seeing a Baz Luhrmann film... the cinematography. The film strikes a near-perfect blend of not taking itself too seriously and heavy inter-personal drama. Like the three previous full-scale productions Luhrmann has done (Australia, Moulin Rouge, and Romeo + Juliet), the main reason for seeing this film is the impeccably creative way in which the story is told. If you've seen Moulin Rouge, you may get a little distracted in the use of the ""in scene narrator"" and semi-first-person storytelling as it feels all too familiar to the previous project... but the stories are so radically different in both setting and content that that can be pretty quickly tossed aside. There is some pretty sick animation work done too (for example, during a snow storm towards the end of the film, instead of snowflakes, it is falling and rotating letters which forms the words of the narration on the screen) that all is done for great effect to never let the viewer forget that they are hearing a story that is being typed. This is what allows for the already-mentioned similarity to Moulin Rouge... and the rockstar persona that comes with it.<br/><br/>For some reason, when you make clear that the story you are seeing is taking place in context to a story being told within the film (ie, the ""main character"" of the actual film is telling the story you are watching to other people), it allows for a lot more bending of the rules of reality. Moulin Rouge and 300 would be the clearest examples of this--though there are certainly others. Because the rules of the road can be ignored somewhat, Baz Luhrmann feels quite comfortable setting a party scene in the 1920's Empire architecture with 2012 hip hop and then dares the audience to question it (like Moulin Rouge). The weird part is that it works. I don't know if it is the combination of the bombastic characters, the semi-over-colored sets or the core animation/camera work, but for some reason the blend of JayZ production capabilities with the ""flapper/speakeasy/gangster"" vibe fits in the 1920's atmosphere almost seamlessly... probably because this is the kind of music you would expect to hear there if they had it.<br/><br/>For the real crowning moment, however, we find another of Luhrmann's recent favorites... a film with no good guys. Like Moulin Rouge, Gatsby centers on a protagonist who isn't the main character--yet whose main role is to narrate the film and hold all the various story elements together. Also, like Moulin Rouge, the narrator is a washed up writer that the world has chewed up and spit back out that is writing/narrating the story as a way to get it off their chest. Because of this, like in Moulin Rouge, pretty much everybody involved turns out to be a shmuck. There's the girl that makes you groan, the guy you want to deck at every opportunity, the love story with a bad ending and a couple rowdy and colorful party scenes in the middle. Though, I will say, watching this movie did make me wish I was a bond salesman in New York during the 1920's...... I wish I could get paid for doing that little work in a week.<br/><br/>Final thought: Lots of eyecandy, sterling camera work, underpaid animators, good actors, good-but-not-great script. They told the story of Great Gatsby mostly as I remember it from the book."

The direction is energetic, you feel like you're at the party that's taking place and in 3D it's even better, sparkly bits and people hands extend out the screen, as does Jay Gatsby's glass when DiCaprio finally makes an appearance as fireworks explode behind him, leaving you in awe knowing this movie is being led by one hell of a star. The supporting cast add to the solidarity of the talent here, I thought Joel Edgerton plays a nasty piece of work brilliantly, Adelaide Clemens is sexy and stylish and Carey Mulligan adds yet another pitch perfect performance to her career full of them.

"Tweekums","9","1","3","23 April 2015"," Baz Luhrmann's take on a classic American novel
","Set in the early '20s, the story is related to us by narrator Nick Carraway. He tells us of his time in New York where everybody he met was somewhat rotten, with one exception; Jay Gatsby. Carroway, an aspiring writer, is working in New York's financial industry and living in Long Island. His neighbour is the mysterious Gatsby; a man who throws lavish parties where none of the many guests are actually invited and few have actually met him; they do however have lots of stories about him; he is related to the Kaiser, he is a spy, he has even killed a man it is all speculation of course but it part of the myth that is Gatsby. Carraway is unusual; he gets an invitation there is a reason for this Gatsby was involved with his cousin Daisy five years previously and everything he has done since returning from the war has been to be reunited with her the problem is she is married to the wealthy Tom Buchanan. Now he wants Carraway to reunite them something that can only result in tragedy.<br/><br/>Having neither read the book nor seen previous film versions I had few preconceptions about the story and some of those I did have were proved wrong! The way the story is told quickly had me gripped; the way we are drip-fed rumours about Gatsby made me wonder just what he would be like long before he appeared on screen. When he does appear it gradually becomes apparent that the man and the myth are quite different. The film delightfully captures the flamboyant feel of the era despite using modern music; it also captures the decadence where the wealthy flout the prohibition laws and party hard not too surprising given that is it directed by Baz Luhrmann. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fine job as the eponymous Gatsby; nicely capturing the flamboyant side of him as well as the shyness when he meets his beloved Daisy once more. Carey Mulligan is great as Daisy; the character who will ultimately prove to be Gatsby's undoing. Tobey Maguire is also good putting in an understated performance as Carraway; a man out of his element who narrates the story to us. Joel Edgerton puts in a powerful performance as the thoroughly unpleasant Tom Buchanan. Overall this film is well worth watching."

"rs9017720","4","1","3","15 January 2015"," An uninspired version of Fitzgerald's classic
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel aptly named The Great Gatsby has been often recognized as the greatest American novel. It took me a year to finally get around to seeing it's film counterpart, and I was immensely disappointed. Whether you love the novel, hate it, or simply admire the way it captured the Jazz age, this movie has all of about nothing to offer you. The movie, to sum up, seems to spend more of its budget and attention on the senses, specifically sight and sound, than profound storytelling. For example, New York has become a brightly colored, CGI party, with colors bursting off of the screen similar to Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge or many of Zach Snyder's comic book adaptations. This is all fine and good, (though it is a huge misrepresentation of the era, which was more of a cover for bad times to come in the thirties) the film ends up losing its focus. There are constant odd jumps in shots, almost always happening in the middle of a character's sentence, seeming to illustrate my point further. However all of this may have been acceptable were it not for the performances. Apart from Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays an excellent Gatsby, everyone's dialogue and performance feels overdone. This is especially true of Maguire, who plays an alcoholic who gives unbearable monologues that sound, well as bad as they were in Raimi's Spider-Man films. In other words, he talks in a disinterested grumble through half the movie and makes random pauses that even Calculon would detest. Apart from these two, the other characters feel generic and boring, a mere shadow to those presented in Fitzgerald's third novel. The ending is quite foreboding, if nothing different for those who have read the novel, but it makes several characters bitterly unlikeable, a problem I had with the source material as well. The ending is tragic, the visuals are fantastic, but the film has too little an attention span and too poor performances to make this movie recommendable."

","Sorry folks, but, after all the hype about The Great Gatsby - including the fact that it is based on what has always been in my mind as classic literature (although I have never read the book), I was very disappointed. F Scott Fitzgerald is said to have been inspired by lavish Long Island parties he attended and, whilst I have no doubt that there were some lavish lifestyles in the aftermath of the First World War, I cannot imagine anything like the parties that Jay Gatsby laid on for people he didn't even know. The sad thing was that those parties weren't even enjoyable - or, should I say, I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere near one! They were laden with loathsome ""would be if they could be"" social climbers. So, for the first part of the movie, I found my skin creeping in disgust - and I don't watch movies for that effect!<br/><br/>Leonardo diCaprio and Tobey Maguire were the consummate professional actors that they usually are and it certainly isn't their fault that this movie is, in a word, boring. Whilst I have seen Carey Mulligan in Brothers, I don't really remember her. Maybe that's because she isn't memorable and there are dozens of better-known actresses that could have played Daisy Buchanan a lot better.

Leonardo Dicaprio is quite good as Jay Gatsby. He is a vulnerable man who just wants his paradise. He's a man looking for a long lost love which happens to be Daisy (Carey Mulligan). Daisy is married though,but Gatsby has obsessed over her for years since he fell in love with her. All of this story of affairs, love, heartbreak, and betrayal is told by Nick Carraway. He is played by Tobey Maguire. He is charming in the role, and is quite dynamic of a character. He goes from an innocent upstart to a marked man for the events that happened in New York with Gatsby. What traumatizing effects happen to him? Well this is where the story goes wrong. It becomes so random and over blown that even the cast has trouble making it work. However most of the story is fine and somewhat survives. It's not perfect,but with the script which is full of cheesy lines,and a disappointing end it is left on the actors to push the story. They do succeed.<br/><br/>Than there is the style. The visually flashy parts of the film try to fight the CGI overdone parts. See the film has a very fake look to it. The difference between the sections in the fact that some looks fake and some does not. Let's talk about the good part. The visual style works whenever he parties are going on. The parties are lush and just large and fun to watch. They have a lot of energy and have a visual stun to them. They are also fun to watch. The bad part is the city scenes. They look fake and over stylized. It is so putrid.<br/><br/>The editing is also at war with itself. There is wildly good cinematography. The parties have great cinematography. The camera weaves around in chaos creating the great chaotic feeling. It's also not so bad in the city scenes. Than there is the music. The modern rap that is put in the film feels out of place and it sucks. The music doesn't fit and it's like someone grating your teeth while some good cinematography is going on.<br/><br/>So how does the film do? Okay. This is not perfect,but the cast is fine, and the other aspects are kind of 50/50. Constantly at war with it own good parts The Great Gatsby get's a 7.5 out of 10."
"spkoolkat","6","1","3","7 May 2014"," The Great Gatsby is a story that is recorded by one Mr. Nick Carraway, of an ambitious boy who makes it large in life except for getting his one true love.
","Mr. Jay Gatsby is a mystery; everybody has heard of him from the top bureaucrats and socialites to the whores in a common street brothel, and even fewer has actually set eyes on him. Finally one day Nick gets invited to Mr. Gatsby's party and an acquaintance slowly grows. However he soon realizes that Mr. Gatsby has other motives for forming such a friendship with him rather than for being neighbors. Thereafter we see through the eyes of Nick how an old love is rekindled between Gatsby and Daisy (Nick's married cousin) with a little help by him. However, as minutes pass in the movie, the lovers, Nick, and the audience as well, become more and more aware of their impending and inevitable doom. Finally it does come but not the same way they had feared, but much worse. It is a love story that has to fight the world for its fulfillment; they try and they fail. We understand that this was how Nick had got into the depression which made him start writing the account of the Great Gatsby in his journal.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole fails to impress in so many aspects. It does not live up to the expectation even after the outstanding performances by the two great actors- Leonardo Di Caprio and Toby McGuire. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan was outstanding as well. It tries too hard, and still does not manage to squeeze out a teardrop from the audience.<br/><br/>It can be looked upon as a nice entertaining piece that can be watched by the gen-x and the coming generation who are just curious enough to get an idea about the society in that early period but don't care enough to spend necessary time to get in depth or to seek the reality. Wrapping up, I would say that its old wine not in a new bottle, rather in just a polished one. The only thing appealing about it is its aesthetics, the 3d effect; that is, its visually very delightful."

","A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.<br/><br/>The reviews on this film seem to be mixed, or maybe even negative. Some people really disliked the musical choices (though I felt them better suited than Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" choices, which varied from great to terrible). Some disliked Tobey McGuire, either for his acting or for the ""lapdog"" take on Nick Carraway. That seems more fair.<br/><br/>I loved it. While ""Romeo + Juliet"" may go down as Luhrmann's masterpiece, this is really quite a trip, with plenty of opulence without ever making that the point. He wanted a love story -- if this can be called that -- and not a morality tale on money, Wall Street, or anything else.<br/><br/>There seems a need to compare Jay Gatsby to the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" merely because DiCaprio appeared in both films in the same year, and both are excessively wealthy. There is no need for that, because again, it is not about the money. The money was merely a means to an end for Gatsby, not the goal in itself."

","The Great Gatsby is a 3D film adaptation the 1925 novel of the same name that stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Elizabeth Debicki.It follows the life and times of millionaire Jay Gatsby and his neighbor Nick Carraway, who recounts his encounter with Gatsby at the height of the 1920's.This serves as a tribute to F. Scott Fitzgerald on the 116th anniversary of his birth and the 1925 novel of the same name.It was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann.<br/><br/>It is the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby and across the bay from his cousin,Daisy and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. As Nick bears witness to the captivating world of the rich,he writes a tale that consists of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and tragedy that similar to our own struggles in the present.<br/><br/>This film is definitely a visually great.It won two Oscars for best production design and best costume design.Too bad that the viewer feels that too much effort was placed in it rather than Fitzgerald's story itself.Also,we get lost in following the material especially when we are continuously amazed with the visual effects of the movie that is so excessive just like the parties hosted by Gatsby himself. Too bad the this great story was presented in a boring and dull manner that one does not hold interest in the tales and themes it is trying to convey.In the end,lessons that could have been learned gets lost somewhere in this film.As for the performances,there is nothing really worthy to be mentioned despite of the talented cast involved in it.Too bad that it is only a minor improvement of the Robert Redford and Mia Farrow-starrer of the 1974 The Great Gatsby.But nevertheless,this film is definitely what Jay Gatsby would say if he were alive today,""A visual splendor,old sport!!!"""

"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","3","18 November 2013"," Has a lot of imperfections that stop it from being great, but of the four adaptations this fares the best
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is a great, no, wonderful book, a beautiful story and just as brilliantly written and one of those books where you can read in one sitting and not feel bored at all. In my reviews of the previous three versions it was said that I wasn't entirely sure as to whether it was one of the all-time literary greats. After reading it again in preparation for this film- considering that it is based on a great story though it's also by Baz Luhrmann(whose style you either like or dislike)- it does deserve this distinction as well as a contender for the best American novel.<br/><br/>Before seeing this films, I saw the 1974, 1949 and 2000 versions. All had good things but also a fair number of flaws, neither really doing the book justice. That is not saying at all that this film is 100% perfect because it isn't, and it doesn't completely do justice to the book. However despite some questionable stylistic touches the spirit of the book and prose as well as of the Jazz Age are here in the way that the other three versions didn't really do so well. It is easy though to see why people criticise the latest version of The Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>The first 20-30 minutes are very rushed and overblown with editing that is so dizzying it could induce a seizure. There are a couple of nice moments in the soundtrack, like some of the background music and a bit of Gershwin(the use of Rhapsody in Blue was clever), but the hip-hop/rap was overused, overbearing and anachronistic(I confess also that I detest that style of music so there is some bias). The CGI was overdone and not needed, it also looks a little too cartoonish. Tobey Maguire is the weakest of the Nick Carraways(the best being Sam Waterson), the observer and the glue of the story, he's too wide-eyed and too much of a blank and doesn't really convey the dignity, carelessness and social awkwardness.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film on the most part looks great, it is beautifully shot and the lavish costumes and sets are never short of exquisite. The party scenes generally have the glitz and glamour any party of the 20s would do. Also period-detail wise it's the most authentic to the 20s period, like for example Daisy's clothing and cropped hair. Where The Great Gatsby(2013) scores the best of the four adaptations is in the depiction of the Jazz Age, it is glitzy but there is also the sense of fun, danger and excitement that weren't there before. While there is Luhrmann's style written over the spirit of the story is essentially there.<br/><br/>Nick's narration has a lot of lines directly lifted out of the book and much of the dialogues are the same(the old sport utterings get too much though admittedly). The story has the life, emotion and passion that the 1974 film as a consequence of being too faithful did not have. And the structure and essence are present with Gatsby still an enigma(always was part of the book's allure, 2000's ruined that quality by revealing Gatsby's background and who he is far too early). From the first 20-30 minutes there is a real temptation to turn the film off, but if you stay with it it does slow down and becomes a huge improvement to what was seen before. Some won't like the sanitarium stuff, actually Nick telling the story in retrospect to someone else was not too bad a storytelling device and did better than how the 2000 version did it.<br/><br/>As with the acting, it is very good and is the most consistent cast of the four versions. Only Maguire didn't across as well as he ought to have done. Leonardo DiCaprio lives up to his character's greatness. There is a sense of him paying homage somewhat to Robert Redford's mannerisms but instead DiCaprio is much more charismatic in the role and there is much more of sense of mystery, more charm, more yearning and a sense of arrogance. This is also the only one of the four adaptations where I found myself really liking and relating to Gatsby. Carey Mulligan is also the best of the Daisys, a character that wasn't played very well at all previously. With Mulligan she is pretty and doesn't play too blandly or stridently, there is a charm and spirit about her but she doesn't make us forget that Daisy is shallow and selfish as well. The chemistry between the two is more convincing than that of the other versions, in a way it is somewhat cold but it is in keeping of the sense that their love is incompatible.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton is the second best Tom after Bruce Dern. He resembles the character better physically, but is the only actor after Dern to actually get the attitude and mannerisms of Tom exactly right, he is a real hard-edged brute but with a glimmer of tenderness instead of being too suave or too soft. Jason Clarke is good as George, he does show a tormented side but also a sense of not being the brightest bulb on the block. Elizabeth Debicki is beautiful and witty and brings depth and assurance also to Jordan, despite being somewhat underused, and Isla Fisher is appropriately conniving as Myrtle if not as much a sleaze as Karen Black. Luhrmann does direct efficiently with much of the drama being allowed to breathe while bringing his own style to it, though there are scenes with it being too much. The pacing is rushed to begin with but when it slows down there's not much of a problem.<br/><br/>Overall, not the great motion picture it could have been, but I found it very enjoyable and the best of the four adaptations. The best version will always be the book though. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Mrtide22","8","1","3","3 September 2013"," Pretty good, except for one thing...
","The Great Gatsby is the classic tale of a millionaire who only wants one thing, the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The classic F. Scott Fitzgerald story is great. The acting is excellent, and Dicaprio really nails it. The set design, costume design, and overall setting quality is superb. The only flaw I can find (literally, the only flaw) is the music. Before you roll your eyes and cut this off, just hear me out. For me, authentic setting in a movie is very important, and music is a big part of the setting. I don't have an issue with rap or hip-hop being in a film, as long as it fits the setting. Rap/hip-hop DOES NOT fit a 1920's movie!!! With a fitting soundtrack, this movie is a 10, but since they had to put that music in, it becomes an 8 in my book."
"in1984","9","1","3","17 August 2013"," More Beats and Booms than the Book
","9.1 of 10 for a book I would rate 8.25 of 10. While I can understand some people complaining about the rap/hip-hop use (which could have been integrated better, but really does fit the film and the situations after the first surprise), there's certain things about the city and early suburban settings that this film captures that the book failed to. It does so without losing the core of the story, enhancing it in some ways.<br/><br/>The ending is so impressive that I walked out ready to give the film a 10. But, as mentioned, there are little annoyances that could have been easily avoided or done better. None of it involves the acting, although DeCaprio is not the ideal casting choice for the character he plays. The story, dress, and realism of the settings all help to overcome most of the problems.<br/><br/>In addition to capturing the inherent disparities of pre-Depression, prohibition-era America, this also captures the big city industrialization better than most of the films and science fiction dedicated specifically to recreate and extrapolate massive cities. It's worth seeing as is, regardless of the book."

","The reinterpretation and re-imagining of the 20s in a modern salsa is stylish and often astonishing, making the first act a really enjoyable experience. The second and third acts however (once the tone is set) become something else, something closer to a theatrical play rather than the extravagant movie it presented itself as. I'm not a big fan of ""Moulin Rouge"", and this film uses the exact same style, trying to captivate the audience as the 2001 Oscar Winner did. All the actors involved did a fairly good job, and considering the exaggerated tone the director chose to follow, a bit of over-acting here and there is almost expected. I wouldn't recommend it for the drastic decrease of excitement and visual stimulation, but it deserves being mentioned for loudly bringing back the experience of the 1920s era."
"shutupburuinit","6","1","3","28 June 2013"," Underwhelming Great Gatsby
","The excellent cast, stunning visuals & a brilliant but missed opportunity for somber social commentary combined are not enough to save save the much anticipated Great Gatsby from being anything more than mediocre. The screenplay itself lacked substance something that Fitzgerald's iconic and intricately detailed first hand accounts of the notorious excesses of the day did not. It is a shame that too many people submitting reviews obviously have never read The Great Gatsby, much less anything by Fitzgerald. Luhrman's shallow adaptation is not a creative expression of the period that parallels exactly what we are as a society again. The lack of depth mostly squanders the talents of the superb cast (the one exception being Toby McGuire). This is a movie with such tremendous possibility that what was done well is hopelessly overshadowed by all that it overlooked."
"Turfseer","5","1","3","23 June 2013"," Gaudy production values can't save Luhrmann's latest due to Fitzgerald's weak source material
","Most of the critical reviews of Baz Luhrmann's new take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, 'The Great Gatsby', focus on its over the top production values. Here are a few samples of the type of criticism I am referring to: ""a near-constant bombardment of visual over stimulation,"" ""mostly a cacophony of style, excess and noise that makes you want to turn it all down a notch,"" ""anachronistic convergence of hip-hop and swing,"" ""all look and no feel,"" ""hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment,"" ""baroque, overblown, megalomaniacal spectacles,"" (with Luhrmann) ""less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste."" <br/><br/>Aside from the hip-hop and unnecessary use of 3-D, Luhrmann's penchant for overindulgence didn't really bother me. In fact, one of the titles Fitzgerald came up with before settling on 'Gatsby', was ""Trimalchio in West Egg""—referencing the obnoxious, ancient Roman 'noveau riche' businessman in Petronius' 'Satyricon', known for his wild orgy-like feasts. I'm not sure at all whether Fitzgerald would have actually objected to all those over-the-top, gaudy spectacles, Luhrmann proffers up here in his take on the 1920s 'jazz age'.<br/><br/>Getting back to the critical reviews, only Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times actually has the temerity to suggest that Fitzgerald's source material is no masterpiece: ""Though it is gorgeously written and often cited as one of the great American novels, Fitzgerald's ""Gatsby"" is in fact very much a slender reed, a tragedy in a minor key."" I would go further and argue that Fitzgerald's main character is not fleshed out at all and woefully unconvincing. Hence, no matter how Luhrmann 'jazzes' up 'Gatsby' (whether successful or not), Fitzgerald's source material will leave any film director handicapped from the get-go, in attempting to successfully adapt the novel from page to screen.<br/><br/>The Gatsby slow-moving introduction appears intentional, as the mystery behind the elusive tycoon, is built up. Again, the gaudy production values (the costumes, the old cars, the set designs) are enough to keep one settled, until the story really begins to pick up. One notes that Nick Carraway, an ordinary 'Joe', plays the part of the protagonist's only true ally. Carraway, the film's narrator, appears to be a stand in for Fitzgerald himself.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Gatsby is introduced to Carraway, his social inferior, and then takes him on a tour of 'his world' the next day, setting out in his Yellow Duesenberg (let's not be too upset that this is a 1929 Duesenberg, and the scene takes place in 1922!). Gatsby of course has an ulterior motive: he hopes that Carraway, will help him reunite with his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Carraway's cousin! <br/><br/>The problem with all this is Gatsby's character. Can you really believe any of it? It's obvious that Fitzgerald, through Carraway, creates an idealized picture of a ruthless gangster, who just happens to go goo-goo eyes over a woman he fell for, five years earlier, before his 'trial by fire', as a confirmed bootlegger . You would think a gangster like Gatsby would have modeled himself on a realistic character like Tony Soprano, who never had any compunctions about going from one woman to another, disposing of them at his whim, in rapid succession. But no, Gatsby is such a noble, mushy guy, that he pines for Daisy (a complete airhead who we learn nothing about) and will even take the heat, when Daisy is on the hook for vehicular manslaughter (at film's end).<br/><br/>Another convenient strategy is for Fitzgerald (again through Carraway's perspective), to ignore Gatsby's dark side by failing to show us any of Gatsby's malevolent behaviors in the bootlegger's world, which allowed him to accumulate all his money, and rise to the top. What's more, Tom Buchannan, the antagonist we must compare to the 'noble' Gatsby, is a flat-out cartoon racist who is constantly mouthing pronouncements about how the white race continually faces annihilation by 'darker peoples.'<br/><br/>Fitzgerald wants us to feel bad about Gatsby when Carraway informs us that no one who attended his extravagant parties, shows up for his funeral. Why in fact should we feel sorry for Gatsby? If in fact, he resembled a fleshed out, real person, then I could have easily felt some sympathy. But the truth of the matter is that Gatsby exists only in F. Scott Fitzgerald's imagination. There is no attempt to create a real-life person here and isn't that what 'art' should be about?<br/><br/>For those who say 'Gatsby' is purely a fable, I say a good fable should reflect 'reality'. Despite being a master of descriptive phraseology, Fitzgerald's characters are the stuff of cheap melodrama: a 'softy' sociopath with a heart of gold. Don't feel sorry for Gatsby as Nick Carraway does at film's end—and don't put him on pedestal. Break out some of your old Soprano DVDs—if you want a true portrait, of a REAL gangster!"

"classicalsteve","8","1","3","1 June 2013"," Strong DiCaprio and Supporting Performances of Good Adaption Marred by Horrid Musical Soundtrack
","If there is one glaring problem of this otherwise very good adaption of Fitzgerald's most famous novel, the post-production music soundtrack editors are the guilty party. For about the first half of the film, the party scenes which provide the backdrop to this story of the Lost Generation and moneyed inequity during 1920's New York is inundated with super sounds of the 21st century, replete with Rap and Hip-Pop. It's as if the filmmakers were afraid that using music from the era, called the Roaring 20's and the Jazz Age for obvious reasons, wouldn't be ""intense"" enough for modern audiences. <br/><br/>The music from this era, which saw the rise of Jazz from its beginnings in New Orleans and into white culture, is some of the most intense party music ever written and recorded. Instead the filmmakers balked and settled on music which would have never existed in the post World War I era. Duke Ellington, Paul Whiteman, Fletcher Henderson and the immortal Louis Armstrong could bellow on acoustic instruments probably with bigger and more robust sounds than any generic hip-pop musician of today. The sounds accompanying the popping of champagne bottles will be forever fused together. Fitzgerald even wrote a book called ""Tales of the Jazz Age"" not ""Tales of the Hip-Pop Age"".<br/><br/>That being said, aside from the questionable music choices, the film is a reasonably good adaption of a story which is nearly un-filmable but has become the 20th-century American novel by which all others are judged. The stand out is without question Leonardo DiCaprio who almost single-handedly saves the entire project. In fact it may be the best DiCaprio performance to date, possibly worthy of an acting nomination. The rest of the cast is strong as well particularly Tobey Maguire as the straight man Nick Carraway.<br/><br/>The movie begins almost like a music video with lots of quick cuts and slow-mo's to the rap and hip-pop which doesn't fit very well with the era it is trying to portray. However, about a third way through, the acting begins to hit its stride and the silly pop music finally starts to wain. Although the story references the crazy parties of the era, it's not about the parties per se, but about the strange love triangle between Daisy Buchanan and her two loves, Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan.<br/><br/>Jay Gatsby is the ""new money"" on the block who holds lavish parties where all the elites of New York come to West Egg to douse themselves with champagne (currently illegal, but what the hell), splash around in swimming pools and throw tinsel in the air for reasons not completely explained except possibly to see if it sticks on the many statues on Gatsby's estate. In this film, Gatby's house rings of an Italian manor house a la the Renaissance which might make a member of the Medicis take notice. The narrator is Nick Carraway, living in a humbler house near Gatsby's servants' entrance, who watches but does not participate actively in the events which follow. The Eyes of Dr Eckleburg, like the eyes of God, are there on a poster in the Valley of Ashes, the industrial and working class area between New York City and the suburbs of East and West Egg. The story concerns how ""Nouveau Riche"" Gatsby plans to court his former lover, Daisy Buchanan from the clutches of the Old Money, Tom Buchanan, who is probably worth the equivalent of about 9 Windsors.<br/><br/>Despite a number of reservations, such as the music soundtrack, the strange book ends with Carraway telling his story to a psychiatrist at some kind of half-way house (in the book he is disappointed but not mentally disturbed), and the character of Jordan significantly reduced, the adaption is reasonably good. And the performance by DiCaprio as the anxious ladder-climber who wants desperately to fit into the world of elite money, is outstanding. DiCaprio finds the delicate balance between friendliness, phoniness, and ultimate anxiety which is what makes Gatsby one of the quintessential tragic heroes of American literature. His may be the best portrayal of Gatsby ever on screen thus far. Carey Mulligan also makes a fine Daisy, who is not a bad person but only rather flighty and longing for love and fun. A recommended viewing."

","My wife and I both just saw The Great Gastby - and we both were not all that impressed with it, even though she is a Leonardo DiCaprio fan.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT - Mild spoiler anyway The problem with the film is that while it is done as a period piece, and there are some wonderful sets, the film has an almost surreal quality about it. To be fair, it has been a long time since I read The Great Gatsby, so I cannot comment on how well the movie follows the original book. I am not sure if the book was intended as a surreal picture of the Roaring 20's or not. Nonetheless, the surreal quality of the film kills a lot of the believability/buy-in factor for the audience.<br/><br/>Also, as much as I like Mr. DeCaprio( and the film has gone through about 45 minutes of its length before he shows up, I felt I was once again watching either J. Edgar or The Aviator. It is almost as if Mr. DiCaprio is now pigeon holed into a particular role type - strong yet misfit individuals. Certainly this would mirror his role in Titanic.<br/><br/>Other than the role of Carroway, played by Tobey Maguire and really serves as the movie's main character since it is told through his eyes, the rest of the actors are unknown to US audiences. This is not altogether bad - certainly the actress playing Daisy, Carey Mulligan, did a fine job in her role. The thing is, the characters are meant to be shallow/two-dimensional, so really the performances don't need to be particularly deep or emotional.<br/><br/>So, really, the film doesn't get the audience to feel comfortable in its world because of the surreal quality. To me anyway, this kills a lot of the enjoyment aspect of it - it is almost as if the movie had a fairy tale/morality quality about it. Again, I am not sure if it was the intention of Fitzgerald's book to be this way - but it didn't play well to me, and hence my low rating of it."

Instead of starting off on an intimate note and then building up to a climactic conclusion, the movie opens with a man in a mental hospital trying to tell a story and then cutting to scenes of seemingly nonstop raucous partying, throwing at the audience an almost endless barrage of noise which completely distracts from the narrator's attempt to engage the audience and causes one to ask: ""When will this stop?"" This mistake is magnified by the injection of hip-hop music which not only is inconsistent with the historical period of the story, the 1920s, but which is completely discordant for a character like Gatsby, for whom trumpets and flourishes befitting royalty would have been far more appropriate. In short, the movie uses the wrong kind of music as a build up to Gatsby's entrance, which not unexpectedly falls flat. Yet, the movie recovers. This movie is about the flaunting of wealth and the emptiness of life in a society in which materialism is worshiped as a god. This theme is driven home through the character of J. Gatsby. Gatsby, who was born poor, believes that his self-worth is based upon the amount of wealth that he can accumulate, and that without wealth, he is not worthy of love. Yet, Gatsby is no mere caricature of a rich man wallowing in wealth; just the opposite is the case. Personally, he is handsome, debonair, charming, intelligent, cheerful, friendly, supportive, generous, and courageous. But it is all a façade concealing a checkered past. Taking his cues from a culture which places materialism and accumulation above all else, he too must accumulate his money and things and engage in ostentatious displays of wealth, not for his personal enjoyment, for he is fundamentally indifferent to all his props, but to show that he is somebody of worth. ""Judge me not by who I am but by what I have."" As a result, his life is empty, all by his own doing. When Gatsby is confronted with the fact of his own deceitfulness, he falls apart, and that is his undoing. From that moment he starts spiraling downward to his doom. Gatsby cannot accept the fact that all that he has acquired means nothing, because if his wealth means nothing, then he is nothing. The first half-hour or so of this movie excepted, this movie is an excellent drama featuring strong and evocative performances, led by Leonardo Di Caprio, who, once again, proves that he is one of the premier principal actors in Hollywood today. Carey Mulligan is also outstanding as Daisy, who is Gatsby's love interest. However, the strongest performance is that of Joel Edgerton's, which attains a level of power worthy of an Academy Award nomination. All in all, this movie is a credible interpretation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel and should be watched by all who value high quality drama and movies."

","I loved the book as did everyone else, but as the age old advice heeds, ""see this movie with an open mind."" Well I did, and I can say that I am not so disappointed, it is okay, but just okay.<br/><br/>From the start it was hard to divorce the voice of the Nick Carraway from the nasal interpreter found in Tobey Maguire. I never imagined Nick Carraway as annoying, but Tobey Maguire certainly did inspire my want to reach into the screen and slap him for making the character into such a sullied bore. Though the opening sequences were okay enough, it was really the original work shining through the cracks that made this film entertaining. Sure the shots were beautiful, the CGI Mansion was large, and the parties at West Egg looked interesting, but this new film adaption made me wanting for something new, the exact feeling I had after watching Robert Redford's attempt.<br/><br/>Of course, Gatsby was like Titanic; you knew the ship was going into the drink, but DiCaprio had a harder challenge with Gatsby, because everyone knew what and who Gatsby was - unlike Jack Dawson. Perhaps that was Maguire's problem, being that he had such huge shoes to fill, frankly he was a very bad choice as this lead character. Maguire's attempt came off as yet another high school rendition of Shakespeare's best without the spider-man tights.<br/><br/>All of this is not to say that this film wasn't entertaining. In fact, as the credits began to roll the audience was captivated at its end. As the silence crept into peoples' awareness, that in fact, the movie had indeed ended, I wondered whether it was the book's echoed emotion that had gripped the movie-goers so much or this film. I did conclude rightly, that it was Fitzgerald's words that had stunned the theater, and not Baz Luhrmann. You can put a pig in a dress and apply lipstick, but you know it's just a pig. On the other hand, the strong base of this novel can give wings to any interpretation, good or just okay, and that is what this film is – another okay interpretation of a storied and favorite book (a modern book that does not age, unlike the modern film that gets dated and old). Ten stars for Fitzgerald, five stars for effort, and those stars all go to DiCaprio alone because Jay Gatsby came alive in DiCaprio's eyes, where Redford's didn't."
"westpenn49","10","1","3","19 May 2013"," Fantastic but only if you love Fitzgerald AND Luhrman
","Over the top-yes, reminiscent of Moulin Rouge, of course. Faithful to the book, yes to the extent I remember it and in all important details. Flawed, I don't really think so.<br/><br/>One cannot talk about this movie without deciding first of all if Baz Luhrmann's over the top style is appropriate. For the essence of the Roaring Twenties I think he was the perfect choice to direct. For the musical score i thought the hip hop rap techno captured the excess quite nicely even if it took a moment to orient myself to the music.<br/><br/>As in Moulin Rouge with Paris Luhrmann doesn't even come close to giving anything but a comic book view of New York City but what a comic book it was. But nothing of that matters as the real star of the show is the enigmatic Gatsby perfectly delivered by Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>For me it all worked the final scenes played as my memory said they should. When the credits rolled it was time to just sit in awe. Greatness at the price of a Sunday matinée."
"wl-casper","8","1","3","19 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby Review
","The bad reviews this film has received is surprising but everyone to their own I suppose. I thought the first 40 minutes was a bit messy and jumped from one thing to the next and the constant playing of Jay-Z was kind of annoying but once it settled down and got into the story I really enjoyed it. The cinematography is brilliant and the script is fairly close to the book which I also liked. <br/><br/>As for the acting, Leonardo Di Caprio is immense in this film. He really does the part of Jay Gatsby justice. Baz Luhrman couldn't have picked a better person to play Gatsby. One thing I had a problem about before seeing the film was the fact that Tobey Maguire was playing Nick but this was the first film I have watched him in where he didn't make me want to pull my eyes out from cringing. There is some parts where he just stands there with that blank expression on his face but overall I think he did a good job. Other actors worth mentioning are Joel Edgerton and Elizabeth Debicki who both bring the characters of Tom and Jordan to life despite Jordan only having a few lines. I would be surprised if Joel E doesn't get a lot more roles now after this film. Carey Mulligan does her best as the selfish and naive Daisy.<br/><br/>I'm not going to into specifics but I'll just say for anyone who has read the book you'll enjoy the film. As for anyone who hasn't read the book it is a brilliant story and I think this film does it justice."
"jgriggs1403","7","1","3","17 May 2013"," BOLD, BRASH, Invigorating!!
","Once again we have an adaptation of a novel. A classic American novel that many have read and come to adore. Like a lot of books to films you will always get those who are disappointed with the transformation.<br/><br/>Fitzgerald's novel the great Gatsby has been considered among the greats. A book that captures the booming 20's with the lavish culture of alcohol and parties. With the rise of the black jazz culture the book captures the increasing diversification of the US. This of course the back drop of the book, in the foreground however, a torturous love story of one mans dream to attain the love of an old flame. With a life populated by parties with unknown individuals , the enigmatic, 'invisible' man hides behind the facade of opulence and decadence, which cannot begin to Penetrate the heart of Jay Gatsby. This love story is forever frustrating and painful with a difficult, devastating climax.<br/><br/>However I find that adaptations have the difficult task of appealing to the big screen as well as satisfying the readers. Most films struggle to achieve this. The Great Gatsby is also one of these films. However I believe it's bold version with its modern twist of jazz- hip hop infusion and toy town CGI backdrop looks to distant itself from the novel entirely. Whether this is a good move or not , you cannot deny that it's creates a whole new experience. It's merges the 21st century with the early 20th. Notwithstanding Clichéd romance in places, with a little too much symbolism in also, it is a clever and stylish approach to a novel most youngest haven't read. <br/><br/>A booming, brash film which doesn't tickle the heart or mind but does attract the eye."

"karly-seveneleven","10","1","3","15 May 2013"," Flawless! Nobody could have done it better than Baz!
","This movie is beyond perfect! Baz Luhrmann is not only a genius but his skills totally made this movie what it is. Tobey was born to play Nick, Joel was amazing and Daisey, Jordan and Myrtle had phenomenal accents. Leonardo DiCaprio was not only sexy but a perfect Gatsby. The modern day music made me fall in love with the film and relate to it. The 3D made you feel a part of the film.It was funny, tragic and happy. I loved how you could see a little bit of Jack Dawson, Arnie Grape, Howard Hughes and Shutter Island in DiCaprio's performance. There could not have been a better cast or director. I have already seen it 3 times in 3 days. This is my new favorite movie and it will be on the charts for a long time."
"mm-39","6","1","3","15 May 2013"," Probably a better book than a movie.
","Probably a better book than a movie. Watching Gatsby reminds me of a few English Literature book's I read then I watched the movie. Good book, but the translation turns flat as a movie. Gatsby is not a bad movie, but not a good movie either. The movie is well directed, acted, and has a strong cast. Gatsby's themes of owning everything, but not having what you really want. Reaching to far. Chasing after a women who's in it for her self. Who are your real friends? Living an empty life. Great themes which any English major would study. However, Gatsby is about a man who pushed self promotion. Like all loud, and attention oriented personalities people eventually grow tired of the noise. I found Gatsby a bit long. Gatsby is a six out of ten stars. Net flick it."

"Xarnis","8","1","3","14 May 2013"," Much better than expected
","""I'm Gatsby""<br/><br/>I went into this film with significantly lowered expectations, based on critic reviews and early response and I must say: Gatsby surprised me. Luhrman's previous films have been hit or miss with me - I liked Moulin Rouge and hated Romeo + Juliet – but this is certainly his best yet. Despite some flaws, I enjoyed my time watching The Great Gatsby. Its impressive, kinetic visuals; great acting; and excellent story manage to propel it past silly voice-over and some empty characters.<br/><br/>Baz Luhrman's style is truly unique, and I can say I've never seen a film that's quite like The Great Gatsby. The lavish parties are incredibly energetic and fun to watch, despite some wonky editing. The sets and costumes are equally stylish and manage to add some personality to the classic tale from F. Scott Fitzgerald. Said story is excellent in this film translation and it's quite faithful to the book. It is a story of hope, tragedy, emptiness, and decadence and these themes make the transfer to film well. Unfortunately, Luhrman uses voice-over from Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) to explain these themes instead of giving the viewer the pleasure of dissecting them.<br/><br/>That being said, Maguire and the rest of the cast do very good in their roles. DiCaprio and Joel Edgerton are the standouts, with Elizabeth Debicki also delivering an impressive sophomore performance. Maguire is good, but he doesn't add anything special to his character, and Carey Mulligan was the weakest of the cast. She has moments of greatness, but those moments are eclipsed by her spurts of sub-par line delivery.<br/><br/>I'm a lover of Fitzgerald's book, and re-reading it this past week may have given me a bit of bias going into this film. Reading the book just before the film helped me feel connected to the characters. While there are obvious development issues, it was easy for me to overlook them, given the fact I had read the story of these characters only days earlier. I enjoyed watching The Great Gatsby, probably more than most people. Luhrman's was a good choice to bring this ageless tale to the screen, and I'm sure if it was anyone else it would not have been as good. The acting, the style, and the story combine to form a very good film, which could have been better, if it was given a little more thought."
"emblake95","8","1","3","14 May 2013"," I discuss the way the film was good and the way it wasn't that good in this review. I also discuss the movie and the way the film is portrayed just like the book.
","The film is set in West Egg, New York and East Egg, New York during the ""Roaring 20's"". Some of the main characters were, Jay Gastby played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Nick Carroway played by Tobey Maguire and Daisy Buchanan played by Carey Mulligan to name a few. The type of film I would categorize this movie under the genres of a Drama and a Romance. The film starts off with Nick Carroway in a doctor's office explaining his life with the time he spent with Gatsby and he narrates the whole film just like in the book. The film then goes on to Nick's life and how he ends up meeting Gatsby. He gets the only invitation Gatsby has ever handed out brought to his home and Nick attends the party. Gatsby throws extravagant parties and Nick is very overwhelmed at the first one he attends. After Nick meets Gatsby they go on wild adventures and they do things together all to get Daisy to meet Gatsby again and bring them back together. Gatsby meets Daisy again and they rekindle the love they used to share before Daisy got married 5 years ago. The love affair only lasts a few months and you will have to see what Gatsby does at the end of the film to figure out what happens between everyone in the film. The film was portrayed just like the book and it is very helpful if you read the book before seeing the movie because it makes understanding everything that much easier. But I asked some people in the audience if they have read the book before and most said no. They seemed to have liked it a lot more not knowing what was coming in the end of the film. The only problem I had with how the movie was portrayed was with the use of special effects and the use of slowing down modern pop songs and making them sound like something from the 1920's. To me it lessened the effect of how the movie should have been thought of. The special effects were kind of weird in the movie because the way everything looks in the film looks real but you can tell the actors are standing in front of a green screen. I enjoyed everything about the film besides the music and special effects, other than those problems the film was done very well by the director Baz Luhrmann and screenplay writer Craig Pearce. The actors they chose really fit their parts also and it made the film much more enjoyable to watch. They all seemed to be in the 1920's and the fit in to the time they were set to be in. Overall the film was a great one and if you are someone who likes to read and have read this book you will most likely be satisfied with the way the film was made."
"rbursell","7","1","3","13 May 2013"," Very Good Movie
","I don't usually write reviews, but because of all the bashing this movie has gotten, I thought it would be a fresh perspective. I didn't study the book in school, but I did listen to the audiobook a couple of days before I saw the movie. The movie follows the story very well. Some have said that you don't feel for the characters in the movie. While I didn't cry or anything, I was touched by Gatsby's desperation to relive the past through his obsession with Daisy. Nick's character was well demonstrated. I thought McGuire did a great job. How his naivety was crushed and his admiration for Gatsby and his idyllic dream. Daisy was flighty and shallow, as she should have been. Captivating made be too strong a word for it, but I did get some sense of her allure in the movie. Although, the book does a better job of this. I liked the book, but found it a bit short. The movie flew by, which is always good. As others have said, the cinematic part of the movie is terrific and while the music is a bit odd, for the most part it worked."
"bobbiepotter","7","1","3","13 May 2013"," Leonardo DiCaprio was great at playing Gatsby
","Loved Mr.DiCaprio as Gatsby! The portrayal of Jay Gatsby was so genuine and could you feel the intensity of his affection and love for Daisy. Mr. DiCaprio made the move for me. And Carey Mulligan as Daisy was so much better that Mia Farrow's portrayal of Daisy. I also like the way I felt like I was looking from the outside in on these people's whose lives which seemed to be chasing happens but not really reaching it. <br/><br/>Although, I really dislike the music. Wished it could have brought more of the essence of the roaring 20s. <br/><br/>All in all I absolutely liked the movie and felt it was much better than the earlier versions."
"the_mysteriousx","10","1","3","12 May 2013"," In the words of Rodney Dangerfield, ""The Great Gatsby"" was...well...Great!
","Like many of Baz Luhrman's films, THE GREAT GATSBY has received extremely mixed reviews from the professional critics. Based on its' box office this opening weekend, though, thankfully audiences are going to decide for themselves.<br/><br/>It has all the cards to be a Hollywood flop, but I'm very glad it isn't that. First of all, this is a great and classic American story. The novel, which I haven't read for many years, still sticks in my brain as observant, detailed and tragic. It also was subtle, something that Luhrman can never be accused of. Combine that with the fact that no movies can ever truly transfer the artistic experience of a written book, and you have to go into this film expecting something truly cinematic.<br/><br/>This is a story of love and the inability to go back to happier times or any time for that matter. Some have complained that themes are beaten over the viewers' heads such as the green light at the Buchanan home, which is certainly true. Likewise there are themes that are naturally less explicit and pushed to the side that Luhrman retains, namely the class system in the United States. A poor man can never truly become a rich man. This is part of the mystique of America and really a false promise. It comes out in the end, when only his fellow mid-westerner, Carraway, honors Gatsby's memory. Carraway in a way gets to live vicariously through Gatsby, his equal, who built a name and money all in the name of love. Gatsby achieved the American dream, yet never was satisfied. I think this is part of the long-lasting power of the novel.<br/><br/>In terms of filmmaking, the film is completely successful. The music score by Jay-Z is often a counter-point to what is felt behind Gatsby. The camera moves constantly and restlessly as the roaring twenties. Luhrman goes over-the-top with set design and costumes to show the extravagance of the era. The 1920s could never really be that exciting, but again Luhrman as a director is a good choice with his style since the character of Nick Carraway is our subjective guide in this story and he is swept up and overwhelmed by the lifestyle of the mega-rich. And the parties are awesome! The parties are so lavish, and while not for the reasons they may seem there is an emotional force behind the emptiness on the surface.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good too. DiCaprio is the top winner in this category. It was nice to see him play a character who makes a bit of fool of himself and has some real anxiety as well. His character is well-groomed and seems to be acting in a way he believes the rich should act. None of the other characters have quite the depth, but they play their range well. Edgerton is rough, but still seems human. Mulligan is very good as Daisy Buchanan, the object of Gatsby's love. She seems a little forgotten at the very end, but she comes across as honorable and realistic in her love for Gatsby and her previous love for Tom Buchanan. Elizabeth Debicki is simply gorgeous as Jordan. She warms up her icy character as she gets to know Carraway, and does a great job of turning her back on him in her last shot - greatly symbolic of her turning her back on Carraway's sense of emotion and honor in favor of her rich lifestyle. Lastly, Tobey Maguire is solid as Nick Carraway. He doesn't have huge range as an actor, but is always identifiable for the audience and definitely seems like someone who would be curious, observing and loyal to Gatsby. <br/><br/>In summary, this is not the 1925 novel. Some have complained about changes from the book and the choices of what was included/not included. In 2013, 9 decades after the story takes place, Baz Luhrman gives this his unique new vision and makes it incredibly cinematic. If you want the subtle story of 1925, you certainly should read the justifiably legendary book. The films will always be subservient to the book, but Luhrman's film is incredibly bold and tragic. You can't go back and live in the past and love cannot be acquired through climbing up America's social ladder."

","The Great Gatsby (2013) This is a drama and ""romance"" film base in the famous novel of Scott Fitzgerald from 1925 and is the 5th film adaptation. (BTW this is my first disappointment of the year when it comes to movies I was waiting). This is about the obsession of a millionaire man (Gatsby) with a married woman (Daisy) that he meet long time ago. The film is too long for nothing, it has a poor super poor screenplay, the conversations are so silly and repetitive that is boring, the only part I can say I still remember about the screenplay is when they said ""big parties are more private than the small ones"" but you don't see the growing love between characters at all, they just ""feel"" somehow. When you see the trailer you are expecting something flawless but unfortunately it's too much sometimes, I feel no sense of ""class or style"" in the direction because we lose so much in all this close ups and up and down shoots but at the same time it was full of beauty thanks to all the beautiful cloth and great fashion style, the music was PERFECT but you are in two different worlds almost every time a song was played. The first 25 minutes of performances was too melodramatic something is not that good because it doesn't feel real at all, but after Leonardo DiCaprio appear suddenly everyone start acting normal and really GOOD, when it comes to acting he was the great about ""the great Gatsby"", also I'm really please with Tobey Maguire because he did a pretty good job. The movie is average at least and that is because of the great cast and the great costumes but not more. <br/><br/>More info: www.facebook.com/ElementaryTips"
"zpconn-1","7","1","3","11 May 2013"," An overly energetic but still competent adaptation
","As long as you go into this film accepting that it is not even remotely accurate as a period piece, this is a competent if overly energetic adaptation of the novel. The main themes are preserved and in fact laid quite bare before the audience, moreso than in the Robert Redford adaptation. This film in particular succeeds in painting Gatsby as a tragic figure, a victim of careless riches (not his own riches, but that of others, in particular Daisy and Tom), which of course was the intent of Fitzgerald. The notion of hope that defines Gatsby for our narrator and guides Nick is also clarified in the film, and it is tied effectively with the tragic ending. One theme, though, which is not touched at all is that of the midwestern values vs. the northern NYC values. The film does emphasize that Nick is both within and without Wall Street, but it doesn't clarify Fitzgerald's intent to portray most of the characters as misplaced and transplanted Midwesterners.<br/><br/>That said, the film falters in its own energy. Jordan, Nick's semi-love interest, is not given nearly enough attention despite the fact that Elizabeth Debicki steals every scene she's in with her surly and tall figure. The ending also felt rushed; we never met Gatsby's father, nor did the film take much time to meditate on just how careless Tom and Daisy really were. This was mentioned in passing at the film's conclusion, but if you've read the novel or seen the older adaptation you'll remember that the story makes a point to illustrate how carelessly they've moved on with their lives, how little it matters to Daisy that Gatsby took the fall for her. George Wilson, the struggling and poor mechanic in the Valley of Ashes, is also pushed to the sidelines until the climactic scene--his character and misery should have been sketched in slightly more detail.<br/><br/>Instead of bringing out these various aspects of the story in greater detail and liveliness, the film instead chooses to puff up its beginning with one too many party scenes. Dazzling though they may be, the screen time they took up could have been more wisely spent.<br/><br/>A good film, to be sure, but not all its decisions were wise ones."
"dspman11","8","1","3","11 May 2013"," The ""Okay"" Gatsby (I will warn when spoilers come about)
","I've given this a 10 out of 10 because on this website, in order to change the overall rating in any way you either give it a 1 out of 10 if you didn't like it or a 10 out of 10 if you did like it. And I liked it. But it was not a perfect film.<br/><br/>First off, I could tell right from the beginning of this film that it would divide Gatsby fans. Baz Luhrmann's direction and the overall cinematography of this film was...strange. Similar to his ""Romeo + Juliet"" remake, which to be honest, I kind of liked. <br/><br/>(Semi-spoiler alert, but, it's in the first 30 seconds of the film)<br/><br/>Baz depicts Nick Carraway as an alcoholic and insomniac, after the events of the Great Gatsby. The premise as to why Nick is telling the story of Gatsby is that he is in a session with a therapist or some kind of doctor, and he is venting. The doctor eventually suggests he writes this story down, and he does. <br/><br/>A lot of people did not like this idea, but I loved it. I thought it was extremely creative of Luhrmann to make his own spin as to how his interactions with Gatsby and the rest changed him forever. It was also a creative way to introduce exactly why we were hearing the story in the first place.<br/><br/>(no more spoilers for now)<br/><br/>I'd like to say Baz Luhrmann followed the book pretty damn closely. I wasn't sure if I liked the film during its first half. It seemed jumpy, and very...big. Every moment, every one of Gatsby's (and Buchanan's, actually) parties seemed so big. Everything was done so big the big moments didn't seem to feel as big as they should have.<br/><br/>A big reason I didn't like the film was the soundtrack. Florence + The Machine works for Gatsby. Jay-Z doesn't. It's an awkward pairing, Gatsby and hip-hop. It didn't work for me. And it took away from some moments, ESPECIALLY...<br/><br/>(alright spoiler alert again)<br/><br/>...Myrtle's death, which I might add, was done extremely poorly. Her body was also catapulted at least 30 feet in the air. I don't know what song played during her death, but it ruined it. Also, the overall scene was just shot poorly. If you hadn't read the book, you'd probably have not the faintest clue what was happening. <br/><br/>(no more spoilers again)<br/><br/>Let's talk about the acting. I have a beef with Leonardo DiCaprio. He seems to always play himself. He doesn't seem to have much of a range. Even in J. Edgar, I said to myself, ""That's DiCaprio with a light accent and grey hair."" He didn't look, talk, or act like Hoover. He generally looks, talks, and acts like himself. Luckily for DiCaprio, he has fantastic stage presence, so he gets credit for being the actor he is. I was disappointed when I liked his portrayal of Gatsby, because Gatsby isn't a reach for DiCaprio. It's another opportunity for Leo to play himself and get commended for it. He should get commended for it. He was a great Gatsby (no pun intended). But he didn't really have to struggle to obtain that look, that talk, etc. He plays himself again, but he does it really well.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire is another actor I've never been too fond of. I can't think of another movie that I thought he acted well in besides Pleasentville. Don't bring up Spider-Man, especially the third one. But I thought he was a very good choice to play Nick. He did a very good job, I was pleased.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton is a guy not enough people know, and I feel that his name was just overshadowed by Leonardo and Toby. He did a phenomenal job as Buchanan. He portrayed Tom exactly how I think he should have been portrayed. <br/><br/>Carey Mulligan...was very good. But I have trouble with Luhrmann's characterization of Daisy. If you read the book, Daisy is supposed to be, for lack of a better term, a ""fake bitch"". She leads Gatsby on but really just crawls back to Tom. You really don't like her, and then you feel bad for Gatsby. In Luhrmann's film, you think of Gatsby as a moron for waiting for Daisy, and you feel sorry for Daisy instead. This probably isn't Mulligan's fault, but Luhrmann's instead.<br/><br/>(massive spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Holy crap, Gatsby's death was done so well. Even as a reader of the novel, who was expecting it, they made the gunshot so unexpected, everyone in the theater jumped. People around me were crying. No matter how many gripes I had with the film, the last 15 minutes of the film were AMAZING. His death, his ""funeral"", the last couple of lines from Nick. It was all stunning cinema.<br/><br/>OVERALL, I'm giving this a 7 out of 10. Much better than the Robert Redford version, followed the book fairly closely, and the last 15 minutes of the film are able to make up for whatever flaws you found in the middle (minus that one scene that I mentioned earlier. That scene still sucks and it still angers me)."

","This movie was good. The way you view it probably has something to do with whether or not you've read the book; I have, and for the most part it followed the book well.

Carey mulligan was alright, and I found Nick Carraway to be perfectly casted (Tobey Maguire).<br/><br/>The soundtrack was pretty bad. The rap music just...didn't fit. I know what they were trying to do, create a party atmosphere and what not, but it Didn't work.<br/><br/>Some parts were a little overdone, but strangely, I actually didn't mind that. It was kind of nice; I really don't know why but some of the melodrama seemed okay, and I usually despise melodrama.<br/><br/>TL;DR -- Leo's not getting an Oscar this time either. F Scott Fitzgerald would probably be mildly proud. The rap sucks."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","10","7 June 2013"," Surprisingly really liked it
","It's no secret that while I always wanted this film to be good, I never had high expectations. Those expectations were lowered with each new trailer, each new released clip, because it seemed totally opposite from what Fitzgerald intended in the novel. The film was pretty much what I expected in its complete theatricality, but what I didn't expect was to like it as much as I did. <br/><br/>I don't think this is a great adaptation of the novel, or even a great film, but it sure is a highly entertaining one. As shallow as the film looked in the trailers, I thought it would all only work on the surface but have no actual understanding of the novel. Despite the style and it being as subtle as a hammer to the head, it doesn't completely feel misguided in its execution. That's because the novel's criticism of this same style the film has can be seen as some sort of underlying satire or even parody when it comes to the more over-the-top scenes. Whatever it is, it kinda works. The only other Baz film I've ever seen is Moulin Rouge and I thought that film lost a lot of steam as it went on, even though it does calm down. This one does too, but the source material is so much more interesting that I can't imagine someone making it completely boring. Quite a few scenes are ridiculous in their overbearingness, but they still manage to be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>A huge reason why this works is because of the cast, and I actually didn't have a big problem with any of them. Maguire is the biggest mixed result here, but even then I expected him to be awful so I was pleasantly surprised. I also expected Dicaprio to completely butcher this character by the clips and trailers I'd seen, and that's the biggest surprise here. He gives Gatsby a lot of the original intrigue that carries us through the novel, and his presence always remains grounded, sometimes even contrary to how the film is. My problem with Dicaprio here, and with him in other films, is his inconsistent accent that does get in the way of his performance, and so many of his ""Old Sport"" deliveries are cringe-worthy. But besides that, I think he did a really good job. The same with Edgerton and Mulligan, both who do the most justice to how I envisioned the characters in the novel. Mulligan's known for playing quietly sophisticated characters with hidden vulnerability, but she subtly gets to the root of Daisy and by the end of it I had the same feelings towards her here that I've always had towards her in the novel- contempt. She does a great job of exposing her for who she really is as the film goes on, but never as obvious as the film around her.<br/><br/>So to everyone's surprise, I quite liked this film. As an adaptation, it's actually worthy because of the acting, and as a stand-alone film it's even more worthy for how entertaining and intriguing it remains, either in spite or because of all of the absurdity on screen."

","F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic tale is brought back to life for a new generation of moviegoers. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is suave, charming and marvelous as the title character. Having played flawed characters in the past such as Howard Hughes (The Aviator, Academy Award nomination), Teddy Daniels (Shutter Island)and Dom Cobb (Inception), DiCaprio brings his own unique style to the mysterious Gatsby that surely should garner him the Oscar he has been denied twice. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire of ""Spider Man"" fame takes the mantel of Nick Carraway, the narrator of the tale. Maguire's performance is done with care as he approaches the role with a haunted feel as he relates the story of how he came to know Gatsby in a sanitarium approximately seven years after the events of the novel. A clever device though by the filmmakers.<br/><br/>The film is shot marvelously as it opens with a shot of Maguire as he looks out the sanitarium window and soon melts into the story's main locale of Long Island, NY. The weaving of the memories and the present time mesh well as Maguire's narration (following the novel's original dialogue with few changes in portions) carries the viewer from each point. Another clever device are the images of the novel's words appear in silhouette as Maguire writes and speaks. <br/><br/>If you really enjoy the classic novel, go see this film and be mesmerized!"

","Scott Fitzgerald is credited with inventing the term ""The Jazz Age"" to describe the 1920s, and is often regarded as the greatest chronicler of that age in fiction. Today the ""Roaring Twenties"" are often regarded as a brief, prosperous, carefree and hedonistic interval between the war- torn 1910s and the economically depressed 1930s, the age of jazz, of cocktails, of flappers and of the Charleston. Like all attempts to summarise a whole decade in a single phrase, however, this can never be more than a half-truth. This was certainly a time of relative prosperity in the United States), but the decade was also haunted by memories of the Great War and its attendant bloodshed and by a sense of foreboding about the future. The era's much-vaunted hedonism can be seen as the reaction of a largely urban, well-to-do minority against the Puritanism of the not-so-silent majority; it was, after all, the decade of Prohibition.<br/><br/>Fitzgerald's best-known novel ""The Great Gatsby"" has been filmed a number of times, but the only other version I have seen (and that many years ago) was that from 1974 with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. I won't set out the plot at any length, partly for reasons of space and partly because it is so well-known. The story takes place during the summer of 1922, in New York and on Long Island, and revolves around the web of relationships between the mysterious, self-made millionaire Jay Gatsby, his friend Nick Carraway, Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan, her aristocratic husband Tom and Tom's mistress Myrtle. Daisy is Gatsby's former girlfriend; the two were at one time very much in love, even though she ended up marrying Buchanan instead. For all his wealth, Gatsby is a melancholy figure, and the reason is partly disillusionment with his opulent lifestyle and partly nostalgia for the time when he and Daisy were in love. His melancholy is heightened by his realisation that Daisy's marriage has been a failure and that in breaking his heart she has also broken her own. He becomes obsessed with undoing the past and winning her back so they can start again afresh.<br/><br/>Some Americans would claim that theirs is a classless, or at least a meritocratic, society, but Fitzgerald shows that America also has its forms of class distinction, perhaps more subtle than European ones but no less real. Gatsby falsely claims to come from a wealthy Midwestern family; in a society which maintains a sharp old-money/new-money distinction he has no wish to be regarded as a parvenu. Even so, he makes his home in the ""new-money"" enclave of West Egg, the neighbouring village of East Egg being the preserve of traditional ""old-money"" families like the Buchanans. In the film this distinction is also shown in the differences between Gatsby's home and Tom's. Both have huge, luxurious mansions, but Gatsby's is built in an exuberant Victorian Gothic and decorated inside in the Art Deco style, whereas the Buchanan home is built, inside and out, in a chaste American Classical idiom. A third decorative style, Arts-and-Crafts, is used for Nick's modest cottage. <br/><br/>This film confirmed my view that Leonardo DiCaprio, after a rather shaky start to his career during his heart-throb period in the nineties, has matured into a very fine actor. Gatsby is a complex character, glamorous and self-assured on the surface but emotional and vulnerable beneath, and DiCaprio does an excellent job at bringing out both sides of his character. Other impressive performances came from Carey Mulligan as Daisy, confirming the promise she showed in another period drama, ""An Education"", from Tobey Maguire as Nick, showing that there is more to him than ""Spiderman"", and from Joel Edgerton, an actor I had not come across before, as the snobbish, arrogant and bullying Tom. I was less impressed by Isla Fisher's Myrtle, played more as a sluttish flapper than as a working-class housewife. Certainly, Myrtle should be attractive- a man like Tom would not have looked at her had she been plain- but more demure than she is played here. It is an important plot point that her husband George is only just beginning to suspect her infidelity; had she behaved like Fisher does here he would have been wise to her long ago. The Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan also seemed miscast as Meyer Wolfsheim<br/><br/>The film was directed by Baz Luhrmann who has not always been my favourite director; earlier in his career he was responsible for a rather eccentric version of ""Romeo and Juliet"", also starring DiCaprio, and the ghastly ""Moulin Rouge"". He did, however, also make that fine film ""Australia"", essentially a traditional epic Western transferred to the Southern Hemisphere, but ""The Great Gatsby"" must rate as his best effort yet. Like its main character, Fitzgerald's novel has two sides. On the one hand it is a chronicle of excess, a record of New York high society during a particularly flamboyant period; on the other it is an intimate, timeless love-story. Luhrmann clearly understood this dichotomy at the heart of the novel, because both these elements are present in his film. Visually its portrayal of the opulent lifestyles of the ultra-rich and of Gatsby's riotous parties is magnificent. Luhrmann's use of Art Deco styling may be slightly anachronistic in a film set in 1922- the style was more associated with the late twenties and thirties- but it fits in well with the general mood of the film. There is a sharp contrast between these scenes and those set in the ""Valley of Ashes"", the run-down industrial area where Myrtle and George live. Unlike the directors of some visually splendid films, however, Luhrmann never loses sight of the need to tell a human story, and succeeds in conveying the full emotional power of Fitzgerald's great novel. 9/10"

","Leonardo DiCaprio just can't keep himself away from movies like these can he. To many novelists, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is of the most popular of romance drama stories. Nor is it the first time that this particular story has been adapted to the big screen. However, add a dash of DiCaprio and the whole magnitude of the movie changes completely. There's no doubt about it - Leonardo DiCaprio is a very talented actor. It's not only apparent in how he acts in the role he chooses, but also the role he chooses specifically. Each character that he has mostly chosen in the past do not stray far from each other, which displays his watchful eye of what role he can fulfill.<br/><br/>What makes the storytelling unique is that of like most romance dramas where the story consistently revolves around the character of main focus, it is instead told from a third person perspective. The person describing to the audience his view and feelings is Nick Carraway (Tobey Maquire), a man deeply affected by Gatsby. This is a better mean of characterizing Gatsby artistically - so audiences don't have to come up with the description themselves. Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce's writing reflect that not only in creativeness but also in dialog, texturally speaking. Most of the vocabulary is upper class and the words reflect various visuals. The one I didn't understand are the glasses on the billboard - the significance?<br/><br/>For the most part, it is all very good writing - especially by the end where practically everything is explained. The only things that should've been fixed were Maguire's character and a Chicago subplot. It is great that Nick Carraway does most of the explanation to the story but his development as an individual takes a backseat. This may leave some viewers frustrated that the main focus was Gatsby but Carraway received little attention (even though he's not of main focus). Also throughout the movie Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) receives frequent calls from Chicago about SOMETHING. However, that something is never talked about openly - the end doesn't even explain that one. What was the importance of that if it was never elaborated on?<br/><br/>Other than that, everything else is fantastic. Viewers will find the idea of contemporary pop culture music and early 1900s fashion together, will blend nicely during the party scenes. This is one film that is able to defy those rules where putting contemporary music into a film significantly dates it. Here it's the total opposite. It feels timeless. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is beautiful, although I'm not sure why I didn't find it as prevalent in Killer Elite (2011) or Knowing (2009). Craig Armstrong who produced the score did a decent job as well. Since there was also a soundtrack, his music wasn't always around, but when it was heard, his tunes helped with the emotions. They weren't anything that defined the film though.<br/><br/>Lastly, the characters (besides Maguire's) were well performed and as developed. DiCaprio portrays Gatsby with likability, even when he's nervous. Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan is sweet and gives her character the same kind of emotion any girl would if they were in the situation that she was in. But the guy who gave probably the second best performance was Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan. Buchanan has a pompous attitude and business tycoon voice. The man is quite versatile. But, if there's one thing everyone should learn from this tale, is that secret love triangles NEVER work. It is a very difficult connection to keep together.<br/><br/>With an adaptation that'll have English teachers fainting, DiCaprio and the rest of the cast give respectable performances. The visuals are saturated with literary references as is the high quality dialog. Just a few areas in the writing should've either been expanded on or left out completely."

","Despite other bad reviews, I thought that this movie was so well done. Baz Luhrmann is one of my favorite directors in the movie industry. I thought the acting was spot on amazing and so was how the film was edited and put together.<br/><br/>To start off with the acting, I thought it was spectacular. Leonardo DiCaprio(Jay) begins to prove his talent in this movie. Do I think this should be his Oscar-nominated role? No. But I do think that he begins to impress and his acting in The Great Gatsby was nothing short of perfection. Carey Mulligan(Daisy) plays Daisy beautifully. She portrays her as a likable person (until the end) and she makes you want Gatsby & Daisy to get together. Tobey Maguire(Nick) has amazing acting as well. In this movie, you can see he's trying to shed his Spiderman image, but it's still there. Joel Edgerton(Tom) plays a self-centered rich man. He portrays Tom just as he's supposed to be portrayed in the book. Elizabeth Debicki(Jordan)'s character has the most spunk. Out of the whole cast, Debicki's character is definitely the most likable in my opinion. Overall, all of these talented actors were put together to make the movie of The Great Gatsby.<br/><br/>The music choices were hated on a lot. Personally, I loved them. I thought the music had edge instead of being just 1920's Jazz. Yes, Jay Z music was not in the 1920's but that's just the style of Baz Luhrmann's films. Luhrmann's films with edge (Ahem, Romeo & Juliet). The edge that Luhrmann put in The Great Gatsby is the music. Plus there was numerous jazz songs, as well as rap. I'd say the movie had half jazz, half rap.<br/><br/>I rated this ten stars because the movie made me think for months. It made me think how selfish the Daisy and Tom were. It made me adore Nick's compassion. It made me want to be loved like Gatsby loved Daisy. The only movies that I rate ten stars are the movies that make me think about the story for months after I've seen it. The Great Gatsby was one of the movies that made me think."

I was enthralled.<br/><br/>Story: This was an outstanding illustration of the inexplicable feeling of incapacitation or helplessness that even the most sumptuous, the most optimistic and ambitious people might have had to go through owing to their family backgrounds in 1920's USA and, in some backward cultures, are forced to undergo even today.<br/><br/>It is a terrifically illuminative story about the terrifying and morbid heartlessness of a segment of the society. Nothing but the simple fact that even the most ardent, the most earnest, the sincerest of the endeavors to make one understand that they are the only source of one's sublimely divine happiness may not necessarily be requited in the way one might want, was intensified and amplified to a point where it gave rise to a frisson of a kind of a realization or rather an insight that is both edifying and depressing at the same time.<br/><br/>It vehemently shakes the foundation of the unquestioned, hackneyed platitudes and predominant, vapidly hopeful incantations of the sort that ""everything is fair in love and war"", ""true love is always reciprocated"", or that ""there is justice in the world"" and so on.<br/><br/>Yet some juxtaposition might be able to make one see life from a fresh point of view which I certainly didn't and couldn't consider before. <br/><br/>It made me reshuffle the whole list of priorities in my life.<br/><br/>The cinematography was, well, remarkably flamboyant, vibrant and vivid. A real treat to the eye.<br/><br/>Performances of the actors, especially Maguire and DiCaprio, were extraordinary which should not be a surprise. Although the performances must be analyzed in the correct historical context, I think Mulligan could have done a little bit more than just trying to looking pretty and confounded *all the time* (a trait that I am slowly starting to loathe in her acting). Other than that, all of the acting was fabulous.<br/><br/>Well that's pretty much it.

","I had been waiting for this movie for a long time, for all its hype and the much talked about epoch making movie of the year. <br/><br/>'The Great Gatsby' starts off with Nick Carraway, (Tobey Maguire) narrating his events and experiences from his past life in New York. The movie starts at a dull pace, with long CGI shots and never ending party celebrations at the Gatsby mansion, which makes one's head go fuzzy. For the initial 30 minutes, the story builds up the suspense about the protagonist Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), with people talking about him in hushed voices and those never ending stories. After killing the boring half an hour, Gatsby finally makes it to the screen introducing himself to Carraway at one of his grand parties. The thrill that was built up, vanishes in less than a few moments as what was anticipated to be a dramatic thriller turns out into a dull melodrama of love and betrayal, with Gatsby desperately longing to tie the loose ends with his lost love. (Innocently hoping that things would be the same as they were 5 years back)<br/><br/>While watching this film, I always found myself at an arm's length, rather than being involved into the story. Halfway through the movie, I couldn't help but wait eagerly for its end; More out of boredom rather than curiosity. The characters aren't given enough screen time to make their appearance felt or develop themselves. The actors just pop in and out of the screen, making the first half looks chaotic.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, with his stone faced acting, irritating accent and forced dialogues, couldn't have been worse in the supporting cast. This, along with the terrible background score serves as the last nails in the coffin for this high budget fiasco. <br/><br/>The best thing (the only good thing) about The Great Gatsby is Leonardo DiCaprio. The story builds up and deepens as we enter into the life of Jay Gatsby, which defines the depth of DiCaprio's role and brings out his skills and maturity as an amazing actor. With his charismatic acting skills and an outstanding personality as Jay Gatsby, Leo keeps one's interest alive in the otherwise boring and one dimensional film. Towards the end, you can't help but feel sorry towards Gatsby as he dies alone, taking all the blame for the crimes he never committed. <br/><br/>'The Great Gatsby' is visually stunning, but is otherwise average and disappointing. What could have been a slick, stylish and sexy thriller instead sinks your hopes and disappoints all the way till the end."

There was actually a point during the movie when I had wanted to check the time on my watch but just couldn't look away. I should think one of the toughest parts of making such movies is having to capture the audience's attention, and making the audience appreciate what it was like to live in that era. But this film had effortlessly achieved that from the beginning, and brought that achievement to a whole new level. And that's coming from a guy who rarely appreciates films of such genre, what with it being set in the 1920s and all.<br/><br/>It has always been a wonder to me why DiCaprio hasn't gotten an Oscar for his work yet. He was (and still is) a brilliant actor who manages to live in the shoes of whatever role he plays. No exceptions here. Alongside the guy from Spiderman (I do know his name, don't worry), the duo charms the shoes off the audience while still playing their roles strongly and effortlessly. And I guess that's one of the elements that made the film so captivating. <br/><br/>And who didn't really fall in love with the beauty of Daisy, or the charm of Gatsby?<br/><br/>The artistic film had created an atmosphere that's so beautifully thick, yet one that's so easily digestible. Obviously long-winded for its own reasons, I never felt bored. I was, instead, eager for the story to keep going, even till the end. We loved Mr. Gatsby ever since he appeared in the film, in spite of the half-hour wait. <br/><br/>I could go on for hours, praising this movie for everything, but I should probably just... Stop typing, so you'd stop reading, shut your computer down, and buy a ticket."

","I'm a big fan of Baz, I'm a big fan of Jay-Z and I'm big fan of DiCaprio and Tobey in this movie, but something doesn't sit right when I watch this.<br/><br/>It's not a secret that this movie is visually captivating. The costumes, atmospheres and soundtrack all work together to make an alive, pastel delight. Simply put, it is fun.<br/><br/>To me it felt like all the elements were there. Obviously the plot line is solid, the acting is great and of course the visuals. Somewhere in the process of making this movie though, it feels like the overall direction was lost. There was a certain incongruity underneath it all.<br/><br/>For example the parties in the movie, as most will agree, are extravagant, but the emphasis put on them, and the general bravado of the film almost seem like the centre-piece with the storyline, and character development tacked on top. I didn't feel engaged on a human level. It seemed to me that every line from the trailer was over pronounced in the actual film, which not only made me think that the trailer was over hyping, but also that the film was made with the trailer in mind, which makes sense considering the lack of focus and direction. <br/><br/>Overall this movie was fun and had a certain wow-factor that makes it worth seeing in 3D, but there was an overpowering sense of the whole thing being stitched together, without having someone smooth out the overall shape to something that made sense through and through.<br/><br/>But of course, this is just my opinion. Many of my friends loved this film, and I'm sure many more will too.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","This is a movie worth watching. Unlike the majority of junk produced by Hollywood, which are time wasters. This is a great story and the movie makes it flashing. Good job to the producers, good taste!. I loved the dresses, the parties, the customs, the suits, the elegance, the shine and splendor of the material world, even the coal town, and mostly loved Gatsby's passion, his tragedy, his despair, his longing, his hope. Leonardo Di Caprio is such a handsome man. Can I have a man who can love me as much as he did Daisy? And if he looks as handsome even better! lol Five start!!!! Go watch this movie!!! It shows so much about the human character, that it made me even question myself - am I careless? Do I just walk around destroying people and things? I loved the scene where Gatsby is waiting for Daisy and then he runs away, his poor heart couldn't contain the emotion, for a second fear almost won, but then he comes back and well, it just melts my iceberg."
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","3 June 2013"," Not that bad at all
","Any movie by Australian director Baz Luhrmann is worth seeing because he has such a distinctive and exuberant style and you have to admire his willingness to be different, even if he is - as the ""Guardian"" film critic Peter Bradshaw put it - ""a man who can't see a nuance without calling security for it to be thrown off his set"". In different ways, I enjoyed ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Australia"" and I was prepared to give ""The Great Gatsby"" a go, in spite of some harsh reviews.<br/><br/>The F Scott Fitzgerald novel of 1925 has been filmed no less than four times before, notably in 1974 when Robert Redford played the plutocrat Jay Gatsby and Mia Farrow was his great love Daisy Buchanan in a restrained interpretation. Of course, Luhrmann does not do restraint and, in this movie, as well as his trademark grandiose sets and extensive CGI, he has shot the work in 3D, but I can only take so much Bazz and for this jazz I chose to see a 2D version, although even then it is very obvious where the 3D was intended to hit you in the eyes.<br/><br/>It is, of course, over the top (most obviously in those huge party scenes in the Gatsby mansion), the framing device of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a sanatorium is unnecessary, and the use of non- contemporary music by the likes of Jay-Z often jars. But there are some lavish sets and some gorgeous costumes and the whole thing has undeniable energy. Leonardo di Caprio has both the charm and the menace of Gatsby, while Cary Mulligan as Daisy continues to grown as an international star. Not so much ""All that Bazz"" as ""Not that bad""."
"loca_elly17","5","1","4","3 June 2013"," No summary
","There is no way all luhrmann's pyrotechnic glamour can match up the poetry of the book. Apparently The Great Gatsby is one of those books that no matter how accurate the movie is, (which it is) can't compare to the ABSOLUTE beauty and profoundness of the book. Its imagery, the character's complexities, did not transcribe. There is hardly any dialogue in the book and that is also the beauty of it. But obviously a blockbuster movie can't base a whole movie just on looks and words unspoken. It needs a story and all those unnecessary conversation have to take place for an average audience to understand the plot. So it just goes down to this compromise, while you are fascinated by Luhrmann's scenography, you are left with nothing for the brain to think on and you might just assume it's one of the other thousand of ordinary movies on corrupt marriages of the upper class. There is no way the movie portrays Gatsby's Greatness. But again, it's nobody's fault. Just some books of a certain caliber should be left books."

","I wasn't so sure when going in. I think Lurhman has a lot of skill bot not always the best focus. <br/><br/>That is to say that often he uses strong technique but in a way that makes a scene about the technique more than the story. <br/><br/>His films have always been likable but not totally fulfilling for that reason.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby however as lush and as beautiful as it was was done in a way that the visual style and technique always serves the story.

","I've been a long time fan of Mr. Luhrman. Strictly Balloom, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Austrilaia are amongst my favorite films. And Moulin Rouge is my favorite film of all time. I enjoy it's manic creative intensity that gives his films a memorable original flair not seen in any other films. So it is with sadness that I say that The Great Gatsby is a huge disappointment. The combination of modern day music and Luhrman's visual dazzle may have sounded like a good idea on paper but it makes the film feel disjointed and unrelatable. Although I'm not too familiar with the source material I'm assuming shadings of it come through but overall I'm not sure anything much comes through at all. The film starts out chaotically enough like Moulin Rouge (a little too simlar in fact) but than it begins to settle and there is a moment when you think Oh this a love story and than the focus strays away and we are left confused again. The performances are decent with a few too many unintentionally funny moments. these are fine actors here just not in their best form. As for the films visuals they are indeed stunning but feel unnecessary in translating such a storyline. And well the direction feels a little directionless the party scenes are fun but nothing seems to be going anywhere or amounting to much. the hyper intensity displayed throughout the film doesn't fit the proceedings at all constantly leaving you feeling a little bored with a stunted sense of empty awe. This is without a doubt Luhrman's worst film. That being said it's not a horrible film there is still some stuff to see here the modern soundtrack is electrifying if not fitting. The party scenes and cinematography although unnecessary are wondorous. I'm not sure when he started to disconnect with the material but I'm willing to forgive this little blip on his resume in hopes that he will get back to his more traditional, original faire. 2.5/5"
"orlandotourist8462","5","1","4","13 May 2013"," A Beautiful Film that Lacks Emotion
","So a dramatic film, from the director of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"" marketed as a visual spectacle, shot in 3D; what could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the same name, ""The Great Gatsby"" focuses on, not Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), but rather the times that his neighbor, Nick Carraway, (Tobey Maguire) spent with him during the roaring twenties.<br/><br/>So this is one of those very hit or miss movies. As someone who has never read the book, I really can't make comparisons so I can only judge it as a movie. I'll start with the negatives, because I feel that the movie missed more points than it hit. First, a positive, this is a very beautiful movie to look at. It's so visually beautiful that it seems to take away from the story and becomes a distraction. I didn't see this movie in 3D, but I have a feeling the 3D wouldn't have made a difference, despite being a visual spectacle, it are aren't a lot of visual scenes, which I feel may have led to some useless 3D. I found the music very distracting. Sometimes they would play music that was relevant for the time period this movie take play, but other times they would play hip hop music or other popular songs relevant for the 21st century. I seriously expected ""Gangnam Style"" to play at some point. It would've made as much sense as featuring JAY Z or Beyonce and Andre 3000 in the movie.<br/><br/>Now this movie isn't all bad, because this movie did get many things right. Even though the visual style distracts form the story, it is incredible to look and there was never a dull moment though out the entire movie. The performances were also great, I haven't seen Tobey Maguire in anything after he finished the Spider-Man Trilogy, but he managed to break away from the awkward nerd that he was known for in ""Spider-Man"". Even though Carrey Mulligan was good, in nearly every scene she's in, it looks like she's on the verge of tears. Obviously the star of the movie is Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. Who am I going to have to beat up in order to insure that this man gets an Oscar? Not for this movie, but this role does continue to show how great of an actor Leo is.<br/><br/>Overall it's not a mess of a film, but it definitely could've had some major improvements, but what it got right, it got really right. I feel that it's one of those movies where you make up your own mind about it. If you feel that it's for you, you might like it. If not, then you can either avoid it or wait for it to come out on Blu-ray."

","The simplicity of the story is what draw's people to the book (well English teacher's force the book on students), but what they should force is this adaptation of the film. Di'Caprio's ""Gatsby"" is purely fascinating, with Leo's look on the man who came from nothing and made himself someone for that ONE girl. Tobey's performance is like none before, he is the man that was invited into a new world, but never knew what he was actually being invited too. Enough about the actor's, the cinematography; in the same bigger than the world should allow party's and wardrobe (not to mention soundtrack) is just as amazing as it can be.

","It wasn't just a movie, it was an experience. All 50 of us movie goers were entrenched, immersed even in this 3D experience for 2.5 hours. Ignore the supercilious reviews and watch this cinematic masterpiece for yourself and decide. Great Gatsby WAS great! It was wistful, poignant, visually stunning, superbly executed, had amazing actors, florid detail which was mesmerizing at times, had a beautiful story line and allowed you (even if for a brief while) to get into Gatsby's head and feel what it is like to love someone so much that it's almost an obsession which rules your life. admittedly I have never read the book, however, I could definitely relate to his sheer devotion to Daisy which encapsulated half a decade of his life. Leonardo Di Caprio was the PERFECT fit for the role. I might be partial because I have loved him since BasketBall Diaries and think that he is an amazing actor. When you can convey words and emotion with your eyes THAT is when you know its good acting. There was a lot of silent cues like that in this movie which kind of tugged at your heartstrings. I really don't understand the negative reviews, it is based on a fictional book and yes there is flamboyance in some parts however that was also true of the excess of the time period.

In fact, this was as good a filming of this classic book as has yet been done, and I believe, as good as can possible be done. There is a line in ""The Last Tycoon"" which says ""you can't film great prose"", but it is actually and literally done here. <br/><br/>This film starts out with a tongue in cheek style. The performers are doing comic book versions of their characters, but the plot continues and the movie gets quite serious and eventually even somber. This follows the emotional tone of the novel. As course there are differences between the novel and the film, primarily with the more subtle nuances of the novel, but this is a movie and subtlety doesn't work too well in big screen 3D spectaculars<br/><br/>BTW, Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker steals every scene she is in, even when she has no lines.<br/><br/>Go see it.

"chococuzzy","9","1","5","28 September 2014"," A faithful, beautiful retelling of Fitzgerald's novel
","This movie completely took me by surprise. I have a love for F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, and I was a bit skeptical about how the book would translate to the silver screen. But I can honestly say that The Great Gatsby was one of the most faithful book-to-film adaptations that I have ever seen. Luhrmann remained true to the book down to the colors of the character's clothing.The soundtrack was beautiful, the CGI and the costumes were gorgeous, the script was impeccable, and the casting was very smart. At first, I thought that Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing more than a heartthrob, a way to sell tickets. This movie changed my mind about him. Now, I consider Leonardo to be one of the greatest actors of our generation. He brought an edge to Gatsby's character as well as maintaining his sense of unwavering hope and his undying love for Daisy Buchanan. He played the character flawlessly. He was Gatsby. Now to review Carey Mulligan as Daisy. There is no doubt that Mia Farrow had the delicate beauty of Daisy, but Farrow portrayed Daisy as very ditzy. Carey Mulligan gave Daisy a backbone. She gave the character depth while still giving her a sense of naivetÃ© and girlishness. Before Gatsby, I had never seen Tobey Maguire in a movie. I thought he embodied the troubled character of Nick excellently while making him very lovable. Maguire made me love Nick's character even more. I hadn't seen Joel Edgerton in a movie either. But I thought he was the absolute perfect Tom Buchanan. Bruce Dern was a fine Tom, but he made him nothing more than a bigoted jerk. Edgerton brought more to the role, making Tom's objectives rational, and by giving him more dimensions than just racist and nasty. So in conclusion, thank you Baz Luhrmann. You brought the book to life in a way that I never imagined."
"ginolee","10","1","5","5 February 2014"," Overall a great achievement on a great but difficult book
","I suppose, in most cases, whenever a beloved American classic is adapted to the screen there will be contention on the merits of the film. In Baz Luhrmann's vision of ""The Great Gatsby"" there appears to be even more criticism probably due to the fact that there have been many other film versions and because the book is so beloved by so many. It is difficult for people to not compare and contrast this film and in the process become overly critical. However, Luhrmann's rendition of ""The Great Gatsby"" really works and everything from the vividness of the set design, to the weaving of Fitzgerald's prose into the film, to the performances of the cast, was adeptly executed.<br/><br/>I was impressed by Luhrmann's adaptation of Fitzgerald's iconic work of literature. For the most part, all of Fitzgerald's major themes are compellingly and stylishly represented: The rich and nouveau riche are all shown with the over-the-top excesses of the ""haves"" and aptly juxtaposed with the ""have-nots"" who are decent people trying to survive; The discrimination and feeling of contempt by those who were bred in a privileged society as opposed to those who newly acquired their wealth; The inability to extricate oneself from the past and to understand the nature of true love; How those with the most hide behind their fortune and could care less about the rest of society including those who work for them. All these major themes are clearly represented in the film and hammered home by the solid performances of the actors. <br/><br/>Because the film, by and large, was faithful to Fitzgerald's work the themes that were explored in the book remain intact in the film. This film is an instant classic because it did not diverge too far from the classic it was based on. Although Fitzgerald's book was written in the 1920's we see the rich in our society pretty much act the same way today. After all, few can argue that the financial collapse that hit our economy within the past five years was not in large part due to the ""carelessness"" of the rich who promulgated the reckless borrowing while at the same time hedging their bets against those that borrowed. There are still those in the wealthy segments of our society that can afford to be careless precisely because they are rich and their wealth was often begotten by that very carelessness of others. Luhrmann's film accurately reiterates this theme and other themes because it stayed true to Fitzgerald's vision of America. <br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" is an excellent film because it accurately captures the themes of the original author, and is as relevant today as it will be in the future."
"kosmasp","8","1","5","29 August 2013"," Stays with you
","I have to admit, when I watched the movie I didn't feel as attracted by it as I do now. But it grew on me, because I kept thinking about it and how it was done. And it's the first movie that Baz Luhrman did that really achieved that with me. It's only the 4th I've seen, but still something to cherish upon. The music would also be something you could cherish upon.<br/><br/>Though I'm not sure if that also could be something that takes you out of it completely. While this is a period piece, the music is very modern indeed. It takes a bit to get used to that. Though the dance moves are clearly from that time, which goes to show you, that dance styles may differ, but the music could be different too and the styles would still be intact.<br/><br/>But while music is always a big part of a Luhrman movie (as are the sets they are shot on, impressive as always), it is the story that is compelling. Almost as compelling as the main female character is to Gatsby himself. There are quite a few character flaws but also a depth to them, that might be rare to other Luhrman movies. I really liked where this was going and the movie is really good too."
"erikjbrouwer","8","1","5","4 June 2013"," A little over the top and music didn't always fit, but all in all still great.
","Most scenes in the film are very well transformed from the book. The delayed mysterious introduction of Gatsby and his reunion with Daisy is just heartwarming. The music, especially in the first half of the film (up to Lana Del Ray), did not fit. Jay-Z and Alicia Keys? Modern beats nibbled on the credibility. The fact that the music did not come from the band playing in the scenes took away the feeling of actually being there. Visually, it did not fall short, somewhat over the top. The 3D was subtle, precisely enough to support the extravagant scenes and extreme camera work. I expected some tears to roll, but the story didn't pickup the way I expected it to. Some scenes were not true enough to the book. The scene with Tom and his mistress was vulgar and unnecessary. Apart from these critical points, the cast surprised me. Di Caprio great as Gatsby. Great as always; he delivers. I was skeptical of Maguire and Mulligan. However, they both surprised me in their own way. Mulligan was a natural beauty in appearance and character. Together with her reserved nature, displayed a very well rounded personality. Maguire narrated the story nicely and showed he could carry the story. He showed he is more than a wall crawler. A must see? With a little hesitation, yes."

Given a 7.5/10 on IMDb.com and certified 48% Rotten on Rottentomatoes.com<br/><br/>""A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.""<br/><br/>So I've read ""The Great Gatsby"" in my current English class and I've found that I thoroughly enjoy the story but I don't really like the book or the 1974 movie. However, I attempted to watch this film with an open mind, from the point of view of an average movie goer, with no prior knowledge of Gatsby and here's what I took from the film overall.<br/><br/>Luhrmann delivers as always with a dreamlike beauty on the side of cinematography. Each scene is beautifully sculpted, flashy, and absolutely magnificent. However, the vast amounts of green screen used to create these scenes tends to be too ""in your face"" for my taste and I eventually got so tired of it to the point that I was getting a headache. I can't imagine the pain that anyone watching in 3D was feeling. That being said, the visuals on this film are definitely worth the $10 I dropped to watch it.<br/><br/>The cast did a phenomenal job with their characters. Carey Mulligan who plays Daisy Buchanan gave just enough flair and melancholia to her character to be admired. Tobey Maguire sadly fell short in a role that's absolutely important to the plot but ultimately so simple that anyone could've pulled it off, which is what saddens me considering Maguire is a capable actor but it seems he just missed it on this role. Leonardo Dicaprio's Jay Gatsby is honestly the best part of this film. He truly embodies all of the complexities of Gatsby is a way that's never been done before and I'd argue that this is, if not one of, his greatest performances of his entire career. However, try as they might, the phenomenal acting just isn't enough to the film out of the water.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is full of grandeur and tantalizing imagery, but the Kanye West soundtrack and lack of any 'real' plot development left me bored and disappointed. Sadly, I wanted to leave the theater in within the first thirty minutes. About midway, when Daisy and Gatsby meet, the film does get better but at this point it just isn't enough. There's an immense amount of overacting, weird shots, and a level of silliness that just can't be shaken. Nick Carraway's constant narration becomes annoying. I found myself on the edge of my seat as the film spiraled into it's climactic conclusion, spinning a beautiful end, but it was too difficult for me not to laugh at how hard they were trying to pick something up after it had dropped and shattered upon the floor. I had to check my watch multiple times in the cinema and I was relieved by the time the credits finally began to roll.<br/><br/>Overall, The Great Gatsby had entirely too much potential to be absolutely incredible and a spectacular rendition of it's source material, but it fails to capture the true heart and meaning of the book. It weaves a carnival of wonder and I really wanted to love this film. It's not a disaster, but by the time it decides what it's doing, it's already too late. I suggest it's better to ""beat on"" then to waste your time. Sorry, Old Sport.<br/><br/>I'll see you at the movies!<br/><br/>~Tyler Skye Gordon"
"jonathon_kane","Null","1","5","12 May 2013"," This Was a Film I Could Not Crack
","A Review of The Great Gatsby<br/><br/>It is sometime after midnight as I write this. My head is still pounding due to the three dimensional glasses I wore when watching the 2 and a half hour long The Great Gatsby. If someone were to ask me right now: what did you think of the movie? I would be unable to answer in speech. The only way to convey my opinion of this movie is through text, precisely what I am doing here. The story centers on the mysterious Jay Gatsby (Leonardo Dicaprio), a self-made millionaire with a questionable past, and his relentless pursuit for the love of his life Daisy Bucannan (Carrey Mulligan). The movie was based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel that was published in 1925. The Great Gatsby was a movie unlike anything I had watched before. As I left the movie theatre, I couldn't crack it. The film itself, with all its technical aspects and star-studded cast, is excellent. Dicaprio gives a stunning performance as Gatsby from the minute we first meet him. If there is anyone living today that could evoke the kind of confidence and hope that Gatsby possesses, it's Dicaprio. As for Carrey Mulligan, the only adjective I can use to describe the effect her performance has on the movie watchers is breathtaking. She is Daisy. The sweet, innocent, self-sheltering girl from the novel comes to life on screen thanks to Mulligan's acting ability. Yet, there is one character that shares in this spotlight, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire). Throughout the entire film, Nick seems to be the only character sober enough for us to latch on to. He guides us through the craziness of the 1920's and does a fantastic job executing the narrator style. Further enhancing the film's allure is the time period, the location, and the ability of director Baz Luhrmann to bring the reality of it all to the screen. For those of you that have studied up your history on the 1920's, you know what a crazy time period it was. As Nick comments in the film, ""the buildings were higher, the morals were looser, and we all drank too much."" Luhrmann paints the 1920's across the screen throughout the entire film. The only thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the choice of modern hip-hop/rock/music for the soundtrack. However, I found myself gasping in certain scenes because there is just so much to take in at once. In fact, the first half of the movie feels like one long, crazy 1920's party. <br/><br/>However, what truly shocked me was the ability for the novel to be placed on screen so fully. I've seen quite a few movies that originated from books, and they all seem to leave huge chunks of the plot out. Not this movie. This film is by far the best novel to movie transition I've ever seen. The themes that are present in the book (the ones we all studied in English class) are present throughout the crazy journey you take with Gatsby. So if you're one of those people who think the movie will never be as good as the paper form of the story, this one might change your mind. And another thing, even if you have read the book, you will leave the theatre with a deeper understanding of the story, perhaps deeper than you wanted. It's one thing to read about the corruption, carelessness, and downfalls of the characters, but it's another thing to actually see those things. I was pleasantly surprised overall. I had seen Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet and I did not enjoy it. But thanks to Dicaprio's and Mulligan's amazing performances and the whirlwind scenes that dot the movie, I give it two thumbs up. My advice, go out and see it as soon as you possibly can. <br/><br/>Rating Warning: Rated PG-13 for some violent images, sexual content, smoking, partying and brief language.<br/><br/>I give it 7 out of 10."

","Disregard all the hype about how the director couldn't really pull this off, that the spectacular style doesn't fit the story, or that the music is all wrong, etc.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The 3-D technique captured an astonishing feeling of depth and realism. The acting was powerful and impressive. The character of Nick was given due respect of weight and authority. The story-telling gradually took on a very beautiful visual poetry. The climax and ending had me with jaw a-drop and tears welling up.<br/><br/>Do see it in 3-D and do see it as soon as you can.

"hot_hands38","8","1","5","11 May 2013"," A Movie...Not a Book...
","As my title says, this is a movie and not a book. If you want this movie to be drawn-out, slow, thematic, and dramatic, then your in the wrong place. That stuff doesn't sell movies these days.<br/><br/>With that being said, I did not feel that the movie was too over-the-top or far off from the book. I was actually scared going into the movie because I thought it was going to be dreadfully slow and dramatic. Also the terrible CGI in the trailers did not help. However, the movie got on my good side pretty quickly. The director was very in tune with what the majority of people want from a movie about The Great Gatsby. He made the entire movie a memory of Nick Carraway's. That was a brilliant idea because it allowed for the crappy CGI, rapid pace, and sometimes questionable soundtrack to fall under the, ""its just how he remembers it"" idea.<br/><br/>The book was terribly slow. This movie is quick and it includes a lot of stuff. People say it is all flash over substance, but if they can't see the substance then they weren't looking. It is supposed to be flashy! Its the Roaring Twenties! The spectacle was perfect to give the viewer a sign of the times.<br/><br/>The acting was awesome! I thought that they had Carraway and Gatsby casted perfectly as Toby McGuire and Leonardo DiCaprio going into the movie, but what I didn't see coming was Buchanan! I think the actors name is Edgerton or something like that, but that dude did an awesome job in this movie. It seems like every actor was in-tune with their character. Thank goodness DiCaprio understood Gatsby. He seems like such a manipulator in the book sometimes; however the movie gives him a more human-element and the viewer can see that he is many things.<br/><br/>I will have to admit, going in I was scared that this movie was going to be a total flop. The CGI scared me, Jay-Z always scares me, and the fact that it was a movie about a insanely dramatic book scared me. However, at the end of the movie I felt like I understood the novel better than I ever had before. Was it a bit over the top in places? yes. Did it play too much on some themes and not others? yes. Did it follow the book exactly? no. But it is a book that people love and when that is the case no movie adaptation can ever be correct. I feel that this movie did a tremendous job of staying true to the book, the setting, the themes, the characters, and the tragedy.<br/><br/>This is definitely a must see."
"budmassey","Null","1","5","11 May 2013"," Seductively entertaining and visually magnificent.
","Watching this film requires a few concessions.<br/><br/>First, you must imagine the elegantly beautiful 1974 classic version does not exist. Trust me. It's painful otherwise, and I will avoid any reference or comparison for that reason. Second, you must also imagine that, notwithstanding Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the setting is not the Roaring Twenties but, rather, some over amped time warp netherworld where Jay-Z and Beyonce' get to be avant garde again because they're rather incongruously and anachronistically foisted on a film in which they really have no place.<br/><br/>If you make it that far, you're almost ready to watch The Great Gatsby 2013. Now brace yourself for Baz Lurhrmann's jarring postmodern deconstructivism that was thrilling a decade ago in Moulin Rouge, but has become by now almost as grotesque as Julie Taymor's murderous affront to Beatle music – Across the Universe.<br/><br/>Thus prepared, you can now enjoy what is undeniably an entertaining, if uninspiring, film.<br/><br/>Tobey Maquire, of whom I am usually a fan, is somewhat flaccid as Nick Carroway, despite the fact that the story depends utterly upon him to drive it forward. He does, however, bring a decidedly literary dimension to the film by framing the main story within his own attempt at recovery. Joel Edgerton is a perfectly delightful Tom Buchanan. He embodies all the machismo brutishness with which Fitzgerald envisioned the character. He also has enough personal charisma to help anchor the otherwise riotous staging. And, of course, there is DiCaprio as Gatsby. I didn't hate him, although I was predisposed to, but I wanted to love this movie, and Leo was one of the main reasons I couldn't.<br/><br/>As far as casting, however, the jewel of this film is the deliriously sensuous and beautiful Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. She makes it easy to believe that Daisy broke hearts with just a smile back in Louisville and inspired Gatsby to bring the world to her dock for her sake.<br/><br/>This film mines Fitzgerald's novel for more complex themes than predecessors have explored. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Ironically, it also strips all the novel's major themes of any subtlety whatsoever and reduces them to stage settings for an unrelenting onslaught of elaborate music videos.<br/><br/>But if I reel in my disappointment for a moment, I can only conclude that this is a well-made movie that is seductively entertaining and visually magnificent. Maybe it isn't fair to expect more."

Some people who want to see a fast pace story with music and party's will love it. But it doesn't get any deeper than that.

"didonatope","Null","1","5","10 May 2013"," A Visualized Novel (Minor Spoilers)
","When I first heard about writer/director Luhrman's return to film; I was actually pretty excited; his visual thrills and his mixing of modern pop culture and period drama made Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge two of the most aesthetically memorable films ever. However, Many people reasonably questioned his ability to bring F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby; one of the biggest novels of all time to the big screen. The book put more of an emphasis on character drama and conflicts in society than artistic grandeur. Having just seen it, I can honestly say that his direction was as much of a success as it was a problem.<br/><br/>The film centers around Nick Carroway (Played by Toby Macguire of Spiderman and Brothers), a former writer, telling the story of how he met the infamous Jay Gatsby (Played by Leonardo DiCaprio- see below); a small town man who turned his life of low income and misery into a wealthy life of parties and liquor. Throughout the film, Nick gets caught in the middle of a series of scandals including his married cousin Daisy (Played by Carrey Mulligan of An Education) and Gatsby's secret romance. What follows is a slew of chaotic events that could destroy everyone and everything including Nick, who didn't want any part of it. <br/><br/>As one can imagine, this film about the roaring 20's contains a lot of drama, betrayal, lust and intensity. All of these elements ad more are expressed through the film's use of colorful sets and costumes as well as its refreshing use of modern music from artists like Jay-Z and Lana Del Rey. All of these qualities really enhance the story and Luhrman's vision of the classic tale is quite admirable. From the sleek custom cars to the sparkling flapper outfits, there is always something gorgeous to grab your attention.<br/><br/>As expected from a Baz Luhrman film, the cinematography is flawless as well. The use of fabric to symbolize happiness and the wide shots of people eating, partying and enjoying themselves added a lot to the film and honestly, it all looked incredible.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I did have a problem with this high emphasis on visuals. The party scenes and set pieces do their job, but sometimes they keep going on longer than they should, leaving less time for character development. For example, the character Myrtle (played by Isla Fisher) is show to be very important by the film's end, but we hardly see her on screen or get a real sense of who she is. <br/><br/>I didn't really care for the dialogue half the time either. For the most part it was tolerable, but at some points it seemed rambling and a bit unrealistic. I'm not really sure if this is just my problem though; I'm personally a fan of crisp, realistic dialogue and don't really like scenes of lengthy explanation. It may not bother you but it was a bit of an issue for me.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Leonardo DiCaprio and Carrey Mulligan steal the show. Both actors give a real, almost method portrayal of their characters and never hesitate. DiCaprio has been trying for years to win an Oscar and while such an award is not necessary to leave a legacy, he has a bright future if he continues his career with performances like this.<br/><br/>So would I recommend this film? Well in my opinion it was pretty decent, but as with Luhrman's Moulin Rouge, I feel like this movie is a love-it-or-hate-it experience. One thing that is for certain is that people who don't like surreal ""artsy"" visuals or modern music will be annoyed by the movie. It's been a while since I've read the book, so I'm not sure how faithful it is, but I still recommend fans of the novel to check it out and make their own judgement."

","This movie looks obviously expensive and has some interesting special effects and choice of music but it is completely unrealistic, has absolutely no meaningful story, over the top romantic (yet you do not feel any depth to the characters, don't identify with them, and therefore feel nothing) and dragged out, especially in the second half. This movie is the film equivalent of those 99 cent novels you read on a train and throw away as soon as you're done. It's just a way to waste a few hours of your time. Why anyone would make such a film is beyond me, but then again, maybe this is the average of what Hollywood is able to offer us today."

Whether you love it or hate it, there's no denying that so much effort was put into it, and it is very very unique. I was initially afraid of the party scenes with modern music, but most of the time, it works joyfully. The acting is simply stellar. DiCaprio amazing as usual, and I was blown away by Carey Mulligan, who I previously knew as Sally Sparrow from Doctor Who. Toby Maguire does okay, and the rest of the cast is just incredible. This film is aesthetically perfect. The sets and cinematography are why I go to the movies. I can't wait to see it again in 3D. Be prepared for a very different kind of summer blockbuster. This is not the kind of epic in the same category as Gone With The Wind. It is mostly faithful to Fitzgerald's book, but is open to people who haven't read it. A unique enjoyable film with some wonderful talent put into it. (I'm glad it got green-lighted.) Go see it."

"valebeeche","9","1","6","4 June 2013"," The Great Gatsby, the great movie.
","What a better way to start my past weekend than going to the movies and finally seeing the movie I was so excited about, The Great Gatsby. This is the third adaptation film based on the great novel of F. Scott Fitzgerald, directed by Baz Lurhmann. I would like to give my opinion about this film, full of romance and drama, that I had been expecting for so long to see. <br/><br/>Taking place in Long Island and the heart of New York City during the 1920s, where a man named Nick Carraway is intrigued by the luxurious life of this new neighbor, Jay Gatsby. He finally gets to meet him, while attending to one of his famous parties he throws very often. Yet, as he gets closer to him he realizes the ""gaps"" in this perfect luxurious life. A curious outcome happens when he realizes Nick's cousin Daisy, who is married to an old friend of Nick, Tom, actually knew Gatsby. <br/><br/>I believe Lurhmann couldn't have chosen better the actors for this perfectly made film. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jay Gatsby in the movie. Which in my opinion, he is perfect for this roll. His emotions, passions and obsessions throughout the movie are performed in such a way where me, as the audience, believed and felt all of this emotions. The way he acted, indeed made me feel I was in this position. Tobey Maguire, portrays Nick Carrey. I believe he did a great job as well. He portrayed excellently this confused, naive character. He is believable throughout the film, and keeps the audience member confused and pondering as well. Carey Mulligan, or Daisy in the film, is a beautiful actress which acts excellently. I really like the fact that she is not known actress, like Jessica Alba or Keira Knightley, so being in this movie, really show how great of an actress she is, and not people thinking this by being biased by past films. She shows passion, desperation, fear in a great way. Joel Edgerton, acts Tom Buchanan, in an excellent way as well. His vices, his passions and the love he felt for others is clearly seen through his expressions and way of acting. I believe they were all great actors, and I wasn't disappointed at all by Lurhmann's choices.<br/><br/>What I loved the most about the movie itself, is that is has a great plot. I mean, it is not like every other movie where you know how it is going to end. It has this element of surprise, which made me like it even more. The scenery and the music of this movie was also mind shocking. Every single scene had this awesome scenery, which made me just want to be there. The music was also perfect for each scene, and it really did fit in the scene and time period. Like the scene of the party, everything was just BIG. The music, the house, the fireworks, the music every single part of it was amazing. It truly made it seem like the party everyone talked about in New York City. The costumes were also greatly done based on the time period, everything from hair, to every single jewelry was magnificent. I believe a movie is a great piece of art, when you feel like you want to be there, like you really want to belong there. As in Les Miserables, it is full of music, drama and romance which all want to make you join the actors and enjoy the same experience they are having. Both have great costume designs and excellent makeup that really make you feel it was filmed during that specific time and place. <br/><br/>What I learned about this movie, is that you should be happy with who you are and what you have. You should not change who you are and what you have, people should love you for who you are. Not only that, money and material stuff should not be the way to someone's heart. Also, you should value what you have and enjoy it, since you never know when it will be gone. I believe there are many things you can learn from this movie, and probably what most people can grasp from it, is about love and who you are and what you have. <br/><br/>I believe this movie is for a wide audience, specially because it is an adaptation of a classic literature piece. I would recommend it to those who have read the book, and to those who like Lurhmann's movies. This movie is rated PG-13, and I believe that's a good rating for this movie. I believe people will like it as much as I did, it is an excellent movie, I enjoyed every minute of it. <br/><br/>If I were to give this movie a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, I would most definitely give it a 5. The wonders of this movie just ""captivated"" me. From scenery, to music to the actors, I was shocked after watching this movie, and it most definitely stayed on my mind awhile after I left the cinema. <br/><br/>This movie review was done by a Costa Rican Lincoln School student, currently a sophomore. It was created for the Film appreciation class of 2012-2013. Whose interests vary from watching TV series, to listening to music and hanging out with friends."

","The things I admire in The Great Gatsby are the things I disliked at the same time. It is so obvious that the plot is so simple, and in no way is it in need of the extravagant production it is packed in. All it is is a simple love story, so I see no reason for there to be a $100 million budget with CGI up the ying-yang and one of the most outlandish costume designs in recent memory. At first, the film comes off as style-over-substance. But as more and more of the theme is revealed (which I never like to give away in my reviews) I can see the reason and a hidden agenda behind this production design, and I really started to enjoy it for what it built itself up to be- a social and human nature statement. Once this was developed, though it took far too long, I could really love the movie. The performances were great and the screenplay is top notch, but it was too far into the film before anything was established. The first hour or so is just useless set up that really took down on my rating for the film. Nevertheless, it is a film worth while for viewing, so I would recommend it.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"
"richardosborne14","6","1","6","4 June 2013"," ""DiCaprio is a joy to watch...""
","This year's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has been long awaited. Aside from being one of the most famous novels of all time, it is directed by the glitzy and visual director Baz Luhrmann, and with Leonardo DiCaprio starring, it certainly had a lot of hype to live up to.<br/><br/>DiCaprio steals the show and, like Gatsby, keeps the film afloat when other elements seem doomed for the seabed. He is a joy to watch from his intriguing and captivating introduction to his desperate and destructive finale. Seemingly appearing out of thin air, with a past shrouded in mist and with, on the surface at least, an enviable demeanor and lifestyle, he pleasantly evokes Fight Club's Tyler Durden. Luhrmann has said his casting of Gatsby had to be a great actor and a star, and in a world where the star persona is regrettably being overshadowed by overnight celebrityism, DiCaprio is one of the last good guys standing, and the perfect choice for the role.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan is also worth noting, in a role that really allows to her to use her innocence and natural beauty to great value, but unfortunately Joel Edgerton's performance wavers, while Tobey Maguire, hazy-eyed and naïve as Nick Carraway, seems to have unfortunately not yet grown out of his red and blue spandex from a decade ago. His voice-over becomes tiring very quickly, which unfortunately devalues scenes and takes centre stage when the audience would much rather be allowed the luxury of seeing a scene play out rather than have Maguire paraphrase for them. A strange and incomprehensible decision to bookend the film with a vignette of Carraway writing the story from a sanitarium distances the audience and adds another unnecessary layer to keep cutting back to.<br/><br/>We know Luhrmann is a fan of mixing contemporary music with period pieces- remember the rendition of Smells Like Teen Spirit in his 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, but despite the great use of a Jay-Z soundtrack, in conjunction with the depiction of drinking and partying, it sometimes feels like Project X has gone back in time, and this cheapens an expensive, lavish piece. Gatsby's own parties are full of the grandiose extravagance we are expecting, but if only we hadn't been in the 1920s frat-style party ten minutes before, the effect would have been so much greater.<br/><br/>With pushbacks and a marketing budget bigger than Gatsby's annual spending allowance, there was obviously a lot of hype and anticipation surrounding the film. Unfortunately I'm not sure it has succeeded in fulfilling this expectation.<br/><br/>As I left the theatre, I was unable to put my finger on how I felt about it. Did it tell me the story of Gatsby? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes, partly. Did it make me feel anything? No, not really. And therein lies the problem. There is enough flamboyancy and large-scale magnificence for any Luhrmann fan to be fulfilled, but in a story of character and depth, this is not enough. The special moments in the film were burdened with a wearisome voice-over, and as much style as Luhrmann brought to the table with this offering, it seems he sacrificed substance. DiCaprio is certainly The Great Gatsby, but the film is simply The Gatsby."

Forge the book. Forget Robert Redfort's Gatsby, Leonardo DiCaprio IS the Big G! What a script by Baz Luhrmann! What makes Francis Ford Coppola think he knows how to write a screenplay for The Great Gatsby?

"3xHCCH","9","1","7","21 May 2013"," Leonardo Di Caprio IS Jay Gatsby
","Two days before I watched this 2013 version of ""The Great Gatsby,"" I read the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald novel and watched the 1974 film for the first time. The book was about a man named Jay Gatsby who moves heaven and earth, building his immense wealth from practically nothing, to be with Daisy, the woman he adored who married wealthy Tom Buchanan because ""rich girls cannot marry poor boys.""<br/><br/>This 2013 version was directed by Baz Luhrmann. You will really notice his touch in those lavish and opulent parties that Gatsby held in his West Egg mansion. Luhrmann pushed the envelope again in the musical soundtrack department, as he did in ""Moulin Rouge"". Imagine making use of unarguably anachronistic hiphop and even rap on top of the scenes from the Roarin' 20s! This is polarizing stuff, you either like it or you don't. I thought it was brave and original, but I did not really like it for the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Like the 1974 film, the story-telling was also very faithful to its literary source, even lifting words verbatim in the narration and the dialogues. However, Luhrmann imagined psychological therapy situation as bookend devices, for Nick Carraway to tell and then write all he knows about Gatsby the man, his next-door neighbor for whom he becomes a close friend and confidante. The lavish set design and costumes, already done very well and award-winning in the 1974 version, were further improved and enhanced by modern visual effects. These will definitely be contenders again come Oscar season next year.<br/><br/>The actors really outdid themselves in this edgier, more passionate 2013 version, when compared to the rather safe and straight-forward 1974 version. That three-way confrontation scene that took place during that hot summer afternoon in the Plaza Hotel alone deserves award consideration for ensemble and individual performance from the three central characters. Joel Edgerton had a more seriously haughty and brutish attitude than Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan. Carey Mulligan had the stunning beauty and grace that would make it believable that Gatsby would obsess over someone like her. Mia Farrow simply did not have those qualities before, and was so easy to hate. <br/><br/>And of course, there is Jay Gatsby himself. Robert Redford played a very perfect Gatsby: handsome, cool, unruffled, confident. However, the Gatsby in the book is not perfect: insecure, nervous, obsessive- compulsive and maybe even delusional. Leonardo di Caprio, I believe, nails this book Gatsby perfectly. Di Caprio is believable as a Gatsby who may have had unsavory means of reaching his present status. You can see the vulnerable chinks in his armor. Redford looked and acted like he was born rich. My one complaint though is that I think the writers gave di Caprio too much of the expression ""old sport"" to say, but that is the writers' fault not his.<br/><br/>If there was one factor that made this film a 9/10 for me rather than 10/10, it was the cheesy portrayal of Nick Carraway by Tobey Maguire. I thought Maguire did not look right for the part, and his Nick was too weak, at least when compared to the smart portrayal of Sam Waterston in 1974. Maybe the therapy sessions Luhrmann wrote for his character did not really do Maguire any favors in this regard. When I was reading the book, I did not really get the sense that Nick would become an alcoholic.<br/><br/>In any case, that casting mishap is only a small glitch in the whole picture. This film was very well made and deserves to be seen by all who love the book, or even fans of the 1974 film. It is a vast improvement over the 1974 version. The use of flashbacks in this current version to show us more about the history of Gatsby as a boy and young man was really helpful to understand where he was coming from. The symbolism of the green light and the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg cannot be ignored this time. Too bad I was not able to see the 3D version so I could not comment on that. I can just imagine though how Gatsby's wild parties would have looked wilder or those cool vintage cars racing down the road would have looked snazzier in 3D. Highly recommended!"

","Wow. I am utterly speechless. First off let me say that The Great Gatsby is my favorite book and I am a stickler for movies being very similar to the book. Thankfully ""The Great Gatsby"" was very true to the book (with a few exceptions of course). Overall it was very true to the book and I actually prefer (SPOILER SPOILER) the movie's version of Gatsby's death than the book's (I liked being able to see what Nick didn't and couldn't see in the book). I thought it was a heart wrenching scene, and I am not ashamed to say that I, and many others, cried.<br/><br/>The cast was exceptional, even Jason Clarke nailed his small (but vital) role as Wilson. I enjoyed Isla Fisher as Myrtle (although she WAS different than in the book, she added some spunk to the movie). I know a lot of people were skeptical of Carey Mulligan as Daisy, I was at first, but she is VERY good as Daisy in this movie. She has the ""low thrilling"" voice, and is sweet and endearing. Many don't understand Gatsby's attraction to her, but what is often forgotten is how much he built her up in his mind over the years, so of course she couldn't measure up. The entire cast did a terrific job, Joel Edgerton was PERFECT as Tom and Tobey made for a great Nick (Tobey and Leo have been friends for years so their chemistry on screen was very genuine), but the standout (for me) was Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. He was the perfect embodiment of Gatsby, I could spend all day talking about his wonderful, stupendous performance, but once you see the movie you will know what I mean. He 100% deserves some recognition (at LEAST) during award season (more specifically Oscars!).<br/><br/>The movie is also beautifully filmed, it is quite the work of art. Baz Lurhman creates the green light and the Valley of Ashes perfectly! The music, which is a big source of the controversy surrounding this movie, works very well with the film and, I think, enhances it! Although one track (a rap track to be specific) comes across as an odd and unfitting choice for the movie (in my opinion). But Florence + the Machine's ""Over the Love"" and especially Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" are absolute magic in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is just delightful, I would put it on your must see list if you haven't seen it already. I think it is THE film of 2013 and it will most likely scoop up quite a few awards during award season ( best costumes of course). And some people were complaining that the first half hour or so, is a bit...rushed, and it is at times, but from when Gatsby and Daisy reunite to the end of the film (SPOILER: especially the horrifyingly powerful scene when Myrtle dies) is pure cinematic GOLD! Needless to say I really liked the movie (that's an understatement) and I am pretty sure you will like it too! :)"

","From director Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge), based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald this was advertised and promoted as one of the big films of the year in 3D, I had to see if it deserved all the attention it was getting. I should start by saying that all I knew about this film was the cast, that there was an original version with Robert Redford, and it started with the words ""In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since"" and ended with the words ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"". Basically, set in 1922, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) has returned home having graduated from Yale University and fought in the First World War, he is ready to begin a career, so moves to New York City to get into the bond business. In West Egg, Long Island rents a house next to the large mansion of the mysterious Gatsby, also living there are Nick's cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Zero Dark Thirty's Joel Edgerton) who he knew in Yale from the same senior society, they have invited him to dinner. At the dinner Daisy hopes Nick will be interested in young female golfer Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki), during their time there the phone rings, Jordan informs Nick that is Tom's mistress Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) in New York, living in the place called the Valley of Ashes, a section of Long Island. Myrtle herself is married to garage owner George (Jason Clarke), and nearby to the garage is a large billboard with a painted fading advertisement for an optician with the eyes of a Doctor wearing glasses watching over them, with Tom taking him Nick gets to meet the Wilsons, but the party ends when Myrtle's nose getting broken. Several weeks pass and Nick is invited to an elaborate party hosted by the elusive Gatsby, he and many of the other guests are curious to meet the rich man, and eventually Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) reveals himself, not drinking or joining in any revelry, and he invites Nick a luncheon in New York. There Gatsby tells him all about his graduation from Oxford, and he is introduced to his business associate Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan) who fixed the 1919 World Series, but later at an afternoon tea Gatsby reveals he really wants Nick to arrange a date for him and Daisy. Five years ago Gatsby and Daisy were in love, but they were split when he was sent overseas in the Army, and she had given up waiting for him which explains why she married Tom, so when he returned from the war he decided to buy a house in West Egg as a first step to win her back. The house he bought is across the bay from her house, and at the end of the dock outside her house is a green light, and with Nick's help they are reunited, she is obviously shocked to see him after five years, but he hopes to impress with his mansion and wealth. Next at Daisy's house she, Tom, Gatsby, Nick and Jordan get together and are introduced to Daisy's baby, and then they go to the city and stop at Wilson's garage for a fill up, and George is convinced his wife has been having an affair, but he does not know who with, and Tom knows Myrtle from the window is watching them. The group next go to a hotel suite, and the truth about Gatsby and Daisy comes out, she refuses to go away with him and any love they had before is gone, but they get into his yellow Rolls Royce together followed by the others in Tom's car, and on the way they pass Wilson's garage and Myrtle runs out into the street, Gatsby's car hits and kills her and continues driving. Daisy was the one driving the car in a drunken state, but Gatsby says he will take the blame for her, Tom wrongly tells George that Gatsby was driving the car that hit his wife, Wilson goes to the mansion, shoots and kills Gatsby in his swimming pool, and then turns the gun on himself. Hardly any people attend the funeral of Gatsby, probably because of his elusiveness, apart from Nick, some servants and his Gatsby's father Mr. Gatz, the true nature of Gatsby is revealed, and in the end Nick returns to the West, breaking up with Jordan, and he loses his respect for the Buchanan's after Tom told Wilson the yellow car was Gatsby's, but he shakes Tom's hand for the last time before leaving. Also starring Jack Thompson as Dr. Walter Perkins, Callan McAuliffe as Teen Jay Gatsby, Steve Bisley as Dan Cody and Max Cullen as Owl Eyes. DiCaprio gives a great performance as a man you are never sure whether to trust or not with his suspicious nature and not fully explained wealthy, Maguire is good as the man forced into all the significant situations, Mulligan is terrific as the beautiful young woman almost engulfed in the world Gatsby controls, and the supporting cast members get their moments too. The story told from the point of view of the simple man trying to make it in business is interesting, the love story going on between the mysterious millionaire and the innocent young woman is intriguing enough, the scenes with big lavish parties and things in the air work great in 3D, and the colour for costumes and backgrounds clashing with some gloominess works fabulously, it is a most watchable period romantic drama. It won the Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Make Up/Hair. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!"

","This movie had some overlap with another favorite movie of mine called the mount of Monte Cresto. The first 15 min were a little slow for me but then it really picked up. Leonardo Dicaprio was amazing...as always. The supporting cast did not disappoint either. I did not read the book so I'm not sure what book enthusiasts would have to say about the movie but I, at least, absolutely loved it. <br/><br/>The storyline was easy to follow with good Shakespearean themes that will make you think a little bit more about the bubble you live in. <br/><br/>The movie also delves into the deep, complex subject of human nature, which I always love to think about because there are so many angles to it. <br/><br/>Definitely worth a ticket to the theater."

","Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of the classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is certainly a loud, colourful and epic experience, its even in 3D. But does that style necessarily work for a story as delicate as The Great Gatsby? Oddly enough the answer is yes. This radical vision for the story is very much intended for this generation, a good example would be the modern soundtrack. This helped to make the story feel more relevant as you are listening to music that is current today, the way jazz would have been for the characters in 1922. You can take any frame of this film and you would have something worth hanging on the wall, it is stunning. Having said that, the most engaging part of the film is the performance from Leonardo DiCaprio. He is truly on the top of his game here; giving us a confused, vulnerable, loving and at times deranged Jay Gatsby. That is not to take away from the other actors, I was very skeptical of Tobey Maguire playing such a central character but he too pulls it out of the bag. Maguire manages to give us a compelling performance but also is able to step aside when Gatsby becomes the focal point, pulling off a shift of the spotlight that is impossible to do without dynamic and believable chemistry, which they do have. We are also treated to a good performance form Carey Mulligan and the best performance I've ever seen from Joel Edgerton. I was also surprised to be laughing as often as I was, the film has a lot of genuine humour and charm to offer including a hilarious intro for the character, Tom. The problems in the film lye in some of the visuals, as you can imagine some of the transitions are rather lavish and occasionally Luhrmann will go one too far with the effects. There are also numerous sound editing mistakes, which I found unusual for a film as big as this one. There is a dialogue scene which takes place in a moving car, some of the dubbing is laughably bad as you can see his mouth isn't even moving. The film also includes a lot of green screen and CGI which I don't have a problem with as long as it looks perfect. Anything short of that and you've lost the audience for that shot, this happened a few times during a lot of the fast car scenes which were shot with a lot of 3D-tastic camera moves. The car looked fine when it was actually a real car, it was when they inter cut with the CGI car that it looked terribly clunky and awkward. Putting those gripes aside the film is a magnificent work and a commendable effort to give this generation a new way in to this incredible story, a lot of young people will go see the film and come out wanting to read the book. <br/><br/>I saw the film in 2D so I can't comment on the 3D but from what I could gather this looked to be another interesting use of the tool, much like Life of Pi. I will certainly be seeing this again and I highly recommend it to you old sport."

","I don't understand the hype. I LOVE the book, but I found this movie confusing and trite, it felt like a conglomerate of fan service, anachronistic pop music, and awful pacing. The acting and casting were fine, but the overall execution is extremely poor in my opinion."
"cradda69","3","0","1","10 May 2020"," Awful adaptation
","This is a sub-par adaptation of what is one of the best books ever. This movie is not awful thru and thru, but basically a completely modernized version of the story and not a good representation of the book. The movie of course includes the usual gratuitous promiscuity that seems to be a necessary element or precondition of so many of today's films, along with 2000s music, not that of the early 1920s. What made the book excellent was, at least partly, the period in which it was set. However, there is a subliminal (for lack of a better word) mood to the book which the movie doesn't capture, except in a couple moments of genius. I might have actually found the movie more acceptable if it was titled differently, but this is certainly not The Great Gatsby: the movie might be worth a slightly higher grade if one watches it under that condition."
"plopperfrog","1","0","2","8 May 2020"," Bad movie based on a bad book
","This movie is bad, though seems to be an accurate representation of the bad book. I guess I just don't get it, all these characters are unbelievably stupid. I think this is a kings robe situation. It's nicely written, but for a generic story. Even if it wasn't generic at the time, it's primitave to say the least, like how a caveman drawing can't be compared to this film though it were the best of its time."

It obviously doesn't work and comes off ridiculous. This makes the film difficult to take seriously and quite hard to get into.<br/><br/>The characters are unlikeable, which isn't mandatory obviously, but it makes it hard to care when this film is essentially a love story. I suspect a lot of the fanfare over this film is the 20's imagery and DiCaprio, but that's isn't enough to make this film engaging - this certainly isn't a great DiCaprio performance in any case."

"michaeltrivedi","4","0","1","2 October 2019"," Best Reimagining of the Gatsby Story to Date
","I enjoyed this retelling on the Great Gatsby. Gatsby being my favorite novel, it was cool to see it come to life with Leo DiCaprio in the drivers' seat. There was also an essence about it that was different, that some may not have liked or admired. It was a hip-hop, modern, dance type vibe to it. Nothing like you would except for a sophisticated classic novel.<br/><br/>The story is the rise and fall of Gatsby, a poor boy who falls in love with a rich woman, and loses her. In an attempt to get her back, he becomes rich himself, through questionable means. But he is still unable to get the woman he loves, as she leaves him for a man who was born into wealth.<br/><br/>The story is really sad, much like the novel. I am not sure what the moral would be, but I guess you shouldn't chase a dream that seems impossible to attain. You should remain happy with what you have, and what is within your reach. Money doesn't necessarily make happiness, nor do parties and being a popular person.<br/><br/>I am not sure about the moral really, and whether Gatsby was right to be so greedy in life. It puts a great divide between the rich and poor, and makes people scared to cross the line to either side. And yet, there's a sophistication about chasing your dream. It gives you something to live for.<br/><br/>4 Stars."

The way Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio) loved Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) was so romantic and unique that, I believe, every girl would dream about that kind of love. I was completely shocked by the ending of the movie because I could not believe that Gatsby died. Such a tragic ending to such a great movie.

I love this movie so much that I cant get enough of watching it over and over again because of a number of reasons. For someone,who is obsessed with lavish, extravagant, luxury, beautiful, excessive life this is an irreplaceable option. Leonardo Di Caprio is the best choice for the role of Gatsby.

Great Gatsby-Final Project
Artistic Value- The Great Gatsby is a film that has many artistic values, which makes the storytelling very good. Its use of innovative style is what has made it such a great film. The use of modern and high-class clothing apparel throughout the film makes it interesting for the audience. Along with different use of camera angles, it provides the audience to really catch the emotions of the character. With these camera angles, it makes the audience feel as if they are part of the film. Artistically the camera is always zooming in or out really fast to capture all of the chaos and parties. But when the camera is on Gatsby it is very still and focused, to to show his deep purity and internal secrets/thoughts that he's holding on to. The Great Gatsby also has done a good job, with its style of music, it has a very modern twist to the 20's style of music. Every song throughout the film has played an important part because it helps the audience get entertained, and puts them on a dancing mood.
The film also has great use of color and lighting, from the warm and cool colors of their clothes to the lighting to capture all the parties and close up scenes. This film had more of non-diegetic style rather than diegetic, because of the music playing on the background and the cast talking to each other.
Entertainment Value- The popularity of this film is the storyline, the writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald's, The Great Gatsby captures and reflects America in the 1920s, shows how the corruption and the obsession of the American people through wealth and status, however it also tells us a love story; Gatsby is in love with someone who he thought loved him back. Gatsby never stopped loving her and he always did things just to see her and be with her. This has made this film to be known as a Classic; a film that won't get old throughout the years. It has become a film that many people have enjoyed and they continue to do so. A couple of scenes that have stood out the most were when Gatsby is shot from behind as he's coming out of the pool, he was waiting to receive a call from Daisy. A very powerful scene was when Gatsby's last words were "" Daisy,"" this proved just how much he really loved her. He never lost hope and his love for her even though she wasn't the one who called the day he got shot. Another scene would have to be when Gatsby and Daisy are gathered with everyone in a room just hanging out and it was a very thrilling scene, because Gatsby was about to tell Daisy's husband who he truly was.
Literary Value- Throughout the film Gatsby has always been a very confident man, he has a lot going on but still manages to show those around him that he is doing fine. One of his internal conflicts would be the love he has for Daisy. He just can't seem to let her go. She was the love of his life when they were younger and before he went to war. He had high hopes that when he came home he would be reunited with her, but came home only to realize she was already with someone else. But this didn't stop him from trying to be with her. Gatsby did many parties in high hopes that one day Daisy would attend and could be with her once again. This all has been a huge conflict with himself. But one of the people who was truly there for him and could see who he truly was; someone who was in love and just trying to get things in his life back together was Nick, he looked up to him, he was one of the few people that Gatsby impacted in his life. Nick was there when Gatsby passed away and no one of the many people who would attend his huge parties were there. He realized just how Daisy truly was, because she wasn't even there when Gatsby passed away.
Educational Value- In this film there are so many scenes that we can learn from and use it in our own type of lifestyle. For example in the film Gatsby does so many things for Daisy but did she ever thank him for everything he was doing for her? Gatsby would throw parties for Daisy hoping that one day she would show up, but never did. This film also shows us that no matter how much we love someone, if they don't already love you for who you are, then it doesn't matter how many changes we make because you will never win, you will never be satisfied. Another thing we can learn from this film is that you can't buy someones love with money. That's simple a phrase; you can't just be spending money everywhere, and whenever you want because that person might not love you back, but we gotta live through it, we can't give up on love. Gatsby didn't give up, he kept going after Daisy, he even ended up passing away but with his last words being Daisy.
In conclusion, I liked The Great Gatsby film. The film was really good, I just didn't like how it ended on a tragedy. I would recommend this movie, I say 10/10. I loved the characters, color and very lighting that was created with the parties or when they would make the camera angles move and how they would make it look like we are there experiencing everything with them."

In my opinion, if one has read the novel than the movie is kind of a let down. The movie only skims over the story line leaving out the much deeper context of the novel.And also makes the satires of the novel missing at times.
If one watches the movie as a standalone, irrespective of what is in the novel than this adaptation is the best of all the adaptions. The direction, acting and music just top notch."

There is too much ink on the environment rendering and the appearance of the characters, but the description of the details of the characters is slightly lacking. The complicated dancing scenes occupy too much space, and the characterization can only be shown through the development of the plot, especially the change of Daisy's attitude before and after. The explanation is too simple and abrupt, which makes people feel that this woman is a pure two. P.S. Making this film into 3D is purely a box office boost."

"d-48328","9","0","2","17 January 2019"," The Great Gatsby and the Great DiCaprio
","Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby was truly a film to remember. In the first scene, we are introduced with the main character, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire). He is depressed and his doctor tells him to write a story about his memories with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). One of the first shot is taken with a low angle lighting, which adds a sense of suspense to the scene. I myself have read the book and thought Luhrmann did a great job at emphasizing the most important parts of the book.
I have always been intrigued by the character of Gatsby. He is an incomprehensible man with some tenacious goals. In the film, Nick Carraway moves into a Long Island cottage next door to Gatsby's colossal mansion. We, as viewers, aren't introduced to Gatsby right away, which adds mystery to his character. The only thing we see is the ring he wears on his pinky finger.
Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's extravagant parties. There, he searches for Gatsby, asking everyone around him if they've seen him and if they got his invitation, but nobody really seems to care, they're just there for the party. Nick then finds Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) and is telling her about all the stories he just heard about Gatsby. But, Nick doesn't realize that he is standing right next to him. The camera then zooms in on Gatsby's ring and we are left waiting to see if Gatsby will mention anything to Nick. When he does, the camera then moves to his face and we see that his mouth is equidistant between a smile and a smirk. His blonde hair is perfectly affixed to his head, and his skin has a pink tone to it.
DiCaprio is the reason many people, including myself, see a movie. No matter what role he is given, he is able to exceed expectations and play the role better than anyone else who would've received the part. With that being said, I believe all the characters suited their roles admirably. At first, I didn't think Carey Mulligan (Daisy Fay) was best for the character she portrayed, but as the film went on I realized that she suited her role very well.
We are first introduced to Daisy when Nick goes to her and her husband Tom Buchanan's (Joel Edgerton) house for supper. She is in a room with Jordan Baker, they are playing around, laughing with the curtains blowing aimlessly in the breeze throughout the room. Then we get a close-up shot of Daisy's glorious ring, which astounds Nick. Then she raises her head up and I immediately thought she didn't correspond to her part.
But, I was later proved wrong by her extraordinary acting. She is able to be elegant, classy, and a little bit sassy, just as I imagined how the character is in the book. This stuck out the most when she sees Gatsby for the first time in five years. Gatsby asks Nick if he would invite her over for tea, so he could see the love of his life again and try to convince her to be with him.
Although, I would like to mention that I didn't like how it seems as though Gatsby is trying to use Nick in order to see Daisy again. Throughout the movie, it seemed as though he did all these things for Nick because he knew that Daisy is his cousin and he could somehow see her again through Nick. But, Nick didn't seem to mind and he was glad to do this favor for him with nothing in return.
Now, going back to the scene with Daisy and Gatsby, I thought Mulligan and DiCaprio did an excellent job at convincing the viewers that they're still in love, especially when DiCaprio gives her a tour of his house. They bonded very well in the scene and you could see the love they still have for each other in their eyes.
I believe they were the right people for each other but met at the wrong time. Gatsby was convinced that you can change the past when you really can't and that's where he went wrong. He tried so many different things to try and convince Daisy to be with him, but there was no way of changing how things ended up. Even if they did end up together, their love would have been different than the first time they met.
Overall, the film was excellent. The costume choices were outstanding and the actors were ideal for the characters they played. However, I did not like that Luhrmann added music from today to a film that is supposed to set in the 1920s, it seemed awkward and didn't really fit in well with the scenes. But, I will say it was unique and a bold move. Luhrmann and the actors did an excellent job at making the book come to life and it honestly couldn't have been any better."

","10 May 2013. First there was the overly confident young punk quick draw in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and of course the major breakthrough as the impoverished heartthrob of Titanic (1997) two years later, and only a year later the fascinating duel role in The Man in the Iron Mask between the innocent, naÃ¯ve young man and the opulent, narcissistic king. Along with the multi-role characters of Catch Me If You Can (2002), the intensely personal portrait of a secretive life of Howard Hughes in The Aviator in 2004, Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby is bigger than life, just as the movie Titanic he starred in. The captivated, close-up starry and bloodshot eyes of Daisy was immediately spell-binding who starred in one of the most memorable Dr. Who television episodes (2007) as Sally Sparrow. Finally, and the anchor of the movie with his co-starring presence in and his strong voice-over storytelling throughout the movie of Tobey Maguire kept this over-stylized and adult fairytale grounded with substantive insight and figurative narrative that captured the essence of fictional writing. As equally satisfying is Tobey Maguire's character's own backstory that begins and ends the movie, echoing the voice over and more hidden presence found in Stand By Me (1986).<br/><br/>The only glaring weaknesses come in the beginning half of the movie where the art design landscape backdrop at one point was too obviously animated in its appearance and the audio track was out of sync with the too apparent impression of the voices being dubbed, oddly in contrast to the criticism that came from the live audio musical singing experienced in Les Miserables (2012).<br/><br/>What was particularly fascinating was the editing and fusion of both movie and novel storytelling along with the incorporation of writings graphics. With the suggestive, visual magic of Moulin Rouge (2001) in the first half, this richly romantic drama brought back the intense relational emotive heart wrenching story of romantic love that made Titanic so successful. The evolving garishness of this the period drama has the similar elements of the culturally explosive backdrop of the romance drama Slumdog Millionaire (2008), the dark richness of the tangled triangular relationship of Interview with a Vampire (1995), or the more spiritual fantasy of enduring love in What Dreams May Come (1998) and even DeCaprio's more recent love interest in Inception (2010).<br/><br/>The romantic connection of intimacy resonates at the same level as period love drama The Reader (2008) or the ending of If Only (2004), the love epic The English Patient (1996). At the opposite superlative end, just as overly-stylized and hyper-dramatic and over the top in the musical Chicago (2002) way or the fascinating visually stunning style of the more recent silent love story of The Artist (2011), the French romantic class A Man and A Woman (1966) captured the richness of the direct, black and white emotive simplicity of romantic love. This movie echoes the bigger than life enduring romance found in the Civil War love story of Cold Mountain (2003) or even one the movie classic of all time Doctor Zhivago (1965). This remake of The Great Gatsby is the stand out movie of the big hits of the 2013 season, making it Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress nominee material."

","This is my first, VERY short, review of a movie. Simply put, the way Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio and every other actor play their roles is close to perfect. I will buy the novel and read it, despite the fact that I know the story. Maybe I should have read the book first, as I usually do, but still this time it is the other way around, even though the novel was written way before this movie. Still, in my opinion, a must-see film!"

","I must say this is one of my favorite movies of all time! It features some very talented actors one being my favorite, Leonard DiCaprio. That so happens to take place in one of my favorite times the roaring 1920s. I had read the book once before but I don't quite recall what difference there is between the movie and the book, sorry! <br/><br/> Let's get to it! The story line is about a young man that grew up poor but had dreams that surpassed his meager existence. His hunger for success drove him to make an unnerving decision, being he was just a boy, to take a chance on his own. This led him to a spontaneous stroke of good luck when he ran into a drunk but very wealthy sailor that was in trouble at sea. His repayment for saving this mans life was to be tailored into what an educated, powerful and wealthy man should appear to be. He was taught how to dress, act, and speak accordingly. This led him to a greater opportunity to be successful or at least allowed him to fake it until he made it. Then, came Daisy! Daisy was a beautiful and privileged woman that captured Gatsby's heart. They met prior to him being drafted into the military. There, just the thought of being with Daisy is all he needed to stay alive. He wrote and wrote but received no response. Though, he refused to give up hope for his one true love, Daisy on the other hand feared for the worst. After not receiving any signs of his existence, she reluctantly moved on with her life. She then got married to one of the wealthiest most eligible bachelors, Tom Buchanan. 
 
Now, still with much faith, Gatsby has come out of the military alive and well and ready to fight for his woman by all means necessary. Instead of fighting with fist, this fight was strictly about money. Gatsby had the grand idea of throwing the most lavish parties in New York, in hopes that Daisy would one day show up and he would be able to proclaim his love. By some great miracle, Daisy's cousin, Nick so happened to stay in a little house at the corner of Gatsby lavish mansion. Nick then became Gatsby's lifeline and aided him in trying to get Daisy back. It worked! They finally reunited with the help of Nick and then the lavish parties came to an end which led to much speculation about whom caused this sudden halt to the festivities. After plenty of close calls, Daisy's Husband, Mr. Buchanan has finally figured out what is going on and has also proclaimed his love for Daisy as well. She then realizes that regardless of how she feels about Gatsby he will remain that same poor boy and will never be able to compete with Mr. Buchanan. In a blank of an eye, her once happy life was turning upside down quickly. Due to Mr. Buchanan's own skeletons an unforeseen occurrence has happened with his mistress and coincidentally, Daisy was the main culprit. Finally, due to Daisy's selfish act Gatsby has made is ultimate and final attempt to gain her love by taking the blame for a tragic event caused by Daisy. Only this last chance at love led to his demise. 
 
 So that was my recap of what happened in this awesome movie. It was a love story, with action that always had you at the edge of your seat. The sound track was also great and helped tie this whimsical tale together. I think everyone should go watch this if you haven't yet. You will not regret it!"

","As a junior in high school, The Great Gatsby was a required book that we read and analyze. At first getting into the story and understanding the world of Nick and Gatsby was a struggle, but for it to be brought to life many years later certainly helped me gain insight into what it would've been like. <br/><br/>I was astonished with the amount of direct quotes that came from the book.

","Fabulous. Over the top. DiCaprio perfect. Faithful to the book with Maguire as Nick Carraway looking uncannily like Fitzgerald himself. The book is almost impossible to transfer to the screen as language is a large part of its effect. Cleverly, Luhrmann has thus made Fitzgerald's text part of the movie by having Carraway narrate it and even writing the words on the screen as he says them."

"Party_Guy1","10","0","1","20 March 2017"," My perception of the novel
","Here's my perception of this novel which I had to read as part of my school curriculum. I feel that the plot including Gatsby's aspiration for acquiring his love back and its correspondence with the setting really reflects American Culture. Not to mention my need to see the 2013 movie featuring Leonardo Dicaprio and Carey Mulligan who had a proficient understanding of the philosophies of Gatsby and Daisy. Both of whom knew how to portray complex characters in the 1920's all while being persuasive to the audience. Notice how almost three-quarters of the dialogue in the movie had similarity to the book. Also, the physical appearance of Daisy really works to reflect the time period and the role of women during America's Gilded Age. In the 1920's the attitude of men towards women would be deemed ultraconservative if you were to ask someone in this age. Their primary role was to appeal to men with their glamorous physical appearance just as Daisy displays in the movie. You are able to notice with her roaring 20's hairstyle and dress which she constantly wears to Tom and later in the novel, Gatsby will feel satisfied. Leonardo DiCaprio's dress-to-impress portrayal really worked to reflect the persona of upper an upperclassman during this time period. I find these qualities in his charismatic tone, the yellow Rolls Royce in which he uses to take Nick to the speak-easies, as well as his luxurious estate which he uses to lure Nick in constantly. On the other hand, I love how Gatsby's flashbacks which include the one's from his war experience help allude to his rude awakening in the final falling action. The novel as an entirety was a book of surprises and contradictions. It proved that the American Dream for some people can erode which is a theme in the novel 'Of Mice and Men' which you guys most likely have read based what I perceive as your taste in literature on this thread. Francis Scott Fitzgerald is truly a genius with the way he took the audience on a roller coaster with their expectations. You have the appearances of Jay Gatsby followed by the Buchanans featuring romantic themes, and ruined dreams. Whatever impression you guys get out of this novel, I feel the subjective matters are enhanced by the primary themes. Being set in the 'Gilded Age', the author knew how to express the whole underlying message of the time period that shimmering appearances can serve as a cloak for hiding mass issues. Characters like Gatsby and especially Meyer Wolfsheim who were involved in a lot of dirty business had their consciences taken over by lust for money. Wealthy people like them living their lavish lives as part of the bourgeois were only broken compasses if you examine their concepts of morality. I respect Fitzgerald for the way he portrays this because there is a connection to the themes of the time period. Contrary to the common philosophy of the characters living their lavish lives as the beneficiaries of America's industrial boom, Nick Carraway is a giant juxtaposition with the way he is viewed as wise and honest despite seeing those exact characteristics in himself (the bedrock for Gatsby's behavior, funny enough). This is seen in his quote taking place in chapter 3 of the book: ""Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known."" At this point in the story, Nick is reminiscing the time he spent in West Egg of Long Island with his distant cousin Daisy and her husband Tom whom she was married to at the time. From this experience, he viewed people of vast wealth as being selfish and careless based on the reckless actions of Daisy she committed while thinking being wealthy constitutes being invincible. These actions are described by Nick in Chapter 4: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made."" Regardless of how Francis Fitzgerald wishes to convey the attitudes of rich people to the audience during this time period, Gatsby's portrayal definitely intrigued me the most. Now the reason I say this is because the author has this method of deterioration he enacts on the character gradually chapter by chapter. At first, his expressions with Nick help convey a sense of welcome and politeness but that decays over to the point of the tragic death of Myrtle Wilson in which he is responsible for. Nick is able to describe Gatsby's transformation which essentially lays out this novel in Chapter 6: ""It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment."" This quotation signifies the harm that has been done to Nick who has been viewing Jay Gatsby as his source for inspiration and also represents Gatsby as the epitome for rich folks in this age, lacking morality and turning out as a heart breaker once you dig into the personality. Overall, what I admire most about Fitzgerald's work is that his portrayal of Gatsby, even in the form of a character reflects America socioeconomic state. 10-star rating? I think yes!"
"ethantheanimal","9","0","1","15 February 2017"," The Great Gatsby Class Review
","In the Great Gatsby, there are four different settings all symbolizing a different type of person in the roaring 20s. The East Egg of long island where the old rich lived, Like the Buchanans. On the other side of the bay are the newly rich, like Gatsby, Nick Caraways neighbor, who are always partying and drinking. There's also the city which symbolizes those who dream and aspire to become the newly rich and pursue their dreams. Then there's the valley of ashes, the working class people that mine coal and other low end jobs.<br/><br/>In the valley of ashes there is a billboard with a set of eyes that over look the valley. On the sign the name, Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, is at the top of the sign. However, they seem to symbolize God staring down upon and judging American society as a moral wasteland, but that's never really brought up. The eyes are just there.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, It seems like Gatsby hit Mr. Buchanan's mistress with is car and killed her. Everyone assumes it was Gatsby who hit her as he was driving home drunk with Daisy in the Car because there was the witness that saw the car that hit them and Tom knew Gatsby was in that car. But it was really Daisy who was driving and hit the lady. Gatsby was letting her drive and she spun the car out of control, but never revealing it was really her.<br/><br/>This was a spectacular movie, the way it was filmed was outstanding with it's very mysterious vibe and the actors were all amazing."
"lorenzomalfer","8","0","1","11 January 2017"," A great movie
","I really like this movie because its plot is very enjoyable, but it has also a moral and it wants to impart a message to the viewers that, in my opinion, can be read in several ways. An important symbol of this film are the eyes on the billboard advertising, that we can see several times; this symbol is absolutely related with the opening lines of the film (""In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice. Always try to see the best in people""), in which the narrator, Nick Carraway, told us that usually he does not judge other people and he always tries to find the best aspects in everybody, also when the positive aspects are not so evident. The eyes on the billboard do the same: they are a metaphor of the eyes of God, which looks and observes everything in our world, but God never takes part in our affairs and actions, he never says us anything; however he always knows everything (in fact only Nick and these eyes know what really happen in the car crash) and he also knows that, also if this world is not always fair (for example with Gatsby it is not) one day he will judge everybody fairly. Another important symbol of this story is the green light that we see in the first scene of the film: according to me, this light could represent the aims and the dreams which everybody has, which not always we can achieve; but hope is the last to die, and this is the reason why in the scene of his death, Gatsby sees for the last time the light, he hears the phone ringing and hopes that Daisy has finally chosen him. Daisy and Tom Buchanan represent the richest part of the society, which is used to the welfare, because they have own it for generations, and they could do everything to maintain it, therefore they are careless about all the other person that they meet. At first the viewer can think that Gatsby is one of them, but actually he is completely different: he is a self-made man that was born poor and has made all his riches during his life. Moreover he, unlike them, is ready to lose everything for the only girl that he ever truly love: Daisy. I think that finally Daisy decides to stay with Tom not just because she does not have a strong personality to leave her husband, but mainly because she subconsciously knows that she is more similar to Tom than Gatsby. The most significant locations of this romance are: the swimming pool of the Gatsby's house, which is associated with Gatsby, because during the parties lots of drunk and happy people used to swim in his pool, enjoying his hospitality, but in the same pool he is killed, alone, without nobody that really care about him. The Perkins Sanitarium, which is associated with Nick Carraway, and represents the problems that this character has after his experiences in New York, and the difficulties for him to make sense of what happened. The garden of the Buchanan's house, which is associated with Tom, Daisy and all those people only interested in keep their reaches and earn always more money, without caring about anybody else. The garage where the Myrtle's husband works, which represents all those poor people that work a lots but have a low salary and so are ready to do everything for the rich people. According to me the moral of this story is that we always have to try to reach our aims, achieve our dreams, also if this path looks too hard, too far or too difficult for us. On the other hand we have also to understand when the dreams that we are looking for, are already behind us: we can't live into the past, also if it keeps on holding us, and we have to go towards the future, like ""...boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly...""."

","""The Great Gatsby"" is an American English-language movie from 2013 and the writer and director here is Australian Oscar-nominated filmmaker Baz Luhrmann. The movie is three years old now and it runs for slightly over 2 hours. The title character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio and his co-lead is Tobey Maguire. You will find more known names in here like Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Isla Fisher. Even literature plebs like myself will recognize that the film is based on the literary work by F. Scott Fitzgerald and there have been many adaptations from this one already. The Robert Redford movie won two Oscars and so did this one here as Luhrmann's wife Catherine Martin triumphed in the Costume Design and Production Design categories. And I can totally see why. In terms of the artistic approach, this film is certainly a feast. It is really good visually and with that I am obviously not referring to special effects or anything, but to costumes, makeup and sets. This is for sure the best component of the film. But there are good performances as well. I am a bit divided when it comes to Maguire here, but ignoring him completely from all awards ceremonies that year may have been a bit harsh. Still, Di Caprio, Edgerton and Mulligan are probably on another level here and they really worked their characters. Admittedly, they also had much more to work with as Maguire's character really only somewhat seemed to be a mean to show us how important, special and perhaps even great Gatsby is. You could almost have a drinking game for every time he mentions the name Gatsby in the first 30 minutes, right before DiCaprio actually visibly participates in this film and story. Initially, Gatsby is treated like a phenomenon, almost like a God and there is talk about whether he really exists. The longer the film goes the more we actually find out that he does and that he is as vulnerable and human as everybody else when a story about a lost love returns to his life and also there is some scrutiny on his possibly criminal professional life.<br/><br/>Is Gatsby a good or bad guy? Is he responsible for tragedy in other people's lives? Can you really blame him for what he does and who he is? It's for you to decide I guess and everybody will perceive him differently I'm sure. While I would not say this was a great watch, I still believe that there are great components to it. I already mentioned the visual side, but there's more than that. Some scenes are also acted/crafted in a way that really impressed. Some information my background here: This was the second time I watched this film I believe. I saw it right after it came to theaters a couple years ago here in Germany and I would say I liked it as much as I did back then and even if it is a film you want to see on the big screen because of its beauty, I still wouldn't say it gets much worse if you see it on a small screen and already know about the events, at least roughly. It was still pretty decent. I have not read the novel this is based on, so my review almost exclusively comes from what I saw from the theatrical perspective. I cannot say I liked or disliked this film more than the book, but looking at critics receptions, both Oscar-winning Gatsby movies did not bode that well unfortunately. Maybe some of them just love the book too much. I myself enjoyed the viewing for sure and I believe this film created 2-3 really memorable film characters that people will still talk a couple decades from now. I think you should check it out and some actors really shine in it, especially DiCaprio who is commanding the screen from the moment he first appears. A must-see for fans of period pieces."

It was unique and we rarely see that in film anymore. The whole It being set in 1925 but yet the music was Current dance tracks was Shocking to me because it was so different from the usual but yet I couldn't see any other music for the movie, It just worked! <br/><br/>Also Leoanrdo And Tobey killed it! Tobey Maguire played his character perfectly! A non confrontational guy who is trying to make it in the big city and meets his neighbour who in every way is extraordinary. He plays this quite guy where as time goes on doesn't know who Gatsby really is and in such doesn't know if he should be friends with him or not. As the movie progresses though he can't help but think the guy is awesome. <br/><br/>Anyways Leo And Tobey play both nice but very mysterious characters and they play them in very different ways! All in all the acting, Directing and writing was all phenomenal! To the director Baz Luhrmann, Absoulety Splendid Ol' Sport... ;)"
"laraganz","9","0","1","15 December 2016"," i liked this movie, i understood how to ""use"" my mind.
","I really like this movie because is not so easy to understand the real message that the author wants to show, so you have to thoroughly understand the film and look inside yourself. This movie is based on the look. there are different kind of people. for example Daisy and Buchanan want to appear as good people so they care of what people say, while Gatsby doesn't care about what the people, so he is very different. I think the opening lines aren't related to the billboard advertising of the optometrist; the opening lines is ""my father gave me some advice. Always try to see the best in people,"" those lines speaks about looking but in a different way than the billboard. For me the billboard advertising represent God's eyes, and that he see and he knows everything. the other symbols that i found in the film are the green light and the weather. the green light at the end of Daisy's deck represents his dream, which is Daisy. the green light is always present in the most important scenes of the movie, in particular at the end when Gatsby thought he finally reached Daisy, but he didn't because Daisy was kind of unreachable. the weather represent Gatsby's feeling and emotions, it changes when Gatsby's emotion changes. At the start of the book Gatsby seems as though he's equal in immorality to the Buchanan, because of the lavish parties. It's only later in the movie that we come to understand that Gatsby has acquired his vast wealth with the hope of one day reuniting with his first and only love, Daisy: but at the end she choose Tom Buchanan because she prefer wealth to love, and I think because she a hasn't a strong personality so she was influenced by Tom. the four main location in the film are Gatsby's house that i associate with Gatsby and his loneliness that was broken when daisy went into his house, Daisy and Tom's house that I associate with both of them plus Gatsby because when i remember their house I always think about the green lights, so i think about all of them, Valley of ashes that i associate with the George Wilson and the place of 'crime', as the crime who committed Tom to 'made love' with Wilson's house and the crime that Wilson committed to kill Gatsby, Nick Caraway's house that i associate Daisy and Gatsby because is as their shelter of love."
"robby-76507","8","0","1","15 December 2016"," My thoughts on the Great Gatsby
","The importance of the eyes in my opinion is that they represent God in a sense. The opening lines of the film says to see the good of people, which relates with the eyes watching over the people. The green light at the dock and Gatsby's Ring are used as a symbol. <br/><br/>Tom and Daisy represent the old rich folk. I can't seem to figure out the moral of the movie, which makes want to research what it is. Also, I feel I will watch the movie again. <br/><br/>I believe that Daisy chooses Tom because Gatsby started shouting and yelling when Tom insulted him. <br/><br/>The four locations of the movie are: New York, West Egg, East Egg, The Valley of Ashes. I associate New York with Nick because he talks about how he wanted to live there. West Egg would be Gatsby with his mansion. East Egg would be Daisy waiting for Gatsby. The Valley of Ashes associates Wilson and his wife in the lower class."
"evanlivi","8","0","1","13 December 2016"," A Elegent and deap movie.
","The great Gatsby is a visually stunning and colorful film with a touch of many different themes. The theme of eyes through out the movie represents the eyes of god, ever judging the actions of the world and ignored by the world forgetting their god-fearing responsibility and their commandments that once bound society. With their illegal drinking, immoral affairs and back handed dealing. The eyes also represent how much is left unseen by people at the surface level. This theme relates to the opening line of the film were nick says that he has began to only see people's evils no longer fooled by the outer image that people project. The characters Daisy and tom Buchannan as representatives of the old wealth. Well there are many themes in the movie I don't believe their to be any set moral to the story. There are several locations through out the movie such as the desolate valley of ash often associated with Tom Buchanan's mistress in the form of a dirty almost revolting slum, other sets include the buccans and Gatsby's mansions that serve as signs of their extravagance Gatsby's represents this as well as his desire to be with daisy, another set is the humble abode of Nick Caraway which serves as contrast to the other locations. The great Gatsby in question is a man that brings a flourish and flavour to the movie with his elegant and cool swagger although he is also shown to be flawed and looses the love of his life because he is to forceful and in his attempts to woo her he drives her away. All in all, the movie contains a lot of depth colour and their just some thing cool about it its worth a look at."

","What is the importance of eyes in this film? We see the billboard advertising an optometrist looking over the Valley of ashes at least twice in the film. Does it relate in any way to the opening lines of the film? Yes it could be rated with the sense of justice Also, what do these eyes represent?The big eyes which appears in the movie represents God and his omnipresence. Also, it could represent the lack of justice that is always possible to feel in these scenes. Are there any other symbols alluded to in the film?The green light in the pear of Buchanan represents the hope that Gatsby always have, major reason why he was so ambitious. The location of it shows where is his hope. Gatsby mansion was used in a very good way to represent how vague his life was despite all parties and people visiting and passing in his house.<br/><br/>Daisy and Tom represent emptiness, self-ilusion and the ego in the story; even can represent the ascension of those feelings back in the 1920's<br/><br/>What is the moral of the story at the end of the book... or is there a moral to the story at all? Why does Daisy choose to stay with Tom instead of going with Gatsby? Maybe because she was scared of being with Gatsby and his anger mental instability . In the end of the story, the moral that the book and the movie left us is the idea of simplicity is what really matters, the appearance and the things of every person is the foolishest part, that times goes fast but we should take care more from each other instead of just living he moment. Perhaps these views transmitted, this story is no more than an analogy with the life and how the things really are."

","This film is one of Hollywood's greatest accomplishments, in my honest opinion. I read this book in high school and fell in love with the roaring 20s during the process. I haven't been able to shake off that admiration for that era ever since. So you can imagine my excitement when the film was announced. Yes, I know there was a film already made about it, but the thing that really caught my eye was that Leonardo DiCaprio himself would play Gatsby. My admiration for DiCaprio is unlike any other. He's one of the greatest actors of our time, without a doubt.<br/><br/>The acting was exceptional, and the screenplay mesmerizing. The film translated from the book perfectly. Not a thing was left out. It was exactly how I pictured in when I first read the pages all those years ago. Some can argue that Toby Maguire's acting was a little flat, but that can be expected so it doesn't come as much of a surprise to me. The casting was absolutely marvelous. Everything was just perfect. It's one of my favorite films of all time."

"ehauke","9","0","1","4 October 2016"," ""The Great Gatsby"" IS actually great
","Bringing a completely new twist to the classic saying ""if it is meant to be, they will come back"", The Great Gatsby is way more than your everyday love story. Based on the book ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, there is two films produced, one in 1974 and the more modern one, in 2013. The 2013 movie, directed by Baz Luhrmann, features key actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. Not only is the relationships between the characters spot on, the sound track emphasizes the era the story took place in, and the set was nothing short of grand.<br/><br/>Even with the era set in the roaring twenties, the plot is relative to any modern situation. Once Nick Carraway moves back into town, he quickly befriends his neighbor Jay Gatsby. The friendship they form is abnormal considering their different status and personality. Nick's cousin across the bay, Daisy Buchannan, had a prior relationship with Gatsby but ended when he left for the military. However, the connection between the two remained. While Gatsby is trying to steal Daisy away from her husband Tom, the morals between family and friends are put into question.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio portrays the main role of Jay Gatsby, and putting on a phenomenal performance he does. His transitions of emotions perfectly depict the characters desperation for Daisy's love. He throws massive parties carrying a wealthy and cool composure in attempts to gain her attention. When he feels he was not getting what he wanted, anger would take over and his entire body would tense, sometimes leading to heated verbal or physical altercations. In every relationship Gatsby had, it is made clear to the audience what his feelings towards the person are.<br/><br/>The music playing throughout the movie is relative not only to the situation, but to the designated time frame while putting a contemporary modern spin on it. There is trumpet solos while scanning over the city at parties, houses, or in the streets. The voices of artists are raspy and go into riffs that reflect the influence of jazz culture in the twenties. There is also upbeat songs featuring current artists like Jay-Z and Fergie that can relate to the movie, but also project to an audience in the twenty first century.<br/><br/>Luhrmann does an amazing job expressing the social divide through the set. In the rich part of town around the bay, ginormous mansions line the shore. There is light reflecting everywhere showing how large and bright the atmosphere is where there is wealth. Going into the working-class suburbs, such as the ""Valley of Ashes"", things begin to gloom. As if there is a cloud of darkness following those who do not have money, people are coated in coal dust and the entire town is filthy. Important even today, the emphasis on the differences in social rank is apparent.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby brings a timeless appeal that can reach to any generation. Incorporating multiple genres, it shows no matter the year, trends from the past are still present in our current society, and will continue to be in the future. Anyone can relate to the story, making this movie bound to be a favorite for years to come."
"picassomanhdan","7","0","1","8 September 2016"," an excellently adapted piece of art from the original
","It's delighting that the movie provides an authentic representation of what the novel is supposed to be. The vibrancy, tempo and narration closely resemble of those dating back to the 20th century Hollywood films, bringing the most of a departed time. I adore the fact that several key prose were made into dialogues and narrative lines; however, the screenplay writers seem to refrain from inserting complex prose that in fact add vivid connotations to the novel. Although this decision is justifiable because the movie should be able to reach to a wide audience as a commercial movies, I can't stop myself but indulge in a rueful smile of a possibility the the essence of this piece of literature can be weaved into another form of art.<br/><br/>The characters are brilliantly portrayed; I doubt if any of them is misleadingly or falsely depicted. This is expected from an experienced and renowned cast like this. Nevertheless, leaving some details out in order for the movie to span a controllable amount of time deprives some key personalities of certain characters (Jordan Baker was not said to cheat in her golf tournament, the romance between Caraway and Baker is not illustrated). Even though inconsequential to the main themes and story lines, the satisfactory feeling is lessened by such small setbacks like these.<br/><br/>I was a little bit disturbed when the script makes Gatsby outraged at the scene in town when Gatsby confronted Tom Buchanan about his affair with Daisy Buchanan. Little does this addition significantly alter the portrayal of Gatsby, yet I still find it unjustifiable to cast in a more negatively-inclined light.<br/><br/>The music complements the movie impeccably. A whole range of my favourite artists constitute to the soundtrack: Florence + the Machine, Amy Winehouse, Sia and Lana Del Rey. I always see a thread connecting their music style together. The Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin fits perfectly into the context, bringing home the idea of the cosmopolitan and glamorous life of an American in the 20th century. Essentially the characteristic of Jazz is of utmost importance."

Nevertheless, the movie is a great experience due to the captivating music and the songs played throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio amazed me with his wonderful portrayal of the character Jay Gatsby. After watching the movie I felt a very strong connection to Jay Gatsby and could feel all his pain, happiness, hope and a plethora of other feelings. I got this amazing feeling that all the glamour and pomp we might see around in our lives is all just that, an illusion which we surround ourselves in to block out the inextinguishable anguish all of us experience. I am reminded of the lyrics to Linkin Park's 'In the End'.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say that 'The Great Gatsby' is an amazing roller coaster ride and everybody should experience it at least once in their lifetime."

","An idiosyncratic Australian filmmaker takes on an American classic.<br/><br/>It's a famous story through another lens, but it is a story so rooted in a certain time and place that it has proved elusive for filmmakers.<br/><br/>But with that said. Baz Lurhmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" demands attention. What he did for ""Romeo + Juliet"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" were just warm ups for this movie.<br/><br/>Baz Lurhmann cuts loose with the effects as we knew he would and as he probably should; this is the fifth film version of the story (counting a silent one), and a straight retelling of the tale would have been superfluous, but despite torrents of tinsel, stylised sets and spraying champagne, the story of the enigmatic Jay Gatsby and his love for Daisy Buchanan still has to hit us on a personal level.<br/><br/>I think Jay Gatsby does emerge thanks in large part to Leo DiCaprio, but it takes until about the halfway mark before we can see through all the distractions to get a handle on him.<br/><br/>As in the book itself, there is a long build up to Jay Gatsby's first appearance - like the build up before Captain Ahab appears on the quarterdeck in ""Moby Dick"". Oddly, the first view of Leo in the role reminded me of Alan Ladd as Gatsby.<br/><br/>All the film versions use narration to varying degrees, and Lurhmann dips into the prose often, following the book more closely than one would have expected, especially the way Daisy disappears from Gatsby's life towards the end. I think Toby Maguire also hits the right note as Nick Carraway, the teller of the tale, although he gets through a lot more business than in the novel. Lurhmann's version brings out the unevenness of the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy - more so than in the 1948, 1974 or 2000 versions. Gatsby has never forgotten her and has become almost obsessive, but she has moved on.<br/><br/>Daisy takes the easy options and avoids confrontation, whereas Jay is impulsive and daring and doesn't mind confrontation at all. Cary Mulligan is close to the best film Daisy Buchanan - not as highly strung as in Mia Farrow's portrayal.<br/><br/>1922 is now far away, but the conflicted emotions surrounding Gatsby and Daisy still strike a chord. I think this is Baz Lurhmann's best film, and Leo DiCaprio hasn't hurt his reputation at all with this portrayal."

","I'm not a fan of the book even after doing a thorough analysis on it. But this movie blew me away. It follows through with the book very closely, including some of its key symbolism. The movie did a splendid job in depicting the subtle moods and themes of the story. Visually, it was definitely a feast for the eyes: the costumes, the lavish parties, the cars.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie has to be the perfect cast. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical of Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. I'm so happy to be wrong. DiCaprio did a splendid job in reflecting Gatsby's character, from his ambition that led him to success to his blind hope that led to his demise. Carey Mulligan (Daisy), Elizabeth Debicki (Jordan), and Joel Edgerton (Tom) also fitted their roles very well. The only person that I do feel is sort of out of place is Tobey Maguire as Nick. I had to get use to it.<br/><br/>We all know what happens in the end, but it still leaves me with a dreadful feeling, especially seeing it visually on the big screen. I think Luhrmann did a fantastic job in delivering the Great Gatsby both visually and through the soundtrack. I love the movie, but I still don't like reading it."

","Believe it or not, F. Scott Fitzgerald was not universally adored by his contemporaries; hardly any ""great"" writer is. When ""The Great Gatsby"" was published in 1925, critics accused it of being light, unconvincing and celebrating the same decadence modern readers now see as the target of the novel's satire. It's ironic to think that the same insults lobbed at the book a little less than a century ago were used almost verbatim by modern film critics about the movie.<br/><br/>The film starts with our narrator Nick Carraway (Maguire) receiving treatment for alcoholism. He recalls from his past the story of Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) a mysterious millionaire and neighbor who threw some of the most lavish parties the North Shore of Long Island has ever seen. Nick's cousin Daisy (Mulligan) lives across the bay in a loveless marriage with old-money magnate Tom Buchanan (Edgerton). Seems years ago she and Gatsby had had a brief but fruitful courtship, interrupted by the events of WWI. After meeting and getting to know Gatsby, Nick agrees to reunite the two thus unraveling a complex tapestry of corruption, infidelity, power and tragedy.<br/><br/>In fairness to director Baz Luhrmann, Warner Bros. and Leonardo DiCaprio, making a film based on a universally acclaimed literary classic like this was always going to be a losing proposition. If you thought Harry Potter and Stephen King fans were annoying nitpicks, imagine having a movie be ripped to shreds by supposed centuries of ""good taste"" who have had nearly a century to analyze the source material. Yet as stated earlier, those same bastions of good taste dismissed the same story nary a generation ago. Are we to believe the film is worthy of the same critical reevaluation?<br/><br/>While the film does have some resplendent moments of visual intricacy, and some metaphorical complexity, The Great Gatsby at times feels emotionally un-engaging and unconvincing. Fixating strictly on the visual, we get the same emphasis on style over substance that plagued Luhrmann's other work Moulin Rouge! (2001), only this time we get to see the art direction without seizure inducing editing. I call this an improvement, even if the outstanding Jim Broadbent is completely absent from this film.<br/><br/>Still, when Luhrmann's superficial approach is warranted the film really flies. The Gatsby parties as well as the fun-loving moments at the Plaza Hotel are infectious. You want to be amid the bacchanalia, dancing the night away, leering at lavish mansion set- pieces and basking in all that insanity. It's inviting, it's seductive and for all involved in the story, it proves a perversion of the American Dream.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out the film's bold choice in soundtrack. While many critics poo-poo the idea of an anachronistic soundtrack, I for one found it inspired and felt it enhanced the story. For the sake of historical accuracy, they could have gone with Cole Porter all the way but by injecting liberal doses of Amy Winehouse, will.i.am and Lana Del Rey, the audience is lulled into a state of comfort. Thus when the story reaches its zenith, even the most libertine of us will feel a sense of moral indignation.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint most every naysayer has about this film is it's ""not Gatsby"". I agree; it really isn't Fitzgerald's vision and since we are talking about a literary classic, that should count for something. But if the book never existed, if this movie was an original idea, would we still hold it with such disdain? Probably not; we'd probably just brush it off as an entertaining, light and decadent film whose story suffers from its visual opulence. Such backhanded praise isn't exactly an endorsement but it's also not the worst thing said about a Baz Luhrmann film."

","This film adapts the greatest novel of Scott Fitzgerald, which explores the dark past and love affairs of a wealthy American millionaire in the twenties. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, which ensures the screenplay with Craig Pearce, has Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role.<br/><br/>The film has a good script, faithful to the novel. Unfortunately, the dramatization soften the symbolism of certain elements. The optician signal, for example, is no more than a piece of scenario. Leo DiCaprio was at the height of his role and, although isn't a particularly inspired interpretation, sought to incorporate his character's personality. Tobey Maguire didn't convinced me, his character looks like a jerk, who drooled over the things of his rich neighbor. The sets and costumes are excellent and show eloquently the ostentation of the nouveau-riche and the madness of the twenties. The soundtrack, which ranges from the strong rhythms of Charleston and the deep melancholy of blues, captures the dichotomy of feelings, experiences and personalities of the characters.<br/><br/>This film is interesting in several aspects and, in my opinion, captures the essential of Fitzgerald's book. Of course, some things implicit in the novel were not portrayed in the film, but that's not makes this film a bad adaptation. Nothing replaces the book and, when we go to the movies, we have to understand that first. This is a very reasonable film. It could be better, but isn't bad at all."

","I had been waiting with bated breath for many months for the cinematic release of the latest attempt to put the 'great American novel' on the silver screen. This time, strangely, it was an Aussie who was handed the poisoned chalice by the Hollywood moguls. There were several reasons for my eager anticipation. Firstly, I am a great admirer of F. Scott Fitzgerald, and while I personally prefer his inspirational 'Tender is the Night', (which amongst other things, relates the rise and inevitable fall of an alcoholic), I do nevertheless hold 'the Great Gatsby' in very high regard. Fitzgerald was so naturally talented and was such a beautiful writer of the English language that frankly everything that he has ever written is just fine by me.<br/><br/>I can see why Gatsby is considered as one of the finest American novels. Apart from it being beautifully written, it also tells the story of the 'American Dream' – in a country where you can totally reinvent yourself and become unbelievably rich and successful. Although there is much dark stuff in Gatsby, it is nowhere near as dark as 'Tender is the Night' and maybe Americans prefer to exalt 'Gatsby', which they have clearly taken to their hearts rather than the complex and troublesome 'autobiographical Tender is The Night.<br/><br/>Secondly, I saw the 1974 version of Gatsby, shortly after reading the novel, and while it was okay-ish, on the whole I found it somewhat disappointing. Considering the great cast, headed up by Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, I felt that they could have made a better fist of it.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I have long been a fan of Australian film director, Baz Luhrmann. In particular I loved 'Strictly Ballroom' and the magical 'Moulin Rouge' although I was quite disappointed with 'Australia', (especially Nicole Kidman's ridiculous upper class English accent – almost as bad as Dick Van Dyke's much derided cockney accent). So after the somewhat muted reception of 'Australia' I wondered whether he could rediscover his directorial touch with Gatsby.<br/><br/>Did He? To be honest I'm still not 100% sure. It certainly divided the critics; it seems they either loved it or hated it. I'm not in either camp. I enjoyed watching the film and never got bored despite its 2 hours 20 minutes length. Much of it was great stuff and it was certainly a huge improvement on the 1974 version, but somehow the movie stopped short of being really great. The actors, with the possible exception of Toby Maguire were brilliant – particularly Leonardo as Jay Gatsby and Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan– and there is no doubt that the movie told the story quite faithfully and used much of Fitzgerald's original dialogue.<br/><br/>The grossly over-the-top scenes of the parties at Gatsby's mansion and the scenes of drunken, drug-taking debauchery in downtown New York were fascinating and highly entertaining to watch. But I suppose I fall into the camp that feels that with such a great novel, the director owed some kind of duty to an American classic and should not have taken us into such surrealistic flights of fancy.<br/><br/>I believe the movie would have been truly great if these scenes of decadence had been portrayed in a more realistic manner; maybe with a gritty, 1930's feel to them. After all, surely they were wild enough as originally written without having to undergo the 'Luhrmann treatment'. It was almost as though 'Moulin Rouge' met 'Moulin Gatsby'. These scenes are great fun – a feast of voyeurism – but somewhat out of place, and frankly, unnecessary. I also feel that the scenes at the motor garage were rushed and could have been longer and better developed, as they are so integral to the story; but maybe I am being picky.<br/><br/>The device of Nick, (Toby Maguire), telling the whole story from a sanatorium was contrived by Lurhmann and in my opinion, was rather pointless. Maybe the Lurrhmann-invented scenes at the sanatorium should have been sacrificed and replaced with extended scenes in the 'valley of Ashes'. I am sure it is all there in the rushes. A Director's cut, maybe? While I still believe that 3D is largely a gimmick which will probably disappear from main-stream movies, the use of 3D in Gatsby probably enhanced my enjoyment, and I have no complaints on that front.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong – this is a fine movie; but whether it will go down as the definitive Gatsby film remains to be seen. If you have a chance, I recommend that you it. There's not too much on at the cinemas these days that are worth the effort of getting up from your sofa, but Baz Lurhrmann's Great Gatsby is certainly one of them."

"Noirdame79","7","0","2","23 March 2016"," The Greatness Of Gatsby?
","For people unfamiliar with F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel and other film adaptations of it, this movie may have been a disappointment in terms of how it ended, perhaps because they were expecting an epic love story. In fact, in the book, the ""romance"" between Gatsby and Daisy is deliberately underplayed, it's more of an expose of the decadence and carelessness of the 1920s decade, and how the past simply cannot be recaptured, despite the actions that are taken in hopes of doing so. Baz Luhrmann's film does place a large amount of emphasis on the ""love story"" aspect, which may have led audiences to expect more than was ultimately delivered.<br/><br/>Not to say that this movie is not entertaining or good. It is, in many ways. Like other reviewers, I found the usage of hip-hop songs out of place, but luckily, the film does incorporate music that does seem to suit the era. Despite not being a period song, Lana Del Rey's ""Young And Beautiful"" works perfectly. The CGI does get a bit much at times, to the point where it looks unreal and a bit too much like animation, but it's still glorious to look at. I suppose that in a way, it was fitting as Fitzgerald was constantly describing light, natural and artificial, throughout ""The Great Gatsby"".<br/><br/>I can't think of another actor of the past few years who could have played Jay Gatsby other than Leonardo DiCaprio. While not a huge fan of the actor since my teenage years, there's no denying that he is a compelling presence on film. You believe that this self-made millionaire or whatever he was, achieved all that he did through blind ambition to win back his first love, Daisy (Carey Mulligan). I have to give Mulligan credit because Daisy is not an easy role to play, largely because the character was deliberately underwritten in the novel. There is a reason for this, because Daisy is idealized in Gatsby's eyes, as well as in the eyes of her cousin Nick Carraway (played here by Tobey Maguire, adequate but nothing more), although to a lesser extent. Basically, Daisy is someone that others project their fantasies on to. Hence why I've never really believed that it was intended to be a love story, because it was not about real love, but trying to recapture the past, to achieve a dream and attempting to obtain the unobtainable. Gatsby does not truly love Daisy, but the image he had of her in his mind. Daisy, no matter what her feelings were for him could not simply walk away from her life; she was married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and had a child with him. The differences between old money and new money aside, there was no way that her husband would ever have let her go, and at some point, Daisy does realize this. Gatsby never does.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Debicki, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke and Amitabh Bachchan all do reasonably well in their under-developed roles. Luhrmann clearly was busy focusing on Gatsby and Daisy's relationship, but it's curious that despite the love scenes, which are well-acted and beautifully photographed, they exhibit little on-screen chemistry. The actors tried, but it never quite comes off. Ironically, there are far more sparks between Mulligan and Edgerton, in spite of the fact that Daisy is unhappy in her marriage and Tom is a brutish philanderer. The way Daisy and Tom look at each other, respond and react to one another says far more than any speeches, declarations of love or ""romantic moments"" with Gatsby. While some may feel that Edgerton over did it in portraying Tom's brash ways, he does show vulnerability, particularly when Gatsby starts pressuring Daisy to claim that she never loved her husband. I've never found Tom to be particularly sympathetic, but Edgerton manages to pull it off, as does Mulligan. Daisy as a character is much maligned but when push comes to shove, she was trapped in the high-society mindset into which she was born, and never pretended to be anything she was not. It was Gatsby who refused to accept reality, and this what ultimately led to his downfall. In fact, even when Gatsby tells Nick about his past, we can't even be entirely sure he is telling the truth, as he is so prone to fantasy. We are also not sure as viewers what was inside Daisy's heart and mind, perhaps she loved both men, but had to make the choice that was best for her, but not without consequences.<br/><br/>The costumes and sets will literally take your breath away, but the exclusion of a few crucial scenes (one of which does show up in the deleted scenes section of the special features of the DVD) may have helped to clear some things up. <br/><br/>It's not my favorite film adaptation of the novel but it's not as terrible as some are making it out to be."
"lesleyharris30","7","0","1","29 February 2016"," Visually Dazzling, albeit lacking in Engaging Storytelling,
","The Great Gatsby is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a visually dazzling film that is very appealing to the eyes, Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant directing style is visible throughout, and the fantastic cast manage to blend it to this universe perfectly, with their stunning outfits and terrific characterisation. The highlight has to be Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, their chemistry is stellar and very sweet, the scenes they share together saved this movie from being a six. While the style is truly beautiful, I felt the director was far too focused on it, and much less on story, no matter how great a movie can look, we will notice if the story is lacking. Nick and Gatsby's journey is a slow moving process and it never feels like they truly emphasise the weight of their dilemma, as a matter of fact I never felt truly concerned for these characters, they are never in a position that could make me feel this way, Luhrmann's style will not be able to distract you from this for two and a half hours. The soundtrack was one of my biggest problems, they should have kept it like a fun, campy 50's style movie, but they simply had to be modern, throwing in songs for the likes of Kanye West and Lana Del Rey that feel out of place and somewhat disturbing, I was not one bit impressed to hear them, they should have stuck with the classics that suited the overall tone perfectly. It is jam packed with flaws, but The Great Gatsby is still very enjoyable because of a charming performance from DiCaprio and beautiful cinematography, it's worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix, but do not go out of your way to watch it. <br/><br/>A young trader soon finds himself tied up in the life of an eccentric millionaire. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio"
"weilandjordan","9","0","2","23 February 2016"," A new and exciting depiction of an old classic.
","The 1920's, a time roaring with illegal alcohol consumption, new money and extravagant parties. The Great Gatsby begins based solely on Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire), a hard working young man who newly moves to West Egg in New York. Nick Caraway narrates the entire film in a doctors office which you see in the beginning, reminiscing back on the Summer of 1922 and the time he met Gatsby. <br/><br/>This is a 2013 film directed by the famous director Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann has directed other films like, Moulin Rouge! and Romeo and Juliet. The Great Gatsby was no exception to Luhrmann's greatness. He picked the cast wonderfully and even though at times the camera is spinning and the scenery is moving so fast, it adds a great depth and realization of the fast moving lifestyle that the 1920's were.<br/><br/>Gatsby is a mystery for the first bit of the movie and his face is finally revealed during an extravagant party he has put together in his mansion on West Egg. The camera pans to his face and when you see him you feel as if you are gasping for air. He is a beautifully put together man with his hair perfectly slicked back with a smile, almost smirk on his face and a gleam in his eye. Gatsby is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio does a beautiful job depicting a 1920's man in love with a married women and facing the struggles of being ""new money"" during this time period. It is easy to tell DiCaprio puts his heart and soul into the characters he is playing and when he is Gatsby you forget he is acting. <br/><br/>Nick Caraway is Gatsby's neighbor and has a cousin, Daisy. Daisy lives across the water on East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), a well educated man from old money who is in line to inherit his families wealth. As the story unravels it turns out Daisy and Gatsby are old lovers and when Gatsby went to war, Daisy met Tom and married him. Gatsby purposefully bought and owns the house across the water to be close to Daisy and symbolizes the hope he has to still be with her and be the man she loves by the green flashing light at the end of her dock. Daisy, who is played by Carey Mulligan, really does an amazing job. She as an actress makes you love her, hate her, sympathize for her and want her dead all within the 143 minutes of this film. Her costumes and makeup along with everyone else's in the film are very spot on to the 1920's and makes everything even more believable. To capture the 1920's the women are constantly in dresses and skirts with bob'd hair cuts with hair pieces in them. The men are usually found in a suit and even when Gatsby takes a swim at the end of the movie, he is wearing a one piece swimming suit. While watching this film there are times that you forget that it was not actually filmed 100 years ago but only 3.<br/><br/>The music choice can quickly brings you back to the 21st century. Artists like Emeli Sande, Fergie, Lana Del Rey, Sia, JAY Z, Beyonce, and many more popular artists of this time are main contributors to the soundtrack. It is a constant modern twist on the ever so popular and famous jazz music. The music is appropriate to every individual scene throughout the movie and gets you into the mood the director and actors want you to feel at different times. <br/><br/>This movie is a must see of the time and leaves you feeling heartbroken and oddly satisfied at the same time. The movie is competing with so much of peoples expectations since there is the famous book written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1925 and the Jack Clayton directed Gatsby of 1974. Even with seeing the other movie, and reading the book this movie still adds new and exciting ideas and depictions of the ever so famous story of, The Great Gatsby."
"jjarz","9","0","2","9 February 2016"," Great story, awesome acting !!!
","I'll start by stating that I have read the book, and have not seen the Robert Redford version of the movie. Also, I understand that the film was set in the roaring twenties and that there are some inaccuracies, which really doesn't bother me. The Jay Z, Beyonce new twist on the soundtrack didn't bother me one bit. I was too focused on the people and characters. At it's heart The Great Gatsby is a favorite of mine because of the story and the great acting of the cast. Gatsby is a self made man, enjoying his ""new"" money. His motivation and reason for befriending Nick (Toby Mcqguire) is to land the one that got away. Joel Edgerton plays a great Tom Buchanon. Conceited, ""old"" money, racist, with a elitist sense of being. Daisy is the ultimate prize and Gatsby will do, and has done, everything and anything for her. In this battle, there is plenty of collateral damage. Friendships, relationships and loyalties are laid waste. Leo plays an awesome Gatsby and you feel his dedication to friends/lovers, desire for turning back time and passion for Daisy and the union that should've/could've been. Driven and obsessed his only flaw may be his loyalty. Can't help but feel for him as he seemingly has everything but that which he really wants. Love the fact that Nick narrates the story as a front row witness and drives home the feelings of the central players"

I'm not a huge fan of Leonardo Di Caprio usually but he was amazing as Gatsby, utterly authentic and convincing as are the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The story was very well told and the juxtaposition of the modern music against the backdrop of the 1920's was surprisingly successful and effective.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

","Very slight spoiler, just about the main thrust of the movie.<br/><br/>I am seeing some reviews about how bad the early minutes of the movie are. I agree they're pretty bad. I almost quit watching too. But once DiCaprio comes on the screen, things change. The direction gets a lot better, too. DiCaprio does a bang-up job portraying Gatsby, a man totally in love with a certain woman, and I felt touched by his performance and the movie. I fell more than a little in love with this movie, and never before has my feelings towards a movie gone from hate to love with this sort of arc. I think it is well worth anyone's time. <br/><br/>Now, admittedly I read ""The Great Gatsby"" decades ago and was unsure how much the movie stayed true to that. So I was adrift there. I liked the movie on its own merits. But looking online, it seems it remained pretty true. So I will take that as gospel until such time as I get to re-read the novel. Which is just to say, it's a great movie. You don't need to know the book."
"barev-85094","Null","0","1","5 November 2015"," Indian Superstar in Cameo Role in Australian version of American Gatsby
","Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, all well and good, but Indian reports on the ongoing Cannes film festival have been far more interested in the fact that 70 year old Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan appears in the film, even if it's only in a one scene cameo you might miss if you blinked twice and weren't waiting for this as the high point of the picture (as many Indians will be). <br/><br/>Australian director Baz Luhrman is a self confessed fan of Bollywood films and the dazzling color that is the earmark of his own films is a direct influence from the Bollywood musical extravaganzas he so ardently admires. His multi prize winner Moulin Rouge (2000) was in a way a homage to Bollywood in its entire staging, color saturation, production numbers, and it even had a complete Bollywood song in it. In his latest offering, ""The Great Gatsby"", (or is it now ""The Greatest Gatsby""?) -- his nod to Bollywood takes the form of having Bollywood's most famous actor, Amitabh Bachchan, appear in it albeit in a role that is merely a cameo. However, Bachchan does get fifth billing in the title credits along with the other main performers, Dicaprio, Maguire & Co. <br/><br/>In India Amitabh Bachchan is more than a mere megastar, he is a national Institution often referred to simply as the Big 'B' one letter being enough to identify the subject. When he was seriously injured on the set of a picture in 1984 and was near death the entire nation prayed for him to recover, and he did so, amazingly. Not only does he have a track record of Bollywood box-office blockbusters going back some forty years, among them the most famous Indian film of all time ""Sholay"" (the 'Curry Western') but he is also a gigantic TV star as host of the super popular quiz show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' (""Who Will Be a Bilionaire?"") which was showcased in Danny Boyle's Oscar winning 'Slumdog Millionaire'. <br/><br/>Bachchan's screen aura is so commanding that even now at age seventy when most contemporaries would settle for walk-on character parts he is still able to be a convincing leading man or play a patriarch towering over top stars half his age. So why did the Indian megastar accept what amounts to little more than a walk-on in Gatsby? This is a tricky question open to all sorts of speculation not the least of which might be: Does Bollywood, with all its blazing bravura and homegrown star adulation, still have a kind of inferiority complex vis-a-vis Hollywood? -- and why is a Megastar like Amitabh Bachchan willing to sit there alongside Leonardo and bask in the sunshine of his glory for less than five minutes in a two hour picture? There must be a good reason ....<br/><br/>Part of it is undoubtedly the fact that Bachchan is desirous of finally getting some high profile exposure in the West where he remains an unknown in spite of his godlike status at home and elsewhere -- before it's too late! On a trip to India Mr. Luhrman looked Mr. Bachchan up and offered him a spot in his next big project, Gatsby. Mr. Bachchan being no dummy when it comes to knowledge of international cinema, realized that this was going to be an international blockbuster and probably figured there was nothing to lose by accepting even a small role in it ... and possibly some of the Western recognition he craves might come his way simply by appearing in a scene with Spiderman Maguire and Titanic star Dicaprio -- in addition, having his name right up there in the main titles as if he had a major part in the picture -- which was probably the only condition laid down in his understanding with Mr. Luhrman.<br/><br/>We can imagine a scene that went something like this:<br/><br/>""Well, look here, Mr. Amitabh, Sahib, I can't give you much of a part --it's only one scene -- but you get to look really bad -- I guarantee you that -- people will remember this scene. You play a notorious Jewish gangster, and you dress like one, to the hilt -- and you get to sit and shmooze with Maguire and Dicaprio, in this sleazy club you run --and to make sure we sell a lot of tickets in India we can put your name up there in Big Letters in the main credits -- how would that be?"" -- ""That sounds very good to me Mr. Luhrman -- especially the main credit part -- so I will be glad to make myself available to you, Mr. Baz Sahib -- er, uh -- Do I get paid for this? -- <br/><br/>""Well, we can certainly take care of all your travel expenses and all that -- New York, Cannes, You know ... the works! -- (CUT to pen signing verbal contract on restaurant napkin).<br/><br/>As the scene was actually shot we see an extremely bug-eyed close-up of Amitabh's eyes literally bulging out under his wide brimmed straw hat, showing white rims around the edge of the iris, like cataracts -- sinister to say the least and not terribly flattering as far as the standard Bachchan image on screen is concerned ... almost frightening, but then this Meyer Wolfsheim is no patsy -- he Is sinister ! -- after all he arranged the fix of the World Series in 1919 -- All this goes by very quickly and will probably horrify many of Bachchan's faithful Indian fans who will wonder if he is not seriously ill -- but there he is, full blast for five minutes in the Great Gatsby -- in 3D no less! Whether anybody but Indians or Bollywood fans will remember this small scene is another question but there it is -- Amitabh Bachchan in The Great Gatsby. And that is the big entertainment news in India this week."

A world of grace, style and ellegance beyond compare. In some ways it presented that, but all ruined by dreadful modern day style music vomitted all over the face of it. What a tragic thing to do to a period piece.<br/><br/>The actors all put on stunning performances and delivered the story well, especially Tobey Maquire.<br/><br/>It could have scored a 10, if they hadn't tried to throw in modernised nonsense which simply doesn't work for something that's supposed to be set in the 1920's (well 1910's to be more accurate) period.<br/><br/>Sadly as millions were made on the back of a great writers work, no one will probably care, but honestly I feel film directors who want to use a writers work and set it in the period of it's intent should at least have the courtesy to honor that writers work by having EVERYTHING set in that period. Music is not optional and sets the tone for scenes. Thankfully the ending was mostly an orchestral score(sadly based on a modern day piece that featured in the film by the sound of it) but still, what's wrong with 1920's style music? There's a lot of great jazz in there and it's alive and exciting. Not boring and mundane like horrible teenie bopper music(which by the way, will age, in comparison to the Jazz music which is timeless)."

Scott Fitzgerald book about class and hope. Set in flashbacks 1922 as a writer, played by Tobey Maguire is urged by his psychiatrist to write about his issues. He has been reduced to a drunken depressed individual but he recounts the impression made upon him when he visited his cousin. She is married but her husband is involved in numerous affairs. Five years earlier she was involved with a mysterious individual named Gatsby who was poor at that time but now he is rich and throwing massive parties where nobody seems to know who he is. Gatsby longs for the lost romance and sends Maguire an invitation to one of his parties to convince him to reunite him. Director Baz Luhrmann is gifted with blaring music and massive visual production as he showcased wonderfully in Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet. Leonardo DiCaprio plays off the mysterious nature of Gatsby who is venting his desperation to rekindle this relationship. Maguire observes him with great awe with his commanding nature hindered by the past. Carey Mulligan plays Gatsby's past lover torn between happiness and a shallow wealthy routine. Joel Edgerton plays the pompous husband whose deceit is obvious and his wealth able to dominate. Isla Fisher makes an appearance but her shopaholic days are now within a different era and setting. Depressing yet stunning update of this classic vision of wealth and the things it cannot buy. Score: 9 / 10"

","Always challenging to put a classic into a successful picture with similar status, but unfortunately this production failed to reach its intended goal. The approach indicates reaching grandeur, great as Gatsby, but the result fails to live up to that. While most aspects are better than average and hours of work with a clear vision were put in costume design, casting, special effects.. there is one gigantic dealbreaker on the horizon, which casts a shadow over the entire project: the music<br/><br/>The story is set in the 20s, but the contemporary and mediocre party music just ruined the entire undertaking. So much potential for a must-see movie, but so brutally ruined. As close as Gatsby gets to grasping his dream, so far away Anton Musted (executive producer music) got from putting in an acceptable work shift: he missed it by a few thousand light years. Clearly delusional his risky choice of music was going to be received well, maybe even more about his artistic talent."

","The story is about a man, newly rich Jay Gatsby, who throws big parties and befriends his neighbor Tom. For me, the whole story wants to be about the mystery around the man named Gatsby, but it is mostly about his tragic love with Daisy that leads him to ruin. The craziness of the era is presented at the sidelines, even though the start did show some promising scrapes of a more critical eye on the events. Maybe the whole atmosphere of 1922 is supposed to be portrayed by the quick, up lifting music, that tip toes between being the savior and the ruin of the movie. The set and the costumes are magnificent, and some of the scenes are very powerful, but, for me, the movie is a bad mess of events that are presented in a crazy, back forward way. The actors did their best to support complicated characters, even though the script didn't help them, but their effort is worthy of mentioning. For all that, I give the great Gatsby a 5 out of 10."

","This movie... okay, it wasn't terrible. It was a pretty decent movie to watch and got the main concepts of the book across well. But I just can't stop myself from feeling a little irritated when I watch it. There are things about it that I just think weren't done right and that kind of brought all my feelings about the movie down. I think my biggest, angriest problem with this was how much it didn't seem like the 1920s. The music was the biggest thing about this. In a movie representing a story of the past, I do not want to hear loud party music from the time we live in. It just pisses me off. I know a lot of people have blabbered on to me about 'modern interpretation' and blah blah but it wasn't actually set in the present day so why is it using present day music? It doesn't accentuate any point. In fact it hid the feel of that era and smashed any sort of hope I had for really enjoying this movie. Then there was the way some of them spoke. It just didn't sound right. Gatsby was often enough perfect (Leonardo DeCaprio always nails these roles) but often enough the rest of the cast didn't really perfect that talk. Maybe it was the writers. All I know was that the lines from the book were done in an alright way. Nick reading out what he had written didn't really do it for me either. It wasn't read in a tone I liked. Maybe it was just a little airy for me. I know that's kind of a stupid thing to nag about but I really wanted to love this movie. I'd heard such great things. There were other things, small things that I won't get into. But mostly it was just how un-1920s it was. It made me miss the book and want to bitch about it (which I guess is done now). I'm glad a lot of people like it but I just can't. I recommend watching it though as I'm sure a lot of people will still enjoy what I could not. The actors did decent jobs too and the uses of setting were sometimes perfect. It wasn't my favourite movie but it wasn't anywhere near my least favourite either."

","The film follows young writer Nick Carraway during the passion and heat- fueled summer of 1922. He's rented a small cottage adjacent to the glorious mansion of the mysterious but popular Jay Gatsby. Gatsby plays host to extravagant parties every weekend, hundreds of people reveling in orgies of music, alcohol and sex. It's the place to be, except the enigmatic Gatsby never seems to attend his own parties. Directly across the bay from Gatsby's mansion is the estate of Daisy and Tom Buchanan with its green dock light, a light that sears into Gatsby's heart every night. Daisy is Nick's cousin and he soon becomes swept up their social whirl, including an ongoing flirtation with languid tennis pro Jordan Baker. It's the 20s and morals are loose, jazz is king and relationships aren't what they were at the turn of the century. There's an underlying pathos throughout the movie that perfectly fits the era too... What can be said of a city that is so corrupt underneath the glitz and glamor that every denizen doesn't already secretly know? This corruption is the source of the breathless urgency both in the story and in the production itself, a Пелл-Mell flume ride to the inevitable climax. I'm an unabashed fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and have enjoyed watching him grow into one of the best actors in Hollywood today, and his performance as the enigmatic Gatsby. The performance that surprised me was that of Tobey Maguire. Best known for the Spider-Man trilogy, his Nick Carraway is nuanced, touching and sympathetic. He wants to be impressed, he wants to fit in, but he knows that there's something fake about everything related to Gatsby, a corruption that reflects the entire glitzy world of the upper class. Carey Mulligan seems lifeless from the onset. It is hard to recognize her in the meaty character that she has been assigned.<br/><br/>Yet, I managed to claw out a few touching moments of the actress, more towards the end as her character dwindles torn between the fantasies of her husband and lover. This film makes you believe in true love! however, the attitude of the main character's shocking. The Great Gatsby is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen in a long time, capturing the hope, the optimism and the glitter of the art deco era. Coupled with the engaging narrative and uniformly excellent performances, it's a love story that transcends the clichés of the genre to stand as one of the best films released last year."

As I watched the movie, I noticed how it was almost just like the book, and by that I mean everything was nearly identical to what I had read in the book. The cast was excellent, especially Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, who accurately portrayed Gatsby and Nick Carraway. This movie was brilliant, and Luhrman did well with directing it. I absolutely loved it, and would watch it again, and maybe a third time if necessary. If only Mr. Fitzgerald could see this wonderful movie adaptation of his novel. Overall, I would recommend this movie to everyone, but you must read the book first, or you may not understand the film. 10/10"

","This movie is the fifth remake. I'll compare it with the 1974 version with Robert Redford as Jay Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as Tom Buchanan, Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan did a memorable performance. He was the real star of the picture. His character was quite complex and volatile. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby was much more interesting than Redford. Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was spot on. However, Isla Fisher as Myrtle Wilson played her role as a frivolous Kewpie doll, hardly one to inspire passion. Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan had as much sparkle as an overcooked noodle. Perhaps they wanted that blandness to help explain her reaction to her later hit and run. It made no sense two men would be fighting over her. She was just a pretty face.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie reminded me of Rocky Horror Picture Show -- huge numbers of people dancing wildly in bizarre costumes suggesting sexual abandon to come. I expected 1920's period costumes. Instead I got 1920's-inspired costumes, wildly imaginative and dazzling. The makeup and hairstyles too were 1920's inspired, but much more glamorous than anything you would actually have seen in the period. I got 1920's- inspired dancing that was a cross between the Charleston and hip hop. I wanted 1920's music. I got a fusion of 1920's and various other surprising genres.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is the picture of a billionaire with his immaculate pale pink suit and not a hair out of place. He just exudes wealth and confidence. However, he was a little young to be believable in the role.<br/><br/>For the second half, the movie then settled in to straight-forwardly telling the story of adultery and unbridled passion which at the time was much more of a big deal than it is today.<br/><br/>The movie probes the relationship between Gatsby and Nick much more deeply than in 1974, constantly asking why is Gatsby so interested in Nick? It never answers. Gatsby is clearly heterosexual, obsessed with Daisy. I think he just needs someone without treachery as a friend almost like a pet person. Nick is bedazzled by Gatsby's wealth and power."
"maddy-morrical","9","0","2","24 April 2014"," This is a review highlighting the success in The Great Gatsby
","The Great Gatsby was originally a successful novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald but recently, has been translated in a different light in the 2013 film. Although I have not read the book, I have done research in which I have come to realize that they are almost identical in plots. The only thing moderately different, is the sequence of events climaxing to the ending in which remained the same in both the book and film. <br/><br/>Although the film had strong aspects and was truly successful, there were a few disappointments to me and many others one being the ending. This ending made me so mad but it honestly did wrap up the film in a proper way. Although the ending was unpredictable, something to consider is the fact that it remained the same in the novel and the film so it is not the movies fault for sticking to the original plot. Even though I am not particularly fond of the way the story comes to an end, I know that this was F. Scott Fitzgerald's concept and it was truly a good plan to stick with. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that fell a little short was the film maker's decision to have Nick, the main character, narrating the story from past to present inside a sanitarium. This implements a different mood throughout the movie than in the book which can change an audience's perception I personally do not think it hurts the overall content of the movie but I do think it was an odd and darker choice. Apart from these moderate downsides, let's look at the actual plot and the numerous positives that enhanced the success of The Great Gatsby. <br/><br/>The basic storyline of The GreatGatsby is about a young Wall Street worker, Nick Caraway, who becomes neighbors with a mysterious millionaire, Mr. Jay Gatsby. The story goes through his interactions with Mr. Gatsby and the constant attempt to reunite his cousin Daisy with Jay as lovers once again. All while this is going on, people are constantly trying to figure out who really was this Gatsby person? And where did he get all of that money? The entire plot has twists and turns and moments where I am sure your heart will just break! <br/><br/>This interpretation of The Great Gatsby was amazing primarily because of its cultural identity, prominent actors, and visuals. Firstly, the era The Great Gatsby is set in is the roaring twenties which was such a monumental time period and I'm sure a lot of fun to portray. They highlighted many of the main characteristics of this era but modernized them and put them in a new light.The makers of Gatsby especially paid attention to the costuming, language, and makeup for the time and it worked flawlessly. The costumes were true to the times but definitely modern and reborn to fit the big screen. The women were dressed chic with sleek pixie haircuts. Whereas the men were dressed dashingly in suits paired with straw boater hats which are trendy but timeless. These costumes were obviously well thought out which shows through their cohesive color combinations, amazing textures, and stunning accessories. Catherine Martin, the brains behind these beautiful costumes, also won the Oscar for best costume design and it shows through the film. The whole film had a regal and charming style which was kept entirely until the end and beautifully executed. Along with such spectacular style and makeup, the language also put this film into the twenties mind set. They said things we today would not typically identify with and in a much lighter tone than how most society would talk in the year 2014. Phrases like ""ole sport"" and 'my darling"" are not typically used in every day speech and it's refreshing to see a cast devote themselves to the era and the culture. This could have gone wrong if the actors did not commit completely to the time, but I think they performed it beautifully in their speech. The little things like this are what makes movie magic so great!<br/><br/>Thirdly, the actors were absolutely captivating within The Great Gatsby. The actors ranged from the stunning Leonardo DiCaprio, the mysterious Toby Maguire, and new faces like Carey Mulligan. Gathering a cast that is already well known is always a great idea to initially draw an already existing audience. This was well executed by casting Leonardo to play the rich and desirable character and someone like Toby to play the average man trying to achieve the great American dream. Although Carey was a fresh new face, she is beautiful and exudes innocence which was perfect for her role. Overall, the acting was a joy to watch and everyone that was casted fit their roles perfectly. Lastly, various other aspects of this film enhanced its originality as well, such as its hit soundtrack. Music scoring in a film is vital to its success, and The Great Gatsby's soundtrack is one of the best I have heard. I love the way they took the classic twenties swing music and blended it with modern day rap music to make a powerful mix. Some people may argue the point that rap does not enhance the events within the film, but there is a meaning behind their choices in music. The rap/pop influences within the music creates that modern flare people are looking for in a revised version of an old classic. The lyrics talk about some main elements of the actual story line like partying, success, and love but in a way that translates better to audiences today. Artists like Fergie, Lana Del Ray, and Jay Z are featured in this soundtrack and really work to the films advantage. With all of this being said, I highly recommend this film to audiences of all ages. Go watch it!"

","Well, I thought the same thing about the music as everyone else. If they had bothered to pretend the film took place in an early time and not the 1920's, that'd be fine for me. But they specifically mentioned it taking place in the 20's, so the play is no modern adaption (as also seen in setting, clothes, etc.) and the music literally sucks. However, we have to admit that the music choice gets better half way through the film. ""Young and beautiful"" is amazingly writing - and all its variations are simply grand. Not watching a film because of bad music choice is simply wrong in my eyes... even with the music being kind of disturbing. Yet, the actors, the incredible setting and all those details and grand film-making skills in composing a beautiful picture, created a stunning artwork. Which also was really close to the book. Thank you for that Baz Luhrmann."

","I was not looking forward to Baz Luhrmann's take on ""The Great Gatsby"".<br/><br/>Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" was an over-the-top animated cream pie that while looked wonderful, the plot and scenery-chewing histrionics of the cast made it appalling.<br/><br/>And I must admit while I was watching this film there were indeed a few moments when Luhrmann seemed to head off down the cartoon path once again but he reined those moments in very nicely.<br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" moves, in more ways than one.<br/><br/>As much as I love Jack Clayton's 1974 take on the F.

"gkeith_1","10","0","3","6 April 2014"," Awesome film.
","Upon second and third viewing, DVR I saw on November 16, 2016, I call this film surreal art deco. It was an artistic way of showing empty, immoral decadence of a young populace demoralized by the horrors, tragedies and losses of the recent World War One.<br/><br/>Yes, on my second tour I saw this film twice, seeing more than I did the first time. I think that Maguire is not as wooden as reviewers here make him out to be. Is Nick the author Fitzgerald, or is Gatsby? Did Nick ever have any romantic involvements, not mentioning the wild drunkenness of the earlier part of this film?<br/><br/>I also kept seeing the films The Aviator and again Citizen Kane upon seeing this film in November 2016. DiCaprio's eyebrow looks reminded me of his Howard Hughes in The Aviator, and the trashy and garish opulence of too many material goods reminded me of Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Upon first viewing some years ago: Awesome film. Beautiful costuming. I never saw the 1974 film version of this F. Scott Fitzgerald story, but perhaps some other time. Di Caprio dies in this movie, just like he did in ""Titanic"". The early 1920s were shown as a period of extreme wealth and crime, post-World War One, which was the War to End All Wars. Nick worked on Wall Street, later to come crashing down on everyone including the wrongdoers.<br/><br/>Movie reminds me of ""Citizen Kane"". A man rich in material wealth, but a sad, lonely little boy in spirit. All Gatsby wanted was Daisy. All Kane wanted was Rosebud. Both men lost their material riches. There is snow or something fluttering in Citizen Kane, as well in this Gatsby film.<br/><br/>The exteriors of the homes of Gatsby and Daisy were superb and exquisite. The interiors were, of course, plush and elegant.<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing the dancers. One reminded me of Josephine Baker. Spot-on image. The party-goers were both elegant as well as decadent. Poor Nick was just determined to get drunk. It was all very realistic.<br/><br/>The cars were just beautiful. The acting was excellent. All were believable, in my opinion. The actors did a great job. I hope to even read this novel sometime.<br/><br/>The bloodiness of the woman killed by the car was an excellent fake bloody makeup job. The cut on her breast was very realistic.<br/><br/>The extreme anger of her husband was justified. His wife had been playing around with Daisy's husband, who sneakily inferred that Gatsby had killed the wife. The twist was that the husband went after Gatsby; earlier, I had thought that Daisy's husband (I forget his name) was going to do the deed, but the garage owner beat him to it. :( <br/><br/>10/10"

","In this amazing movie Baz has executed the roar of the twenties! His style worked with the craziness of Gatsby' parties and for those who have complained about the Sanatorium I would stay quiet. Baz has explained why he put Nick in the sanatorium, as the book is all internal he needed a way to get the story moving, answer the question of why Nick is writing and to whom he is writing to. It is also a homage to Fitzgerald's final novel before he passed, The Last Tycoon, the main character was revealed to be writing in a sanatorium as a way of therapy (which was a common treatment an worked for Nicks character development) I haven't seen such a great book to film adaptation in while, they changed a few things but it worked. The cast, the music the costumes, and especially the sets were a dream come true. They were all exactly how I pictured them! This movie deserves a lot more than what people have said. Baz has captured the twenties in an unimaginably perfect way. I loved every second of this movie. And it deserves more credit than it has gotten. Set your bias aside and WATCH this amazing film."

","I saw the 1974 Robert Redford version of this when it was first released, but fortunately couldn't remember enough about it to spoil this great version for me. What that didn't have for sure was a helping of that ghastly, homogenous and homogeneous, rackety modern dance music that spoiled what is a superb period piece in the riotous party scenes. What was the director thinking? If he was trying to relate the watcher to a modern-day bash, it was totally out of place, especially for people like me who think that such 'music' is like hell on earth.<br/><br/>I have my reservations about the story itself, but this isn't a book review. I think that I recall a different situation for a certain event, but I'll stick to saying that the casting was great, marvellous acting and attention to detail apart from the aforementioned anachronism. I just loved that I seemed to be watching a hybrid comic book/theatrical version. We watched the 3-D version at home on a large screen, and the experience was just marvellous. I might even dust off the book and give it another read as well!"

","It was an interesting change to watch a Leo movie so soon after seeing him play Calvin Candie, and that kind of timing should help the movie's box-office as well. But, I digress at the beginning itself.<br/><br/>How's the movie? I enjoyed it, and thought it was very good, though it is far from perfect. I read the book at an early age (and did not care for it much at the time). It did not deter from my enjoying everything Luhrmann throws at us. Speaking of which, he does not throw much, as he is wont to. Cases in point - 'Moulin Rouge', 'Australia'. I don't know if he elected to go subdued for this one, or if it was a result of Drew Pearce's re-writes, or I've become conditioned to the Luhrmann brand of opulence and excess. In either case, the acting is top-notch, except for the 1-note performances from Mulligan and Edgerton (not their fault really, it's the way Luhrmann chooses to play their respective arcs).<br/><br/>The richest role, IMO, surprisingly belongs to our protagonist, Tobey Maguire, and though he also receives a (kinda) raw deal from Luhrmann, firmly sinks his teeth into the material, this being his lead role in ages (not counting 'The details'). Leo does a great job, but we have come to expect nothing less from him, esp. after 'The departed', 'Revolutionary road', 'Shutter island', 'Django unchained' and Luhrmann's earlier take on 'Romeo and Juliet'.<br/><br/>The 3D is great, and comparable to Scorsese's use of immersive filmmaking from 'The re-invention of Hugo Cabret'. The production design is magnificent, though I am not the right person to judge if it's impeccable from the standpoint of how it all was in 20s NYC (Comments welcome on that front too; I genuinely would like to know). I also did enjoy the use of contemporary music in this period piece, though I went in expecting to be turned off by that aspect.<br/><br/>All in all, a good time at the movies, and deserves to be watched on the big screen for sure."

","The Great Gatsby a visually stunning, captivating, intriguing age-old classic tragic love story originally written as a book by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It tells a story which sets in the Roaring Twenties before The Great Depression...about New York society and the decadence of that era, the wild excesses and emptiness (the Prohibition and bootlegging of alcohol), the glitzy and glamorous parties and plot twists that shows that after all these years, the current generation still facing the same social problems like their predecessors in the 20s.<br/><br/>The cinematography, makeup and costume designs were brilliant. The film succeeds in portraying every manner of Gatsby's extravagance. The sets are great, the music is amazing and the costume and fashion style depicted in the film seems to reflect the 1920's. It seems to show how two individuals, not from a wealthy background can easily be deceived by the empty lie of self-gratification.<br/><br/>The film also carefully depicts how obsession and wealth can also blind individuals in love: Gatsby's obsession with Daisy and Daisy's obsession with wealth and status despite his love for Gatsby. As Gatsby's true identity and intentions finally revealed in the second half of the movie, one can't help but to sympathize with the hopeless romantic...it is his passion, false optimism, hope and undying love for Daisy which ultimately leads to his own demise.<br/><br/>Gatsby has led his entire life in trying to earn and win the love of Daisy, but Daisy is just too afraid to lose the kind of life she has grown up with, to love the one guy her heart calls her to...even though she knows that her husband is cheating on her. It is deeply heartfelt to watch as Nick was unable to stop the dreadful chain of events that he eventually feels responsible for. <br/><br/>Once again, Leonardo DiCaprio proved himself as a credible actor by delivering a charismatic, heartbreaking performance as Gatsby. He's done a wonderful job in personifying the character's insecurities, despite his stylish and charming outer appearance. The scene where Daisy and Gatsby reunite together again at Nick's house after 5 years is both awkward and hilarious.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, which is considered a classic literature by many...and I'm not a fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, therefore I'm reviewing the film based on what I've seen on screen. In my opinion, it is a film that I would recommend others to watch.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","When the first Jay-Z tune was played I was astonished. I was fully expecting re-orchestrated tunes of the time. Still, the Jay-Z compositions worked and as the film progressed I warmed to it considerably.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is very lush and there is a lot of computer graphics in it, the digital designers even played with character eye color, but this was an abundant period in American history. Though I took exception (a gut reaction) to the opening, I had to remind myself that the roaring twenties were called that because of the excess and cronyism that marked that time.<br/><br/>On reflection, the excess created by Luhrmann and his staff was not only fitting, it was necessary to convey the proper mood of the film. This ""excess"" was also necessary to the story line. After all, Gatsby has an ulterior motive for these parties.<br/><br/>It has been a while since I read the book, but I get the sense that the story and plot were followed rather favorably. The special effects brought to bear in the making of this film made pivotal moments that much more shocking, and in an odd way, real. At least the feelings the movie-goer is encouraged to have are that much more real due to the efforts made by the production team.<br/><br/>All in all I gave this a seven, a bit lower a score that I would have given had the film adhered a bit more to the times it is supposed to represent. Again, I have no objection to the Jay-Z music on it's own, but it did not really fit with this period in history...that is my main beef with this film.<br/><br/>Finally, though the effects were well placed and properly applied, I felt this film really didn't need them. They were, after all, way beyond what was required to tell the story.<br/><br/>I felt that the casting was pitch perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby McGuire were the exact right choices for the two principal characters. Carry Mulligan made a tragic and fragile Daisy. Joel Edgerton's portrayal of the two faced and manipulative Tom Buchanan made me hate him, which is exactly the feeling I was supposed to get for this character. The remaining men and women had precisely the look I would imagine for the twenties, beautiful, vain, and shallow. Finally, I think the supporting actors Jason Clarke (as George Wilson) and Isla Fisher (as Myrtle Wilson) were excellent. So casting, I felt, was about as good as it gets, the overall effect of the film was pretty overwhelming, but, that said, it didn't quite ring true."

This is all correct and not over-hyped.<br/><br/>It was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and published in 1925.<br/><br/>The story is set during the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a poor bonds salesman/author, tells the story in his own thought-provoking, wise and influential words, it starts with his moving to the village of West/East Egg, where he is introduced to the luxurious life of the rich by the beautiful Daisy and The Ill-Tempered Tom and meets his dodgy lover, Jordan Baker. But the moment that really triggers the story is this talk of Jay Gatsby, who just so happens to be Nick's millionaire neighbor. Once he arrives back home he decides to give Gatsby a call and then ends up going to one of Gatsby's parties.<br/><br/>During the rest of the novel you gradually realize all the characters connect in some way.<br/><br/>This book is really quite mind-blowing.

","Really didn't expect much from this movie before I watch it. The hyped American Hustle totally disappointed me. Seems no one said anything good about The Great Gatsby. But this movie gave me a big surprise. The color, costumes, buildings, visual effects are stunningly beautiful. That's alone worth the price of the ticket. The way the director telling the story is magnificent, plus it IS a good story. In the end, I was emotionally touched and inspired. This doesn't happen often. I have to say this movie is the best of the past year. This is not at all time top ten, but good enough to stand out in those junks of last year.<br/><br/>Weak links of this movie: 1. Leonardo Dicarpio: superficial acting in ALL his movies. He is lack of depth of a real man. 2. Toby Maguire: too childish in ALL his movies. 3. Music: The jazz are OK. But the hip-hops are totally improper."
"grantss","7","0","3","2 March 2014"," Better than the 1974 version
","Good adaptation of the F Scott Fitzgerald book, and better than the 1974 adaptation. Not great though: too much style instead of substance (which has always been an issue with Baz Luhrmann's movies). The first half was mostly just Luhrmann showing off what he can do with special effects, light, colour and movement. The 21st-century soundtrack in a 1920s setting was particularly irritating.<br/><br/>However, the substance kicks-in in the second half, and then the movie becomes interesting. Much less special effects, much more drama. The last few scenes are very emotional, and brilliant.<br/><br/>I know this is supposed to be Leonardo DiCaprio's best shot at a Best Leading Actor Oscar, after being snubbed many times, but I don't see him getting it. I wouldn't even have him among the nominees. His performance is OK, but not brilliant. In fact, it is debatable whether he even deserves top billing in the movie. Yes, he plays the character after whom the movie is named, but Tobey Maguire has much more screen time. <br/><br/>Maguire puts in a solid performance, in a role which requires him to be solid but not spectacular. He is the narrator, and our eyes into the life of Gatsby and friends, not a man of action. <br/><br/>Carey Mulligan shines as Daisy. She is perfect for the role.<br/><br/>Good performances from an all-Australian supporting cast: Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, Jack Thompson and Elizabeth Debicki."

","Having known that The Great Gatsby was going to be adapted yet again to cinema and that Leonardo DiCaprio was going to star as the lead, I immediately felt obliged to read the novel by Scott Fitzgerald. It was definitely worth the read and then I found myself even more excited to watch it. When I finally got the chance I got the feeling that most of the essence of the original story was brought to the screen. As for the other aspects, and some people actually had problems with this, they combined to give us the entertainment that movies are supposed to provide. Ranging from the modern day soundtrack to the computerized shots of 1920's New York, everything fell into place to give us a thrilling ride. I like to think that the music and the extravagant production provide a comparison as to how the parties of Gatsby and overall the fun spirit of the 20's would be like today.<br/><br/>DiCaprio proves once again that he is one of the best actors working today and the intense feelings he brings to Gatsby are a joy to watch. Carey Mulligan makes for a sweet Daisy and serves well as the object of Gatsby's desires. Tobey Maguire is competent as Nick Carroway, the narrator of the story. He is taken in by this world and leaves it disgusted. Joel Edgerton plays a despicable Tom Buchanan who you hate more and more as the movie progresses. The overall tone of the film just grabbed me and never let go. I enjoyed seeing this lavish production, I enjoyed watching these performances, and yes I even enjoyed the music.<br/><br/>My perception of the film may differ from more older audience members. In my opinion most of the heart and soul of the book was captured, and that combined with all the over the top scenes and electronic based music was all I needed to enjoy it. I recommend it to anyone looking to see this classic story come to live in a more modern setting.<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"
"anthony-burton4","7","0","4","10 February 2014"," Flawed masterpiece
","Watch this film, but try to keep an open mind through the opening 30 mins - it paints a false impression of what this movie is going to be like. As many other reviewers have said it begins with far too much visual and auditory punch, but the real flaw is the use of modern music. At times in the first 5 mins this is cleverly done with the clear sense that the movie characters are hearing one style, while we are hearing another, but as the movie continues the distinction becomes quite blurred. This culminates in the party scene, which as a portrayal of the 20's is so far off the mark that I had to wonder if the producers were smoking something when they decided to take that slant. You are left with the feeling that Baz rejected a 20's setting and decided to set the story in a fantastical parallel universe.<br/><br/>Get past this and the rest of the movie is sublime with a great leading performance by DiCaprio - perhaps the best I've seen from him. It perfectly captures the sentiments of Fitzgerald's classic - the dark side of the American Dream.<br/><br/>So make time for this masterpiece, just get through that first 30 mins."
"the-zombie-pirate","7","0","2","2 February 2014"," Almost but no cigar
","In high school, a TA had us label the characters of The Great Gatsby as moral, immoral, and amoral, which was my introduction to the concept of amorality. This movie portrayed the amorality rather clearly, however, I see it more now as not so much as not caring or having no value system at all, but as rampant selfishness and selfcenteredness. The characters had values or knew of what should be valued; they simply chose to live in disregard. Where the film falls short is in how it fulfills that portrayal for its first half to two thirds. The acting seems hollow, especially DiCaprio and Maguire, yet I think that was the intention and I think it works or would have worked if it were not for the music.<br/><br/>Whenever a film's score takes the viewer's attention away from the film, the viewer's interest wanes, at least in my case. I do not know why the makers thought that anachronism replete with raps, dubstep beats, and auto-tuning would enhance the story telling or better engage the audience than the actual period music.<br/><br/>I think that the hollow acting conveys a sense of falsehood and pretense in line with the story's theme, however, what seems like poor acting is distracting. The flashy and HD/ADD attention span editing, lighting, and general cinematography enhance that sense along with adding a feeling of insincerity, emptiness, and surrealism. I think that these latter two techniques were intentional and work well for this story. Unfortunately, they also pushed me to the edge of not caring about the movie itself, then the music plunged me into disinterest for at least the first third. I think I would enjoy seeing this movie with a period score, which would lift my rating by at least one star.<br/><br/>Eventually, the music fades into the background and it becomes apparent that Maguire and DiCaprio can indeed act. The characters and my attention come into focus. The director can actually direct and I forget that I am watching a movie.<br/><br/>This movie made me sad(der) and reminded me of how devoid of true love and value the human centered world really is. In the end, I enjoyed this movie. Its makers had something good going, but they very nearly destroyed it with unfitting and terrible music."

Leonardo did a good job but I was not impressed by his acting at all. He is one of my favorite actors and maybe that's why i was expecting more from him. Having said that, I liked Tobey's acting and role more than anyone else's in the movie. He was, sort of, in the background in the entire movie - moving the story forward. Connecting the dotes and being there to help and be right was what he did well.<br/><br/>Visually the movie was spectacular. Cinematography was awesome and sets were worth watching. But somehow, intensity and depth was missing. It is like you're watching it and enjoying it but you're not in it. On the other hand - I liked the story, of course it is one of the great literature jewels, in general but not it's end. It was tragic love story which didn't end well.<br/><br/>You might like it or you might hate it...but overall worth a one time watch."
"shawneofthedead","6","0","2","18 January 2014"," The film is not quite as great as its Gatsby, but it's worth a watch for its design, soundtrack and - most importantly - central performance.
","Baz Luhrmann does not make movies to be understated or subtle - his best-loved films, from Romeo & Juliet to Moulin Rouge!, are deceptively colourful baubles, bright and sparkly and feather-light on the surface, cracking apart to reveal the dark, tragic side of being alive. The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1920s-set novel about the darker desires hidden within the glittering decadence of the Jazz Age, would seem to be right up Luhrmann's alley.<br/><br/>Critical reception to the final film has been divided, however, veering between rapturous proclamations that it's the finest cinematic version of Fitzgerald's novel yet; and bitter condemnations of his miserable failure at effectively capturing the essence of the book on screen. I've not read Fitzgerald's novel, so am ill-equipped to pronounce one way or another my opinion as to whether Luhrmann has whipped up a fantastic or terrible adaptation of the book. As a purely cinematic experience, however, it's safe to say that there's much to enjoy in Luhrmann's starburst of a film - even though it's hard to shake the feeling that he's traded much depth and character for a hypnotic aesthetic and soundtrack.<br/><br/>The tale of the titular Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) is told by his neighbour Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), an observer - almost a voyeur - of the huge, hedonistic parties thrown every night at the glamorous mansion up the way. Gatsby comes from 'new money': a self-made millionaire whose wealth and whims are causing ripples of curiosity throughout high society in 1920s New York. As Carraway finds himself drawn ever more into Gatsby's excesses, he discovers a secret in his friend's past that explains his behaviour in the present, one that is inextricably tied up with socialite Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and, by extension, her aggressive philanderer of a husband Tom (Joel Edgerton).<br/><br/>Luhrmann's film is a treat to watch and listen to. Every frame drips with style and excess, as flappers Charleston their way across the screen and Jay-Z's jazz-influenced hip-hop beats spill over the audience. Gatsby's parties are draped in an air of smoky energy that effectively conveys the sort of lazy, frantic decadence in which the moneyed classes lost themselves before the Great Depression reared its sobering head.<br/><br/>Scratch beneath the glittery surface, and The Great Gatsby is pulsing with themes and ideas about love, obsession and the American Dream - all of which, as I understand it, underpin Fitzgerald's novel. Much of this depth is due to DiCaprio's fascinating, subtle central performance. (It's the most subtle thing on display in Luhrmann's entire glitterball of a film.) Jay ought to be a hugely complex creation - he's not merely great or admirable for having dragged himself bodily out of poverty for the sake of a dream (or obsession) that's kept him going for years; he's also to be pitied and, occasionally, feared. Gatsby as a character also embodies the hollow promise of the American Dream - he can reinvent himself as much as he likes, but it doesn't mean he'll achieve the success, love or happiness for which he's so earnestly striving.<br/><br/>As Gatsby, DiCaprio manages to be man, metaphor and menace all at once, a feat that again proves he's one of the finest actors of his generation. He plays all the shades of that complexity wonderfully well, swinging from desperate to unhinged to naive - oftentimes in the same scene. He makes Gatsby's tireless, misguided devotion believable and sympathetic, even in the character's more deluded moments. If your heart breaks while watching this movie, it will be for him.<br/><br/>The rest of The Great Gatsby is hit-and-miss. When DiCaprio is off the screen, the film sags and its weighty themes seem to evaporate into thin air. Mulligan is halfway entrancing - while not quite a completely opaque presence, it's nevertheless tough to really relate to the little cracks and moments of heartbreak that Mulligan layers into her performance. Maguire, meanwhile, seems uncomfortably out-of-place - and not necessarily in a good way. His Nick Carraway has little colour and fire of his own, instead basking in the glow thrown off by Gatsby and Daisy - which is no doubt part of the point of his character. But, as Maguire plays it, that impression feels less like an organic part of his performance and more an unfortunate side-effect.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's film sings, shines and sparkles just as brightly and earnestly as many of his earlier works. Whether all that charm, verve and brightness is deployed to good effect is more debatable. Gatsby's great tragedy is that his monumental efforts to spin a new fairy tale for himself never quite achieve the result he's clearly hoping for. The same, unfortunately, goes for DiCaprio and the movie surrounding him."

","You know, I've never been the biggest fan of both F. Scott Fitzgerald and director Baz Luhrman, so when Luhrman announced he was adapting Fitzgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby for the big-screen, I had very low expectations, and in those regards I was surprised by the film, but it still does not make me a fan of Luhrman or Fitzgerald. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular Gatsby, and he's charming and does his usual Leonardo DiCaprio thing here, but it's a fairly safe performance by an actor who is capable of far more reaching material, however, part of the reasoning for that is that this film never really takes flight. This is an emotionally cold story, and it's hard to relate to rich people lavishing in their own extravagance when very few people are actually that wealthy. Not to mention the fact that all of the melodrama comes across as trite and soap opera-like in our more modern time where we've seen just about every genre clichÃ© this films features hundreds of times before. Even still, this is a visually sumptuous film that is vibrant and energetic in its style, with some solid performances from the cast. It's just one of those films that if you aren't already a fan of the book or the director's previous works, you will find very little to latch onto here and enjoy.<br/><br/>I give The Great Gatsby a 6 out of 10!"

In fact, I delayed seeing it because I'd heard so many bad reviews that I didn't bother until I could find it online. I figured that if they couldn't make a good Gatsby film with Robert Redford, Baz Luhrmann didn't stand a chance, even with Leo DiCaprio. What a mistake. <br/><br/>Mind you, it's not entirely perfect... I'd have done just a few things differently, and the choice of integrating modern music into a period film like this can be jarring, especially in the beginning. But after the first twenty minutes or so everything really does come together, and it becomes a beautiful, colorful, and engrossing film. The performances are absolutely wonderful, especially DiCaprio, who is spot-on and captures the Jay Gatsby character perfectly. <br/><br/>I really was shocked and amazed at how incredibly good this turned out to be.

","I had previously enjoyed Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet and Moulin Rouge so when I watched his version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, I wasn't surprised at his modern take on it despite being mostly true to the time period it's set in. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as the title character who made himself become rich through not very legal means though has the charms to hide that part of himself to those swayed by his demeanor. Tobey Maguire still has the boyish look to pass himself as the green witness to the party atmosphere that abounds around Jay Gatsby's mansion. And Carey Mulligan just oozes beauty and charm as the flighty Daisy. When I saw the original trailer for this movie, the hip-hop music was distracting knowing about the '20s jazz age setting but it makes sense here in conveying the innovative and provocative way it ushered in a new kind of music to a mass audience. With this being the first time I was encountering this source material, I very much enjoyed this version of The Great Gatbsy."

","I was captivated ten minutes into it. I never read the F. Scott Fitzgerald book, but the movie seems to stay true to most of what I read of the original novels plot summary. The extravagant party scenes, cars, costumes, and music were very fascinating, but it was the mystery and ever-changing story of Gatsby, narrated by his neighbor Nick Carraway, that drew me in. I imagine in the Roaring Twenties, during Prohibition and before the stock market crash, things really were that extravagant in New York and Long Island. And I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a very good job of portraying the mysterious millionaire that is in love with a woman, while trapped in a lie that he continues (and possibly believes) in the hopes of getting her back. You can clearly see his mood change anytime he's in fear of his secrets getting out. But as Nick tries to explain to Gatsby, you cannot relive the past and erase what has happened since. Great adaptation, in my opinion."
"jackasstrange","7","0","2","1 December 2013"," Over the top stylized film
","I was thinking about making a proper comment about The Great Gatsby(2013, worth to remember that there is two oldest films based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald ), then i just realized that stylish modern french-wave romance would be a perfect definition for this film. Stylized, perhaps is a word that causes eeks in some cinema conservatives, and this kind of 'stylized' films nowadays tend to be received with a strange low brow and bigotry by the critics, which not for coincidence dislike this film. <br/><br/>While i agree that in some parts the fact that this film inexplicably starts to play contemporary rap instead of playing a common music from the 50s is kinda weird, the quick frenetic editing, also criticized by some for being way too frenetic, it is nothing new in cinema. In fact, it was inspired in an old very known style of films: the french new wave, which one of the most notorious characteristics were the utilization of quick editing almost every time to constantly reminds the viewer that he is watching a film, contrasting with the super blockbusters by Hollywood, who managed to put the viewer as close as possible to the characters and to the film itself. This trick was used in The Great Gatsby, and it totally fits the story the crazy special effects and also the beautiful cinematography. Cinematography is indeed good in this film, it is really made in a way that you can even feel the ambient, and also to delight the panoramic shots of the Manhattan island in external and internal views.<br/><br/>But despite all this effort in taking our attention constantly away from the film, Gatsby's story is really interesting, and you really want to know the secrets he keeps and the why of everything. The 'cause' in question couldn't be more cheesy in a romance film _ A Woman _ and he is entirely moved by his passion for that woman. But this is not a conventional romance story, despite the fact that it really looks like one. In the end, Gatsby was the heart of NY. If he was good or not, does not matter.<br/><br/>A recommended film, though not for everyone. 7.0/10"

I was wrong. This is a good version of the oft-filmed story. Leonardo DiCaprio, never one of my favorites, does pretty well here as Gatsby. The script is very much like that written for the 1974 version, which is my favorite. The photography glistens and I didn't mind the hip-hop music too much! The running time is exactly the same as the 1974 version, and the period details are pretty well done, outside of the fact that Gatsby's beautiful car is about ten years too young for the 1920s.

"boscopa-1","Null","0","2","19 October 2013"," Entertaining Film; Not a Fan of the Novel
","This is a movie I wouldn't have watched under my own initiative; my girlfriend wanted to see it. That being said I'm glad I did. I read the novel in high school and it bored me to tears; I also slumbered through the Robert Redford version many years ago. I never understood why the novel is considered such a classic and truth be told I still don't. However, this version held my attention and kept me interested for the entire running time. <br/><br/>Assuming everyone knows the story I will not rehash the plot. Toby Maguire is Nick Carraway, the narrator of the novel and the narrator of the film as well. Carraway is a cipher; all of the pivotal moments in the story involve other characters while he merely recounts them. The central figure is the mysterious Jay Gatsby; a fabulously wealthy man who throws decadent parties and about whom nothing is known. The buildup to his first appearance is nicely handled and when Leonardo DiCaprio arrives about a half hour into the movie he is equal to the anticipation. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the payoff does not match the buildup. The reason for everything Gatsby does is to rekindle his love affair with Daisy Buchanan, currently the wife of jackass Tom Buchanan. This is where the story falls apart for me and possibly in the translation from novel to film. In my mind Daisy should be a paragon among women: beautiful, smart, sexy, nurturing, and loving. In short a lady worthy of a man's undying devotion. While I understand this is also part of the tragedy of Jay Gatsby, i.e. loving an undeserving woman, Daisy does not fulfill any of these qualities. She seems weak and easily manipulated by the two strong men in her life: Gatsby and Tom. In short I just don't see why Gatsby would devote all his energy to winning her over. One can have sympathy for her because her husband is a bastard but she can't seem to be her own person. <br/><br/>This brings me back to the character of Gatsby. To do everything for the love of a woman appeals to the romantic in me but to do it for this woman seems plain stupid. For someone as clever and driven as Gatsby is he seems really delusional about his chances with Daisy. Not only does he want to rewrite history with her but Daisy needs to come to him on his specific terms. Winning her is not enough but must be done within the elaborate fantasy world he has created. One can feel sorry for him because even if you have not read the book you can see where the story is headed. The crucial scene where Gatsby announces his plans for Daisy in front of Tom is heart-rendering. Everyone knows Daisy is not going to leave Tom except for Gatsby and he refuses to accept this even after he is brutally exposed as a fraud by Tom. Daisy becomes an emotional wreck, commits a horrible crime for which Gatsby takes the blame, and then deserts him completely. Unable or unwilling to accept the truth, Gatsby foolishly clings to his fantasy up to his dying breath. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is marvelous as Gatsby. He is everything the character should be: dashing, handsome, mysterious, curiously naive, boyish, and noble. I read a review that joked how a good drinking game could be made out of how many times he says 'Old Sport."" I doubt many would make it past the 60 minute mark before calling an ambulance since he punctuates nearly every sentence with this phrase. The sequence that really cracked me up was the staged first meeting with Daisy. Gatsby is as nervous as a schoolboy; blushing, stammering, and charmingly awkward. But come on Dude, have you looked in the mirror recently? You're Leonardo DiCaprio for God's sake!! All kidding aside I couldn't stand him as that twerp in Titanic but he has really impressed me over the years not only as an actor but as a charismatic movie star. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is a notch below but still effective. Toby Maguire is an excellent narrator and blends into the woodwork during the most pivotal scenes which is not an insult. Carey Mulligan does as well as anyone could in a role that is probably impossible to play. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan does a fine job as a character that could have easily devolved into the standard bad guy part. Tom is a really despicable person to be sure but at least he knows it; he's honest about being a crud and doesn't seem to suffer any pangs about it. To him Gatsby is worse because he is a phony. <br/><br/>The look of the film is clearly the selling point. The visuals are beautiful, the colors vivid, and the CGI recreation of New York in the Roaring '20s looks fantastic. The party scenes give a real sense of how decadent the times were before the stock market crash ended it all. The use of modern musical updates to some classic songs works very well and breathes fresh air into what could have been a very stale retelling. And I love how the shot of Gatsby's corpse floating in the pool is directly lifted from 'Sunset Boulevard.'<br/><br/>While the story itself does not really appeal to me this version of The Great Gatsby was worth the investment. I can appreciate what the narrative is trying to convey while quibbling with some of the execution. The visuals alone make it worth a look but the performance of DiCaprio should not be missed by anyone who appreciates the actor and what star power is all about."

Now I have to re-watch it to compare, but I believe the basic story is faithful to the book.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is Jay Gatsby. That isn't his real name, at least it wasn't the one he had for most of his life. Growing up rural and poor he eventually left home, encountered a sailor, and from the older man learned how to become a ""gentleman"" in modern society. But when the older man died, and the surviving family inherited all the money, Gatsby moved on with his new, more sophisticated name. <br/><br/>At some point as a young adult he fell in love with pretty Carey Mulligan as Daisy. But when he went off to war they lost contact, and she married to become Daisy Buchanan. Her husband is Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, a wealthy man, some called him ""the polo player"", living in a mansion on a bay on Long Island.<br/><br/>So after a few introductory scenes that I found a bit unclear and disjointed, the story became Gatsby's quest to regain the love of Daisy. It is 1922. His method was to get very rich, ostensibly via illegal commerce, and buy the even more ostentatious mansion across the bay. Here New Yorkers would come often for lavish parties, with entertainment, all without invitations. Gatsby hoped one of those parties would bring Daisy back to him.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire also has a key role as Nick Carraway, a writer whom Gatsby had befriended, and who tells much of the story from a doctor's office.<br/><br/>It is important to remember this is a Baz Luhrman film, and as such has a certain look and pace to it. I enjoyed it after the opening scenes were passed and the story began in earnest.<br/><br/>Spoilers: As we know the story ends tragically. Gatsby tries very hard to get Daisy to admit she never loved Tom, that she still loves Gatsby, that she will divorce Tom and they will go away to a new life. But a gas station man mistakenly believes Gatsby was having an affair with his wife (Isla Fischer), when it really was Tom, so he shoots and kills Gatsby, ending his dream of getting Daisy back."

","I enjoyed the film except for the horrible music. Rap/Hip Hop music had no business being in a 20s story. It was distracting, horrible, and was plain wrong for the film. With all the jazz greats who were performing during the time period of the story. <br/><br/>This was an opportunity to select from and highlight the music of the time. It is really unfortunate and just about ruined the movie for me.

","There's been several entries into film for this Novel material from Fitzgerald, but I haven't seen the others, and read the book long ago forgetting many of the details. This installment ""The Great Gatsby"" by director Baz Luhrmann is a good run with the exception of one highly grating and irritating liberty taken by the filmmakers - mixing contemporary and classic music anachronistically. Didn't work at all, and was a big mistake - for a piece based on period literature over 50 years ago. That out of the way, the actors performances range from excellent to satisfactory with Joel Edgerton turning in the best performance as Buchanon. Absolutely loved the climactic argument with Edgerton and Dicaprio. The single funniest and most entertaining moment in the movie is Edgerton's Buchanon snidely and cynically laughing at Dicaprio's Gatsby spilling on about 5-year love to Daisy. Great visuals. 7/10 and recommended"

"MovieDude1893","5","0","2","8 October 2013"," Fine Fluff, but a thoroughly unremarkable adaptation
","The Great Gatsby (Luhrmann, 2013, C+) <br/><br/>There is enough good here to make the miscalculations (and a few of them are colossal miscalculations) even more apparent. However, the film has a few virtues. One is DiCaprio, who gives a usual sturdy performance, even if it only ranks near the middle of the best work. Also, the film's back half is much stronger than it's opening. It's the best screen Gatsby to yet be made, but it's still only a little better than half way there. <br/><br/>Here's the real issue, though: Luhrmann labors under the delusion that GATSBY is a love story between a man and a woman and not a love story between a man and a dream. He takes a source rich with symbol and metaphor and creates a distressingly literal adaptation. His camera wings gleefully through party after party, luxuriating in the decadence of these mansions. He is in love with the excesses of the roaring twenties. He makes the exact film that Gatsby the character would want made about himself and in doing so bypasses richer thematic avenues. To borrow a phrase from both the novel and film versions, Luhrmann is far too occupied with his count of enchanted objects."

Don't get me wrong.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>I hated the obnoxious over use of ""Old Sport"" and the out of time soundtrack. Gatsby had Rap, Hip Hop, and Techno music playing at his parties in the 1920s. A really stupid thing to do if you ask me. It helped ruin the overall mood of the movie.<br/><br/>The scenery/style was accurate and breathtaking. As with all new movies far too much CGI was used to the point of some scenes looking more the Roger Rabbit than reality.

","Another visual feast by Baz Lurhmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia). The fifth version of the classic book by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and definitely the most extravagant, as we would have expected from Luhrmann, who always tends to lavishly overstylize his films. This is his first foray into the realm of 3D, and fortunately it's a successful one at that. From a narrative viewpoint, the movie predictably feels less intriguing. In the early Roaring Twenties, war veteran Nick Carraway (a rather dull Tobey Maguire, as is the norm) moves to Long Island, next door to a giant mansion belonging to the seemingly incredibly wealthy but enigmatic Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio, another one of his hugely rich and influential but emotionally tormented big screen souls). Drawn to the unreal world of fabulous upperclass decadence, Carraway soon gets his taste of high society as he attends one of Gatsby's unbelievably amazing parties. Gatsby soon purposefully reveals himself to Nick and recruits him to arrange a meeting between himself and Nick's attractive cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), a long lost love of Gatsby from before the Great War whom he lost contact with and who has since gone on to marry a rich but quite dislikeable land owner (Joel Edgerton). Hoping to respark their love thanks to Nick's involvement bridging their past, Gatsby and Daisy soon reunite and haphazardly start an affair that can only end in tragedy. But despite his attempts to basically bang a married girl, you hope Gatsby succeeds as he is a sympathetic character, once a boy who came from nothing but worked himself up to incredulous heights, while still favoring the lower class folks who live decent lives worth living, instead of engaging in the monotony of endless partying. Gatsby appears to make a stand for the poor, hard working labourers with his understanding attitude and actions, which can only lead to his downfall from the rich ruling classes and their corrupting power over everything and everyone. But what a downfall it is, shot with such dynamic vibrancy and wild colour schemes, presented in three jaw-droppingly beautiful dimensions! Nevertheless the blatant melodrama at the core is hard to be effectively sugarcoated, even in Luhrmann's elaborate ways. The Great Gatsby emulates its titular character, in the sense that it's packed with bombastic bravura and laced with visual flair throughout, detracting you from the lack of a refined, satisfactory plot, which is notably absent if you care to see beneath the mask of its sensational appearance. Beneath the surface it's all fairly hollow, but not without a certain charm. This movie is a feast to behold as much as the parties it depicts would no doubt be a thrill to attend, but ultimately, it proves a fairly forgetful experience in the long run. And so Hollywood can keep remaking Fitzgerald's novel once every few decades to ever more spectacular results."

It seemed no profound truth to be gained. Then one day, strolling on the way home, I was suddenly enlightened: we are all Gatesby. Harboring great expectations for the future, we pursue the green light across the river, arduously reach out both arms and exert all we have graping the twinkling in the mist while actually drifting far away.

","Hello, my name is Pham Lai and this is my first review for any movie. To tell you a bit about myself, I am a 17 year old Vietnamese philosopher. While I may not be educated in Oxford like Sir Gatsby, I certainly do a lot of thinking. I am a simple Caodaiistst, and I love life. In my language, my religion's full name is ""Đại Đạo Tam Kỳ Phổ Độ"" which means ""Great Religion of The Third Period of Revelation and Salvation"" in English. We believe in the teachings of the Buddha, Sages, and Saints. Anyhow, enough about me.<br/><br/>This movie was a dull story of love, and nothing more. Like James Gatz, anyone in life can work from nothing to fame, or at least live a modest life. I personally grew up in South Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City) and just recently moved to Hanoi, in north Vietnam. My country is always oppressed by some people, for example the Americans and the Chinese. For more than a thousand years, Chinese have controlled our great land of Vietnam. The Americans tried to invade us and force their ways on us, but we prevailed and won the war. I grew up in poverty and I slowly, with each passing day made a better and better future for myself, just like Mister Gatsby. This movie was very sad in the fact that the ""old chap"" Gatz wasted all those 5 years waiting and waiting, and then died in such a horrid way. The ending of the movie for me was a big disappointment, almost like they didn't have the funding for a better one. Just as Mr. Gatsby was so close to finally having his love, he was shot through the heart. And even in his death he was disrespected, because nobody went to his funeral except the young lad that lived next to Gatz. The movie itself honestly wasn't very interesting, it was a simple plot about someone inside a physic ward telling a story of his friend, or had he imagined it all? It was a simple love story of a man who wanted what he could not get, and because it was such a simple story, I give this movie a 6 out of 10 stars."

","To begin, I find it annoying that all anyone complains about is the music not fitting the times. I think that's one of the strong points of the film. I really don't like all the artists involved in the film (besides Jack White) but the music worked well. It shouldn't be a problem unless you believe that a movie needs to be 100% true to the source material. <br/><br/>I liked the visuals, too. It was all very cool, and it wasn't overdone to the point where it distracted from the story.<br/><br/>THE PROBLEM IS THE STORY ITSELF<br/><br/>Let's get something clear: if this movie would have been handed over to a great director... let's say David Fincher... in post-production it would have been movie of the year hands down. <br/><br/>The only thing that ruined the film was the editing. And yes, it RUINED it. It killed this film. The most aggravating part of it all is we all know by now this is just ""a certain director"" trying to pretentiously assert to us that he is ""arty"" and ""edgy."" <br/><br/>Which is fine, unless you destroy all sense of pace that the film has! <br/><br/>The pacing was just awful... especially in the first half.<br/><br/>It was edited so literally every thirty seconds the location changes. Meanwhile our narrator, Tobey Maguire, speed reads what seems like too much dialogue. It hurts to watch these scenes.<br/><br/>Everyone says the second half is better: and while it is, it's only because the acting was so strong it occasionally broke through the bad editing. Especially DiCaprio. This film could have been the highlight of his recent career. I honestly didn't feel as invested in the characters as I should have been. There were a few really well done scenes, and they only made me more angry at he bad one's.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is another problem. I don't think it's his fault. I think it's just the approach he decided to take or the director (sorry Baz but it has to be said) instructed him to take. He just wasn't that interesting or notable, with the exception of a few scenes where he works to his strong points. It's not good that the movie is centred and narrated by such a weak character.<br/><br/>While the acting and sets/animation are truly AMAZING, the flaws just kill the film. It's not the must-see movie of the year like it should have been, it's just a decent film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Baz Luhrmann should not be allowed to work on post-production with the exception of special effects. He's a great director, visionary, and writer... but man he does not get pace. If you're doubting the importance of pace, go see this movie. Maybe then you'll understand."

","When you watch a movie which is a celebrated novel in English literature, you try and see if it simplifies the literature and yet maintain its subtlety. <br/><br/>The movie does this splendidly. Apart from the challenge of converting worded descriptions into a visual replication, the character portrayal has come out really well. The passions of Gatsby, the narrative impulse of Nick and Daisy!<br/><br/>The plot for those who aren't familiar - A millionaire tries to befriend certain people to get close to his love interest. How is does that and whether he manages to get close to her is just one part of the movie. The more sensitive part is the third person narration of the entire event by Nick Carraway (Tobey). That adds the flavour into the movie and asks a larger question on the legitimateness of the actions undertaken by the characters and their subsequent impact on perceptions about them.<br/><br/>For all these projections which blend the need to make a visual effect simple yet layered, I give it a 7 on 10."
"murtaza_mma","8","0","3","10 September 2013"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Baz Luhrmann's monumental adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus
","The Great Gatsby is a 2013 drama film directed by Australian filmmaker Baz Luhrmann, based on a 1925 novel of the same name by the great American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's novel is best remembered for its hallucinatory portrayal of the Jazz Age through the microcosmic world of glittery opulence kaleidoscopically enveloping the extravagant but hollow way of living that underlines the ethos of the American Dream. Fitzgerald's scurrilous satire on the zeitgeist of the tumultous 1920s, The Great Gatsby explores several conflicting motifs like love, materialism, sacrifice, self-indulgence, extravagance, idealism, stagnation, upheaval, ostentation, modesty, etc. And Luhrmann's movie, to its credit, succeeds in capturing the novel's motifs in essence, if not in totality. <br/><br/>The Great Gatsby presents the tale of a young, enigmatic, seemingly profligate millionaire named Jay Gatsby whose ideals of love come across to be so virtuous and pristine that they seem to be modeled upon none other than Don Quixote himself.The Great Gatsby despite its flaws proves to be an unforgettable cinematic experience for an intelligent viewer. The Great Gatsby, being the quintessential Luhrmann extravaganza, is quite high on style but fortunately there's enough substance to keep a keen-eyed viewer interested throughout. Fitzgerald's masterful storytelling seems to gel quite well with Luhrmann's showmanship. The manner in which the movie blends elements of drama, suspense, romance and tragedy is indeed exemplary. Simon Duggan's breathtaking cinematography brings the movie to life. Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Carey Mulligan are brilliant in their respective roles and in that order.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby is neither a typical Hollywood product nor an art house movie. It is for this reason it is difficult to categorize as a film. And perhaps that's why it opened to mixed reviews in Cannes early this year. If anything it's a movie that requires patience and would most definitely satisfy the cravings of the patient lot.<br/><br/>For more, please visit my film blogsite:<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job and portrayed the quiet character he was supposed to be well. Leonardo DiCaprio was also a great contribution to this movie. Gatsby was intended to be a mysterious man who was read by others as well off. Carey Mulligan fulfilled her role with a lot of promise. She was able to play her position as the middle women well and her acting as secret mistress was great. Overall, this was a good movie it had a good story line, and as the movie plays you become more and more interested with what will happy next. Although I do have one complaint about this movie, time.

","From the encyclopedia the facts are here: 'The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.' Pretty well said and for those many of us who have read the novel that straightforward description serves Fitzgerald's story well.<br/><br/>Enter Baz Luhrmann who adapted Fitzgerald's novel with his constant co-writer Craig Pearce (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom) and director this Rose Parade Float version of Gatsby and the emphasis is different from the book - and that really is OK; it is a visualization of the raucous flamboyance of the Roarin' 20s pushed to extremes and decorated with Luhrmann's fetish for across time music themes and songs. The story remains intact for the most part as narrated by faux writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the epitome of the American Dream Jay Gatsby is pasted on Leonardo DiCaprio while the vapid Daisy is well underplayed by Carey Mulligan. The spectacle settles down for moments offering some fine cameos by Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, spectacularly beautiful and talented Elizabeth Debicki in the small but significant role as Jordan Baker, Isla Fisher as the doomed Myrtle Wilson, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband George Wilson, and Callan McAuliffe as the teenage Jay Gatsby plus a 'cast of thousands'. It places rich man poor man and the opportunities for role reversal at a new level and Luhrmann and company make that happen. Yes, it is overdone and over the top as is Luhrmann's style, and no, I wouldn't watch it again, but as entertainment on the grand scale it is not bad! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","Well, 'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one story that has been given too many trials on the screen. Chronologically in 1926, 1949, 1974(won 2 Oscars & screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola) and now in 2013 by different directors. What I mean to say is, Baz Luhrmann(Director) had a lot to learn from screenplay, cast and direction of the movies previously made on this very novel. But what I saw, the choice for the actors for the roles was way weak except for Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is not a narrator kind of an actor, so his role's requirement was not amply coped. It seemed like a real character is missing from the screen.<br/><br/>However getting to the positive aspects, music of the movie had its modern touch. The way it made its place in a story plot of 1922, it is really a thing to praise. The compatibility of music with dialogs and screenplay was very accurate and carefully tailored.<br/><br/>The Great DiCaprio (Gatsby)'s character was very strong, beautifully handled and fulfilled.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is a worthy effort as all of its versions before.

","Rich man Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) befriends Nick Carraway (Toby McGhuire), but his real intention is to get close to Nick's cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), who is currently married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Oh, oh! This is basically a love story. Okay, a rich man's love story. <br/><br/>I think we might have more of an appreciation for Classic stories if they were updated into modern times, somewhat. Hey, I said ""somewhat."" Not a reboot, but like this one with upbeat music, some CGI and, yes, narration that helps fill in the blank parts in a story. Why? Because it all worked in here. I was mesmerized.<br/><br/>I do not understand why DiCaprio has not been awarded an Oscar. He is a very talented actor all the time, and he makes everyone around him better and it definitely showed in here. I was surprised at all the other characters' performances. I have new respect for Toby Mcguire, Carey Mulligan and the best - other than DiCaprio's performance - was Joel Edgerton's character Tom Buchanan. They were perfect. <br/><br/>From time to time, you will see sentences appear on the screen as Nick narrates. These words are some of F.Scott Fitzgerald's writing and this was most clever. Kudos. <br/><br/>It doesn't matter that Carey Mulligan was not the most beautiful woman that could have played Daisy. Her looks give off that very pretty, perpetual youthful look. And, as far as Gatsby was concerned ""the heart wants what the heart wants."" End of story. We cared about Gatsby - although for a long time we really didn't know anything about him (that comes later) – and wanted him to succeed. Maybe he reminds us of someone we wanted and couldn't get for whatever reason. Again, end of story. <br/><br/>In a rich man's environment you would expect the sets to be grandiose and most beautiful and they were. The music and limited CGI were spot on as was the cinematography. <br/><br/>In the beginning you will hear that many people knew very little about Gatsby and were those stories about him true? But, then again, he threw spectacular parties and who cares? <br/><br/>You will be told the truth, in time. You will find out where Gatsby's money comes from. Why he waited 5-years before looking Daisy up again since he left abruptly back in the day. You will also learn Gatsby's real story and how he came to be The Great Gatsby in the minds of the many. How good is that? See, the Classics don't have to be boring. Okay, now bring on That Scarlett Letter (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","Baz Luhrmans' interpretation of the Great Gatsby falls nothing short of exquisite. He brings a modern touch to a masterpiece and interweaves the two seamlessly. Carey Mulligan was Daisy through and through (much better than Mia Farrow). She impressed me the most. Leonardo DiCaprio was almost as impressive and seemed to understand the complexity of Jay Gatsby and took it to a place that Robert Redford failed to do with his subtle yet powerful acting. I cared about all the characters (except Tom)and Tobey McGuire was also convincing as Nick the troubled bystander of this tragic tale. Baz Luhrman has managed to tell a story of a group of people that remains relevant in todays society of wealth and prestige and the victims that it ensnares. If you are a fan of Baz Luhrman and modern touch that he brings to his films this will be a plus for you. If not than you probably won't enjoy any of his films. That has to do with personal taste not his ability to be a great filmmaker or artist. I'm looking forward to seeing Carey Mulligan in other films."

","THE ELEMENTAL CHALLENGE <br/><br/>In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald penned what one might arguably claim the elusive ""Great American Novel."" Such a peculiar magnum opus inherently challenges all but the finest film makers into a frenzied, trembling attempt (whether realized or not) at the long climb of a seemingly endless ladder, i.e., the crafting a worthy transformation—a transformation of the practically untouchable wonders effervescing from the words so carefully crafted and printed between the covers of Fitzgerald's American masterpiece—into the artistic medium of the silver screen. A roaring difficult transformation indeed, consisting of a mastering a series of complex moving images (both separately and comprehensively), which requires an impeccably accurate representation of that effervescing wonder, stretching out into the darkness toward the proverbial green light, and slowly rising from the immortal words of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Oh, what a titanic task! <br/><br/>THE FANTASTIC RESULT <br/><br/>Baz Luhrmann, producer and director of the sensational, dazzling ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001) stands firm as perhaps the only film maker free of any crippling intimidation limiting the proper transformation of Fitzgerald's palatial, avant-garde literary art work into an equally spectacular, stunning filmographic art work. Luhrmann, the producer and director of the ""The Great Gatsby"" (2013) expertly adapts the singular nature of Fitzgerald's brilliant, tantalizing, and imaginative prose into the rich, artistically cross-comparable, and almost intoxicating wonders of film and sound. In ""The Great Gatsby,"" Baz Luhrmann skillfully breathes new life into that extraordinary effervescence that softly rises from Fitzgerald's written tour de force, but Luhrmann does so from the modern medium of amazingly high quality moving pictures and mind-engaging sound. This adept use of these moving artistic images combined with all but overwhelming sounds expands and magnifies the softly rising effervescence of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby to encompass and thoroughly thrill one's senses in the simply wonderful audiovisual, artistic masterpiece that is Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby."" <br/><br/>EPILOGUE <br/><br/>Artistic mediums innately present themselves in what humans interpret under vastly altering perceptions. Comparing a literary work of art to that of a film likens comparing a grizzly bear to a killer whale. While both animals carry similar traits such as the genus mammal and feeding by killing, they prove different in more ways than similar. So it is with comparing The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald with ""The Great Gatsby"" by Luhrmann. Hence, one must let preconceptions go. Enjoy the filmographic master's touch for what it is: a splendid work of art in film, not literature. When you honestly do this, ""The Great Gatsby"" will open for you a new world of dazzling artistic splendor and enjoyment."

","Just recently, I had read F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel ""The Great Gatsby"" in preparation for Baz Luhrmann's new film that bears the same name. ""The Great Gatsby"" stars Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, an aspiring writer and war veteran who is struggling to make a profit after entering the bonds business. He moves into a small cottage on Long Island, where just over on the other side of the bay lives his cousin Daisy Buchanan, played by Carey Mulligan and her snobbish husband Tom, played by Joel Edgerton. Next to his humble cottage stands a massive palace owned by a wealthy businessman shrouded in mystery named Jay Gatsby. New York inhabitants flock to his home every weekend where he holds grand parties. In this case invitations are not necessary, though Nick seems to be the only one invited. Upon his arrival, Nick is bedazzled by the shear scale of the party. He bumps into a woman named Jordan Baker, a famous sportswoman who he had met earlier whilst visiting his cousin's house. They decide to search for the party's host, Mr. Gatsby. Purely by accident, Nick seems to come face to face with the man himself. As the story progresses we discover more about Gatsby and his somewhat unusual past.<br/><br/>The film has been constantly advertised as a thrilling and energetic adaptation of the novel, but after seeing it i'm not sure that's a good thing. Where the novel was subtle and elegant, the film is outlandish and at times even a bit obnoxious. As with such films as ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"", Luhrmann seems to focus more on the style of the film and undermines the story. Though, I can't deny that the film looks beautiful, even if the style feels overbearing. People have criticized the use of modern day music, I personally thought this was a bold choice that played out very well on screen. The music helped set the scene for the parties and added a certain charm to the classic setting. Surprisingly, the 3D was unusually well done. I'm really not a fan of this so whenever I go see a 3D movie it tends to feel like a chore. In this case it really helped to immerse me in the story, as well as create beautiful visuals. On an acting level everyone delivered solid performances. Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton were all fine. The supporting actors were also just as good. Isla Fisher and Elisabeth Debicki did a great job at showing the contrast between different types of people in the society of the late 20′s. Whilst Fisher's character was vulgar and provocative Debicki's was sleek and classy.<br/><br/>In hindsight, Luhrmann's adaptation of Fitzgerald's classic novel can be obnoxious due to the overbearing style of the film, but it also provides the viewer with beautiful visuals, well acted performances and a well paced story. It establishes itself as a faithful and energetic imagining of the book. It certainly is not as great as it has been advertised to be, but it still is pretty good."
"jburtroald95","7","0","2","11 July 2013"," Not as good as we'd hoped, but not as bad as we thought
","Everyone acquainted with great, classic American literature knows that F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is an artfully subtle, quietly philosophical character-driven piece that charms readers mostly with its elegance and with its air of mystery and tragedy. Everyone acquainted with popular Australian cinema knows that Baz Lhurmann's films entertain mostly with their novel excesses and their frenetic alternations between comedy and tragedy. However, the results of Lhurmann setting out to adapt this treasured novel along with co- screenwriter Craig Pearce, who penned each film of the Red Curtain trilogy, are surprisingly more successful than one might expect.<br/><br/>On several points, the director's showmanship actually seems very appropriate, mostly as he depicts the colourful, decadent, indulgent world of the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby (played very sensitively by Leonardo DiCaprio) whose penchant for the extravagant is as great as Lhurmann's. The scenes inside his colossal, noisy, lavishly decorated mansion bursting with uninvited partygoers from all walks of life give Lhurmann a plausible excuse to use his characteristic frenetic editing, dress hundreds of extras in bright, sparkly costumes, blast out techno- beat dance music and bedazzle us with explosions of loud colours. In its way, these scenes are equally if not more effective at pulling us into the outrageously vibrant world of the excited, optimistic, childlike title character when compared with the original novel. The anachronistic music might be jarring, but I doubt that a party scene using vintage 1920s jazz certainly would have made me feel as wild and electric and as though I were a part of the late night celebrations myself.<br/><br/>The soundtrack works even better in the first scene of drunken indulgence, where we see Gatsby's normally well-behaved next-door neighbour Nick Carroway (Tobey Maguire) being literally dragged into a smaller-scale but still riotous celebration by his brutish acquaintance Tom Buchanan (a strikingly conceited Joel Edgerton). A very psychedelic shot of Nick, our narrator and technically our protagonist, observing his own ridiculous behaviour high up in an apartment building from the street below is a rare moment where Lhurmann's stylised visuals manage to communicate some of the complexities of Fitzgerald's celebrated prose. When they're not clearly satirising modern society, they might be adding to key narrative points melodrama that is either engaging or sickeningly alienating, or the camera-work might just be taking us on a bit of a roller-coaster. I did get a little tired of the camera's hyperactivity after a while, but fortunately the cinematographic sugar high is done with after half an hour.<br/><br/>The melodrama that comes through afterwards mostly works because the story is, at least on some level, about extremes. If Gatsby and Tom's sweet mistress, Myrtle Wilson (a surprisingly good Isla Fisher) are the lovable fools with an absurd amount of faith in their far-fetched plans – Myrtle desperately hopes that she will be whisked away from her dim, primitive husband (a very poignant Jason Clarke) by a richer dim, primitive husband, Tom –then most of the other characters are either shallow fools or shallow villains. There is no question that the beefy, cocky, controlling, white supremacist Tom is our villain, who in the end becomes truly diabolical. Elizabeth Debicki exudes confident stealth and superficiality as Jordan Baker, seemingly the most streetwise female character but who is ultimately as much of a blunderer as the two hapless romantics, Myrtle and Gatsby. Curiously, though as the beautiful but shallow damsel Daisy Buchanan, the plot-driving object of desire, Lhurmann has cast the captivating Carey Mulligan, who of course endows Daisy with the remarkable emotional depth that she does so well. This fooled me into thinking that Daisy was actually a person of substance, despite her actions, or lack thereof.<br/><br/>The character of Nick Carroway is equally thin. In the novel, he is the everyman who, with the exception of the poignant ending in which he becomes an active presence, only exists to witness or catch wind of all the exciting events and give us a cohesive story, <br/><br/>In translating Nick to the medium of film, Pearce and Lhurmann add very little, if any, depth of character to him. Lhurmann's direction to Maguire seems to have been little more than to act like a wide-eyed grinning puppy dog cheerily excited by all the serious emotional conflicts around him. At this, Maguire does excel, but if they also wanted him to be an engaging narrator, they should have hired someone with a bit more of a range. The film relies heavily on a voice-over from a weary, crazed Nick who recounts the story in flashback, sitting at his typewriter in the office of a psychiatrist. Unfortunately, our little link is not lovable enough to enliven one of the most overused of all cinematic storytelling methods. His deadpan voice-over sucks the life out of Fitzgerald's beautiful prose.<br/><br/>Fortunately, though, the butchered narration is occasionally improved with the very striking visual motif of displaying wispy clumps of ashes that shape the words that Maguire is sleepily reciting. Another of the many visual treats is the design of the dismal coal district which is directly in front of the glitzy, colourful wealthy district that is sustained by the hard, manual labour of the lowlier urban dwellers. A large optometrist's billboard containing a giant eye is situated right in the centre of this district, and is frequently cut to as a symbol of the sense of truth and morality that the largely immoral characters turn to at their convenience.<br/><br/>The 1974 Gatsby film adaptation is widely considered to be a very accurate, but ultimately soulless cinematic retelling of what is superficially a very dull story, so I suppose that going spectacularly against the tone of the novel was a more likely way to get to its heart. I'm not quite sure that all of the experimental theatrics really give us a new appreciation of the original work, but they are certainly offset by the many solid performances from the key players."
"TimMeade","5","0","3","9 July 2013"," Cinematic Hyperbole a Matter of Taste
","There is a key scene in The Great Gatsby, your reaction to which will probably determine whether you love it or not.<br/><br/>For the first 30 minutes the eponymous Jay Gatsby is a missing enigma. Teasingly and tauntingly you see him fleetingly in long shot through a far distant window; there are a few close ups of his right pinkie sporting an out-sized signet ring; he is gossiped about, alluded to and referred to, at ever more frequent intervals so that, just like the shark in the original Jaws, his presence becomes greater and more intense by the very fact of his absence from screen.<br/><br/>And then it happens. We gate crash one of Jay Gatsby's regular opulent parties. The grounds in West Egg are overtaken by the whole of New York society, clearly aware that mass ostentation is the only rule of attendance. The camera draws us upon him. As Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue builds and bursts in its sublime crescendo, The Great Gatsby is suddenly there before us, smiling inscrutably, raising his cocktail glass in salute as the night sky behind him is suddenly aflame with the greatest firework display ever seen outside of China.<br/><br/>If you sit in your chair, mouth agape, goose bumps covering your whole being, silently lip-syncing 'WOW!!!!' you will undoubtedly love the whole film. If, on the other hand, you consider this cinematic hyperbole to be, well, perhaps just a teensy-weensy bit over the top then this may not make your Film of the Year shortlist.<br/><br/>For this scene neatly encapsulates Baz Luhrmann's whole take on this enterprise. The film is, to all intents, a cartoon. Live action maybe but a cartoon nonetheless. Gatsby's palatial mansion with its fairy tale turrets and fountains is straight out of a 1940s Disney animation; New York and its hinterland of The Valley of Ashes look more like Batman's Gotham City and even the flashback scenes to World War One's Western Front appear to have been lifted from the 1980s comedy satire, Blackadder Goes Forth. The film gains nothing from being in 3D and having seen it twice I preferred the 2D version, although a few shots were a little askew betraying its dual format.<br/><br/>There is not a shred of subtlety or nuance to be found in the entire 143 minutes. That is not Mr Luhrmann's style. Indeed, I imagine The Great Baz waking up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night in a momentary fear that someone, somewhere might just be able to draw their own conclusion from a scene he believed he had nailed down to be totally beyond interpretation. It is his film and you will see it his way or not at all.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio pretty much nails Jay Gatsby; it's the sort of role in which he excels, for Dicaprio always looks like a movie star – a disadvantage when you try to play mundane but perfect for larger than life characters. The usually excellent Carey Mulligan however, whose haunting performance in Shame I rate as the best I saw all last year, fails to fire as Daisy. It's difficult to be convinced that she could motivate the intense love rivalry between Gatsby and Tom, played as a single note with a never ending scowl by Joel Edgerton. Tobey Maguire has the unenviable task of having to deliver large chunks of the film in narrative – a device which suggests Mr Luhrmann was unsure how best to drive the story.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is deliberately anachronistic, modern day hip hop preferred to jazz. Quite what this is supposed to achieve is beyond me. F. Scott Fitzgerald himself coined the phrase, The Jazz Age, and the film's setting is crying out for a superior jazz score.<br/><br/>The film never fails to fill the entire screen. It is a big film. It will not bore you. You may love it. You may not."

","I felt such a colorful character as Daisy would've better played by someone like Cameron Diaz or Drew Barrymore. Adelaide Clemens fell flat against the other stars. We needed someone breakthrough to fill this role or someone like Cameron or Drew to hold up to Leonardo's charisma and get some audience's reaction. Instead, the half-full theater was nearly silent the whole time. I have to agree with others who saw it that the addition of hip hop felt forced. I would've preferred an original score that felt pulled out of that Gatsby period. And it was a rough start with the screen writing. Less is more, Hollywood! Less is more! We were bored by weak lines. More could've been easily pulled from the book. The SFX and also the graphics at the close were incredible. They were vibrant and more than memorable, so I expect they'll inspire more great design from Hollywood. Overall, I was really expecting much more to honor F. Scott who lived and is buried in my hometown."
"knowyourmovie","7","0","2","16 June 2013"," Flawed, but visually stunning interpretation of the classic masterpiece with great soundtrack
","On the outside the 2013 adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" looks like a beautifully crafted exclusive jewelry box. The quality of the content, however, is not consistent with that of the exterior: inside the box is not a tiny priceless natural diamond, but a huge, tasteless, cheaply- looking cubic zirconia.<br/><br/>That does not mean, however, that Luhrmann's latest movie is not a pleasure to watch. I would even venture to say that ""The Great Gatsby"" can be considered a must see movie, mostly because of its lavish, visually stunning cinematography, if not because of the poor interpretation of the classic story, the interpretation that lacks both depth and substance.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""The Great Gatsby"" is visually breathtaking in almost literal sense. There are many moments in the movie that make you hold your breath and leave you utterly overwhelmed by the piercing richness of the miraculously powerful visual feast. <br/><br/>""The Great Gatsby"" features quite impressive camera work. In some scenes it almost feels like the camera somehow gets attached to your heart and cleverly tricks it into beating faster - with excitement or in anticipation.<br/><br/>Another strong suit of the movie is its amazing soundtrack (Craig Armstrong) that masterfully, with the remarkable precision captures the twists and turns of the novel's delicate mood. While some people were not impressed with the hip hop mix of the original soundtrack, I found it to be in the surprising harmony with both the distinguished literary source and the visual magnificence of its 2013 cinematic adaptation.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Baz Luhrmann's vision, so delightfully original in regards with the exterior details, suffers a noticeable setback when it has to deal with more serious matters, like the delicate substance of the novel, with all its depth and complexity.<br/><br/>That is precisely the area where the 2013 adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" lets us down, suffering from all kinds of issues: the misunderstood and misinterpreted main characters, the poor character development in general, the dragging story sprinkled with wrong accents, the added unnecessary scenes that are not in the novel, and finally the missing important scenes that actually are in the novel.<br/><br/>Being excessively focused on the love triangle between Jay Gatsby, Tom Buchanan, and Daisy Buchanan, the 2013 adaptation fails to give proper attention to the several strategically important plot lines, including the relationship between Nick Carraway and Daisy's close friend (and pathological liar) Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) or the failed marriage of George and Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher).<br/><br/>In addition, the movie falls into a trap of excessively romanticizing Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan and thus misrepresenting their complex relationship by portraying it as a formulaic tragic love story.<br/><br/>It essentially tells us a tear-jerking story about a pair of cute lovebirds who naively dream of impossible only to be tragically separated by the cruel fate. A high human tragedy from the novel has been reduced to a vulgar love tragedy in the movie.<br/><br/>There is also a certain disconnect between the narrative that strongly hints at all the Gatsby's illegal activities, unscrupulous business dealings, and shady connections and the inspired sugary image that we see on the screen.<br/><br/>Charmingly passionate and overly sensitive, Romeo-like Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby from the 2013 movie in no way looks like a shrewd trusted associate of sleazy Meyer Wolfsheim and a prominent member of his notorious gang.<br/><br/>This inability to create a believable character seems to be caused more by the Baz Luhrmann's faulty vision than by the DiCaprio's acting, which was generally acceptable.<br/><br/>The same is true for Carey Mulligan whose simplistic, one-dimensional Daisy Buchanan seemed to be more a failed director's concept than a failed acting project.<br/><br/>While both the 1974 movie and the 2013 movie portray Daisy Buchanan as a delicate flower, in the 1974 interpretation the magnificent Mia Farrow is quick to expose these peculiar, barely hidden thorns, the dangerously poisonous thorns that quite naturally pierce poor Gatsby's heart and lead to his inevitable demise.<br/><br/>The 2013 version, on the other hand, misses the opportunity to shatter the silly romantic heroine image until it becomes too late. As the movie fails to properly introduce Daisy's dark side in a timely manner, the transition from the sweet little honey to the strikingly shallow, uncaring, selfish person, a person who ""smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into 'her' money or 'her' vast carelessness"" loses most of its punch and credibility.<br/><br/>With the main characters in the Baz Luhrmann's movie being not that impressive, the supporting cast does better overall, although not without some regrettable blunders.<br/><br/>One of the biggest disappointments was an absolute miscasting that completely ruined one of the characters, so intriguing in the novel. Amitabh Bachchan was way off target in his performance, and generally did not seem to be a good choice for the role of Meyer Wolfsheim. Whatever Mr. Bachchan was portraying in the movie hardly bore any resemblance to the notorious character who first ""fixed"" the World's Series in 1919 and then came up with that neat little idea of opening numerous drug stores that were very busy selling some useful ""prescription drugs"" during the Prohibition years.<br/><br/>Joel Edgerton, on the other hand, turned out to be a great Tom Buchanan. I have yet to find a single moment in the movie where Mr. Edgerton's refined performance was even slightly off base.<br/><br/>Another solid acting work in ""The Great Gatsby"" unexpectedly came from Tobey Maguire whose nuanced performance as Nick Carraway was a pleasant surprise indeed. By creating such memorable character Mr. Maguire proved that he is capable of something more than being a shabby Spider-Man from the primitive superhero franchise for teenagers.<br/><br/>In conclusion, despite the movie's serious flaws, I would still recommend watching ""The Great Gatsby"", mostly because of its fantastic exterior that deserves to be seen, enjoyed, and appreciated, major shortcomings above notwithstanding. <br/><br/>www.knowyourmovie.com"
"cesar-velandia","10","0","2","16 June 2013"," Great adaptation from a American classic
","The recent presentation of The Great Gatsby on the big screen, masterfully recreates an era, perhaps the last happy in the early twentieth century. Start relevance by a classic of American literature that focuses desire, strength and inspiration in a character who symbolizes the emergement of American society. <br/><br/>This literary work filmed in the 70's with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford, - written by Francis Ford Coppola-not dazzle at all in the use of film as a form of artistic representation. In the new opportunity in The Great Gatsby production, director Baz Luhrmann displays the skills and experience performed in the spectacular Moulin Rouge. <br/><br/>A careful casting molds believable characters thanks to the addition of small roles big role around the Jay Gatsby. I ask: is there in Hollywood and the rest of the world an actor that generates the magnetic field necessary to portray Jay Gatsby than Leonardo DiCaprio?. I think not. Think of the promises of today, Ryan Gossling, Ewan Macgregor, Jude Law, to name a few that may have body image but not DiCaprio's acting skills, a guy who has entered a maturity that lets you play big roles dramatic force, and expects a reward from the academies for the actor man, not the child of Titanic. Moreover, talking about the successes, the representation of the time, staged in New York City has no antecedent. The urban image, the skyline of skyscrapers springs and brightest public space in the world of that time until today, Times Square is drawn, scanned, colored by smoothing effect rendering, the newly invented neon light as the elevator and steel technology, massed and concentrated in this landmark modern urban city. <br/><br/>Speaking of mistakes do not find relevant. Beyond tastes to the means used by Luhrmann, the theatricality of the dialogue, a script that is very well done, combined with choreography and musicality reminiscent of Moulin Rouge, without falling into the musical. Luhrmann commitment exacerbate the last expense of a society, the excesses of happiness modernizing, capitalist progress and poverty of the periphery, which foresaw the punishment of slum come 1929. Also, before the construction of this frenzy, the film is intentionally literary pace and this film.<br/><br/>Storytelling, attached to a literary classic rhythms required to print a seemingly simple and everyday plot develops into a sum of complex moral situations of conflict of love. If production and the telling includes images of the letters that form words and sentences of the story on the screen, is a way, probably not the best, but the director decides to tell the story in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald on screen . Moreover, the soundtrack is spectacular, but not the film unfolds in the intensity of love is blindness in the version of Jack White. <br/><br/>Finally, returning to the hook of performance of actors led by DiCaprio, if you believe them. Gatsby believed in the hero of a generation, from one country into modernity, which built the American dream, rising and you can fall and die but never forget, that allows the construction of myth. From a man up, but that the same society will never accept, even love of your life will continue, the world will give back. ""Gatsby, who represented everything so I feel real contempt. If personality is an unbroken series of gestures made, then something magnificent Gatsby was in a heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if connected to one of these very complex machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away "". <br/><br/>From there the drama of the story set in a way, an option, he found the best way to tell it and to express it. I was convinced that Leonardo DiCaprio is great. He is the Great Gatsby."

","Don't get me wrong, I loved many elements of this movie, but I hated just about as many as well.<br/><br/>The one thing that frustrates me most about this movie is the music. There is literally maybe one song from the actually time-frame this is from in the entire film (and I'm nearly positive it was a remix). They play dubstep and hip hop over what sounds to be speakers. Now this wouldn't bother me except in the library scene at Gatsby's you can hear the bass through the walls like this music is actually playing there, not to mention it's the 1920's and there would never be bass bumping through a big ole' house anyways. This was an excuse to make money off of music artists as they seemed more interested in putting as much popular music as possible(and not even in a tasteful way), instead of keeping it even slightly realistic. They have to put some popular hip hop song in 30 second increments since the scenes they're intended for are extremely short. Short 30 second spurt of some rap song here, stops dead, change scene, a rap/dubstep song for 30 seconds, none of which ever fit the mood other than for the party scene. <br/><br/>Realism was a bit absent for a lot of this movie as no music from the era is played, the issue with the bass as stated above, and it was simply too flashy, the party scene in particular. The kind of lights and things going on are a movie watching realists nightmare. It literally is made to look like a nightclub, and its in the 20's.. And to top it all off, Gatsby' car apparently has the speed of a Ferrari and this is set in the 20's. Gatsby drives recklessly EVERYWHERE and no one seems to mind, not even the cop that pulls him over (more like just drives next to him). Gatsby and Tom also apparently felt it necessary to basically race to the hotel for whatever reason..<br/><br/>Now that that rant is done, I loved the actors chosen and how they performed. Leo was tailor-made to be Gatsby (except for them making him say old sport nearly every time he talks to someone), as was Daisy's actress. Myrtle wasn't as good as I expected having loved the actress playing her. Tom was excellent considering my former seeing him as a family man in Warrior. When it comes to how this was shot, other than the music and a lot of short scenes, it was well filmed, such elements as Dr. Eckelburg's eyes and the settings were amazing. The ending was perfect IMO to the book, and the way this was told (Nick being a drunk speaking to a therapist) was a very interesting way to do it.<br/><br/>Had it not been for the music and lack of realism this would easily get an 8 from me, but those two things just bring it down so much as they really don't fit the movie at all."
"michael@piston.net","7","0","2","15 June 2013"," Great cinematography, quaint drama
","The Great Gatsby is a feast for the eyes in its vivid and loving recreation of the 1920s New York bubble society. Unfortunately, the retelling of the Gatsby story did not work nearly as well as the cinematography if for no other reason than the central theme which drove the novel seems curiously out of date in contemporary America. Surely no present day Gatsby would've responded with violence to Tom Buchanan's suggestion that a self-made man like Gatsby could never be the equal of men who inherit their wealth. To the contrary, today, it goes without saying that a person who earned his billions is more admirable than one who inherits. Further, it is hard to picture a person as stiff as DiCaprio's Gatsby as a great confidence artist. Finally, the shrinking violet delicacy of Daisy Miller compares unfavorably by today's standards with the uninhibited sexuality of Tom Buchanan's whores. In short, this is a fabulous work of cinematography and reimagination of 1920s New York party culture. But as a drama it seems stiff and quaint."

","The general opinion about the movie is divided; there are many who believe that the movies wasn't a good adaptation of the famous F.Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the same name, & then there are many who believe that the movie on it's own was excellent. I am part of latter, for i believe that the movie, itself was excellent. The portrait of 1920's life style was adequate, the story was coherent & easy to follow, unlike the convoluted novel on which the movie was based. DiCaprio's performance was unsurprisingly brilliant, Maguire & Mulligan did a fine job as well. Sure the movie didn't have action or twists that you come to expect from modern flicks, but that hardly comes as surprise considering that the novel itself was written in 1925, when unlike today, extreme wealth & murder weren't as commonplace occurrences. The gist of the movie was the unraveling of Jay Gatsby's character; Jay Gatsby, the quintessential American male hero, the original scarface/ Self made man with a shady background. It was also about a man's struggle to get his past back.... Yet in the end the ultimate reality prevailed: 'Time & women wait for no man'.... Great Movie. Bravo Baz Luhrmann - Job Well Done!"

","The Great Gatsby is a spectacle for the eyes and hears. The scenery is creative and very loud around the actors. The music though not for made for the era does seem to fit in with the world that was created. <br/><br/>The writing for this film was very bland but that could just be because I find the overall story of Gatsby very bland. The classic lines from the novel were in the movie but they just didn't quite seem right with the world of Gatsby but the writers and director set for the audience. Overall the writing was just okay.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely to tremendous on most parties. CAREY MULLIGAN-was the weakest link of the group as she gave a very boring performance as Daisy Buchanan. ISLA FISHER-who I thought was the biggest risk of the cast as Myrtle Wilson gave a surprisingly pleasant performance. TOM EDGERTON-portrayed Tom Buchanan in a dazzling way and wouldn't be surprising if the Oscars awarded him for his performances. TOBEY MAGUIRE-as Nick Carraway, though his narrations weren't the greatest his overall performance was very nice and he may rejuvenated his career after the Spiderman disaster. LEONARDO DiCAPRIO-Jay Gatsby, he gave depth to the character that no one else before was able to give. You see all the raw emotions and the silent emotions poor out of through his eyes. In my opinion it was the best acting performance I have seen in my lifetime. He was truly incredible"
"phd_travel","7","0","2","11 June 2013"," An extravaganza - a very detailed update with some miscasting
","This is a modern re-imagining of the Great Gatsby. It works and doesn't in some ways. The most modern aspect of this movie is the over the top cgi mansions and parties with 21st century music. Gatsby's mansion was a bit hideous looking. While the scenery is quite magical in it's own way, the music was a mistake. It would have been better to use 20s music with a modern interpretation instead of the rock rap style music. <br/><br/>The screenplay takes great pains to clearly lay out the whole story very explicitly both in background of the characters and the plot events. That is one of the strong points. The dramatic Plaza scene is well done.<br/><br/>The casting consisted of some good choices and some bad choices. Carey Mulligan is much prettier here than in other movies like Wall Street 2 - she looks good in the period costumes and acts movingly vulnerable and weak enough for the role. Tobey is a boyish but quite suited. Leonardo is earnest but his face is a bit puffy. He isn't 100% convincing but it's a difficult role - none of his predecessors was perfect either - Robert Redford was wooden, Toby Stephens scowling. The main miscasting was Joel Edgerton who looked more like a thug than a blue blooded moneyed scion. He could have been Myrtle's husband instead. Doesn't look like he could have swept Daisy off her feet. Some one more preppy looking would have been better. Casting the Bollywood actor as Meyer the Jewish businessman was another distracting mistake.<br/><br/>For a more realistic version, the Mia Farrow Robert Redford movie is a ""grown up"" version compared with Baz's update. The scenery on location in Newport feels more authentic.<br/><br/>Overall it's worth a watch for the spectacle."

","The movie is colorful, fun to watch, and fun to listen to. To be a really good movie, however, the actors are not satisfying enough. DiCaprio/Gatsby looks like his face is swollen after too much tanning. Daisy misses out on the big emotions, and it's hard to understand why Gatsby is so focused on her. And Maguire/Nick is ... just there, somehow. Also, as a literary adaptation, the movie has a few shortcomings. The idealism of Gatsby, catalyzed by how Nick sees him, is one of the main themes of the book. In the movie, this idealism and optimism is mentioned often enough, but it is not put into scene in a credible manner. DiCaprio/Gatsby comes across as an odd and slightly crazy guy who is at the brink of losing control, and not as someone who, day after day, year after year, lives for the love he once owned."

",". . . and while his 2013 version of THE GREAT GATSBY falls slightly short of his magical masterpiece, MOULIN ROUGE, director Baz Luhrmann has done himself proud with this adaptation, given that he was handicapped by filming this gritty New York City story entirely in Australia! Perhaps the biggest shame is that Luhrmann did not commence filming before fellow Aussie & MOULIN ROUGE star Nicole Kidman was too ancient to play the part of ""Daisy Buchanan."" My Nineteenth Century American Novels prof proclaimed that the source material for this movie was the ""perfect"" novel, and that not one sentence or word could be changed, improved, added, or left out. When I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's book for myself, I noticed a lot of it was random lists, so if my professor even read this novel, I doubt that it was recently. Otherwise, how could he have said what he did? Similarly, there are a tidal wave of details--some no doubt CGI--in Luhmann's movie, and while a few could be changed, added, or deleted with no great consequence, the whole hangs together well, especially in comparison to the Robert Redford as Gatsby version. Though it would have been nice if Luhrmann could have gone on location to Little Girl's Point in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where Capt. Cody inspired James Gatz to change his name to Jay Gatsby, it would have made his movie as expensive as that location-centered flick, THE FALL (too bad Australia has no place as singular or beautiful as Little Girl's Harbor). Hopefully, this director can make up for that glaring shortcoming by making a 3D version of THE HOLY BIBLE."
"rebecca-ry","8","0","5","6 June 2013"," Surprisingly Faithful
","'The Great Gatsby' is the latest film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. It follows Nick Carraway as he meets a new crowd in illustrious 1920s New York City.<br/><br/>The novel is a classic in American literature and it is seen as an unfilmable book due to its subtlety. Unfortunately, this means that there is no way everyone who read the book will be happy, simply because the characters are so interesting and everyone has their own different opinion on them. The book could be portrayed as quite dull but thankfully 'dull' isn't exactly Baz Luhrmann's style; the ultra-glossy look of the film works really well in portraying the time period. The costumes are beautiful and the soundtrack is bizarre yet it somehow works. A major problem was the CGI; there were some points where it was glaringly obvious and drew you out of the story. Gatsby's house, the ocean and some parts of New York City looked really cheaply made because of this (this may not be quite as noticeable if it is seen in 3D). Another technical problem I noticed throughout was with audio synchronisation; there were lots of moments where the words you were hearing were clearly not being said by the actors, it was poorly dubbed in this case. I wouldn't have mentioned it if it had only happened a few times but there were definitely more than ten occasions where I noticed this. The decision to show this in 3D is really odd; yes, with Baz Lurhmann his direction is highly visual but when you go to see and American classic novel adapted for film, do you really want a silly gimmick distracting you?<br/><br/>This is one of the few films where there were no disappointments whatsoever in the acting. Leonardo DiCaprio portrayed Gatsby brilliantly and it is one of his best performances. It now seems obvious that he was the perfect choice for this role. Tobey Maguire also gives a great performance and managed to make me like him as an actor for a change! Carey Mulligan played Daisy well but her character was written to evoke sympathy from the audience, she wasn't as selfish and vapid as she was in the novel. Joel Edgerton was quite entertaining as Tom and really portrayed the character well. Initially, I was quite worried about Isla Fisher playing Myrtle but she did very well despite only being in the film for about five minutes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very faithful adaptation; nothing major has been left out and the majority of characters were portrayed as they were in the book. However, almost everyone has a different perception of the novel so this may not be the case for other people. If you haven't read the book, this is still a very enjoyable film with some really heart- breaking moments as well as some comical moments too."

","Since I haven't read the book before the movie (shame on me!), I had a suspense right until the very end of the movie.The movie was more than I expected:for me, it is a story how a man's dream can build palaces,and it reminds me so much of Coral Castle story that inspired Billy Idol's Sweet Sixteen. Usually a dream is greater than the life and the object of desire itself, and Daisy is Gatsby's object.However, in real life she is just a simple girl whose love shifts from Gatsby to Tom and vice verse, and she is unable to decide which one is her one and only love. I liked so much about this movie.I was afraid a little bit that I will fall asleep watching guys and gals from 30's in those suits and dresses dancing to old-fashioned music, but it was quite the opposite!There was funny intermingling of 30's music and modern rap rhymes and wild parties.Really made me feel I'd like to go to Gatsby palace and have some fun with those people. As much as I like Gatsby's character, I like Tom Buchanan's as well,although he might be considered a villain by some.It is an epic duel of two strong characters for the love of one lady, and Tom is even more picturesque a character as Gatsby is.And even though he search for ""love"" in places other than Daisy's bedroom (which he admits), he is truly in love with her,just as Gatsby is.I am still not sure whose side I am taking in this duel,even after watching the movie. Would like to write more about this, but I can tell you one thing: I did not move or spoke a single world to the person I went to the cinema with, the movie kept my attention so much.Must see,especially if you don't know what happened at the end!"

","Where does one begin to write a review for The Great Gatsby. The story line without the doubt is captivating and will save any production no matter who the director is. <br/><br/>Baz Lurhmann is without a doubt champion of modern interpretations and gets a 10/10 for his productions of Romeo and Juliet and Mullin Rouge. Gatsby however is a different matter. It is fine to use modern music in a 1920s film as long as it fits the story line and captures the mood the storyteller is trying to portray so desperately. In this case Luhrmann has definitely failed. You can not have people dancing Charleston to Beyoncé's Crazy Right Now or Jay Z's raps. You can not talk about the emptiness of the upper class of 1920's New York when the background score tells you, you are lost in somewhere in time <br/><br/>This unfortunately undermines what could have been a wonderful interpretation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic. Of course there are elements that save the film. Toby Maguire IS Nick Carraway the best thing in the film. He narrates the story perfectly and took us on a great ride of emotion and helps us navigate our way through the craziness of Lurhmann's imagery and characters. Unfortunate Daisy (Carey Mulligan) the girl the whole fuss is about is only seen for 4 forgettable scenes in this film and I cannot help to wonder where in the film ''her voice smelled of money''. Why the obsession? <br/><br/>Myrtle (Isla Fisher) Tom's Mistress is shown twice. Why do we have to feel sorry for her? How about Wilson? <br/><br/>As for Di Caprio, his performance is the usual good but nothing unexpected. The element of mystery is completely absent from his performance and the phrase 'Old Sport' comes out of his mouth with the usual childish immaturity that is in his voice when he plays Jack in Titanic. <br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of this film and the intensity of the story line however save the whole production. You will come out with wet eyes and reflect on Gatsby because of those 20 minutes. Otherwise the 3D does nothing to make the scenes memorable or the images extraordinary. The characters a part from Nick and Gatsby are not explored enough for you to sympathise or understand them and certain crucial parts feels rushed. <br/><br/>Do see it and you will enjoy the experience of it as it is an over all good film but if you are a fan of the book, the old film or love the era then you will be greatly disappointed."
"godong","6","0","4","3 June 2013"," Very nice looking, lacking substance
","First of all let me get this out of the way. The film is visually stunning, and I personally - without normally listening or enjoying this kind of music - liked the sound side of things as well. Mainly because it was a different take on this, which makes it somewhat fresh. The party scenes went on for way too long, though - even my two female companions got tired of watching the clothes.<br/><br/>What I found lacking was the narrative and the pacing. It starts off with a lot introductions, and then we simply don't learn a lot about the characters. The back story of Gatsby is simply showed in a brief (quite oddly placed, in my opinion) segment, and then you kinda forget it because it really didn't feel so significant. And all the magic surrounding Gatsby is lost instantly. Since the movie is called ""The Great Gatsby"", I'd figured there'd be some kind of mystery, and with the voice-over it'd be in the right lane for a ""film-noir"" detective feel. Nick Carraway is obviously intrigued by this whole thing, but he simply feels like a silent bystander. You also don't really get a personal feel of Gatsby - everybody's saying he's a great guy, the most amazing, honest person in the world, but in movies it should really be ""show, don't tell"". <br/><br/>All in all the first half of the film feels impersonal, and quite frictionless. The second half is a lot better. The hotel scene builds a little tension (though not much considering how substantial the disclosures are), and after Tom's lover gets run down, you actually feel like someone might lose something in this film. The tragic ending is actually great, and you actually felt (for) Gatsby. Daisy's actions are fairly hard to understand, but considering that you basically get to know nothing about her in the movie, I guess it's not really anything you can get worked up over. <br/><br/>All in all, it's not a bad movie as such. It's visually fantastic, but the plot feels elongated, and most of the people you're introduced to have no real impact on the story. Watch it if you want a visual experience, but don't expect much else."

","First half was boring until Gatsby showed up then it made a somewhat watchable movie. Is Jay-Z soo rich that he went back in time and ran the 20's too??? The music ruined it for me though. Hearing Jay-Z and Kanye West thrown in here and there made sure I couldn't be engulfed in the 20's at all. I heard Techno , Dubstep, Rap, all of which shouldn't have been in this movie. Why couldn't they use real period music? The scene with the big powerful guys in the back of the barbershop lost me too when Jay-Z's lines was used as narrative subliminal message. The scene with the black people in the car drinking Moet and listening to Jay-Z lost me too. I see them doing that now...not in the 20's"
"Mess8424","8","0","2","1 June 2013"," Very unique, but possibly overly flashy
","I will admit that I did enjoy this movie very much. My only real problem with it was the over-use of special effects. While the effects are fairly well done, they just get very old by about 10 minutes into it. Thankfully, it seems the director realized this, because the effects die down after about two-thirds in. The story seems to be fairly accurate to the book, besides some minor details. It is much more theatrical and overly dramatic than I expected, but this is not due to actor fault. Instead, it is what was intended of it. The acting is superb, in almost every case. I, unfortunately, never did read the book, and I can only assume that some of the unexplained scenes in the movie are explained in the book. Some parts of the movie left me with only ASSUMPTIONS of what is happening, which I was kind of disappointed in. Overall, it seemed well done, besides special effects overuse and some plot holes. Definitely an enjoyable experience."
"Troy_Campbell","6","0","4","1 June 2013"," Great? Nope, but still good.
","Glitz, glamour, greed, girls, guns; that's Gatsby alright. But is it great? Good would be closer to the mark, despite Baz Luhrmann's trademark zest and extravagance. The Aussie director throws everything including the kitchen sink at his retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of decadence and romance; some of it sticks, some of it distracts. With help from cinematographer Simon Duggan, Luhrmann creates a glorious rose-tinted look for his hyper- real 1920's, but alas it's hampered by the excessive and often obvious CGI, which simply isn't needed. The decision to mix modern music with a period score - which has worked for Luhrmann before - is a successful gambit and injects an extra level of fun into the proceedings, especially in the first act. The film's core strength though, is Leonardo DiCaprio's engaging portrayal of the eponymous millionaire, who is initially shrouded in mystery but slowly unravels into an all-too-human protagonist driven solely by love. In support, Carey Mulligan is exceptional as the beautiful but emotionally-damaged object of Gatsby's desires and Joel Edgerton is commanding as her philandering, pig-headed husband, however Tobey Maguire fails to impress as the innocent pawn who gets sucked into their lavish lives and struggles to keep his hands clean. Lasting nearly two and a half hours, this adaptation is at times too repetitive and self-indulgent to garner Luhrmann any new admirers, yet those who are already fans of his unapologetic over-the-top style will undoubtedly find plenty to enjoy, especially on the big screen."

","This film comes under the section of ""not sure why they made the it"". Lovely looking in 3D it is, but in a ridiculous toontown way. Indeed this would have made a more convincing animated film.<br/><br/>The Idee fixe of the green light may have supreme importance in the book, but in this film I began to think I was a mysterious alien signal. In fact it was more fascinating than most of the dialogue and storyline.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is quite good at the suggestion of something not quite right. And yet he doesn't seem to occupy the space the others are in. Toby Macguire seems more interested in the era, but insists on the wide eyed Marvel character still.<br/><br/>Ultimately there is not enough to fill 2 hours of film. The movie is set in a cartoon world that without having the purity of a cartoon. The basic story doesn't deserve the screen time, or it needs to be told by someone with something to say. <br/><br/>And yet - there is a little film called Metropolitan from decades ago that this razzmatazzfest could have learnt from. A film about another class and outsiders. I recommend you watch that instead."
"apstewart17","5","0","2","31 May 2013"," True to the book, Dicaprio is excellent but overall the potential was not met.
","This film could have been brilliant; unfortunately it only just does a few things very well and a lot of other things poorly. Now, as a massive fan of the novel I found that the story synced up very well with the source material. That made me happy. Also the always-excellent performance of Dicaprio as the title character was played with elegance, insecurity and a definite sense of loneliness (characteristics which are essential to the role) I also go on the record of saying that Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Elizabeth Debicki played their roles very well; as did Isla Fisher. Now onto my issues with the film. Number one: Tobey Maguire. Plain and simple he was a bad choice for this character. He was spineless and still managed to appear extremely pathetic every chance he got. I see Nick Carraway as a smart, grounded human being who has also been sheltered for the majority of his life. In this film he came off as a young kid who didn't know the difference from right and left. I do believe that this role could have been much for effective had some actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal, Andrew Garfield, or perhaps Joseph Gordon-Levitt had tackled the role. I am not just saying Garfield because he too was Spider- Man. It just a matter of opinion. Regardless I just did not buy his performance. My second issue was the soundtrack. Alone the music would be a great album to put on a dance to. In the context of the story, it just doesn't fit. I know the vibe of the film was shooting for a largely illustrated ideal of the time frame where glamour and alcohol were in full swing; but considering my love for the classic nature of the source material I felt it was too campy and blown out of proportion. Which Segway's into why I think this film doesn't need to ever be in 3D. An utterly pointless gimmick that needs to be put to rest. I appreciate the vibrant art style, the production design was excellent. I don't know if everyone saw it; but in the scene with Gatsby and Nick driving into town the jump cuts were awful and the audio didn't even sync up. That is unforgivable. In conclusion; I will not see this film again. I appreciate the art style to an extent, I really enjoyed the majority of the performances but I do find a lot wrong with this when it could have been so much better. Quite the let down."
"maya-822","7","0","2","31 May 2013"," Best Luhrmann's film so far
","I never really liked Baz Luhrmann's movies. Too many colors, too many gaudy details, too many objects, too many camera movements, too many shots edited too quickly. Too much of everything. Too far from the cinema I like, which is a cinema that takes its time, that shows without showing itself. Roméo+Juliette and Moulin Rouge! left me with a visual indigestion that made me want to watch nothing but Bresson's films for a while. So I have to admit I was reluctant to see Luhrmann's new film. I didn't particularly liked the 1974′s version, nor loved the novel, so I wasn't scared to be disappointed. I just thought of taking some Alka-Seltzer with me just in case I needed to neutralize the big baroque pudding I was going to be fed. So is my stupidly prejudging the film helped me like it? Maybe yes. I guess it's easier to be pleasantly surprised with a film you already hate. After the first minutes, I'm already reasonably irritated by the stupefied air of Nick's character, and even more by the very unsubtle and unnecessary tracking shots of a camera flying across the bay between West Egg and East Egg. And then something happens. I enter the Buchanans' mansion. And there, in a very bright scene, in both senses of the word, I meet Daisy, and I get in just a few shots all the illusion of her character, made of frivolity and unhappiness. Then I follow Nick and Tom in their ride into town, and, in Tom's secret apartment, I find myself in the middle of an animated David Lachapelle's photograph, and I think yes, Lurhmann is great at capturing the essence of the party. Another party scene, that time at Gatsby's, and again I'm amazed at the filmmaker's mastery of rhythm, sounds and visual effects. Lurhmann's frenzy is no longer emetic, it's orgasmic. In many ways, Luhrmann's movie is more explicit than the 1974 version, and than the novel. The frenzy, the hysteria of sights and sounds serve the tragedy because they underline the emptiness. Luhrmann's Gatsby might lose a little bit of his mystery, but he gains in vulnerabilty and in humanity. We feel close to him. DiCaprio with his juvenile looks is perfect for the part. Gatsby in his pool is Jack at the end of Titanic. We love him, we want Daisy to love him, and we want his dream to come true. Luhrmann's Gatsby is not a madman, His love is obsessionnal, he is madly in love, but he is not sick, society is. Of course, and it is intentional, Gatsby and his relationship with Daisy eclipse all the rest. Nick is merely a filter through which we see Gatsby, and his relationship with Jordan Baker is completely overlooked. The two by the way I thought more clearly sexually ambiguous than the characters of Capote's script. Luhrmann loves mannerism and anachronisms, but here, it works fine. Amy Winehouse, Lana Del Rey, André 3000, The XX, etc., surprisingly fit. I did not feel like I was watching MTV like I did for Moulin Rouge!. This new version of The Great Gatsby is an ambitious and intelligent movie. All throughout the film, Luhrmann plays with codes, with the history of cinema, with our gaze. He does get carried away sometimes, but more often he is in the right. Read more reviews on http://filmcritiks.wordpress.com/"

","It has always being considered as the 'Great American Novel', and considered unfilmable at the same time. Such is the veneration for the novel meant that there is always a great deal of responsibility to whoever is adapting it on screen, and Australian film director Baz Luhrmann's take on an American classic is the sixth attempt, since the days of the silent film era.<br/><br/>The plot is known to generations of readers who have read the novel. But it is the opening scene which may have some taken aback on how narrator Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) tried to recall the events taking place in the summer of 1922 on Long Island and New York especially on Long Island's West Egg where he and his mysterious wealthy neighbour Jay Gatsby (Leonardo diCapiro) had lived. Carraway had initially no idea whether anyone would want to read on the events which took place in that particular summer which had quite an impact on his life, but his doctor at the sanitarium where Carraway was at encouraged him to do so.<br/><br/>Thus Carraway let his writings do the talking on what happened three years before, which began with him talking about the America he knew at that time as he began his career as a bond trader in New York, his home on West Egg and living next door to Gatsby, along with the visit to the Buchanan mansion opposite the lake on East Egg where he will meet his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), cousin-in-law Tom (Joel Edgerton) whom he knew from their time at Yale and Daisy's childhood friend and golfer Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) where they will all have dinner together. Before the conversation flowed at dinner, Jordan had remarked about a party she had attended at Gatsby's mansion, leading to Daisy wondering whom her childhood friend was talking about.<br/><br/>But little did the narrator Carraway realised that the man who is his mysterious neighbour does also have a relationship with his cousin. It would only be after he had been invited to the party, and the only one being invited where everyone else just found their way to Gatsby's mansion with people of all sorts, he began to slowly unravel through the glitz and glamour of the parties his neighbour Gatsby had threw consistently on weekends after both men were reunited since both served in the same unit on the front during the war, that he began to learn of the man behind the parties, and from Gatsby's Jewish friend Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan). At the same time, learning about Gatsby's connection to his cousin Daisy with also Jordan acting as the go-between as she recounted the day when she first saw Gatsby and the tensions leading up to Daisy's wedding to Tom Buchanan.<br/><br/>That is not the only thing which had a profound impact on Carraway in that particular summer. There is also the affair between his cousin-in-law Tom and his mistress Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher), whom Tom first met at the garage ran by Myrtle's husband George (Jason Clarke) at the Valley of Ashes, and the people Tom and Myrtle know in New York whom he met including Myrtle's older sister Catherine (Adelaide Clemens).<br/><br/>Things start to go a little awry at the Gatsby mansion after Daisy and Gatsby were reunited, leading to all sorts of questions being asked in the newspapers over the origins of Gatsby's enormous wealth, which is also something Daisy's husband Tom started to get a little suspicious over apart from wondering how and when his wife first met Gatsby. The chain of events leading to the final fate of his neighbour and friend Gatsby would lead to Carraway becoming a changed man on how he look at the America he once knew.<br/><br/>Much has been debated over the fusing of hip-hop into a film which is set in the 1920s where it also known as the 'Jazz Age', but it is also bringing it to a modern audience with a contemporary relevance apart from how people in that period would interpret jazz as how Lhurmann saw it. Other than that, one would probably a sense of déjà vu over the film's plot and how it mirrors the America the narrator Carraway saw, and the constant reference to the green light as seen from the dock of the Buchanan mansion and how that fitted into the whole narrative.<br/><br/>Still, it is the spirit of the novel being reflected on screen which had stayed true for very much throughout. It is the story which still has its current relevance."
"SteveMierzejewski","7","0","3","30 May 2013"," The OK Gatsby
","If you've never read the novel, you'll have a much better chance of liking this film. That's because the film basically focuses on the Gatsby-Daisy love affair and avoids going too deeply into any philosophical/psychological areas that the novel tries to bring to light. Yes, it is a lavish production that would continue to be so even if the 3D glasses were eliminated, which they should have been. Before seeing the film, I had doubts about the sound track which included compositions by Jay Z. Oddly enough, the sound track worked and was not distracting. However, I wonder why director, Baz Luhrmann, decided to add modern music to a film obsessed with recreating the atmosphere of the 1920s. Perhaps financial reasons were behind it, or maybe he just wanted to lure in the younger audience.<br/><br/>The acting was good enough. DiCaprio played a kind of Gatsby but failed to bring out that sense of melancholy and longing that you find in most Fitzgerald characters. His Gatsby was interesting if lacking in depth. I had trouble with Carey Mulligan as Daisy. She was a little too ""girl next doorish"" to make us believe that she was Gatsby's obsession. She simply lacked the psychotic proclivities that the novel's Daisy possesses and which underpin the somewhat confusing psychological attraction between the two main characters. Nick (Tobey Maguire) was more simple-minded than in the novel.<br/><br/>But the people I saw the movie with, and who were not familiar with the novel, thought the movie was quite good. I can see their point and almost wish I hadn't read the novel a number of times.

","""The Great Gatsby"" is a novel of style and substance. This film version of the book is a triumph of the former over the latter. It's not a bad movie. It's visually stunning; it's well-acted; and the soundtrack is (perhaps unsurprisingly) very good. But the plot and the characterisation seem to play second fiddle to the director's insistence on giving greater emphasis to the costumes, to the cinematography and to an overall sense of spectacle. The result is an enjoyable but ultimately shallow film that fails to interact sufficiently with the viewer. A disappointment. Read the novel instead (if you haven't already done so). 6/10."

Leo's character and acting are superb. Toby does a nice job and their chemistry works well. The supporting cast is very good and the story itself holds its own.

","Although visually deafening and self indulgent, The Great Gatsby succeeds due to Luhrmann's bold vision, homage to the source material, and even another breathtaking performance from Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby isn't a film to be taken lightly. It's played out on a grand scale, and there is certainly never a dull moment. It's fast paced, exquisite, and an enormous production. With that said, there are going to be positives and negatives.<br/><br/>The Great Gatsby just doesn't have an off button. Luhrmann constantly throws his visionary yet overwhelming world in his viewers faces without ever considering down time. His modernization of the classic tale works in some places; I can't say the music works or doesn't because sometimes the music fits perfectly with the scene while at other times I want to watch the movie on mute. It seems as if Luhrmann wants to plan the best party in history, but only has a small house to do so.<br/><br/>On the other hand, The Great Gatsby is pure popcorn entertainment. Never once was I bored, tired, or thinking negatively. I was hooked on the story and I always wanted to know where it was going. I previously mentioned the world Baz creates is indulgent, which it is. But that doesn't prevent it from being bold and creative. Throw in one of DiCaprio's best performance and an ensemble (Tobey Maguire is immensely underrated) worth dying for, and The Great Gatsby turns out to be a film worth watching and maybe even loving. Its flaws just prevent it from being masterful."

","The first half of the movie was so annoying that both me and my wife wanted to leave. Very fast, very colorful very loud music and the plot moving very very slowly. The second half of the movie was better, and the ending justified our decision not to leave half way through. Not accurate depiction of the era, really really bad decision for the soundtrack to play modern music and not music from the time the story is supposed to take place. I really liked Moulin Rouge better, and I think the main flaw of the movie is that it cannot decide whether it is a musical or a drama. I think that younger viewers (I am 40) may like it better."

","I have seen the movie twice so far and its amazing. The whole cast has done justice to the characters they played. And Jay Gatsby, none other than Leonardo DeCaprio could have played this role better. He makes each one of his characters immortal. The way his love for Daisy is portrayed is mesmerizing. The way he looked at her is the way every girl wants to be looked at, he beautifully does this, just as written in the novel. They way he loves her, its the way every girl wants to be loved. In the initial minutes , the film keeps you itching to see Gatsby, the curiosity keeps rising every minute until he appears. And even with shady truth about his life you keep falling for Gatsby. The background score is amazing, suiting the scenes perfectly. Young and Beautiful takes your breath away. The film touches your heart and makes you wanna fall in love, and love like Gatsby. I would say watch this movie in the theatre, its worth it."

","I had all intentions of walking into a masterpiece of filmography when decided to go see this movie. I had heard it was excellent, as the score for this film was a 7.5 out of 10. I'm not sure weather or not it deserves that score. Within the first hour of this movie, I was in shock. It was horrendous. The camera did not know what angle to show, so it played them all. The actors put on voices they could not pull of. The overall narration was horrible. <br/><br/>I was determined that I would sit through the whole movie. After an hour had passed, it seemed to become sort of whimsical movie, and my partner and i were unsure if this was a romantic comedy. Nevertheless, it was indeed funny. The more the movie progressed, the more i was squirming in my seat. It held so much emotion at the end i began to feel i was actually in the movie. The actresses shined more-often than the lead males. The plot was decent, the ending was okay, although i could have wrote one better. The soundtrack was not on par with the time period. Even Dicaprio's line ""Old Chap"" seemed to be a suit far to big for him to wear. Still, the last hour of the movie began to reveal all the faults, admit its plot holes, and put me in a feeling i never wanted to escape. Most of all, the movie stayed fairly close to the book. I have to deduct points for the dreadful beginning, but the middle was decent, and the end excellent. In all essence, The Great Gatsby, both the man, and the movie, have their downfalls, but nonetheless, they both Deserve the title ""Good"" if not ""Great""."

","Although I didn't read the book, this movie was quite disappointing. Firstly, it is boring most of the time. Tobey Maguire (when older) doesn't seem like a war veteran. Doesn't even seem like a veteran either. According to the Gatsby's great love for Daisy, we could expect some gorgeous actress and representation. But we just can't see it. Carey Mulligan is a fine young lady but not a very attractive and astonishing supermodel. Finally, we can't understand how in the 1920's there are so fast and supercharged cars, semi-naked ladies partying and a DJ that combines jazz with dance and bass beats, and some other stupid situations according to the time of the action, right after the ""Bélle Epoque""."

"hedeshian","10","0","2","22 May 2013"," The critics are so wrong!!!!
","I know this is a very bold statement but, I have an honest feeling most critics are so wrong on this one. They have fallen into the trap of comparing a piece of classical art with a piece of impressionist art. Fitzgerald's book is a classic, while Baz Luhrmann's production is an IMPRESSION of the story. While impressionists miss on details, they focus on feeling, which I believe Baz Luhrmann was able to convey to most of his audience. So if your are planning to watch the movie I have some advice for you... Enjoy the interpretation. For all the critics who are saying some of the scenes are over the top exaggerations, that's like saying Van Gogh used to many brush strokes to paint his landscapes..... Now I think I am exaggerating!"
"BharatSamra","6","0","2","22 May 2013"," Nice Try Old Sport
","Baz Luhrmann commits infidelity in a treacherous betrayal to F. Scott Fitzgerald as he is lured towards a modern, more attractive mistress named Style. This affliction with unnecessary aesthetic causes The Great Gatsby to appear disloyal to the novelist's source material. While Luhrmann often returns to Fitzgerald at instances of faithfulness, too frequently he is enticed by Style, all the while leaving substance to be ""borne back ceaselessly into the past.""<br/><br/>Literary adaptations are always difficult to execute perfectly, partially due to the variety of interpretations that page readers have on a particular text, partly because not all screen viewers have even read the literature in question, and primarily since cinematic perfection cannot exist as not all would agree on it. It is even more difficult, as a reader turned viewer, to leave your novelistic perspective at home. All this considered seems an unavoidable detriment to The Great Gatsby as a motion picture. Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of the 1925 Jazz Age novel simply feels far to contrived, for a story that deals with themes of such realism. The film contradicts itself in its collision between incessant noises, artsy visuals and disloyalty, and then eventual credibility through dramatic action and characterisation. The Great Gatsby is far from being a narrative regarding the binary opposites of good and bad, though these themes manage to organically surface by themselves through the conflict that Luhrmann implements between aesthetic artificiality and genuine storytelling.<br/><br/>Thankfully, The Great Gatsby offers its least genuine, borderline unbearable act for the opening 45 minutes, though this sense of near cinematic torture continues to emerge, though less frequently, throughout the picture. It is unfortunately this opening act that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, a ringing in your ears and a stain on your retinas. It cannot be described more appropriately than deafeningly loud and unnecessarily stylised, causing absolutely nothing to feel important as your brain is just trying to process the narration, dialogue, diegetic and non-diegetic sounds that are each battling for supremacy. The desire to cover your ears is only prevented by the knowledge that you will then have to withstand the visuals alone. The film throws such a variety of information at us that we cannot appreciate or take notice of anything in particular. Gatsby's introduction feels as important as a speck of dust on Nick Carraway's tie. Furthermore, the snappy editing techniques incorporated just assist in giving The Great Gatsby a sense of delusion and vertigo, which really needs to settle down before it causes irreversible cognitive harm to its audience.<br/><br/>Like a babysitter's hopes for the misbehaving child to calm down, our wishes are answered as following an abundance of hyperactivity, The Great Gatsby becomes a more endurable, peaceful and in fact quite magnificent drama film. As our two paramours eventually acknowledge one another, the volume lessens, and the film becomes a story not an acid trip. It is only from this moment in the film when one can finally begin to enjoy and care about any character, relationship or any aspect at all for that matter. The Great Gatsby becomes and exceeds our expectations. It fulfils the literary imagery (if you have read it) placed into your mind by Fitzgerald's novel during that first reading. For those that haven't, you finally, albeit behind schedule, are introduced to these wonderfully broken souls. These lost, tragic, misunderstood souls are portrayed quite phenomenally by an exceptionally talented cast. Leonardo DiCaprio is Jay Gatsby; Carey Mulligan is Daisy Buchanan; Tobey Maguire is Nick Carraway; Joel Edgerton is Tom Buchanan; and that's not just because the credits tell us so, it is due to their ownership over their respective roles and fulfilment of our expectations of their literary description.<br/><br/>Now back to my dislikes for the film, which I only think is fair as The Great Gatsby itself negotiates between giving the audience what they came to see, and disappointing them beyond belief and so I shall negotiate between what the feature does greatly, and what it does not. This convergence of polarised characteristics within one film is most evidently seen, and heard, through the party scenes, in addition to the hugely dubious soundtrack choices. While actually outwardly suitable and creative for the promotional trailers for the film, when translated into the feature itself, the musical choices of Kanye West, Jay-Z amongst other contemporary artists are so unfitting that you feel it is repeatedly necessary to ask the musical supervisor to check if they have the right pair somewhere else. Meanwhile, the oddly choreographed party scenes are constructed for no purpose other than to appeal to a modern, young and presumably intoxicated audience. In coalition, these two elements feel more like we are in an updated version of the 1920s (the era of Fitzgerald's novel), rather than the era itself. You feel you are being thrown through Luhrmann's time machine as you enter different periods and this is not as enjoyable as you think time travel could be.<br/><br/>Like Gatsby himself, the film is introduced as a perplexing mystery, and much like the film itself, you contemplate on how much you think you know and are understanding, though I am sure this parallel was not the intention of Luhrmann. Overall, a forgivably improved second half and a more than satisfying emotional conclusion leaves Baz Luhrmann's piece, not quite at master status, but as an enjoyable yet disappointing journey to see The ( ) Gatsby, that was missing its Great."
"dragoi-catalina","8","0","2","22 May 2013"," The Great Gatsby... not SO great?
","Since I have seen both favorable and unfavorable reviews of the most expected movie of the year, I decided to write one myself showing the goods and the bads of the film - at least the way I see them.<br/><br/>1. The acting<br/><br/>What I liked: JOEL EDGERTON! His portrayal of Tom Buchanan is close to perfection. Carey Mulligan's performance was pretty good too. She managed to encapsulate Daisy's character in a very pleasant manner, despite her lousy lines (not her fault). Isla Fisher did pretty well too. The biggest surprise was new-comer Elizabeth Debicki, who did an astonishing job! <br/><br/>What I didn't like: The boys - both Leo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. None of them were awful (Tobey got really close to that, though), nor were they good. They both gave mediocre performances. Maguire just can't play sadness, anger or other negative feelings, and I didn't find his voice suitable for a narrator's. As for Leo DiCaprio, I am SICK of seeing him die (especially in water!!!). Also, the ""old sport"" was supposed to be natural, as Gatsby had been using the appellative for ages - I don't know whether it was the actor's or the script writer's fault, but many of the times it sounded forced and false. <br/><br/>2. The directing<br/><br/>What I liked: Baz Luhrmann's years in theatre are obvious when it comes to attention to detail. This movie is almost like a painting - a very beautiful one. Beautiful costumes, beautiful sets, beautiful parties and beautiful portrayal of events, all accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack which I will review in no. 3. <br/><br/>What I didn't like: While the movie is very pleasant to look at, it lacks essence. It tries to stick to the book too hard. I usually like this, and I would have liked it now too if it hadn't lost the main points of the story in the process. The Great Gatsby - the book - is about America itself. The Great Gatsby - the movie - is about nothing but a bunch of filthy rich people having fun, in a very wrong way. <br/><br/>3. The music<br/><br/>What I liked: That the score was original - and the songs were wow. Lana del Rey's Young and Beautiful, Florence and the Machine's Over the Love and The XX's Together were my personal favourite ones. The score alone is breathtaking.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: First of all, some songs - most of them, actually - had nothing to do with the scene they accompanied. The most obvious and annoying one was Kanye West and Jay Z's Who Gon Stop Me when Nick got drunk with Tom. Like, seriously, guys? We're in the 20s, for God's sake! This leads me to the second point - the score has a waaaaaaay too modern sound for 'The Roaring Twenties'. And the ones that try to sound like jazz/charleston fail their main purpose, thus the final result being rather kitsch. <br/><br/>4. The script<br/><br/>What I liked: It sticked to the book. It really did. And if reading it is pure magic, imagine seeing it brought to life. <br/><br/>What I didn't like: Just as I mentioned in the 'acting' section, they exaggerated a bit with the ""old sport"". Maybe it's just me, but if in the book it doesn't bother, hearing it so many times on screen sounds forced - big time.<br/><br/>I guess the world still hasn't got a movie adaptation worthy of the breathtaking story written by the amazing Fitzgerald - I guess it never will. To be honest, I never really expected much of this movie and that's why I can't exactly call it a disappointment. When you go to see a movie adaptation of America's greatest novel yet, you expect it to be just as great or even greater - that's downright impossible. Have all the best directors of this world (oh, Luhrmann is not one of them) together and they still won't reach everybody's expectations. I can say that the movie fulfilled - even exceeded! - mine, so I guess it did its job. But I'm still waiting for a better one :)."

"MissSimonetta","8","0","2","21 May 2013"," Not great but still pretty good
","I have come to terms with the fact that we will likely never see a perfect film adaptation of The Great Gatsby. It may not be as unfilmable as, say, The Catcher in the Rye, but it's still a difficult one to pull off. Baz Luhrmann does a good job with his reimagining of the source material, staying faithful to the letter of the novel while taking away some of its thematic depth.<br/><br/>The visuals are fantastic: it really brings the fast-paced, excessive world of the book to life. The costumes are gorgeous as well. The music did nothing for me, but then again I don't like rap or most modern music anyway, so I won't hold that against the film. The performances are mostly adequate, the only standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio as the title character and Elizabeth Debicki as the woefully underused Jordan Baker. DiCaprio is marvelous in the lead; I usually find him merely passable as an actor but here he really shines and brings a lot of passion to the role. Debicki is sexy and cold as Jordan, and it makes me so sad that she isn't given more screen time.<br/><br/>This adaptation focuses on the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy a little too much. They make TGG out to be a love story, when the main point in the book was that Daisy was a shallow woman not worth the effort Gatsby is making to obtain her heart. The many themes concerning the death of the American Dream and the moral decay of the 1920s are not elaborated upon, but I suppose that is to be expected.<br/><br/>So is this worth your time? I would say so. It's visually gorgeous and what is left of the story is still effective. And it may be controversial to say this, but this is miles ahead of the dull 1974 version."

"eonbluedan-1","8","0","2","21 May 2013"," Not a classic, but there is a classic in here
","A far better adaption than I expected of one of the most important American novels, remaining very loyal, whilst undergoing an exciting, vibrant update that only Baz Luhrmann can execute. The set design, the art, the soundtrack, used rather tastefully and in a way that brings us right into Gatsby's world, making it relevant for today, without being obtrusive; Luhrmann manages to turn it all up as loud as it will go, but it doesn't become annoying. His reverence for the source is clearly in tact and when he needs to be restrained, he shows he isn't just style with no substance. In fact, his handle on the material is so strong that he brings out the melancholy of Fitzgerald's contemplation on this time in America rather beautifully; it is only in retrospect we see how prophetic and accurate the author's tragic metaphor was. The story is apparently simple, but like the book, the themes are complex and important; this is certainly a love story, but the examination of the mythical American dream, politics, power and money, greed and excess, the emptiness of high society and the corruption that material obsession and wealth brought to a post-war America on the verge of financial ruin remain well stated and strangely relevant. The poetry of the book is not lost; it is in fact enhanced, and at the most important moments, with a cinematic eloquence that almost rivals the written word.<br/><br/>Yes, there are little things about it that don't work, there is a sense that Toby Maguire is not quite fitting, and it is a little too long, but this is a bold imagining with generally fantastic performances, notably from Joel Edgerton, who we barely recognize, and Carey Mulligan, who has the pleasure of delivering one of the most well known pieces of dialogue from the book and does so with a power that gives us goosebumps. Then, of course, the now ever dependable Leo, who nails exactly what Gatsby is on the page, and who has developed a talent for unexpected explosions to a level that few can currently reach.<br/><br/>Not a classic piece of cinema, perhaps, but certainly one in which we can recognise an American classic."

","First I have seen the adverts about a month ago. Bilboards placarded across the capital were meant to advertise Baz Luhrmans new costume drama, so I decided to go to movies as soon as the film arrives. And so I did.<br/><br/>I haven't known anything about the story itself, so I haven't got any expectations, and it was better that way. It is based on an L. Scott Fitzgerald novel, one that he became famous and worldwide known author with. And it is good. The story. I wish I could say the same about the film. It is shiny, rich in colors , and the costumes are incredibly well done – all you need for a blockbuster. But the pictures are too plastic, everything is too beautiful like you are watching a fairytale – and even though there is a drama behind, you can't take it too seriously. The director God knows why, but likes close snits, and that does not do good to anyone. It is pushing it too much to realize their feelings, to see surprise, sadness or anger on their face. Just too much. The same goes, when he want to emphasize certain things – like the spectacles on the poster, that see everything happening. He returns to them several times, and it does remind me certain cuts from Moulin Rouge. <br/><br/>I don't say it is a bad movie, it is an OK one, that is nice to see after a long day. You don't have to think about it too much, and it pleases your senses."

","First, regarding the plot--fans of the book will be able to point out a few inconsistencies, but I think the movie actually helped me understand the book better. It isn't in perfect alignment with the book, but the way Luhrmann chose to portray the characters and the scenes effectively brings the conflict between hope and disillusionment into focus. The cinematography was stunning--this movie is worth seeing just for the glittering opulence that is a Gatsby party. Some may point out the fake quality of the scenes, but isn't that the point? And then there's the music. Jay-Z is absolutely brilliant, and even though the soundtrack heavily features rap in the Jazz Age, it fits perfectly. Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" is just, well, beautiful. So go get your flapper dresses and a group of friends, because The Great Gatsby is a must-watch.

Just when you're about to shriek, Enough! the mysterious Gatsby is introduced. Thereafter, the movie transcends the spectacular and becomes the beautiful love story full of idealism, naiveté, hope and despair that F. Scott Fitzgerald created as literature.

","I have long wondered why DiCaprio has not yet received an Academy Award. I continue to do so. The first performance in which he probably should have won was Gilbert Grape. After seeing his performance I am awed by his range. In Great Gatsby he could show confidence, despair, and vulnerability whenever called for. Few actors have the depth of range that DiCaprio possesses. There have been many who have received the Academy Award that he can act circles around. He became Gatsby the poor boy who dreamed of making it big and reclaiming his lost love.<br/><br/>The cinematography was wonderful. The acting by Toby Maguire and Joel Edgerton was spot on.<br/><br/>Mulligan is a fine actress, BUT she fell short in this role. This is going to sound ugly, but they never should have dress her in the low-cut dress revealing she has more moles than Carter has pills. That was a total turn off when she was suppose to look seductive and appealing. In most of the rest of the shoot they managed to hide her little weakness. She came close but fell just short of the mark in making me believe that she could totally bewitch someone like J. Gatsby.<br/><br/>The music also did not match what one would expect for the movie. I suppose that the movie was trying to relate to present day youth, but it was wrong for the movie. I appreciate J.Z.'s attempt, but I didn't think it worked."

So to expect more from a production is, if I've to quote the movie, 'asking too much'. <br/><br/>My only criticisms are the ending and CGI's of the movie. CGI'S are too obvious that they are not real, we don't believe them to be real for a second.

While the Baz Luhrmann does stay faithful to the words on the page, the overall tone and feel of the picture seems to be in the wrong place. When the truth about the book is about the falseness of these rich people and their empty lives while using the pedestal of a love story to get through it, Luhrmann seems more interested, or maybe the studio was, at making the love story front and centre, almost ignoring the more interesting aspects of the tale. What is left is an hollow film, that is fancy for the eyes and not much more.<br/><br/>I chose to see the in 2D and judging by what I saw, I don't think I would have missed the confetti and floating typewriter words coming at me very much. Luhrmann's films always look like the prettiest girl at the ball. Gatsby is probably the prettiest of them all and with good reason too. Those parties Gatsby throws is wonderful, full of energy, vibrant colours and dance numbers. It's at one of these parties that we are introduced to Gatsby, in one of the most over the top and perfect character introductions I've seen on film. DiCaprio captures the essence of Gatsby, a lonely insecure man who hides behind his riches and puts on this mysterious front. He looks the part, acts the part and is one of the highlights of the picture. No one else seems to be on the same page as him though. <br/><br/>Joel Edgerton is Tom Buchanan, a brutish fellow who is having an affair. Edgerton chomps on his cigars, kisses his woman and loves to poke the fire when it is hot. His wife, Daisy, played by the timid as a mouse Carey Mulligan is the picturesque woman that Gatsby is pining for. She doesn't seem to have a real identity. She is torn between two men, but nothing else of her character wants to come though. Her cousin, Nick Carraway is played by Peter Parker himself, Tobey Maguire. Much like the book, he is give nothing to do but walk around in the background with a drink in his hand. Maguire takes this thankless role and adds no flare, no emotion, no sense of tragedy to it. Aside from Pleasantville, I've yet to see a good Tobey Maguire performance. <br/><br/>The story is a tragic one and even if Luhrmann didn't want to focus on the rich and famous and just centre on this love story, he should have added more stakes into it. Character with little to no screen time early on in the film, play major roles later on. It's an odd balance, made even odder by the Luhrmann flare he puts in it. The film feels like Moulin Rouge, with the over exaggerated expressions and acting from the background characters. The choice of modern music in an old time era, Luhrmann even uses the same plot device with a man telling the story at a typewriter. <br/><br/>But like I said, the film look gorgeous, sounds great and is very eccentric, much like the characters that inhabit this story. This is probably the closest adaptation of The Great Gatsby we'll get, even if it didn't get it right."

","The production is simply amazing, it fascinates you with the rich themes and the charm of the characters and leaves you wondering. I completely snapped out of reality, the scenes took me to a dream. The fashion costumers where perfect and the music was a jazzed up fusion of the modern pop & rap songs. Loved the fact that the scenes were very colorful and the different angles each seen was shot from. If I had to watch it again, I would only go for the first half as it's all dreamy, mysterious and funny, yet the second half, tragedy and drama comes in with a sad ending, which changed my reaction to the movie. Also, it was very long, would've enjoyed it more if it was shorter than 2 hrs & 30 minutes."

","i was not able to be really into this movie. there were some great moments that almost got me into it, somehow (mainly director's fault, in my opinion) the magic was lost after 1 or 2 sec. It's like talking to someone you really like on the phone but the reception is bad and it keep breaking up and spoil the whole conversation. Of course Leonardo DiCaprio was charming with his blue-eyes and naturally born star charisma in this film. Tobey Maguire too had this eye-catching glamor in the movies like always. Daisy Buchanan was such an important role in the story but i didn't think Carey Mulligan was correctly picked for this role. I felt this movie kinda ruin the original novel though i didn't read the novel. I just want to see a movie that makes me forget where i am and makes me feel i'm one of the character in the story."

","The first thing I'll make clear is that I adore the story of the Great Gatsby. I was entranced by F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel when I first read it in high school, and have kept a copy ever since. When I saw that a modern movie was to be remade, I got excited. When I heard that the enigmatic Mr. Gatsby was to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio, my imagination leaped. DiCaprio has proved himself to be a competent actor to me with films like Inception, Shutter Island and the more recent Django Unchained. However, when I read that Baz Luhrmann was slated to direct, my doubts started to creep in. Although I admire Baz's colorful style and creativity, upon first viewing it occurred to me that his eye-popping circus choreographic chaos technique of directing wasn't appreciated for this film. The Great Gatsby is a story of human emotional suffering, which is a subject that deserves long, somber shots that stare into the actors' eyes, and Luhrmann's attention-deficit-disorder approach to directing didn't capture it too well. Especially in the first half of the film, his constant jump-cutting combined with his own and Pierce's script did not work for me. It's such a shame, because the second half of the film progressively worked for me. By the time the film finally slowed down to necessary pace, it was over. The actors in this film are a delight, but two stood out specifically to me. Leo DiCaprio did a wonderful job as the enigmatic Gatsby. Even in spite of the directing, Leo did his best to stretch the emotion of his character to its maximum. The other actor, to my surprise, that I found genuinely enchanting was Joel Edgerton. Considering the only other film I know him from was The Odd Life of Timothy Green, Edgerton here is a teeth-gritting presence, a man who perfectly reflects the character in the book. He reads his lines here with such conceitedness, such arrogant confidence that this character would have, and I truly enjoyed it. I'd hope he gets consideration for Best Supporting Actor. Overall I'd recommend going to see it because the story itself is fairly represented in the film, and it isn't your typical 2010's superhero movie, thank God for that."

This is one movie that is not only a ""grand spectacle"", yet also a deeply sensitive Ode to the Classic novel that is relevant for us to ponder....Now, what is our ""green light?""<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that Our Critics have always hated on this Director, Baz Luhrmann for no reason, despite his epic works. ( i.e Romeo/Juliet, Moulin Rouge, Australia, etc.) Perhaps, it is because he is from Australia that US Critics are SOO mean (can't figure it out.) It is sheer insanity. <br/><br/>This is what a Genius looks like in a Director-Baz Lurmann doing ""The Great Gatsby.""<br/><br/>His movie that is not only a ""grand spectacle"", yet also a deeply sensitive Ode to the Classic novel that is relevant for us to ponder right in the Now;<br/><br/>Today.... this film poses one BIG question for us ALL---what is our ""green light.""<br/><br/>On those grounds alone, don't listen to the Critics, run, don't walk to see ""Gatsby."" Have they really seen the same Film? This movie has set the bar for the sophisticated, open minded adult film-goer to new heights, as far as gorgeous Movies to savor...<br/><br/>I admit, it was many years ago that I read his book for the first time. I had to refresh myself of the tragedy and fatal flaws of each character in F. Scott Fitzgerald's book. I was blown away by how close this movie followed the emotional truth of each character and yet had the audacity to blow them out further. That took guts for the filmmaker, BIG, BOLD and VERY BRAVE guts, Baz....<br/><br/>I say tonight something that is almost NEVER said out loud. This movie was better than the book. Yes, I said it here! While I have a powerful imagination, I liked the insane, brave and heartbreaking places that this often loud film dares to take us in our seats...all while leaving us to ponder our own ""green light"" ....in silence."
"f_n87","8","0","4","11 May 2013"," a larger than life spectacle brought down by the horribly miscast Mulligan
","To avoid dwelling on the negatives, there's many things that this adaptation gets right:<br/><br/>1) The colorful, self-indulgent grandeur of the sets captures the rich, heady and claustrophobic world that Fitzgerald created in his book to perfection. The noise , the migraine inducing lighting, the bizarre contrast of an old era against modern music, all of these all serve their purpose well. They overwhelm us and this pulls us into the shallow but beautiful escapism of the hedonistic post-war years<br/><br/>2) Performance wise, I actually thought Tobey Maguire fit the character of Nick really well. His glazed, childish almost foolishly lost look which could grate your nerves in other movies works well for this character. He looks truly lost in this world and you believe that he would be the lamb to the wolf like world around him.<br/><br/>Leonardo IS Gatsby! I'm an ardent fan of the original book and a literary enthusiast in general; very rarely am I satisfied with how a novel character translates to screen but Leo plays him with a perfect amount of passion, distilled intensity and bottled rage at a world he can't fit into nor escape. Through his eyes and disturbed body language you truly feel Gatsby's alienation and helplessness in Daisy's love. The sense of maddening happiness tinged with an inevitable unhappy ending is hard to convey with facial expression, but Leo manages it to a tee. A treat to watch! <br/><br/>The rest of the actors, such as Tom and Jordan and Myrtle are all equally apt, though they don't have as much scope as the leads to perform . <br/><br/>Now to the biggest flaw in the film: Carey Mulligan's Daisy made me want to pull my hair out I'm frustration! Now by no means was Daisy an especially likable character in the book; indeed she was largely a symbol of the shallow and self serving glitter glamour of that era, where love could be discarded as easily as cheap perfume if it became inconvenient. Nevertheless, you can still sympathize with Daisy's confusion if not her actions. Mulligan does not convey the subtleties of Daisy's character at all. Her Daisy is childish, self-conscious and at best she looks vaguely interested in Gatsby. The sense that Daisy was in many ways a victim of this hedonistic world is entirely lost in Mulligans conception. She elicits little sympathy, her romantic dialogue delivery lacks even a fraction of the passion of Gatsby...and it truly ruins the whole equation because she does not seem to be a viable object of such an intense passion. Its like a little girl was given old time costumes and got lost in figuring out what or who her character is. Mulligan is not horrible but just as Leo makes Gatsby come alive, Mulligan makes Daisy even more repugnant than she was in the original story. Even Amitabh Bacchan in a minute cameo as Meyer Wolfsheim makes more impact than her. A sad factor in a movie that otherwise was a truly sincere effort at bringing Fitzgerald's work to fruition."

","In the Roaring Twenties, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a Yale graduate and a Midwesterner, decides to move to New York City and learn the bond business. Not being a man of enormous means, despite springing from a fine family, he considers himself lucky to rent a cottage on the West Egg of Long Island. His second cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her extremely wealthy husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton) live across the bay on the more fashionable East Egg. Almost at once, Nick discovers that in the gargantuan mansion that is next door to his little abode, is a mysterious gentleman, Mr. Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). In fact, Nick hears the enormous summer parties from his windows before he actually meets the man himself. When Mr. Carroway has lunch with the Buchanans, a fellow meal guest, Jordan Baker, is intrigued by Nick's residence and tells him she went to one of Mr. Gatsby's parties. Daisy, oddly, perks up her ears at the name as well. But, before Nick receives his invitation to the next affair, other happenings occur. It is revealed that Tom has a mistress in the Land of Ashes, an industrial area that separates the Eggs from Manhattan. Her name is Myrtle Wilson(Isla Fisher) and she steals away one afternoon to party with Tom, Nick and assorted others in the cheap apartment Tom rents for her downtown. Garage owner Mr. Wilson, the husband, is too trusting and work weary to figure out the schemes. But, back on WE, Nick accepts his neighbor's hospitality and is floored by the party's opulence, both in scale and entertainment. The bondsman turns around and runs smack into Gatsby. They hit it off, with the tycoon revealing some of his background to Nick. All is for a purpose is Gatsby's mind, for he once knew Daisy, as a former suitor, and he wants Nick to invite his cousin to ""tea"" so they can meet again. In Gatsby's heart, the romance has never died but the war and Jay's former poverty came between them. Nick agrees to the rendez-vous. Once the former lovers meet, however, they ignite a chain of events that end in tragedy. Beyond that, just what is the secret behind Mr. Gatsby's enormous moneybags? Most folks who read this review will probably know the book and will have sought out other takes on Baz Luhrman's new film. This critic believes it to be a fine film and an innovative production but, alas, not without a flaw. More of that soon. First, the production itself is so bursting with style, gorgeous art direction, vibrant music, and glittering costumes that it is a pleasure to behold. Second, the cast is terrific, with DiCaptrio fulfilling the title character with a wonderful performance. Mulligan, Maguire, Fisher, Edgerton, and all of the others offer great support. Then, too, the script is most faithful to the original work, with once major exception, but it spouts Fitzgerald's own words most of the time, a big asset for purists. Especially true are F. Scott's subtle depiction of wealth, family heritage, and the dreams of those who, lacking both, want to get there. The only flaw, my view, is that the plentiful energy of the first half vanishes in the second, as the pace gets slower and slower. As a result, the film runs a bit too long and lacks the finishing impact it should have. Nevertheless, this spanking new interpretation of the ""Great American Novel"" has riches to behold and enjoy."

This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.<br/><br/>But one hundred years later, we must face the tragic fact that the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an appalling condition.<br/><br/>In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

","""The most hopeful man I ever knew."" Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire)<br/><br/>I refuse to enter into the fray about the comparison between F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and any film adaptation. Both are different ways of telling the story and should be discussed on their own merits. Baz Luhrmann's film version, The Great Gatsby, is sumptuous, just as you would expect from the visionary director of the eccentric Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet, and it successfully translates the great disparity between hope and despair, the have's and have not's, memory and reality, love and longing, and the American dream. <br/><br/>Luhrmann's personal evocation of the roaring 1922 twenties is art deco and sin ramped up to full speed. The mise en scene is loaded with careening cameras, wild colors, flappers, jazz performers, and luscious automobiles. Luhrmann wildly imagines that time between the Great War and the Great Depression when no apparent consideration arose about the poor or the danger of Stock Market catastrophe. The shots are beautiful while the people often foolish.<br/><br/>The greatest fool is Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), newly rich yet old in love, longing for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), yet her old money will not let him have her, notwithstanding she's married anyway. DiCaprio plays him like he's a movie star (come think of it, Leo is Gatsby in a movie star life), distant and dreamy with tons of money and no one to give it to but revelers who give nothing back. DiCaprio seems instinctively to know the seductions of wealth and fame, and the dark pit of loneliness that accompanies the futile grab for the one thing he can't buy.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan's Daisy makes little impression except for her memorable smile, or at least the actress doesn't show why her character is worth Gatsby's sacrifice. However, that may have been the purpose with her thin characterization all along: She embodies the carelessness of the rich, barely able to sacrifice for love, unattached to anything but things.<br/><br/>Luhrmann's choice for Nick's framing the story from the sanitarium compromises his credibility for narrating the story. Although Maguire brings the right wide-eyed naiveté to the role, he doesn't have the weariness of Joseph Cotten's institutionalized narrator, Jed Leland, in Citizen Kane. By the way, that film has a lost dreamer as its protagonist as well.<br/><br/>Although Nick knows you can't remake the past, Gatsby keeps hoping to return to it with Daisy. The film gives that melancholy theme its due, and Fitzgerald can be heard and felt at the end:<br/><br/>""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" Nick"

","It is a very good movie and does as good a job as possible at adapting a movie to a great novel like ""Gatsby"". Most ""professional"" reviews have it all wrong. As some other positive reviews point out very well, the people making these bad reviews must not understand the novel. The ""over the top"" and ""excess"" criticism -- the most prevalent in the bad reviews -- completely miss the point that the novel is in part about the excess and over the top nature of the Roaring Twenties. The music is appropriate I think and done well. Is it worth your time and money (the bottom line)? Absolutely. Remember you are seeing these characters through the observer in both the book and the movie, not through the eyes of the characters themselves. Remember it is not just a love story, it is also a commentary on the American Dream (the Green Light is the symbol for that dream, btw) and the Jazz Age written in the middle of it. They take one literary departure. They turn Nick Carraway (get it -- ""care-away"") into a writer looking back from the Great Depression. This allows them to use the words of the novel more than most movie adaptations and also describes after the fact something that Fitzgerald was able to see in real time (a very rare talent). The bad thing to me was I don't understand how their hats were supposed to stay on while racing across the Queensboro Bridge, and I think the ending would have been better if had stayed exactly like it was in the book. But then I guess they had to condense some of that for time reasons. The best thing about the movie? The ending paragraph of the book -- perhaps the best single description of The American Dream in literature -- is also the end of the movie, and they throw it up on the screen in a way that is cool in 3D. A little trivia - that paragraph is also on Fitzgerald's grave stone in Maryland. So go see it."

","Now, I've just returned from a screening of the film in all of it's Real-D glory and I return home, writing on my computer with mixed feelings. Why? Perhaps is because as much as I love this book and I love DiCaprio, I just can't bring myself to love this film. Its greatest pitfall has to be the set design. I can't bring myself to love a movie where every scene that doesn't occur in some tiny room, is so blatantly CGI'ed. I found it difficult to grasp the glamor of the homes of Gatsby and the Buchanans for the pure fact that it was so fake that I didn't care. You can't try to impress me with a home I know isn't real.<br/><br/>Granted, I knew ahead of time that this film would be completely exaggerated in every way, the same way that our loving director gave us a shocking adaptation of R+J. The wardrobe and make up were done brilliantly and the first thing I thought about when the movie ended was ""Damn, if only I had a nice suit like that..."". The reason why I say this is because our loving Nick Carraway has been destroyed by Toby McGuire. It's no secret that Toby and Leo are good friends and it's likely the reason he got the role as Nick because he was the worst actor in this film. His robotic voice as a narrator doesn't draw you in and it bores you because Toby has ripped apart everything that makes Nick who he is which is another problem on its own.<br/><br/>Our beloved, despised, and alluring set of characters are whittled down to nothing more than people who just happen to be around Gatsby. Everything takes a back-burner to Gatsby crisis, including the detailed life of the protagonist! Nearly EVERYTHING that provides character development for Nick is removed from the film and essentially for every character as well. I know I'm jaded because I despise the modern age of Hollywood and its over-simplicity of everything just to make a quick buck, but seriously? Did you have to destroy the real issues of this book and make it into a romance? Where the issues that Fitzgerald wanted to bring to attention are nearly ignored? Shame on you!<br/><br/>The Soundtrack.....it's been over-hyped as expected and nothing is really special about it. I expected there to at least be some sort of Jazz in the film, but in the end, if you ignore the brilliant submissions by Florence and Lana Del Rey, you have a TERRIBLE soundtrack that doesn't fit with the plot. By the end of it, I hated when the bands would come out and pretend to play music for some crappy electronic beat that magically played...There aren't any speakers, nor are there turntables or special effects so where the heck is this thumping bass coming from? At first, I thought it was non-diegetic sound to entertain the viewer, but during a scene I quickly realized that it's diegetic and it can be heard muffled in the background.<br/><br/>But in the end, Gatsby, Tom, Jordan, Daisy all were supported with good acting and they managed to make this an enjoyable experience for me. A classic to be? Not at all. Worth the money to watch? Yes! It'll entertain you and amaze you with the rich cinematography. The use of colors is phenomenal and well done, just try to get past that awful narration!"
