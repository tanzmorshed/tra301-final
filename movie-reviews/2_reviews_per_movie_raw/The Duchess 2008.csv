"milofromtheblock","7","155","197","5 September 2008"," Compelling and Layered Costume Drama
","The Duchess is a superior slice of costume drama which manages to craft interesting, multi dimensional characters and an involving storyline from the well worn confines of the genre.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays a very similar role to the one she played in Pride and Prejudice, a feisty, modern woman trapped in a male dominated society. However, whereas Lizzie Bennett's heart and character inspires affection, the Duchess of Devonshire's fosters only reproach and punishment from her traditional and patriarchal husband. Her performance is a standout and demonstrates why she is so highly rated in the face of many disappointing roles in other films. She brings both strength and weakness to the character. Able to deliver withering put downs at her husband and others, whilst showing the pain of her loveless marriage etched into her face.<br/><br/>If Knightley is the lynchpin of the piece then it is Ralph Fiennes that elevates it above a crowded genre. Resisting the temptation to play his character as evil, instead he simply plays him as a man of his times. In Fiennes' hands the Duke feels no need to win any bouts of verbal jousting with his wife as he is secure in the knowledge that, as a husband, he is in complete control of the relationship. The Duke also clearly sees very little wrong in his treatment of his wife and acts, as he sees it, in a logic manner making the whole film feel more believable and, as a result, tragic.<br/><br/>In terms of the cast the only misstep is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who lends the wide eyes of a political dreamer but doesn't have convincing chemistry with Knightley and plays one of the more one dimensional characters in the piece. However Hayley Atwell impresses by playing her character so well it is possible to describe her as scheming, and manipulative as well as sympathetic and loyal without it seeming a contradiction.<br/><br/>The film is deliberately paced so as to give characters and events time to breathe, encouraging the mood that the marriage is a car crash in slow motion, inextricably drawing all the characters further into the muddled mess of their relationships. Overall it's a fully recommended slice of real life costume drama that draws a multi layered drama full of compellingly deep characters from what could easily have been a one note story."

","After reading copious amounts of mediocre reviews for ""The duchess"", I wasn't expecting much from this film. However, from the first scene I was utterly absorbed.<br/><br/>The film isn't ""just another period drama"", it is an absolutely beautiful and heart-rendering tale of the tribulations faced by Georgian woman. Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who although is the key character in the film (as you can probably infer from the title), represents the situation of all woman belonging to a patriarchal society, not just the aristocracy.<br/><br/>Keira knightly is exemplary in this role. Her facial expression tells more than a script ever could. I enjoyed her performance in ""atonement"" but this was in a whole new league. Ralph Fiennes was also excellent. My best advice is to ignore the critics and come to your own conclusion. My only negative criticism was the rapidity with which Georgiana bonded so intimately with Bess. However, I don't know enough about the social context of the time to really make a judgement.<br/><br/>All in all, a deeply moving tale that shouldn't be neglected."
"joestank15","8","30","39","1 January 2009"," Good story. Interesting and mostly believable in presentation.
","The Duchess - Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgiana's passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley again does a period piece and again looks mostly out of place. She's British alright, but a few stone away from looking like she belongs in 1770's Britain. It's augmented by the fact that her character, based on a real woman, was supposed to have gone through about 6 pregnancies, 4 of them successful. Knightley's emaciated form is just wrong. What is right though, is her performance. As a mother, as a chasismatic political presence and a woman desperate for a happy life she nails it absolutely.<br/><br/>I could have seen a little less focus on the love triangle and a little more on the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of this woman becoming such an important and popular cultural icon in British society. The film glosses over how this came to be, and asks us to take it as a fact after one brief scene showing the Duchess's political shrewdness. It's another case of Hollywood ignoring what's different about a film, preferring the safety of delivering what people have seen before.<br/><br/>Fiennes gives such a quiet performance right from the start but it grows and fills the area. It's often a mesmerizing performance because of his rigid adherence to societies expectations and rules at the cost of all else. Fiennes occupies the screen whenever he's in a scene. When he and the Duchess argue, she's like water smashing up against the unyielding cliff. Ralph Fiennes is aw-inspiringly scary in one scene without seeming in anyway over the top or demonizing of what his character represents. Ultimately his character is human and believable; purely a man of his times. His character is so down to earth and in the end simple. All he wanted from his marriage was a son and to be left alone to play with his dogs.<br/><br/>A mesmerizing turn from Fiennes in a likable, if familiar film, The Duchess gets a B+"
"blackburnj-1","8","125","182","13 September 2008"," An entertaining film which promises much for the future
","The career of Keira Knightley has been somewhat of a mixed bag. She has had strong moments, invariably under the direction of Joe Wright, and she has had her less brilliant moments, mainly in the later ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. But, in ""The Duchess"", an entertaining and moving portrait of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, she truly shows signs that she is coming of age with a performance of subtlety and nuance.<br/><br/>The film has been marketed with not so subtle emphases on Georgiana's relative, Diana, Princess of Wales. The tagline for the film, ""There were three people in her marriage"", is not only, by my count, a miscalculation (a serious miscalculation if you count the dogs) but also guilty of creating a subtext which simply isn't in the film. Anybody looking for a film about Diana will be disappointed. Anyone looking for an entertaining film won't be.<br/><br/>The film is a moving portrait of a very tragic figure, brought to life by a career best performance from Keira Knightely. Her abilities have grown over recent years, with ""Atonement"" being her previous best, but here she shows great potential. She is ably supported by Ralph Fiennes, who is on fine form. His performance never descends into caricature or cartoonish villainy, but maintains a sense of humanity, no matter how selfish it is, underneath his characters various inexcusable actions. There is also a fine performance from Charlotte Rampling, though there is a weak link in the person of Dominic Cooper, who is too young for his part and struggles with it.<br/><br/>The witty and emotive script has a lot to recommend it and its characters are put into an engrossing and lavish world, successfully created by the director Saul Dibb. Extraordinary costumes fill the extraordinary locations, and there is a beautiful score by Rachael Portman to accompany it. The result is a fairly stylish affair.<br/><br/>The film's exploration of unfortunate innocence and the loss of freedom is at times poignant and adds to what is an extremely satisfying experience at the cinema and provides a great deal of promise for the future from its director and its star."
"geoffgee","9","74","110","11 September 2008"," A good story beautifully filmed and with fine performances - especially from Keira Knightly.
","I came away from the cinema after seeing The Duchess feeling I had had my consciousness of what life must have been like for the aristocracy of 18th century England dramatically raised (both literally and metaphorically). The story of Georgiana's marriage unfolds by subtle degrees amidst the most sumptuous of interiors and landscaped gardens - all beautifully filmed and realistically recreated. Apart from the main characters, there appear a rich selection of characters from neighbouring strata of society - aristocrats, political activists, servants and children (as babies and older) both legitimate and illegitimate - all of whom contribute to weaving the screenplay into an immensely fascinating narrative. I was already a fan of both Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes before seeing The Duchess, so I was pleased to find that their performances were well up to - and in the case of Ms Knightly even surpassing - my expectations. Even those who aren't normally 'into' period dramas (like me) should, I feel sure, find much to appreciate in this excellent film."

","What rather wonderful about this story is that Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightley) discovers a way to exult in victory over things and to get back some kind of power in a time where, really, women had very little Being someone of great vitality and liveliness, she was very much a dreamer and an idealist, a woman who loved being the center of attention, who loved the fact at some point that her picture was in the paper, that the clothes were always talked of, that her every move was commented on <br/><br/>We are immediately impressed by her presence, by her personality She wasn't behaving quite in accordance with the way in which other 18th century women were expected to behave <br/><br/>But there was something incredibly sad about this self-conscious lady She was a victim of herself A victim of her own innocence A victim of people using her for their own profit Even though she seemed to have everything, we realize that it was not that simple And with all of her privilege came a lot of moral obligation and things were never what they really appeared to be <br/><br/>The Duke (Ralph Fiennes) was a misanthropic man, rather cold, unemotional and quite cruel He seems to like better his hunting dogs to his young wife Of course with certain values, that he believes were absolutely right and that he strictly held to <br/><br/>This sumptuous period piece also presents the Duchess of Devonshire as a political hostess Saul Dibb's film shows us her dinner parties, her evening events, her fame and its extraordinary effect on her It made her both desperate to please, terrified of doing anything wrong and shocked at her own celebrity and unable to figure out in her own mind why she was quite so famous And we see the crippling effect it has on her sense of self"
"Rave-Reviewer","7","40","61","8 October 2008"," More fun in corsets
","The latest slice of period drama to grace our screens is this biopic on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who during the 1770s was patroness of the Whig party and prisoner of a marriage which made her, among other things, suffer the indignity of having her husband's mistress living under the same roof. These heritage dramas are an industry all by themselves; the armies of prop hirers, wig and costume makers, researchers, production designers, location scouts and (mostly) British actors who go to make them must find themselves in almost permanent employ. The BBC does them, the Americans have a go at them, and the public can't seem to get enough of them. The Duchess is a superior example of the genre, though nowhere in the league of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, and combines the spectacle of Keira Knightley looking glamorous in a range of frocks and wigs, while at the same time honing her acting talents (no more those rictus grins), with the guilty pleasure of following the uncomfortable parallels between the fortunes and indiscretions of the ancestress of Lady Diana Spencer with those of the Princess of Wales herself. Lowering over the whole proceedings is the truly superb presence of Ralph Fiennes's Duke of Devonshire, Fiennes an actor who can convey polite discomfiture or threatening ire with slightest twitch of the mouth. In his hands the Duke becomes far less a melodramatic villain than a product of his time, and you almost feel sorry for him. Go and see The Duchess; only those who have had children will balk at the liberties taken with childbirth and breastfeeding. But not even that will spoil the fun."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","31","46","12 November 2008"," A great period piece, Kiera pulls in a fantastic performance
","I couldn't wait for The Duchess, I am just a huge fan of period pieces and Kiera Knightly is becoming a fantastic actress in this genre. I was looking forward to this film mainly because I studied Georgina a little bit in college for my history class and I always thought she was such an elegant and strong woman that stood out from the others. She was like the Madonna of her day, she had a great sense of style, self, and strength. While the movie is not completely accurate, it still was a fine movie to watch. Kiera truly held her own as Georgina and was absolutely stunning. One of the underlining stories that I appreciate in this film is the battle of the sexes. Ralph Fiennes who plays the Duke of Devonshire does a fantastic job as well and he plays this anti-villain, shows the true side of the pain and pressure men felt but how they looked at women as nothing but property. This story truly touches you and makes you grateful for our present day.<br/><br/>Georgina is born into a high class family of royalty who is about to be married off to the Duke of Devonshire and everything seems great, G is going to live the high life of class, culture, and being a lady of the people. She comes across the price though: her husband's affairs that are practically rubbed in her face, her life is constantly watched and judged by people, she must be perfect at all times to keep up her reputation as a joyful lady, she is forced to be the mother of the duke's child from an affair he had, as well as she cannot birth a son for the Duke and he will find every opportunity to rub it in her face. All this and Georgina has found another love who she cannot give her heart to fully for the love of her children and people.<br/><br/>The Duchess is a fine film that I truly enjoyed. I wouldn't be surprised if Kiera was nominated for best actress during the academy season. I would highly recommend this movie, especially for the period piece lovers. Like I said, this film makes you appreciate what we have today in our modern society and truly makes you feel for the pressures both men and women had to face in that day. Georgina is a figure that I think is very looked over in history when she is one of the strongest presences in England's history. The Duchess, even though not entirely accurate, does a very good job of telling her story and was a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>8/10"

The Duchess of Devonshire is the perfect character for her to play, and it's obvious Keira immersed herself in the role, and completely understood every single motivation of her character.<br/><br/>I recommend everyone to go and see this film!"

","When Quentin Tarantino presented Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, he famously stated that Merchant-Ivory productions were a major turn-off for him, much like on-screen violence could be for someone else. No one else seems to agree with him, though, or at least not openly, since lots of British directors are trying to become the next James Ivory (the real one lost his mojo with The White Countess, which also marked his last collaboration with the late producer Ismail Merchant). And while Joe Wright hit the jackpot with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, his colleague Saul Dibb doesn't fare as well with The Duchess, an elegant but frigid costume drama which fails to be particularly dramatic.<br/><br/>To secure some kudos, Dibb cast Wright's go-to leading lady Keira Knightley as the film's heroine, Georgiana Spencer, whose life changes radically when the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) asks for her hand in marriage. The quality of her lifestyle improves significantly, and all she has to do, as she's frequently reminded by her mother (Charlotte Rampling), is to be a good wife. Unfortunately, that task proves more difficult than expected, since the Duke insists on having a male heir and Georgiana keeps giving birth to boys. All that's left for the poor man is to find a mistress, who happens to be the Duchess's best (in fact, only) friend (Hayley Atwell). Georgiana would like to retaliate by having an affair with her former suitor Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), but common decency suggests she shouldn't. Why? Because she's just a woman.<br/><br/>Unhappy marriage, sex seen as a mere reproductive device, lust for freedom, society of the past seen as a mirror of contemporary events. Sound familiar? yes, the blueprint is obviously Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, a far superior period piece that manages to speak to the audiences of today. Coppola did that thanks to the soundtrack, which emphasized the idea of the Queen of France being a rebellious teenager; Dibb's approach involves parallels with Georgiana's famous descendant, Princess Diana, as well as a political subtext suggesting the Duchess was one of the world's first feminists. Fair enough, as long as he has the substance to back that up. Does he? No. He puts all his energy in highlighting the natural beauty of 18th century England, and in that sense the movie can be mentioned in the same breath as Room with a View or Howard's End. Elsewhere, though, it's pretty basic, with a story that's been told many times before and has no new twists that can add to its dramatic resonance.<br/><br/>The performances are another problem altogether: Knightley might have seemed like a perfect fit for the role and she tries her utter best, but it feels quite theatrical (in a bad way) and overstated, and sh isn't helped by Atwell and Cooper's emotionless staring as support. Fiennes and Rampling, on the other hand, are amazing, especially the former's apparently cold but really entertaining and moving performance - if Bill Murray did period dramas, it would look a lot like that. It's also a bit ironic: the film aims to be female-driven, but is completely stolen by a man."
"jaredmobarak","6","35","59","2 October 2008"," Freedom in moderationThe Dutchess
","Keira Knightley's period drama for the year 2008 is a well-crafted one, but lacking in anything new and exciting. The Dutchess is your run-of-the-mill tale of unrequited love amidst the artifice of a marriage of utility. It all begins with a gathering of teenagers, playing their games in the yard while the adults talk inside, planning the futures for their children behind closed doors. When Georgiana's mother tells her how she will be the next Duchess of Devonshire, you are almost shocked at her reaction. So happy and excited that a man could love her after only two meetings, she cannot wait to leave and start her new life  seemingly forgetting all about that boy in the yard for whom she obviously has feelings for. This is a time of regimented rules, of lives orchestrated for success and not allowed to spontaneously evolve. A decision that I don't think she could have said no to anyways just set up her entire life's journey, one full of happiness, wealth, and eventual heartbreak.<br/><br/>I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into the film. I had heard the stuff about how Georgiana was the Empress of Fashion and thought maybe this would tell about her designing sense while also her life. Maybe it was going to be a romance or a tale of deception and intrigue, a behind the scenes look at royalty. Instead of any of those, The Duchess ends up really being just a bio-pic disguised as an historical drama. At times it seems like some interest is about to show face as we learn early on about Her Grace's penchant for politics and desire for all people to be free. It actually seems like we're about to watch her fight for women's rights and equality, but instead the topic is glossed over and she becomes the face of the Whig Party, not a vocal piece to the puzzle. Even the fashion aspect is thrown to the side. The Duke mentions it once and she is introduced at some sort of fashion show later on, but after a funny speech, it is back to the pomp and circumstance of the royal way of life.<br/><br/>Whether the film succeeds or not doesn't detract from the fact that the attention to detail is quite nice. Director Saul Dibb has gotten a crew to recreate the time period, actors to inhabit their roles, and an all-around authentic look. I love the moments looking through the windows towards the outside. The glass is fogged and warped as it was back then and the compositions frame the characters of importance with the clear portions, while the others are distorted in the imperfections. Pacing-wise, the film never really drags. It is all composed nicely, spanning the 6-8 years from marriage to the bearing of an heir. The film itself is not boring; it is the story that becomes mediocre and obvious while the cast still intrigues throughout it. Once the relationships and affairs all become public knowledge to the audience, it is just a matter of what will happen next? Unfortunately, that is a question that didn't interest me as much as what could have been looking at different aspects of Georgiana's life, rather than just the marriage itself.<br/><br/>Knightley must be given credit for pulling off another turn in a corset, long dress, and numerous wigs. Almost appearing to be a glutton for punishment, she just seems to flock to this type of role. But with good reason, she is solid throughout, showing her youthful exuberance as well as her stubborn disgust at the injustices put upon a woman in that time period. Much smarter than one would expect from a girl sent off to become a Duchess for the sole purpose of conceiving a male heir, Georgiana is a fascinating woman.<br/><br/>Her husband is played by the great Ralph Fiennes in a role that I am not used to seeing him in. The Duke of Devonshire is very much an automaton going through life fulfilling his duties. Unless with his beloved dogs, Fiennes gives off a cold dead persona, breathing as little life into the part as possibleand that is a compliment, not an insult. He is the kind of guy that just walks away from the group when he is done or bored, he doesn't have to explain himself. Fiennes makes this man sympathetic somehow, showing the audience that beneath the harshness lays a man trapped into a life he cannot leave. He looks out the window at his children and wonders at how free they are. Here is a man in charge of everyone, but alone living for the title. He has an image to uphold and unfortunately that means he must be strict and decisive when it comes to events that could tarnish his reputation and image, events that the Duchess throws his way often.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, some of the love triangles are interesting to see fleshed out with the wonderful supporting cast, it's just that I wish there was more weight to the story with those moments only complementing. Dominic Cooper's Charles Grey, the boy from Georgiana's childhood, adds a layer with the inevitable affair, and the character of Bess Foster, played by Hayley Atwell, is perhaps the most interesting of them all. At first the Duchess' best friend, she becomes her husband's mistress and lover as well, creating a dynamic unused to in films like this. The three live together, all for their own needs. One for his title and heir, one for the power to have her children returned to her, and the other, trapped in her life now, to have some semblance of meaning. It's definitely the most off-the-wall aspect of the story, but unfortunately not enough to make The Duchess any more special than the next period drama to come, or the last before it."

","The costumes are wonderful, the country houses are spectacular, but the story is rather a one note affair. This is indeed a shame, as the book on which the film is based, is a rich and interesting biography.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are very good, but there is little for them to do, as all the action is centered on Keira Knightly. She does not shine here. Having recently watched her in Atonement (where she was very good)I was disappointed by her performance in this film. I felt as if I knew what she is going to do where - a real shame, as I believe that she will be one of our most interesting actors, but not if judged on this outing.<br/><br/>Where are the examples of Georgiana's wit, her clever mind? And why are historical characters so often played with modern sensibilities - Georgiana would have known just what the Duke expected of her, as she was his property - the law in those days, not my opinion - so to suggest otherwise is just nonsense. She really was much more fascinating than depicted in the film."

"JamesHitchcock","7","11","16","18 September 2008"," Every man in England is in love with her- except her husband
","The marriage between Lady Georgiana Spencer and William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, was an arranged union between two of eighteenth-century England's most powerful aristocratic families. It appears to have been loveless from the start; the Duke was more interested in hunting and his dogs than in his wife, whom he only married so that she might provide him with a son and heir. He took his wife's best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster, as his mistress; the three lived under the same roof in a ménage a trois. Georgiana threw herself into her own interests- gambling and political campaigning- and eventually took a lover of her own, the handsome young politician (and future Prime Minister) Charles Grey, by whom she had an illegitimate daughter.<br/><br/>The publicity material for this film has made much of the supposed parallels between Georgiana and her kinswoman Princess Diana, born more than two centuries later, even using the tagline ""There were three people in her marriage"", a clear reference to Diana's famous remark during her 1995 ""Panorama"" interview. There are, of course, differences. Diana, for example, was never a friend of Camilla Parker Bowles, and certainly never had a lesbian relationship with her; the film, in one very suggestive scene, implies that Georgiana and Elizabeth were more than just good friends. The film itself does not play up the Diana angle as much as the marketing campaign did, although there is one obvious reference when it is said that every man in England is in love with Georgiana, except her husband- a remark often made about Diana herself.<br/><br/>After ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement"", Keira Knightley has inherited the office of Britain's Official Costume Drama Queen, once held by Helena Bonham Carter. (Helena has abdicated to take up the position of Tim Burton's Muse). I would not agree that this is Keira's best performance- that remains ""Atonement""- but it is nevertheless a good one. Her Georgiana is a tragic character, passionate and high-spirited, but trapped by the rigid conventions of her age and of her social class. When I first saw Keira as Lara in the television ""Dr Zhivago"" her voice and mannerisms reminded me strongly of Diana, so her casting here is perhaps appropriate. (There were three people in Zhivago's marriage as well, although in that case Lara was the Camilla-figure).<br/><br/>Eighteenth-century female portraits, especially of aristocratic ladies, can often seem rather anonymous, revealing little of the sitter's individual personality, and I think there is a reason for this. The ostentatious fashions of the day, especially those massive, ridiculously over-elaborate wigs, seem to have been designed to draw attention, not to the looks of the woman wearing them, but to the wealth of the husband, lover or father who had paid for them. (The early nineteenth century was to see a sharp reaction against this type of fashion; Georgiana's daughters would doubtless have dressed far more simply and elegantly than their mother, allowing their individual looks to shine through). It is therefore a tribute to Keira's beauty that, even when dressed in the riotously exuberant height of Georgian fashion, she still manages to outshine the clothes she is wearing.<br/><br/>There are good supporting performances from Hayley Attwell as Elizabeth and Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's mother, although I felt that Dominic Cooper was rather bland as Grey. Unlike one reviewer, however, I did not think he was too young for the part- indeed, if anything, he was too old. In reality Grey was seven years younger than Georgiana, whereas Cooper is seven years older then Keira Knightley. Had Grey been as old as the character shown in this film, he would have been eighty when he became Prime Minister in 1830.<br/><br/>The real star, however, is Ralph Fiennes, often a great villain- he was the Nazi commandant in ""Schindler's List"" and Lord Voldemort in the ""Harry Potter"" films. His Duke, however, although deeply unsympathetic, is not quite a villain in that sense. He is cold and unemotional, obsessed with position and status. His extra-marital affairs- apart from Elizabeth he seduces one of the maids at Chatsworth and fathers an illegitimate daughter by her- are not motivated by love or, probably, even by lust- he is too much of a cold fish for that. They are, rather, an expression of his power- he seduces Elizabeth by offering to use his influence to help her recover custody of her children from her estranged husband. His treatment of his wife, including marital rape, is motivated by the same desire for power over others. Yet one senses in Fiennes's performance that even the Duke, as much as his Duchess, is a victim of social conventions, that he is unable to express love and other emotions because he has never learned how to do so. There is often an emotional reserve about Fiennes' acting, which in my view makes it difficult for him to play a romantic hero like Bendix in ""The End of the Affair"". (In that film I thought he would have been better as the cuckolded husband, Henry). In a part like the Duke, however, he is perfect.<br/><br/>The film falls within the British ""heritage cinema"" tradition, although unlike most films in that tradition it is based upon historical fact rather than fiction. As with most heritage films, it aims at a faithful reproduction of the period, especially the costumes, and was filmed against a backdrop of some of England's grandest stately homes, including Chatsworth, the ancestral home of the Devonshires. (Unfortunately, their London mansion Devonshire House was demolished after the First World War, so Somerset House was used instead for the London scenes). Saul Dibb, however, seems to have been aiming for something different from the classic Merchant-Ivory ""heritage look"". ""The Duchess"" with its muted colours, is comparatively subdued; perhaps Dibb felt this was more appropriate as, for all the fine clothes on display, it is essentially a film about emotional suffering. 7/10"
"eagleroost","9","3","3","26 May 2009"," A moving story
","Flawless. This is so much more than a pretty costume piece. Yes, there is only one linear plot, but Kiera Knightly takes us so deeply into the story of her character, The Dutchess, that we are completely absorbed.<br/><br/>This is no comedy of manners, as we are used to in so many period pieces. This is the story of a girl excited about her future, learning blow by blow what it means to be the wife/property of a powerful man. I was impressed that Kightly was able to portray the pain of her marriage and the deep love of a mother. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes was perfect as the Duke. A man so used to his own power and privilege that it allowed him to live with no consideration for others. You don't like him, but you do understand him. <br/><br/>I saw the love interest of the Dutchess, not in terms of an undeniable passion, but more as an attempt to snatch some shred of joy for herself in a life empty of love. In that respect, it was played convincingly. <br/><br/>I am not sure that men will be able to relate to these themes, but women who have been married and have children will have their hearts torn by each painful compromise and decision. Somehow Knightly and/or the director manages to lead us through this tragic tale in a way that is moving instead of depressing. <br/><br/>Despite its historical nature, this is not a family film as the sexual themes are for mature audiences."

","""The Duchess"" tells the tale of the beautiful young Georgiana Spencer (Knightley) who, in the late 18th century, is married to the much older Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes) and attains wealth, status, and prestige, all at the price of being condemned to a loveless marriage. It's familiar ground: the duke is the typically phlegmatic English nobleman, unable to express or perhaps even experience emotions, while his wife is in every way his superior: in intellect, courage, self-reliance, devotion to children, etc.<br/><br/>Most of the story revolves around the inequality between men's and women's lives: the former openly flaunting their mistresses while the latter are forbidden such dalliances. Men don't come off very well in this movie: they beat their wives, threaten them with separation from their children, and treat their girls with utter indifference while a boy is the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>While the plot is not altogether scintillating, the acting more than makes up for it. Knightley is at her best, able to convey all the emotions the role requires. But the star of this movie is Fiennes, who in spite of playing a truly unlikeable character, manages to keep him from being utterly detestable. At the end, his humanity finally breaks through just a little bit, and one wishes the script would have allowed a few more glimmers at earlier points in the movie as well.<br/><br/>But even if one were to magically delete all dialogue from the film, and just watch it on the big screen with the soundtrack, it would be well worth it. The constant parade of fashions, primarily women's but also men's, is like a documentary of late 18th century clothing. Each scene seems to outdo the other. It's like walking through a museum full of Gainsborough and Reynolds portraits, and seeing each one come to life; wonderful! The stately mansions, the magnificent teams of horses, the sweeping vistas of gardens and sheep on the pastures, it's all England at its very finest. The soundtrack was beautiful, lush and romantic and very apropos. I particularly liked the inclusion of much period music which was intelligently (though not always accurately) paired with the era. Was Bach played in England in 1775? I rather doubt it, but still it fit nicely and sounded gorgeous.<br/><br/>Do see this on the big screen; don't wait for the DVD."

","The locations, specially Bath are the most cinematic aspect of this opportunistic tale. The Duchess, it seems, was a distant relative of Lady Diana Spencer's and there is a certain symmetry in their stories but Keira Knightly projects only an ""actressy"" air. She was superb in ""Pride and Prejudice"" but here she just simply poses and stares. Ralph Finnes's awful Duke is much more believable. The extra marital doomed love story between the Duchess and Dominic Cooper left me completely cold and perhaps that's were the problem resides. Their relationship, their ""love"" should have consumed us for the sketchy tale to work, but it didn't. Still, the locations, I repeat, are breathtaking and ""The Duchess"" can be seen if you don't expect to be other than an spectator."
"adnarish","5","6","8","15 January 2014"," A question of expectations
","I'm of two minds about this film. On the one hand, Saul Dibb has managed to turn a book into an entertaining film about the trials and tribulation - and, let's keep things in perspective, extremely privileged life - of the frolicking Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). It hits all the targets of the romantic genre, and does so with a nice mix of emotional scenes, witty banter, and even some interesting discussions.<br/><br/>Some, because on the other hand the film fails to step beyond the confines of its genre and to really engage with the historical period in which the events take place. The female protagonist gets married to a Duke (Ralph Fiennes), is supposedly unhappy (but wastes little time exploiting the new social options presented to her because of said marriage), and soon the viewer is on board with Georgiana for a ride through all the familiar scenes: her husband's mistresses, her own dalliances with young dreamers, an unexpected pregnancy, etc. etc. The political scheming in the background is mentioned, but there is very little interaction between the events of the story and the historical context. In the final minutes of the film, lines of text assure the viewer that Georgiana was one of the most influential women of her day (in England, one assumes). Unfortunately, not much of that supposed influence is shown in the film, where Georgiana has to make do with a short scene in which she rallies a crowd of a few dozen spectators at a political campaign event.<br/><br/>It's all the more unfortunate that this angle of Georgiana's character was left underexposed, because in the first few minutes of the film she quickly finds herself in a rather witty back-and-forth with one of her husband's political allies, Charles Fox (Simon McBurney). Those scenes, so teasingly shown in the trailer, are sadly moved to the sidelines soon after. If those reading this felt similarly disappointed by this, I can recommend Patrice Leconte's 1996 film Ridicule. It's an excellent and very witty look at the French court in roughly the same time.<br/><br/>So all in all, if you're looking at this film as a romantic historical drama, it's actually not all that bad. But unfortunately it's also not much more than that. A shame, especially because this is an era in which there should be no shortage of great characters from which to draw inspiration for far more interesting stories and films.<br/><br/>A final note on the acting: Ralph Fiennes is great as William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, as is Simon McBurney as the politician Charles Fox. Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell gave two decent but unexciting (which isn't necessarily bad) performances as Charles Grey and Bess Foster respectively. As for Georgiana herself? I can understand directors are reluctant to use different actors for the same role, but wanting a 22 year old Keira Knightley to portray both a 17 year old newly-wed and a 35 year old mother was perhaps a bit too much to ask. Knightley makes the most of it, and some scenes are well done indeed, but on the whole it wasn't really working out for me.<br/><br/>Recommended for easy romantic watching, not so for an engaging historical drama."
"moutonbear25","9","10","16","28 September 2008"," What it feels like for a girl
","It seems that with each passing year, there comes a point in time when we will inevitably find the young and beautiful, Keira Knightly, in yet another period drama. It also seems like every period drama these days, whether it features Knightly or not, feels the need to disassociate itself from the conventions of the past and assert itself as fresh, with a unique twist on the genre. This is particularly challenging when the story is one we've seen a number of times prior. The true story of Georgina Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, as told by director, Saul Dibb, in THE DUCHESS, is one where a young girl of ""modest"" heritage is married off to an esteemed Duke for a price. Her duty is to serve his grace and provide to him a male heir. As a woman, she is nothing more than a decorative commodity and should she not be able to fulfill her wifely promises, then she is essentially useless. Dibb is smart about it though. With the point already made before the film even begins, he chooses to focus instead on the reality of this kind of imprisonment  what it feels like for a girl beneath her binding bodice.<br/><br/>Knightly carries the weight of this film on her shoulders while carrying the weight of the wigs on her head with poise and prominence. Her big brown eyes go from playful to shy to distraught and defeated. When we first meet her, she is free and seemingly unaware of the heavier world outside of her backyard games. Before long though, she is face to face with adulthood. This particular face belongs to Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire. It is here that Dibb steps in to add another layer to the played out trajectory. With an age difference that is only matched in vastness by the distance between them, the Duke undresses his Duchess and asks why women's clothing must be so complicated. There is no better occasion for small talk than before two practical strangers go to bed for the first time. Knightly, trying desperately to hide her nervousness, replies to the obviously rhetorical question though, claiming that this is the only way for women to express themselves in the times they live in. It is clear she is not sure that a reply is necessary or even allowed but it is also clear that she speaks to ensure that she is seen, that her person is present. Her clothing falls to the floor and the imprints of her corset can still be seen on the smooth of her back.<br/><br/>Dibb follows this form of unexpected intimacy and insight with commentary about celebrity and how little the adoring public truly knows about their icons. The Duchess of Devonshire, or at least the one in THE DUCHESS, was an immense influence on her people. Her presence at events guaranteed crowds while her fashion determined the trends. Even her association with particular people could sway public and political opinion. She embodied grace and extravagance while remaining humble and the public ate it up. In their eyes, her life was perfect but those who traveled in closer circles knew better. They knew that there was little love between the Duke and Duchess and increased strain as she was not able to provide a male heir. Even they didn't know just how bad it was though. The wait staff on the other hand could have made millions on a tell-all. Like Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, Dibb shows us what goes on on both sides of the castle gates, highlighting the drastic disconnect between the two close worlds. The Duchess was made to make many horrific choices and concessions that would have broken many a lesser person. What makes them so harrowing in the context of the film is the plainness with which they are expected by the Duke and subsequently accepted by all involved.<br/><br/>THE DUCHESS is shocking on many levels. It is shocking how harsh it is underneath its polished finish and how new this old tale feels. It is shocking how well Knightly can hold her pain and her own. And it is shocking how little value and worth was once afforded the women of the world. But it is perhaps most shocking that the manner in which women were once seen as a male possession, with purpose and function that only serves the male agenda, still exists today, no matter how you dress it up."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","5","5 October 2008"," Melodramatic period piece
","""Melodrama"" and ""period piece"" say just about everything when it comes to ""the Duchess"". Several opening establishing sequences quickly set the scene  young, playful Georgiana (Keira Knightley) rejoicing at her mother Lady Spencer's (Charlotte Rampling) announcing her good fortune of soon to become the Duchess of Devonshire. The opportunity is not lost to also introduce in these early scenes her future lover Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). Her dream of a love-marriage (she has, after all, already met the Duke twice), however, is soon shattered as the Duke of Devonshire claims her virginity on their wedding night as if he is undertaking a military exercise. It soon becomes evident that to him, her only reason of existence is to produce a male heir. This all sound very familiar and ""The other Boleyn girl"" comes immediately to mind, a movie that, by comparison, offers more zest and vigour.<br/><br/>With the all-too-familiar plot line of a failed marriage (mentioned all too often by the protagonists) and the single-agenda of whether she can ultimately produce a boy, the story quickly loses momentum. To rescue comes an interesting character Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), a sympathy-earning women prevented from seeing her three sons by her brutal husband. Befriended by Georgiana and taken into their household, she goes on to become the Duke's mistress. Georgiana, in her made-belief poetic justice, starts an affair with Grey. There are other details but essentially this is the story that provides the base for not a few emotional outbursts and melodramatic conflicts.<br/><br/>Acting obviously carried a lot in such a movie and here, comparison with another recent period piece is interesting and illuminating: ""Brideshead revisited"". The more straight comparison is Charlotte Rampling with Emma Thompson. Those who have seen Thompson in ""Brideshead"" will remember her impeccable, powerful portrayal of Lady Marchmain. Rampling in ""Duchess"" is stereotyped that does not full deserve her talents.<br/><br/>A much more interesting situation is Hayley Atwell who appears in both movies and is arguably the best among the three leads in ""Brideshead"", playing Julia Flyte. Very interestingly, there are two lines of comparison. First, as respective female leads, Atwell in ""Brideshead"" plays a complex role with depth and reserve that Knightley hadn't been able to command in ""Duchess"". The other comparison, of the both of them in ""Duchess"", is even more fascinating. Even when Bess Foster is a supporting role, it is a more complex character and offers some of the few non-cliché elements in the movie  her prime motivation for betraying her best friend is her absolutely unwavering determination to see her kids (something only the powerful Duke can help her with). Atwell handles the job beautifully, outshining Knightley. This is not to say that Knightley is not good; but Atwell is definitely better.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is delightful (if not elating) to watch as he manages to create a character that is even more fiendish than Voldemort! Dominic Cooper, whom you might have seen recently as the young boyfriend in ""Mama Mia!"", gives a credible if not spectacular performance as Grey.<br/><br/>As a period piece, this movie fulfills the audiences' expectation of plush mise-en-scene, lush landscape and pulse-stopping costumes. Those interested in camera work will notice the repeated use of contrasting out-focused surroundings with the sharply focused object (such as when Lady Spencer points out her daughter to the Duke at the opening scenes). One interesting thing I must mention is how the names of the Duchess's three little girls pop up in front of them in a carriage scene. I can't help but wonder aloud if this is taking a cue from Facebook's photo tagging  signs of our time!"

Keira Knightley, over-exposed, cannot live up to the demands of being centre stage but does her best.

Charlotte Rampling once again graces the screen with a regal air, and Dominic Cooper brings a solid performance as Mr. Grey. And, it is in the cinematography and sets and costumes that brings THE DUCHESS to life and gives it the sheen and polish of that era of opulence and lushness of the Royals. THE DUCHESS, like MARIE ANTOINETTE, serves up a rich piece of elegance, set around a story that makes you want to have a happy ending, but that would be a fairy tale. <br/><br/>So, forget/ignore the critics, the soft reviews, and take in the story and intrigue which is THE DUCHESS."

Unfortunately these are not supported by the story. The real Georgiana was a dynamic individual very active in the social and political movements of the day, yet here we are provided merely with a cliched and predictable lightweight romantic melodrama.

","""The Duchess"" from 2008 is the sumptuously-told story of Georgiana Spencer, Duchess of Devonshire, a direct descendant of Princess Diana.<br/><br/>Georgiana (Knightley) becomes the wife of the Duke (Ralph Fiennes) in 1774. It's an arranged marriage, and the Duke is adamant about the fact that he wants a male heir. Beautiful and vivacious, Georgiana is beloved by society though unhappy in her marriage. The sex makes her uncomfortable, mainly because her husband isn't big on communication. Her mother (Charlotte Rampling) assures her that once the heir is born, the sex will be less.<br/><br/>Georgiana, however, keeps giving birth to girls, and the Duke and Duchess even take in Charlotte, the Duke's illegitimate daughter, after her mother dies. Georgiana loves her as if she is her own daughter. <br/><br/>When Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell) enters the scene, Georgiana is thrilled to have a friend and confidante, until her husband sleeps with Bess and the three are forced to live together. Georgiana then falls madly in love with Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and learns that what's good for the goose isn't so good for the gander, especially when the goose has all the power.<br/><br/>Beautiful looking film, with good acting from a top cast, but it moves slowly. One never tires, however, of looking at Knightley in a series of gowns and wigs, ravishing in every scene. The film shows the sad state of women in those times - arranged marriages, blamed if they can't have a boy, forced to tolerate their husbands' affairs, and without power.<br/><br/>Georgiana was a woman who was outspoken politically and drew a lot of attention. It is easy to see why she would find her marriage so constraining. While it may have been, she makes the best of it and makes peace with her circumstances. She emerges in the film, thanks to Knightley, as a strong, adaptable, and forgiving woman.<br/><br/>It's a lovely story, but it could have moved along a bit faster. If you like costume dramas, you will adore this."
"brissotin","4","2","2","10 June 2014"," Half and half interesting
","I saw this movie in cinema and this is the way to do it!<br/><br/>On one side, this movie is not well researched. Nearly every actor does not match with the role. Keira Knightley is not the 18th-century sex-bomb, you would expect from the contemporary paintings. But the hole political role of the duchess is not told in this movie. So you can not understand why in one scene is an great audience. Charles Grey was a young boy, when the duchess married the duke of Devonshire and this is the reason why the first scene in the movie is complete nonsense - like nearly all the story line. The duke was not a old men in this time, and the duchess was significantly older than Mr. Grey etc.. The dark side of the duchess, her faults (drugs, gambling etc.) were not told. So the story of the movie is something like a lie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are very nice costumes. OK, you cannot see why the duchess of Devonshire was so famous for her costumes because she has all the film quiet normal and mostly informal dresses for the period. <br/><br/>I think, it's a nice film for women. If you forget, the background and the historical life of the duchess of Devonshire - perhaps than nobody would see the film in cinema. So they needed a title. The life of the real duchess was quiet interesting full of adventures, illness, journeys, political arguments, intrigues etc.. But here is only a story of a nearly stupid rich women in some problems with her brutal husband. <br/><br/>I admired the locations and the costumes but as a movie without any real interesting conflict and mostly boring not really motivated actors its hard to look at it without regret."
"treadwaywrites","6","2","2","9 January 2009"," Duchess Looks May Keep You Going
","In a nutshell this is the story of the Duchess of Devonshire. She had a very controversial and lavish lifestyle from marrying at the age of 17 to a much older man who expects nothing less from his new bride than 18th century aristocratic behavior and for her to bear him a male child. Georgianna, the Duchess, is not complying. She enters into society, uses her beauty to advance a political undertone and indulge her own whims whatever they are and at whatever the cost to herself. Her actions eventually undo her wants and when the Duke exerts his wealth and power he brings to bear the power of an 18th century man over a woman.<br/><br/>The story is a tragic tale that looks absolutely stunning. Keira Knightley is beautiful as the Duchess. She has been in more than one period piece where her look is akin to wearing drapery. Though very uncomfortable looking in the 18th century garb, Knightley plays it well and appears as though she were made for the costumes. She plays opposite Ralph Fiennes as the Duke and holds her own. The film is a large undertaking for relatively new director Saul Dibb, who also wrote the script for the movie.<br/><br/>The film is surprisingly good. At first glance it looks like a total bore, but once Knightley hits the screen there is no doubt your attention is going to be held. There is no urgency to run out to the theater for this one. Save your money and watch it on HBO. **/****.<br/><br/>As for the poster it depends on whether you like to look at Keria Knightley. It is a little disappointing that even with an 18th century period piece that the poster designer couldn't find a scene that was usable. The poster is pretty, but could have been so much better."

Of course, a thread-thin relation to Princess Diana doesn't hurt at all either.<br/><br/>Somehow the man's world of the Duke of Devonshire, played by Ralph Fiennes, allowed for multiple affairs even to the extreme of having one's favorite side dish just move right on in to the main house ... including meals with the Royal couple!! It would be quite funny, if not so sad.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays the Duchess with fortitude and the proper amount of reservation. She has become quite adept at the period piece. Fiennes, on the other hand, plays the Duke as if he has a constant stomach ache and is in need of Alka-Seltzer. He totally lacks charisma or even many human traits, save lust for those other than his wife. The third wheel who is promoted to second is played well by Hayley Atwell, a desperate and alternatingly cold and warm mother and friend. Rounding out the cast are Dominic Cooper (Mamma Mia) who plays future Prime Minister Charles Grey, and the true love of The Duchess' life; and Charlotte Rampling as the too proud mother to Knightley, who dispenses very weak advice with a stiff upper lip.<br/><br/>The film is well done and the similarities to Princess Diana's marriage are inescapable, but there is just not quite enough substance here. Easy enough to watch, but lacking in historical details ... more of a soap opera approach."

","Call me obtuse, but I will never understand the fascination so many people experience when confronted with the lifestyle and behavior of the so-called nobility, one of the worst species of parasite on our blighted planet. This movie concerns, by and large, the antics of a 'duke', equipped with more money than sense, whose main interests in life seem to be young women (preferably naked in bed) and dogs. Predictably, his young, naive and perhaps not terribly bright wife is the victim of the duke's callous, capricious behavior, and, in spite of some attempts to assert her trodden-upon dignity, she is finally discomfited in the end: a bit like Winston Smith in the last chapter of Orwell's '1984'. The playwright and the director have missed a unique opportunity to highlight the obscene contrast between the majority of the British population and their idle, parasitical and cruel 'aristocracy'. Worse still, peasants and the urban working class are occasionally shown while wildly cheering 'progressive' candidates to a general election when these pussyfoot around, promising some vaguely-worded 'reforms'. How the undeserving class known as aristocracy could be (and alas, still can be) respected and generally admired, will always remain a complete mystery to me."

","The period drama never has been a genre that has offered cinema attendees high octane thrills and pacing, instead opting for a much more subdued, elegant formula to tell whatever historically placed story it may be willing to explore. To say that much of the genre as a result is usually unfairly deemed as dry to the point of uselessness would be somewhat of an understatement; in fact the vast majority of such films, although slow and exceedingly dry, usually make up for their blandness in story with well rounded, memorable and exciting characters. The Duchess however, is not one of these films. No, this is dry turkey with an ostensible glaze created by superficial juice. Going through the motions at every turn, director Saul Dibb fails to create anything worth noting here; it's an extremely straight-forward, standardised period drama with little to no interesting characters whatsoever. So not only do you have to sit through a soap opera plot that feels about as fresh and exciting as seeing Keira Knightley in another period costume, but you have to do so with inane personas that never do anything but pamper about in their big mansions, shouting at their servants. Dull, dreary and utterly disposable, The Duchess is as boring as the genre gets, and while there are some good elements present, they fail to mesh coherently to disguise the fact that the script has no intrinsic value inherent in its thin, formulaic design.<br/><br/>To discuss the premise of the movie is almost futile; if you have seen any movies from the genre, you have pretty much seen The Duchess. Revolving around yet another privileged woman who in turn marries a man of prestige and obviously finds out he is interested in her only for the chance to birth an heir, the twists and turns that take place here are stunted and all too obvious. Throw in the ambitious dreamer that whisks the duchess to her dream fantasy land where the sex is just so much better because, well, he's rugged and a little more emotionally viable, and you can see that not much out of the ordinary is set to take place over the next couple of hours. At this point in discussing the story I would normally diverge onto something that works a little better, and yet I can find no opposing tangent to bring up here. Aside from the happy error of making the film's quietened antagonist more empathetic and compelling than the lead woman, The Duchess is straight forward, no risks involved, period drama; all the staples are here and yet never before have they all felt so lifeless, tired and irrelevant.<br/><br/>Indeed, in order for such a film to work, one must bridge the massive gap that separates the culture of today with that on the screen. Many of the most memorable movies residing within the genre have managed to do this, but The Duchess never does. Sure enough, the script does well to put character and themes of love and regret in the forefront of focus in order to tell a story of humanity rather than history, yet in direct contrast with this year's much more engaging The Other Boleyn Girl, this outing feels emotionally mundane. Lead actress Keira Knightley is no stranger to these types of features, but unfortunately her whole performance this time feels perfunctory and useless; her character is ruled by emotion to that the point that she is perceived as weak and without reasoning. When you have a central character who asks for sympathy in every scene without doing anything to warrant such a thing, you have a troublesome predicament. As a personality The Duchess of Devonshire is banal and the antithesis of compelling. She never surprises and shows less personality than in her ridiculously fake beauty spot that she sports in one scene. During this sequence I was enraptured by this giant obstruction on Keira's face, and then I remembered where I was. To scream irony at this point would have been befitting.<br/><br/>To be sure, there are audiences out there who will eat up this sort of thing for what it is; cheap, seen-it-all-before drama that demands little and offers not much more in exchange. Behind me sat two older women, both of whom I deemed aficionados of the genre going by their hoots and wails during certain scenes that tickled their fancy. Sure enough, I would guess that they at least were entertained, yet I was not. Again, I blame culture difference. And yet with major worldwide successes this year from the likes of Iron Man, Indiana Jones and Batman, one wonders if the period drama will ever manage to draw in the demographic that such movies have thus far managed to do. Going by The Duchess however, which prompts one to believe that things are only getting worse for a genre that is by now churning out the same story time and time again, this potentiality seems unlikely. Perhaps if the historical setting and themes present here were delivered with more poignancy and an overall conviction or sense of modern relevancy, The Duchess could have at least dispelled my apathy towards the genre by the likes of The Other Boleyn Girl. Unfortunately this is not the case; esoteric and emotionally stunted, this movie is too hard to get into, and all too easy to walk out of; only for those who haven't seen a period drama in the last five years.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

But how did the director manage to turn a rattling good political/social story set at a time of great unrest in all of Europe and slow it down to a trudge through the sludge?<br/><br/>Perhaps part of it was the camera work, particularly all those shots through windows that ""just happen"" to blur the one thing the viewer needs to see? Or the terrible sound, which allows us hear every footstep and slurp of wine, but always blurs the dialogue at its most vital point? The needless implied lesbian sex scene? Or simply the wooden performances on the part of all the actors? Shoddy directing, shoddy writing--of course it got an Oscar.<br/><br/>To be honest, for a story where so much might have happened not a lot goes on.<br/><br/>Longest 98 minutes I've sat through in a long time."

","I saw The Duchess on Saturday night, the latest English period piece (this time late 18th century) starring Kiera Knightly as a woman in a bad relationship. This time she is Georgiana, a slender, attractive, fashionable, emotional woman who is all but sold to the Duke of Devonshire, played as an ice-cold, aging, brute by Ralph (he would like you to call him ""Rafe"") Fiennes. The Duke of Love he is not, at one point he defends his disinterest, his rampant infidelity and his abuse of the power of his birthright by saying: ""I love you in the way I understand love."" As he understands it, the intent of marriage is nearly exclusive to produce a male heir which Georgiana fails to do on numerous tries. While he is waiting, he produces an illegitimate daughter and invites another woman to comes to live in the palace and attend social functions with the two of them. Georgiana takes solace in the future prime minister Charles Grey. They produce Eliza, whom she must give up or lose the children she has with the Duke. Georgiana eventually lives out her life quietly and is officially replaced as wife after her death. The movie is interesting largely because the relationship bears such a striking resemblance to the Prince Charles / Lady Diana Spencer (who is a descendant of one of the characters) / Camilla Parker Bowles affair. Diana/Georgiana are fashion icons both beloved by the nation (""the only one not in love with Georgiana is the Duke"" as one character describes the common wisdom). Charles / Duke are both dull (in most ways that word can be defined), plodding remnants of a once powerful royalty who would have risen to not a quantum of the power they possessed if left to their own devices. Of course, modern divorce laws and the continued marginalization of the monarchy meant that Diana would not share Georgiana's fate. The movie, and to some extent the modern story, put the lie to Disney's princess stories my girl's favor and suggest that Prince William may not be dreamy as you might think."

","Superb job by the costume designers, hairstylists and location spotters. Nice to see Charlotte Rampling in a big production again as well. What of the two leads, Fiennes and Knightley? They really try and some of the scenes are quite moving, but, overall, a second rate script defeats them, which, basically, does not have enough 'meat' to cover the entire length of the movie (meaning that we get lots of scenes inserted on the same principle as 'The Tudors' TV series - 'ten minutes up, undergarments down' and time for a bit of carnal viewing for the audience). Overall, I came away feeling the script writer/director had tried to be just a little too clever in getting the 'parallels' across: a beautiful, young member of the minor aristocracy is 'auctioned off' by her parents to marry a (much older) member of the 'top of society' (have you got it yet?) Her family name is 'Spencer' (have you got it now?) The old fogey she marries only wants her to produce a male heir (come on!) and it becomes apparent he has no interest in her at all as a person. In the end, he forms a relationship with another woman (who has lots of strapping, healthy sons) and they form a 'menage a trois' under the same roof (Ahh, now you've got it!!!!!!) In the end, she fights against love and following her heart (and going for cruises on big yachts in the Mediterranean?) and instead sacrifices herself for the sake of her beloved children. MORALE: women in the 18th century had it rotten and is it not lovely to live in an enlightened, blissful era like ourselves instead??! As I said, I would concentrate on the hats (how DID they keep those things on top the massive haystacks of hair piled up on their skulls???)"

","Not sure why more people didn't like it. Really. It certainly is a handy piece of work featuring both interesting characters and highlighting an interesting life. Maybe people are a bit sick of period pieces from England, especially if they featuring Kiera Knightley and concerns love triangles and such. Lets face it, we have seen most of what is presented here in one form or the another.<br/><br/>Still, i found myself very much caught up in this drama. Its hard not to. The costumes (most deservingly awarded) and settings are really beautiful and there are some interesting characters that move in and out in the background, i especially liked (or loathed?) the parts with Bess. Films that are based on true evens inherently tend to be a bit less clichéd and harder to foresee, as i think was the case here, although this certainly cant be said for everything here.<br/><br/>I mean, take the part where Georginia wants to feed her babies her own milk. WHY?? Why does films like this force modern views on their protagonists. Because we couldn't sympathize with them otherwise? Please. Stop. Its just annoying.<br/><br/>On the whole though its a fine drama with good performances. Knightley proves herself more then worthy, don't believe the haters. Dominic is OK but needs more scenes to flesh out his character. Ralp Fiennes on the other hand manages to make The Duke if not charismatic, at least interesting, even though his character isn't explored as much as it should have been. (seriously WTF is his problem). This drama is rather one dimensional in this respect and though its sibling, Sofia Coppulas Maria Antionette did a better work capturing much of its thematical meat without resorting to pinpointing. That said, its still a very nice film, and if you are into period pieces you owe to yourself to check it out."

","Fantastic settings: Althorp, Chatsworth, Bath etc; amazing budget on costumes - without a doubt the best since Sophia Coppola's Marie Anotoinette - and a feast for the eyes with it's detail for Georgian times.<br/><br/>However, and it's a huge however, no matter how great the production values, and this looks pretty expensive, nothing can disguise the fact that Knightley is beautiful but fails to be more than than a good actress. She is not a great actress. This may be an unpopular comment, but in the scenes with Rampling or Fiennes she lacks depth. As a young ingénue thrust into a marriage she is perfect; as the most political women of her day who found herself in probably the most famous triangle before Prince Charles, not so.<br/><br/>She is in no way bad, and this is watchable, but it is not brilliant. It is a great shame. Knightley must find a way to really convey the smallest gesture to mean more. She loses her temper reasonably well, but not completely. One senses there is no madness, it is all too self-conscious and shows too much control. One gets the sense that she is an actress, but not a fully developed one.<br/><br/>We enjoyed this, but my wife's comment on The Duchess was the same as mine: looks brilliant, lacks power."

","THE DUCHESS (based on Amanda Foreman's book ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" which in turn was based on historical fact) has been well adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and writer/director Saul Dibb. What was basically snubbed by the critics of the theatrical release as a 'fashion show with little else going for it' turns out to be a quite beautiful period drama. The fact that the story is based on the life of the outspoken feminist and political thinker in the late 1700s - Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire - who happens to be an ancestor of Princess Di whose life in many ways paralleled the Duchess, makes it more interesting than most costume dramas. And yet, even without the obvious parallel in stories, this film stands well on its own, due to a smart script and a fine cast. <br/><br/>Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) coaxes the marriage of her beautiful daughter Georgiana (Keira Knightley) to marry the very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a rather boring dog lover whose only interest in 'purchasing' a wife is to gain a male heir. Caught up in the dignity and lush homes and gardens of the Duke, the new Duchess charms all who see her - and the manner in which Keira Knightley wears the vast number of gorgeous sculpted costumes gives credence to her appearance popularity and enhances her personal popularity as she looks beyond the surface to the hearts of the people around her. When the Duchess is unable to produce live boy children (two stillborns don't count, nor do the two daughters she births), The Duke turns to dalliances both with the household maids and to the Duchess' newest friend Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell): the Duchess seeks solace with her childhood love Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and the tension in the household comes to a breaking point. British etiquette rules, and the 'wife' must bear up under the pressure of society, a position the Duchess obeys but continues her popularity with the politics and social comments of the times - quite a daring feat for those revolutionary years in England, America, and France and the world in general. How this singularly intelligent woman copes provides the resolution of the story. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley is ravishingly beautiful and continues to impress with her sensitive acting skills. The contributions by Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell bring finely honed characterizations to life. Rachel Portman is responsible for the musical score that fits the production like a glove. There is, then, far more to this film than a panorama of elegant costumes. It is deserving of a larger audience. Grady Harp"

","Where did they dig up this one? I found the film delightful. I am not one for costume dramas so this was very surprising and opened many doors.<br/><br/>Some people complain about the historical errors. Who cares?

She executed her lines perfectly aside from a certain ""What's wrong with me?"" which could have had a little more emotion.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes was amazing. Being a dedicated watcher of ""Harry Potter"" I certainly wasn't disappointed. His hypocritical, egotistical and sex crazed 'Duke of Devonshire"" ranked in evil right up there with Lord Voldermort. He was my favorite character, portraying an ""evil and inhumane"" character when at the end, shows a little humanity.<br/><br/>Dominic Cooper played a serious role, which worked for him, for once. He played Georgiana's lover in an extremely explicit way. He was wonderful. Good to look at, good to listen to.<br/><br/>A couple of things I want to point out.<br/><br/>Although this movie is PG 13 (or M in some cases), it is all to do with sex, rape, politics, alcohol and gambling.

","A British costume drama - now, there's a surprise. And Keira Knightley in period dress - more surprise. So, why make it? The novel angle in director Saul Dibb's work is that this is a true story about the life of Georgiana Spencer who became the Duchess of Devonshire in a loveless marriage so there is much resonance with the experience of Diana Spencer in our own times.<br/><br/>In a sense, this is a movie which cannot fail - after all, there is a steady market for period drama with wonderful English stately homes and repressed English sensibilities. On the other hand, it needs to be rather special to stand out from so many similar outings - and there's nothing unique or outstanding here.<br/><br/>Although there is a good supporting cast - Ralph Fiennes as the Duke, Charlotte Rampling as the mother and Dominic Cooper as the lover - this is very much a starring vehicle for young Knightley (still only 23) who is rarely off the screen. This is not her best performance (that was probably ""Atonement"" with ""Pride And Prejudice another success) but it is perfectly competent, even if - unlike her wig - it doesn't catch fire."

","Fiennes has been a reliable actor since his breakthrough appearance in ""Schindler's List"" a little more than a decade ago. His diabolical Nazi had a complex personality that transcended some of the stereotypical portrayals seen before. For most of last decade, he has continued shining with films like ""The English Patient"" where his romantic sensibility permeates the entire movie. ""The Duchess"" proves once again the caliber of his acting. Here, the technical details are flawless, but it is how he reaches into the soul of the character that dazzles us. He inhabits the role, bringing out every possible facet and detail. The portrayal of the duke leaves no room for doubt or questions. The man was the human embodiment of power, and he commanded respect and fear, never fully understanding how he had to make his moves. Yet he knew that handling this power could have enormous repercussions on his political, social, and personal lives, and the burden was at times unbearable. Fiennes shows this man had the ability to deal with, but he knew it was important to show that his actions and consequences did affect him, too.<br/><br/>The movie is supposed to be a portrayal of the woman who married this iconic figure, and Knightley shows she keeps growing as an actress. It could be argued that Fiennes would need an acting partner who could do this magnificent dance with him, giving a performance that was solid and interesting. Knightley does just that, going beyond the costumes to explore how being a woman during this period was not an easy task, even when she had advantages that other members of her sex could only dream of. However, did she have the control she thought she had? This is the aspect the movie explores, and with both of these actors, it is possible to take a peek into this historical period.<br/><br/>The film is elegant, gorgeously produced, with a lavish score that highlights the emotions of the main characters. Fiennes imposes plenty of restrictions on his actions because of the expectations society puts on him. Her other half is the emotive one and he knows he needs a partner like that, going beyond his initial design for his wife. They make an excellent couple and a great partnership. If only things were this easy...<br/><br/>There is much to admire in this interesting recreation of a period and a society that has changed quite a bit. The best thing about the movie is again how wonderful Fiennes is, and how the film revolves around him, even though there is much to enjoy by watching Knightley bring the legendary woman to life. It ia all about what is being allowed during a period in time, about who is able to execute that power discreetly enough to retain the mystique, the respect and the necessary authority that has kept these people at the top of their elite. It is a delicate balance, and the film allows you some insight.<br/><br/>It is a good movie, come, sit, and learn that not everything was pleasure for people like the duke and his wife."

","Yes, Keira looks good in costume dramas. Just because she's so un-busty we like to see her bones squeezed in corsets. The contrast makes old viands taste more contemporary. But at the eleventh period piece in a row the Knightley effect is losing its sting fast, and however nuanced her acting may have become in the process - dashing with poise - this spice alone can't cover the staleness of the product. For the enduring vitality of a period piece - as of any other movie, but more than most genres - rests ultimately on the screenplay, not on the star appeal or the production values, and ""The Duchess"" is no exception. The sheer fact that its subject is taken from life - a biography, in fact - and not based on one of those immortal Austenian novels already studded with witty lines, which would stand any treatment and still sound fresh, should have advised on some extra writing effort, but the authors thought otherwise. They seem to have believed that putting Sheridan, the Duchess of Devonshire - the most admired literate beauty of Georgian society - and her lover, a future Whig Prime Minister, together into some Adam interior would have produced instant wit, and dispensed with literally putting it in the script. Unluckily for us, it proved not to be so. Poor Georgiana, a chatty character we must presume, and a writer in her own right, is always left with nothing to say or to do, but sobbing, inhaling, glancing and - yes - pouting. Even the usually infallible charm of English buildings and landscapes suffers severely from the general lack of character: the countryside is shapeless, neither sunny nor cloudy, hour and season are nondescript, and Palladian architecture looks wearisome and predictable - you can't endlessly revisit the staircase of Holkham Hall throughout the movie and escape boredom. The overall impression is that of a comedy of manners staged by the National Trust, a well-meaning stint at reliving the splendours of centuries past - coaches, valets, hounds and wigs for the benefit of tourists: the whole ""Georgian experience"" - in some stately mansion from which life has been drained away long time ago."

It barely skimmed the massive detail contained in the book and was a big let down for me. It was beautifully made with seemingly no expense spared on costumes or locations but to give one example no mention was made of the huge gambling debts run up by the Duchess, which was of course a major problem for her.

"jem132","9","3","5","4 October 2008"," Knightley dominates the screen in The Duchess!
","Yes, you heard right. The critical reviews have been mixed so far, but this ordinary little film-goer thought ""The Duchess"" was quite wonderful, and young British leading lady Keira Knightley carries the film. She appears in almost every scene as Georgiana, an intriguing figure in royal history. Married off in her teens to the Duke of Devonshire for the sake of producing a male heir, she rebelled against the constraints of her time by indulging in extravagant partying and gambling. She became a fashion darling of the press. Even though she could not legally vote, she wheeled and dealed in political issues. She bedded a future Prime Minister and bore his illegitimate child. It's a magnificent part for any actress, but not everyone could pulls this off. Keira Knightley does.<br/><br/>In her past few films, the actress has really left behind her awful performances in the ""Pirates of Caribbean"" series (and she's still only 23). In ""The Duchess"", she could easily have been swallowed up by the presence of Ralph Fiennes and those huge, elaborate costumes. But she gives a wonderful, emotional and compulsively watchable performance here. Completely convincing! Fiennes at first seems to be on auto-pilot, but a subtle movement, glance or inflection of speech suggests a man who doesn't necessarily like the times, either. Saul Dibb, previously a TV director, doesn't really do anything elaborate or unique with his direction. It plays very much like a television BBC production, and one of my few complaints of the film is that I would have liked to see some more imaginative direction. The costumes and sets are lovingly recreated, and we do gain a real sense of time and place.<br/><br/>In supporting roles are the always satisfying Charlotte Rampling, and two newcomers in Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell. Atwell's character, Bess, forms the plot's most interesting arc. Bess is first Georgiana's friend, taking up residence in the castle at her insistence. Not too long after she has been moved in, she jumps into bed with the Duke. In Knightley's most effective scene she rips into Fiennes, as the ""one woman in England he had to choose"" is her best friend. Yet a truce and intriguing mutual respect is formed between the two women, linked by the man who Georgiana refers to as ""our husband"". Atwell is a lovely presence and hopefully will do well in the future. Dominic Cooper is Charles Grey, ambitious young politician and Georgiana's eventual bedmate. Cooper tries his best but he's just miscast as Grey, he doesn't understand the complexities of his character, and he doesn't really suit the period. Still, I love tragic, forbidden romance and this angle of the film satisfied me."

","As with most period pieces of this nature, the lavish lifestyle of the rich and powerful is portrayed with great accuracy and grandeur. Although The Duchess is a beautiful film to the eye it is dreadfully dull in the minds of men. Just so you know I'm not completely biased against such films, I'd like to mention that I thought The Other Boleyn Girl and Atonement were both very good.<br/><br/>Well then, let me summarize.<br/><br/>Georgiana Spencer is a naive 17 year old girl who is ecstatic about marrying the Duke of Devonshire, who has fallen in ""love"" with her after only a few brief encounters. Unfortunately, the Duke desperately wanted an heir and was only in ""love"" with the Spencer women's supposed reputation for bearing male children. Georgiana found herself going from ""knowing love"" to a loveless marriage. Even on their wedding night, he shows no passion and no tenderness in his love making. He only has a single objective set in his mind. He sleeps with other women without discretion and has an illegitimate daughter with one of his servants.<br/><br/>Alas, her hand is bound by the ring on her finger and her mouth is bound by 18th century social conventions. She is trapped. Georgiana provides the Duke with 2 daughters, but that is insufficient to please him. She finds refuge in fashion and becomes the ""it"" girl among socialites and commoners alike. And in an age before suffrage, Georgiana is able to wield her influence in fashion into leverage in politics. Her wit and charm is able to dictate modern fashion and sway the allegiance of voters. In particular, she uses her influence to forward the political career of a young member of the Whig Party, Charles Grey. Georgiana and Charles fall madly in love, but are unable to act on their feelings.<br/><br/>Charles isn't the only intimate relationship that keeps Georgiana from drowning. She befriends Bess, a woman who has fled from an abusive husband. After inviting Bess to live with her with the Duke, tensions rise. The Duke and Bess begin sleeping together. Bess begs Georgiana to understand that she is only in this affair to have the Duke force her husband to release their children to her. When her children finally arrive at the Duke's home, the Duke finally shows some humanity while he instructs Bess's son how to shoot a rifle properly. Georgiana tries to bargain a deal where Bess and the Duke can have their affair only if she can have an affair with Charles. Outraged, the Duke chases her down and rapes her. No one is able to do anything.<br/><br/>Finally, Georgiana provides the Duke with a male heir. With the hand of a skilled swordsman, the Duke signs a check to Lady Spencer for Georgiana's completed ""duty"". Georgiana decides that this is her chance to escape in a love affair of her own. Against her mother's advice, she flees to Bath to meet Charles for a prolonged ""vacation"". Her affair results in gossip, so the Duke threatens to take her children away and to strip her and Charles of their social status. Georgiana has no other choice than to obey and return to her beautiful prison. She gives birth to another girl, but this one is Charles's illegitimate child and is consequently raised by the Grey family.<br/><br/>The rest is uneventful and is summarized in a few paragraphs at the end of the film, which I lack the enthusiasm to repeat here.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that she is unusually thin, I find Keira Knightley quite beautiful - ravishing even. Perhaps that's the reason I agreed to watch this with little objection. Little did I know I had signed myself up for 220 minutes of torture. Right. The Duchess is only 110 minutes, but I assure you I was watching a much lengthier version of he most inhumane nature. The end is a bit hazy. I must have blacked out from repeatedly banging my head against the empty seat in front of me. Sorry if I come off as a simple-minded brute, but I can also see that the story is enlightening of the times. This film illustrates the great societal pressures on both men and women. Especially women. However, when it comes down to entertainment value, The Duchess is lackluster.<br/><br/>So where did the movie go wrong? I couldn't sympathize or relate to any of the characters. The Duke is a complete ass, Bess is a total bitch, and Georgiana is pitiful. It was too difficult to detach myself from my 21st century values to understand the psyche of upper class Englishmen of from the 18th century. To me, period pieces tend to overplay the suppression of women to get sympathy points that can be cashed out for public catharsis. This just doesn't work well on male viewers. It can be done, but it's rare. Also, the story is completely predictable. Yes, I understand this is based on history, but I hated history in school. Let's face it. Movies aren't the best sources for education, so why not stretch the truth a bit in favor of entertainment? Get the viewer to want to know more. I left wanting to know nothing. The story is objectively compelling, but subjectively mundane. In my mind, The Duchess would play a fantastic role in a Bud Light commercial where the men sneak beer into the theater, high-five, and drink to stave off boredom.<br/><br/>This is truly a Chick Flick.

","Costume period dramas are a constant bore so why should I spend my time unclothing this one literally style. Because ""The Duchess"" is a pretty good one I must say your highnesses. Keira Knightley stars as Georgiana, the Duchess of the Duke of Devonshire in the 18th Century. However, this Duke and Duchess are not the happy aristocratic couple as they do tend to verbally duke it out from time to time. In fact, they are both opposite ends of the spectrum. Georgiana is charismatic, humorous, and enchanting; while the Duke is lifeless, demanding, and egotistical. His only concern with the Duchess is for her to labor a son to be his heir. When the Duchess can only deliver junior duchesses and no mini-Dukes, the Duke chaos follows. Not to mention, the Duchess longs for a charming politician named Charles Grey, but the Duke makes it very difficult for the Duchess to fall into The Grey Zone. Director Saul Dibb does not dibble dabble too much with the same ol' period piece plot. Dibb does a stellar job in characterizing the protagonists so the focus is not primarily focused on the usual elaborate art direction and whopping costumes of most period pieces. Not to say Dibb did not have some help in accomplishing this by hatching out handsomely to Screenwriter Jeffery Hatcher appealing script of the film. Knightley's commanding performance as Georgiana was of extraordinaire reign. Keira is quickly becoming the acting queen of the period piece genre. Ralph Fiennes was pitch perfect as El Duque. And there were some nice thespian supporting touches by Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's selfish mother Lady Spencer (for hire to have her daughter marry the Duke), and Dominic Cooper as the aforementioned Charles ""Not in Charge"" Grey. So my concluding exclamation is that ""The Duchess"" is one surprising period film that makes its mark! **** Good"

","I went to see this movie with my friends not knowing what to expect (I hadn't seen any previews). I enjoyed it, however. It was well put together, and the costumes and cinematography were top-notch. Keira Knightley delivers a wonderful performance; not over-the-top. She is clearly a smart actress and makes many great decisions about her character -- there's a certain sensibility to the way she interprets the duchess. The story itself is not as interesting as I would have liked -- not too original, and nothing that I haven't seen before. But the production value and performances are good enough to carry the film."

And there is a wee hotty for those who need it. My only disappointment was that the movie used sex a bit too much to gloss over some difficulties but overall whomever watches it will gather some understanding of the standards and life of an 18th century man or woman. And probably have a lot of sympathy for the footmen. What a boring life!"

I could forgive the plodding plot if there were chemistry between any of the actors, but there is none. Fiennes and Atwell are not believable as lovers, nor are Knightley and Cooper. I didn't know who to root for in this film.

While the story chronicles the Duchess's life with vibrancy to show her hampered by the constraints of a rigid society, it struggles to overcome a lack of perspective.

"jonathanruano","9","1","1","15 December 2009"," The Duchess
","My main fear before I saw the Duchess was that this was going to be another feminist movie about a ""strong woman"" in the 18th century. I was glad to discover that it wasn't. The Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana (played surprisingly well by Kiera Knightly) was an intelligent woman who was interested in politics, had ideas of her own, and had this refreshing ability to speak directly, a quality that was mirrored by her lover Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). Yet Georgiana was not a strong woman. She was powerless against the things that life as a woman did to her. When the Duke (Ralph Fiennes in another great performance) wanted to rape Georgiana, he got his way because this is a society where a man of high rank enjoys almost absolute power -- especially over women -- and does not have to account for his deeds and misdeeds. When the Duke wanted to take on mistresses, he did so with impunity. When the Duke wanted to force Georgiana to separate from her lover, he succeeded by threatening to take away her children. ""The Dutchess"" in a phrase is dark, explicit and uncompromising portrait of aristocratic power in 18th century England with a very clear message: for women, independence and civil rights were an illusion. The glimmer of hope, of course, was that some of the women were making timid requests for greater independence for the first time.<br/><br/>This is not a pleasant picture by any means, but it is so well acted and so startling accurate that we actually feel empathy for people, like Georgiana. And that means something, even for a picture like the Duchess whose plot is no more complicate than repeated acts of submission. A brilliant film."

","Georgiana Spencer, a beautiful English noble woman, and a direct relative of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was a woman ahead of her times. In those years, a young lady did not have a choice in the matter of whom she was going to marry, it was up to her parents, in this case, her mother, Lady Spencer, to choose one of the most powerful men in the country, William Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire. All that was expected from Giorgiana is that was to give male heirs to a man that cared more about his dogs than his own gorgeous wife. As their marriage begins, she has to accept the fact that a young girl, Charlotte, an illegitimate child of her husband is brought to their home, without as much as an objection on the part of Georgiana.<br/><br/>When Georgiana meets another noble lady, Elizabeth Foster, she learns about what a cruel husband had imposed on her new friend, banning her to see her own children. Georgiana, asks William to let Bess come live with them and get her three boys to join their household. Unfortunately, William sees in Bess a who he wants and makes her his mistress, something that at first appalled Georgiana, but came to accept.<br/><br/>Since the duchess could not produce a male heir, William decides to try another approach by raping her. By that time Georgiana had developed a passion for Charles Grey, a beau from her single days. Charles, who was deeply involved in politics, had always loved her, but society prevented them to be openly involved. After all those were different times. As a curious note, Charles Grey's name was adopted to name a favorite tea, the ""Earl Grey"" brew, a favorite of many.<br/><br/>This tasteful production, directed by Saul Dibb, takes the viewer into the grandeur of the England of the late eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries in a visually splendid production that is a great pleasure to watch. Based on the book ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"", by Amanda Foreman, gets a satisfying production by the director and Jeffrey Hatcher and Anders Thomas Jensen. Gyula Pados, the cinematographer captures in vivid detail the places where most of the story happened.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly makes an interesting contribution as the complex character she was asked to play. Ralph Fiennes is hateful as the cruel powerful man he impersonates. Charlotte Rampling appears as Lady Spencer, an iron willed woman who thought her daughter's duty to be married to a powerful man. Dominic Cooper, Hayley Atwell, and the rest of the supporting players do an excellent job for the director.<br/><br/>""The Duchess"" is a feast for the eyes. Enjoy."

"Turfseer","7","1","1","24 May 2009"," The Duke gets short shrift but the Duchess never bores!
","The Duchess is based on the true life story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire who married William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire in England in 1774. The facts of Georgiana's life form the basis of the film's plot. We're introduced to the Duchess when she is 17 years old; her family (including Georgiana) is excited that she is being married off to the Duke. After the marriage, she's soon disappointed that the Duke never talks to her and appears to be emotionally distant. Despite this, the Duchess becomes extremely popular in aristocratic circles and eventually involves herself in politics, campaigning for Whig candidates and supporting liberal causes.<br/><br/>Time passes and Georgiana has two daughters but is unable to produce a male heir. The Duke bitterly resents her for this. On a trip to Bath, the Duchess meets Lady Elizabeth Foster who is a victim of domestic violence—her husband has forbidden her to see her children again and she has been put out of their house. With nowhere to go, Georgiana takes pity on Lady Elizabeth and persuades the Duke to let her stay with them. In a move to get her children back, Lady Elizabeth sleeps with the Duke and Georgiana feels betrayed and orders her to leave. But the Duke overrules her and the three end up living together until the Duchess's death many years later.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Georgiana has fallen for Charles Grey, later to become Prime Minister. She wants to make a 'deal' with the Duke, allowing her to see Charles while he continues his adulterous relationship with Lady Elizabeth. The Duke is so outraged by the Duchess's proposition that he ends up raping her. The Duchess ends up pregnant and finally produces a son. But the Duchess cannot stay away from Charles and she ends up pregnant. After a daughter, Eliza, is born, the Duke sends the child away to live with Grey's family. In the film's climax, the Duke demands that Georgiana return to live with the family but she decides to live with Charles. After the Duke threatens to bar her from seeing all of her children ever again, she changes her mind about Grey and returns to her husband and children and lives out the rest of her days on the family estate.<br/><br/>Some critics and posters here have complained that The Duchess is a story that we've seen too many times before. Maybe so, but it never bores. All the plot points are covered effectively as the protagonist's journey is etched in stark relief. There's the inciting incident where the Duchess learns of her betrothal to the Duke. The break into the Second Act occurs when the Duchess's leaves her 'ordinary' world and marries the Duke. The Midpoint where the stakes are raised, occurs when the Duchess invites Lady Elizabeth into their household leading to further complications. In the words of Christopher Vogler, the protagonist approaches ""the inmost cave"" at the end of Act II where the protagonist must undergo an ordeal. In The Duchess, Georgiana attempts to defy the Duke and ends up being raped. This is her ""All is lost"" moment or ""Dark Moment of the Soul"".<br/><br/>The Dark moment is actually a delayed crisis. It's a huge setback but the protagonist must regroup and once again must push forward. In the beginning of Act III, the protagonist must have some kind of respite before pushing forward into the final battle. In The Duchess, Georgiana's respite is the birth of her son. The Duke's double standard perhaps pushes Georgiana forward into the final battle. She's determined to have her affair with Charles Grey despite her husband's damning prohibition. The Duke however turns the tables on her. He forces her to choose her children over her relationship with Grey and in the end, she surrenders and returns to the family.<br/><br/>Because this is a true story, Georgiana's victory is bittersweet. Due to the time she lived in, women were not permitted the same rights as men. The hypocrisy of the Duke is evident: he is allowed to live in an adulterous relationship with Lady Elizabeth under the same roof but the Duchess is not allowed to see her lover. Nonetheless, the protagonist must 'seize the stone' and take possession of what was being sought in the 'special world' (in this case, Georgiana's quest for the special world of freedom and self-actualization). Since this is 18th century England, the Duchess doesn't exactly 'change the world' but at least she gets her children back, so in that sense she has restored some semblance of balance within her world.<br/><br/>I'm not in agreement with those who disparage Keira Knightley's performance as the Duchess. I found her to be believable and compelling as a woman who heroically asserted herself in the male-dominated society of the time. Ralph Fiennes didn't have much to work with in the role of the Duke. One gets the feeling that the film's writers didn't know much about the Duke of Devonshire historically so they decided to turn him into a stock villain. There was an attempt to mitigate the character's unsympathetic portrait at the end, softening him up by depicting him as being slightly more sympathetic toward the Duchess but it was a little too late. We needed to know more about the Duke—a more nuanced portrait. All we get to know about him is that he liked his dogs and often complained about the food on his plate. And is there any evidence that he actually raped his wife? I think that scene was inserted strictly for dramatic effect but I doubt that it happened.<br/><br/>The Duchess might not be the most original 'period piece' out there, but its focus on domestic violence and how women must cope with it is as relevant today as it was back then."

","The Duchess is a nice movie, which tells us something about the Duchess of Devonshire. I was engaged, how realistic are kept all the traditions, especially etiquette, which were sometimes funny to me (for example the standing up and sitting on chairs). Unfortunately the film became after the first hour predictable and monotonous; love stories appear either from Georgiana or from the duke. It seemed to me that the director has forgotten about other events which could possibly happen. Very interesting are also the actor/ actress performances: Keira Knightley has done (as always) a great job, but I was “captured” by Ralph Fiennes, who represented strangeness and distance. Another plus is soundtrack. The Duchess is an average movie, which does not harm anybody but it will not surprise as well."
"jboothmillard","5","1","1","15 April 2009"," The Duchess
","I think this is one of the only costume dramas I wanted to see purely for the costumes, well, and the leading actress, from director Saul Dibb (Bullet Boy). Set in the 18th Century, this sees Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightley), an ancestor to Princess Diana, marrying The Duke of Devonshire (Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes) at age 17 to become The Duchess. Adored by the public, the same can't be said about The Duke, who it seems is more interested in having a son that much else, and after two daughters, he feels Georgiana may be unreliable. She meanwhile befriends Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), who later is found to be a woman that the Duke is betraying her with, but he is insistent that she lives with them, so uncomfortably, they do, even when Georgiana does produce a son. So with the pressure of an unfaithful husband, Georgiana creates public scrutiny, and falls in love with young rising politician Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). The Duke however is not allowing the affair to continue, even with his own liaison with Lady Bess, and he threatens to take her children away if it continues. So the film ends with Georgiana having her last conversation with Charles, he announces his engagement, but at least she lives happily with the children, and it says in the final text that the Duke married Bess with the blessing of Georgiana. Also starring Charlotte Rampling as Lady Spencer, Simon McBurney as Charles James Fox and Aidan McArdle as Richard Sheridan. Knightley does well as the dignified Duchess, Fiennes may be slightly pantomime villain in his performance, but he still has his moments, and even with not much to recommend, this is not a bad story. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, and it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Make Up & Hair. Worth watching!"
"DICK STEEL","8","1","1","27 December 2008"," A Nutshell Review: The Duchess
","The trailers had tried to market this as drawing some parallels to the late Princess of Wales Diana Spencer's life, given the subject matter being a lady of royal lineage being subjected to a loveless marriage which comes complete with affairs and scandals. It had even superimposed her portrait on the trailer to suggest a deja-vu of history, given that the story here is based on real people and presenting a dramatized snapshot of their lives. Until of course Keira Knightley had to stand up and say that this movie tells its own story without the need for such cheap promotional gimmick.<br/><br/>But frankly, the life of the Georgina, Duchesss of Devonshire (Keira Knightley) in late 18th century England, couldn't be anything less than similar in certain ways, if based on Amanda Foreman's biography which formed the basis for the film. At a young age and to the delight of her mother (Charlotte Rampling), the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) proposes a sealing of families through marriage, where his sole concern is to have a male heir. He wastes no time in impregnating his young wife, and treats her nothing more than a baby- producing factory, given a girl baby after girl baby, in addition to stillborns and miscarriages.<br/><br/>It's also a sign of the times where women have no rights, and are expected to perform their duty, of being a wife and mother, which also translates to having no say to what their husbands are doing. For the Duke, it means spending a lot more time with his dogs with no effort in communicating with a factory worker, and being the sex addict that he is, takes pleasure in bedding chambermaids within his castle, or even the Duchess' good friend Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), who succumbs to trading her body for powerful influences in order to see her children, taken away by her estranged husband.<br/><br/>As with most period dramas, it's a tussle between duty and love, and affairs of the heart. While the Duke's dalliances have taken a toil on his marriage, given that the Duchess one headstrong woman, we slowly see her relent and slide into resignation of her fate, but not before trying to perform a tit-for-tat with her lover, future Prime Minister Charles Grey. From the slate of movies in the period drama genre, it seems that such stories are becoming quite popular to be translated to the big screen, and I recall Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, who was betrothed in similar circumstances just across the English Channel.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley stars in yet another period drama, and she's quite an old hand at it already, which no doubt translates to her delivering her best performance thus far in the genre. She presents the pain of living a lie quite convincingly, having to put on a front in public, while behind the scenes get surprise after surprise at the revelation of her husband's true character. Ralph Fiennes seemed to be quite stoic this time round with nary an emotion, and given he is Voldermott, has no difficulty in playing the bastard of a character, using his influence and power for his personal gratitude, making no negotiations to wanting things his way. In fact, one wonders men in high positions back then, could get away with a lot of things, and their wield of influence no doubt carries a lot of weight.<br/><br/>The Duchess doesn't present its themes in depth, and sought instead to have breadth in covering a broad range of topics, from social standing to England during the cusp of elections, and while it certainly has no lack of material to last its run time, it certainly hinges on its big name stars to carry the film on their collective shoulders. It's a very straight forward film, like watching the life and times of someone unfold in chronology, and those looking for some satisfying, compelling drama with deep tussles involving heart and soul, might want to look elsewhere instead. Nothing fancy here, but it works."
"colonel_green","8","1","1","7 December 2008"," A fine period drama.
","A lot of people think of British period drama as stuffy and boring, a reputation it occasionally does something to deserve, but history is anything but dull, and if you were under the impression that the past was a place of strong moral values and happy marriages that has given way to our current immoral society full of single parents and extramarital affairs, think again. Consider the subject of the life of Georgiana Spenser Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley).<br/><br/>Married young by her mother (Charlotte Rampling, in a wonderfully controlled performance) to William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), the foremost peer of the realm, she finds quickly that her husband (who she met only twice beforehand) is a cold and distant fellow who is only interested in a male heir. Already tasked to mother his bastard daughter Charlotte, she gives birth to two daughters, to the disgust of the Duke, who has a series of mistresses that she tolerates. The Duchess becomes a social marvel, hobnobbing with Whig politicians like Charles James Fox (Simon McBurney) and Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, later 2nd Earl Grey and Prime Minister) and politician/esteemed playwright Richard Sheridan (Aidan McArdle), whose ""School for Scandal"" was based heavily on the Cavendishes' marriage. She eventually finds a close friend in Lady Elizabeth (Bess) Foster (Hayley Atwell), and invites her to live with them, which turns out to have dangerous consequences when the Duke initiates an affair with her, and refuses to expel her. She then finds herself living in a forced menage a trois (subtle humour found in the three of them eating silent breakfasts together). Understandably, she finds herself increasingly drawn to Grey.<br/><br/>The dramatic core of ""The Duchess"" is an examination of the limited social prospects for women in this period (though, as an aside, one imagines a great many poor women from this period would gladly enter a loveless marriage to live like Georgiana does), and their limited legal rights. Both Bess and Georgiana face adulterous husbands who hold over them the prospect of never seeing their children again as a price of leaving; getting her children back is, indeed, Bess's motive for embarking on her affair with the Duke, who, as a powerful lord, is easily able to finagle it. Georgiana, likewise, initially decides to choose freedom over her daughters, but cannot. The Duke, for his part, is a controlling fellow, raised in a very patriarchal worldview; Fiennes expertly shows his emotional straitjacketing, which at odd moments make him mildly sympathetic, though he mostly is not, particularly at the conception of his long-desired son. He's normally at a loss when called to talk about feelings.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley, once again travelling back in time to the 18th century (her fifth or sixth visit, I believe), does a fine job as Georgiana. Hayley Atwell is likewise very good as Bess, a character who walks the finest line between sympathy and dislike from the audience. There's a curious scene included which seems to suggest at a rather different dynamic between the two women, though this doesn't go anywhere. Fiennes, as mentioned, does his best in a rather staid role. Dominic Cooper as the young semi-radical Grey is suitable, though not of the same calibre as the other actors. McBurney and McArdle are scene-stealers in small parts as Georgiana's sympathetic male acquaintances. The set design, as one would expect, is stunning.<br/><br/>While not in the highest tier of British period pieces, this is a fine addition to the genre."

","Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightly) is of marriageable age in olde England. Her parents, especially her mother (Charlotte Rampling) are delighted that she has caught the eye of the extremely wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) and she is under consideration to become his wife. Basically, the Duke has two requirements for his future partner, that is, she must be attractive and she must be very fertile. Providing an heir to his fortune is of utmost importance to this man. After assurances of family genetics, the match is made. ""G"" is astonished and happy to become the Duke's wife, for she has high hopes for a loving marriage. Alas, the Duke proves to be a cold fish who is more interested in his dogs than in his wife, and, apart from an occasional trip to the bedroom, he ignores his young and beautiful spouse. Then, too, although Georgiana proves herself capable of bearing children, two young daughters survive while two sons are stillborn. This is a bitter pill for the Duke to swallow and he brings a mistress into the house, Bess (Hayley Atwell) and expects G to accept the situation. Meanwhile, all of society loves the young Duchess, for few can resist her beauty, charm and wit. No one realizes the unhappiness of her life away from society until she meets an old friend, Charles Grey. In him, Georgiana sees a man who could bring her true love and affection. But, even though the Duke is permitted his dalliances, will he allow his young wife to do likewise? Hardly! This is a beautiful film which celebrates the true life story of the beautiful and remarkable Duchess of Devonshire. In her era, women were the ultimate ""trophy"" wives and were expected to aid their husbands in society but remain strictly under their thumbs at the same time. If sacrifices were required, the women were asked to make any and all of them, even ones that seemed impossible. Naturally, this was a tall order for intelligent and sensitive women like Georgiana, and sometimes sorrow was the result. As the young royal, Knightly is wonderful, exhibiting a totally new performance that shows the great depth and breadth of her acting abilities. Fiennes, too, in a completely unforgiving role, brings such a vast amount of complexity to his part that viewers can not dismiss him as merely a thoroughly loathsome individual. The other actors, including Atwell and Rampling, are all very fine as well. The scenery in London and the English countryside is most inviting and the costumes are astonishingly opulent and of award winning caliber. The direction and script are marvelous, too, and indeed the whole production breathes class and refinement. If you are a fan of historical fare, don't miss this one. You will be enchanted. But, even if you are not a normal admirer of the ""bodice drama"", you will be so enthralled with the Duchess that you will bow to its ultimate power and beauty."

You really feel for the poor duchess, who is trapped in a prison I would not wish on any man or woman.<br/><br/>But in the end, the problem with this movie is the script.

"samkan","4","3","7","2 January 2009"," Just A Poor Film
","I'm guessing this film was designed as a star vehicle for Miss Knightly. I'm not a cruel person but Kiera simply is not up to carrying such a weighty role. I believe Cate Blanchett, Emily Watson or Gwyneth Paltrow would have each had different takes on the character and come out on top. But KK simply doesn't have or has not yet developed the ability.<br/><br/>There's a 1998 film called DANGEROUS BEAUTY set in 15th century Venice which is very similar to THE DUCHESS in that it centers on a women's fixed and extremely limited role in ruling class, aristocratic society (especially the concept of the mistress). DB succeeds because it focuses more on the society itself (not to mention a far stronger female in the lead role).<br/><br/>Rather than say that this film is bad, its better said that it is just weak all around.

"fablesofthereconstru-1","6","2","4","17 October 2008"," The Breeder
","Late in ""The Duchess"", the motif of royals looking out of windows is completed, when The Duke of Devonshire(Ralph Fiennes) watches his children at play, and says wistfully to his wife, ""How wonderful it is to be that free."" This duke, who treats Georgianna(Keira Knightley), The Duchess of Devonshire, as nothing more than a breeder throughout their loveless marriage, gets a full pardon from the filmmaker for his deplorable treatment of this duchess. Although it is true that he, like the fairer Devonshire royal, abides by the limits set forth by their respective titles, the duke holds the advantage of being a man, therefore, his imprisonment comes adorned with benefits not made to Georgianna, the woman. While it's easy to wish for the woman's emancipation from her aristocratic duty, the viewer is required to consider the emancipation of the unremorseful philanderer, as well.<br/><br/>The first time that the duke looks out a window, he's a single royal checking out the goods, as Georgianna, who is just some plain ol' heiress at this juncture, entertains mixed company out in the mansion's garden, unaware that the future is being predetermined by her mother, Lady Spencer(Charlotte Rampling), who agrees with the duke that they'd be a prudent match. Within the window frame, Georgianna is thrown into sharp relief as the other guests are made irrelevant by the filmmaker's use of soft-focus. The isolated girl, a projection of the duke's psyche, is not the object of romantic love like Maria(Natalie Wood) was in Robert Wise's ""West Side Story"", when Tony spots her from across the proverbial crowded room. His feelings about Georgianna can be explicated through the film's use of deep focus, the antithesis of the Classical Hollywood editing style of its day.<br/><br/>In ""Citizen Kane"", young Charles Foster Kane is outside romping in the snow, blissfully ignorant(just like Georgianna) to the decisions being made indoors, as plans are set in motion for the future newspaper mogul to go away and lead a more fruitful life. Starting on Kane, the camera pulls back to reveal the autocratic grown-ups in the living room, thus negating the need to cut between the interior and exterior action. With deep focus, contrary to the Classical Hollywood editing style, viewers are instilled with freedom; they can choose what to look at. In ""The Duchess"", the mis-en-scene demonstrates how the duke's freedom is irrevocably taken away from him, by making Georgianna alone, legible to the naked eye, which apes the duke's mind's eye.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the duke sleeps around. The duke, equipped with little, if no scruples at all, sleeps with Bess(Hayley Atwell), Georgianna's best and only friend. The mistress tries to justify her actions by explaining to the duchess that she traded sex for the power that the duke wields. Bess wants her sons back. At the reunion, Georgianna observes the mother and her male-filled arms apart from the other people, the other objects that compose the scene inside her picture frame. Bess is in focus, because the duchess believes her alibi, since being a mother of an heir, a boy, is the highest role that a woman could aspire to fulfill during their day. However, Bess stays on, occupying a seat at the far-reaching dinner table's midpoint. It's a weakness of ""The Duchess"" that the screenplay doesn't get to the heart of Bess' feigning neutrality: Is the court-wrecker truly in love with the Duke of Devonshire, or biding her time until she can assume Georgianna's title?<br/><br/>The relationship between Georgianna and Bess echoes the two women in Alice Walker's novel ""The Color Purple"", when Bess, the other woman, like Shug Avery, explains to the love-deprived wife that there's pleasure in sex, as Georgianna experiences her first orgasm, like Celie, through the ministrating fingers of the more worldly woman. In the Walker novel, Shug leaves Celia's abusive husband, but Bess' interest in the duke never wavers. ""The Duchess"" seems dishonest about Georgianna's friend; she's a lot more treacherous than the film lets on. Both lovers behave so badly towards Georgianna, ""The Duchess"" annoys by excusing the duke's transgression because of social and political obligations. In that final window, the entire garden scene is in focus; following the logic of his mind's eye and the coinciding use of soft-focus to mimic his interior life, if ""The Duchess"" wanted to redeem this bastard, the filmmaker should have borrowed a page from Steven Spielberg and allow Georgianna to be with Charles Grey(Dominic Cooper), just like how Mister(Danny Glover) reunited Celie(Whoopi Goldberg) with her sister at the end of the film version of the Alice Walker novel."

I doubt you'll be disappointed."
"rdolan9007","7","0","0","17 June 2020"," Slightly better than average period drama based on a true story.
","I was tempted to pass on 'the Duchess', as it sounded like a hum-drum period drama piece which looked pretty but had no real edge. I did hear however that it might be better than I originally thought, and so decided to watch it. While this film is not a great one, I would say it is a good one. The main advantage this film has is that it is based on true events, and that does gives the film some dramatic urgency, something that it occasionally comes close to losing.<br/><br/>The story had it been made up would have seemed too contrived and in a way too clichéd in its depiction of the events in this film. The truth (with artistic license, naturally) revealed by this film is a thorough if a sometimes uninvolving examination of the gender politics of that time (18th century England). It is also by remote implication a study of the systems that reinforce both the suppression and repression often involved in those politics.<br/><br/>The plot involves Keira Knightley playing Spencer who is married to the Duke of Devonshire played by Ralph Fiennes, emphasising her 'inability' to quickly bear him a male heir; a state of affairs which is further complicated by the Duke having an affair with her best friend Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell). In a somewhat awkward turn of events Bess then moves in with Georgiana and the duke, in which the initial hostility between Georgiana and Bess gradually becomes an important friendship again. This in part is due to the rape of Georgiana by the duke, which is mainly heard of screen in a harrowing sequence. To make this cocktail of intertwining relations even more unstable, is Georgiana's 'scandalous' affair with aspiring politician Charles Grey played by Dominic Cooper.<br/><br/>The story despite its complexity is well told, and the predicament of all the characters is nicely illustrated, each one of whom is trapped by the systems of class and codes that imprison them. There is the duke's desperation at not having a male heir in a society which demands it. Georgiana herself being married to the repressed and rake of a duke, who also represses her in turn. Bess Foster is someone torn between friendship to Georgiana and her love of the duke, and finally there is Charles Grey being unable to free Georgiana from the duke, who uses Georgiana's children as emotional blackmail to stop her seeing Charles Grey. Then there is the final sting in the tale; Georgiana has Charles Grey's baby (Eliza) which she has to give up ,and is finally brought up in secret by Charles Grey's family.<br/><br/>The acting is good, although Keira Knightley's performance is not much more than what you might expect of a standard period drama piece. She doesn't do much more than is required, ie look attractive in nice voluminous dresses, and be impressed by the duke's palatial houses. This maybe seems harsh, but in a way that is all Keira Knightley is required to do in this film, and she does that perfectly capably. The film itself doesn't really demand much more of her in this role. The result is perhaps you don't always feel for her plight as keenly as you might.<br/><br/>On the otherhand Ralph Fiennes gives you the feeling this is a duke who is usually repressing his feelings, and not given to emotional enthusiasm, other than to his dogs. The times when Ralph Fiennes does break through the strictures of his rigid comportment are done to impressive effect. The rape scene were the hidden hostility and aggression suddenly surface in his character is shocking. Yet Fiennes still conjures enough sympathy for you to not forgive the rape but understand it in part comes from a system that places unremitting pressure on both men and women.<br/><br/>Hayley Atwell also gives an excellent performance; she seems to portray a natural warmth, that always makes her an interesting screen presence. It is also a convincing one. You can understand how her torn friendship to Georgiana is caused by Bess's love of her own children, which the duke has used his influence to gain custody for her, from her abusive husband. This act makes Bess's affair with the duke more understandable in her initial betrayal of Georgiana.<br/><br/>Dominic Cooper is all right as Charles Grey, although perhaps a little ill-suited for the role. There doesn't seem to be the charisma that would attract Georgiana, but the political scenes are were Cooper is at his best, and as well as that Charles Fox played by Simon McBurney. McBurney is superb in that role, referential and respectful of Georgiana, and the impression of being a canny political operator as well. I did enjoy the dalliance with politics as seen from the Whig perspective in this film; they came across as slightly more radical that the Tories, and it explains why Georgiana's character would be attracted to them.<br/><br/>The film is probably a little too polished and fitfully shallow to be more than an interesting and slightly better than average period piece. There is bite there, but maybe lacks the overall menace of Lady Macbeth, which is not dissimilar in terms of subject. In being a true story it is an important one as well. This comes at a time just before the upper class echelons are being threatened by demands for voting reform, and women are still seen openly as property to produce heirs. It appears to be a far different time and age, and yet the themes of misogyny, rape and abuse in marriage are still relevant. I think this is a good film, and yet maybe slips of the target, rather than skewering it. Yet the final captions for the characters are poignant, sad, and not unhopeful as well. The film therefore made me care about these characters and their fates, which helps temper the reservations I have about the film. I enjoyed the film without being in thrall to it: it is good but I can't say it is a classic of the genre."

Her marriage was the dictionary definition of a gilded cage and there wasn't a moment I didn't want to reach in and slap her husband. The film attempts to humanize him at points, implying that he might be just as trapped by the imperial system, but it was hard to buy that after he rapes her and takes on her best friend as a permanent in-house mistress. The only other complaint I have is that the duchesses affair with her childhood lover isn't given much screentime. I just couldn't see the chemistry and he looked like a dollar store Rami Malek."

","In theory, a more sophisticated period drama based on the true story of Georgiana (Keira Knightley), an aristocrat married off to a loveless marriage with the enormously wealthy and politically influential Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes). She is treated little better than a brood mare in fancy dress but has way to much independent spirit to settle for that and is soon having an affaire de coeur with Dominic Cooper ""Earl Grey"" (yes, he of the tea...). Meantime, the Duke has taken a mistress and so the film depicts how our multiple ménages-à-trois work out. It very much emphasises the (very) limited choices of women in 18th Century Britain - regardless of their status - but unfortunately, save for a few brief appearances by Charlotte Rampling - the characterisations were way too sterile for me.

","On the face of it life for Georgiana Spencer is going to get even better as William, The Duke of Devonshire; the most senior peer in England was to marry her. The problem was he had little interest in her apart from her ability to provide him with a male heir. Their relationship worsens when she produces two daughters but no sons. Life at home may be strained but she is one of the most popular in London society; drawing a crowd where ever she goes and even getting involved in politics. She also draws the attention of up and coming politician Charles Grey; at first they are just friends but that changes after she has produced an heir for the duke and he has not only started having an affair with Georgiana's friend Bess but actually moved her into the marital home. Being that this is the eighteenth century standards are quite different and the duke does not see her behaviour as mirroring his; he is just concerned that the gossip about his wife's affair will become public; he gives her an ultimatum; she will stop seeing Charles or she will never see her children again.<br/><br/>This isn't the sort of film I usually watch but I'm glad I did as I rather enjoyed it. Keira Knightley does a fine job in the title role; showing both the joy and despair of the duchess at various stages of the film. Ralph Fiennes is very good as the duke; a man who clearly has difficulty showing emotions and whose only real desire is to have a son... the only time he appears genuinely animated is when he is talking to Bess's sons. As one would expect from a quality period drama everything looks great; beautiful houses in beautiful settings inhabited by beautifully dressed people; even the numerous servants are dressed in impressive attire. It isn't all beauty though; the way society treats women of the day is fairly shocking and at one point the duke rapes his wife and nobody does a thing. If you like period dramas this is certainly worth watching; even if it isn't your favourite genre you may find yourself enjoying it; I know I did."

Yes there were parallels and I assume that there was that motivation for the movie. However it was more than that, a true story well told. I have never been a great fan of Keira Knightley but she really nailed this one. She went from young innocent to world weary woman through the course of the film and acquitted herself well her best performance since Atonement. Fiennes was great as her unfeeling, rigid husband too and avoided the cartoon villain that he could have been.

Miss C.Rampling is magnificent as her mother,cold - eyed and acquisitive,greedy and grasping,pimping her daughter to a vile man whose proclivities she must have been aware of. There are some jolly moments from Sheridan and Fox,but generally the film is serious in tone,concentrating on Georgiana's determination to be taken seriously as a wife and a political woman.

","This is a serious and fascinating movie worth watching for it's depiction of marriage in its time period and for good performances from Keira and Ralph. There are many parallels with Princess Diana's life shown in the movie like how everyone in the country is in love with her except her husband (especially since the Duchess was related to Diana). This took place hundreds of years ago so like women of the time, she initially accepts the unloving nature of her husband who doesn't talk to her and cheats almost from the start. They really had no choice then as the dilemma of the divorced woman having few rights is shown.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is convincing and chilling as the cold husband. Keira actually acts very well and you feel for her unhappiness especially when giving up her love child.<br/><br/>There are a few faults. Miscasting is one of them. Firstly Dominic Cooper is not handsome or dashing enough to sweep her off her feet. They could have chosen someone with more leading man looks for this role. Secondly Haley Atwell as Lady Elisabeth Foster doesn't look at all like and English rose. She has a more modern multi ethnic look and is out of place. The movie should have gone on a bit longer showing briefly how the rest of her life played out and her various highs and lows like political achievements and gambling problem. Bit too much focus on the menage a trois aspect. Although the costumes are grand the English countryside and houses could have been more beautifully portrayed.<br/><br/>The first time I watched this I didn't enjoy it. Found it a bit gloomy and depressing. But the second time I watched it I had visited the house of the Duchess ""Chatsworth"" and read up a bit about her life and figured out who was who. I appreciated it more and liked it."

","The Duchess was advertised on the back of a very controversial advertising campaign, using Georgiana Cavendish's famous relative Princess Diana as a part of the marketing campaign. Despite this The Duchess is a decent, if standard costume drama.<br/><br/>Georgiana Cavendish (Keira Knightley) is an intelligence young woman from noble stock. At a young age she marries the much older man the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), one of the most powerful peers in the House of Lords and a wealthy landowner. She only marries him so that she could bore him a son. There marriage is complex, the Duke is cold and distance to his wife, particularly when she has daughters and he has affairs, including with Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), Georgiana's best friend. But Georgiana becomes a major figure in England, being a fashion idol and a major supporter of the Whigs (in very loose terms Liberal) party. She is an idealist and she forms a close relationship with politician Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper).<br/><br/>I first thing I had to say is The Duchess is a very beautiful looking film. The costumes are grand and wonderful to look at. I'm sure there was a great amount of research and love and care from designer Michael O'Conner (who deserved his Academy Award). The Art Direction was also of a high end and there was a lot of detail put into this film. They wanted to get the feel for the period. The director Saul Dibb seemed to be influenced by Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon with the amount of candle light shots and wonderful historical settings in Bath and the countryside. Dibb did a good job trying to keep a good pace and there solid attempt to make an interesting film.<br/><br/>There is a good cast and Keira Knightley is growing as an actress. She has proved her talent in Pride and Prejudice and Atonement and she gives a really strong and believable and her range was tested. She is becoming the biggest name young costume actress around. Fiennes was good as always playing a emotionally distance man who only cared about himself. But we do not get to know much about him and is really much there in him. Many of the to other performances were typical and decent in a costumer drama and many of the characters are the usual characters that you would find. Charlotte Rampling has an interesting character as both Georgiana's best friend and the Duke of Devonshire's lover in what is a very complex relationship.<br/><br/>There are big ideas and themes in the film. The phase 'there were three people in our marriage' is taken to a new extreme with Georgiana having to life with the woman having an affair with her hubby. For politics and history nuts there is plenty to sink your teeth into with Georgiana becoming a major political campaigner for the Whigs and reform and even more surprising considering women did not have any say. Political ideas and philosophy were discussed in the film. Sexual politics was also a major theme in the film, showing the hypocrisy of the age that it was of for a man to have a mistress because it was the done but it was social suicide for woman to have affair. The Duchess also show that marriages in the aristocracy were made for political reasons and ensure that a land owner could give their land to a son: not love. If a landowner gave their land to a daughter then the people their married would inherit all the land. No many how intelligence a woman was men still held all the power and influence in the land.<br/><br/>I also have to praise Rachel Portman's string based score, which was fitting music for the time.<br/><br/>But as strong as film as the Duchess is, it does not do anything that stretches the genre."

","First of all, let's celebrate the modern times n the more sensible social customs compared to the biased n grievous conventions of olden times. The movie makes you feel really sorry for the ladies of that time. <br/><br/>The story was pretty fascinating in the beginning but slowly turned into a corny soap opera (Star-Plus anybody?). The sad part? It's a true story, about the real Duchess of Devonshire, wife to the 5th Duke of Devonshire. To be honest, I considered it a regular soap-opera story until I found it was based on real people and mostly facts. That changed my point of view. However, cheesy as it may seem, right before the credits roll, we are told of 'what happened to the characters in the future'. WHO in the world would allow their disloyal husband to marry her friend, and that too 'with blessings???!!' Otherwise, it drew a pretty accurate picture of that time.<br/><br/>The cast was very good and direction fabulous. It was as if they belong to that period, and not the 21st century. The setting, the make-up, the costumes, everything was convincing. I'm not a big fan of Keira Knightly, but for once she performed really well. I think this is her thing- the-sad-victim-of-fate English royalty- and like Jolie, she should stick to roles that suit her and stop going for versatility. She was good in Atonement too, but a sad case as Elizabeth Bennet. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes, like in The English Patient, played his role (the unconcerned philanderer) perfectly. Charles Grey, played by Dominic Cooper is another reason why I loved the direction and the cast. He makes you wish things had been different for him. Well-done, I must say. Charlotte Rampling and Hayley Atwell did a remarkable job too.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a commendable effort on part of the cast and director."
"Lejink","7","0","0","16 August 2009"," A Duchess's progress
","Just another bodice-ripping costume drama...? Well, perhaps, but this latest entrant into a historically crowded field has such a strong narrative (based on a true story, so the legend has it), that taking into account the customary high production values this type of film usually engenders, the final result is a quality movie, with contemporary resonance as issues of child access, infidelity, class division, male-dominated relationship issues and a little bit of celebrity populism and more are presented for our delectation.<br/><br/>The high-society-at-play opening on the lawns of England is merely the entrée to the more serious sport of class politics as aspirant mother Charlotte Rampling thrusts her innocently ambitious 17 year old daughter Keira Knightley into an arranged marriage with the older, colder Duke of Devonshire, old dour-face Ralph Fiennes, rich beyond belief and a major power in contemporary Whig politics whose sole expectation of his new bride is to sire a son to prolong his family line.<br/><br/>Knightley's and to a lesser extent Fiennes' characters' stormy progress from this starting point to a sort of understood peace at the end is effectively the story in a nutshell, taking in, as it does, the affairs of subsidiary characters who cross their paths, like the Duchess's soul-mate, Lady Bess who will go to any lengths, including the bedroom, to win the Duke's influence in getting her infant sons returned to her from her in-possession separated husband and aspirant young politician, later Prime Minister, Charles Gray, the Duchess's ardent admirer from her youth who remains her passion in adulthood plus other contemporary historical figures like Whig Prime Minister Fox and Restoration playwright Sheridan, always making appearances at some grand ball or somesuch. The point where Knightley's character realises she must make the same sacrifice for her children's welfare that she decried her friend earlier in the piece is the nexus of the film.<br/><br/>Knightley is very good as the young ingénue who learns the hard way, despite a native intelligence, just how little prepared she is for her deep-end entry into the man's world of Regency England. Fiennes' journey of self-exploration is shorter, but hints at the later concessions society would make to legitimate feminine demands in marriage as well as society as a whole. <br/><br/>Interior and exterior shots are beautifully set and lit. Many shots are well-composed including variations on the almost clichéd long-table shot of breakfasting husband and wife not communicating with each other. Ditto the costumes and particularly the extravagant hair-do's of the women of the day! I did however find the background music not always redolent of the era and so all-embracing that you often got the impression that a string quartet was playing just off-camera in almost every scene. Too much of a good thing.<br/><br/>A bitter-sweet tale then of female/motherly sacrifice which ends, rightly, on the side of the angels."

Every scene, every movement, every nuance of emotion is painted with the brush stroke of a master. A beautiful, bittersweet tale told magnificently.<br/><br/>I never tire of Ralph Fiennes and here he is at his best. I always rated Keira Knightley as many others may; namely an averagely good actress that is very pleasing on the eye, but on this occasion she excelled herself. <br/><br/>Dim the lights, turn off the phone and if you are not impressed by the end of the movie then ask the Devil for your soul back."
"spambouk1000","7","0","0","10 March 2009"," Ralph Fiennes steals the show
","I am not a fan of Keira Knightley, but in this film she manages to do an okay job. The Duchess of Devonshire was indeed a fascinating woman, and Knightley manages to convey the impression of a woman learning about motherhood, marriage, and love as she matures from a young girl to a strong woman. The scenes with her children are the strongest, especially the heartbreak of having to give up a daughter. I think Knightley does well but that many other actresses could have done better (ex. Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz, Natalie Portman). She doesn't really manage to show wit, liveliness, or shine. Why would anyone think of her bland duchess as a fashion plate? As a light for the Whig party? As the best hostess in London? Knightley rests on pretty, as she often does.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ralph Fiennes does stellar work with the Duke of Devonshire. Fiennes is everything that Knightley is not: he brings to what could have been a flat role a sense of depth and complexity. He shows, as Knightley should have, that power is not everything, and that even the richest man may suffer disappointment and heartbreak. The contrast between his scenes with his wife and those with his mistress and her sons show that Fiennes can embody both a man sleepwalking and a man with heart. I was more interested in the Duke's story (and his mistress's story) than in the dull, poor-little-rich-girl duchess."
"Red-125","9","0","0","17 February 2009"," Why didn't more people like this film?
","The Duchess (2008), directed by Saul Dibb, is a period film with a difference--the events actually happened. Keira Knightley portrays Georgiana, a young 18th Century aristocrat who entered a loveless marriage with the Duke of Devonshire, played well by Ralph Fiennes.<br/><br/>The first surprise of the movie is that Knightley is able to look like the real Georgiana, Dutchess of Devonshire, whose likeness was captured by Reynolds and Gainsborough. The second surprise is that Knightley can act! (It's no surprise that she's strikingly beautiful in lavish period costumes, but I didn't know she had talent.)<br/><br/>I don't pretend to be an expert in English history of that period, but the outline of the plot is historically accurate. In fact, the only overt historical discrepancy I could find is that Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), who is in love with Georgiana, is portrayed as relatively poor and low-born. In reality, his family was powerful and well-connected.<br/><br/>Hayley Atwell does well as Bess Foster, the Duchess's closest friend, and the incomparable Charlotte Rampling portrays Lady Spencer, Georgiana's mother. (Yes--it's the same Spencer family. Princess Diana in many ways reenacted the role of the Duchess 200 years later.)<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, and gave it a vote of 9. The IMDb average for the The Duchess is a mediocre 7.0. This is an excellent film. Why didn't more people like it?"

A true story always wants to make me learn more about these characters and their family and, doing so, learned that indeed Georgina is related to Princess Diana (both Spencer) and 'Three People in this marriage' is a nice reference to her.<br/><br/>Although the movie is mostly on her love/emotional life and didn't dig into other areas too much, I simply loved it."
"georgioskarpouzas","8","0","0","29 January 2009"," A fine movie about a not so tragic story
","Although critiques about this movie have been ambivalent, I was very satisfied with the result. The two protagonists Fiennes as the cold and prosaic Duke and Knightley as the beautiful and volatile Georgianna meet the demands of their roles with success and gusto. Although I lack experience about the manners of 18th century British aristocrats, that is how I imagined them to be.<br/><br/>Knightley is very fine in the portrayal of a leader of society, an equivalent of let's say Churchill's mother in her time, exercising indirect political influence in an age that women could not directly participate in politics. Her love is not consummated, she is separated from one of her children and she has to cohabit with the mistress of her husband who happens to be a personal friend. But still her fate does not seem bad to me compared with how other women lived in Europe at the time. To have a prosaic and non-communicative husband is the lot of most women, although usually he does not happen to be a Duke.<br/><br/>Therefore while the movie is supposed to be a drama, I regarded it more as a comedy of manners. I wonder what moral effect on the servants had the private life of their masters and how the latter prohibited them from rendering it public, although I am not aware of the existence of the gutter press by then.<br/><br/>It seems that Knightely has found her calling in the portrayal of women of the gentry or the aristocracy and I think those characters suit her style very well. I recommend this movie for her presence as well as that of Faines and the people in the supporting roles, Mr. Grey the lover and Mrs Foster, the mistress."

","Keira Knightley is exceptional as Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire. This story may urge you to check some history book pages. Georgiana Spenser entered a marriage based on money for providing a male heir for the Duke of Devonshire(Ralph Fiennes). The Duchess was to endure stiflings demands while keeping the pretense of a happy royal coupling. She was not shy in political circles and was an 18th century fashion plate in a lavish society. Adding insult to her loveless marriage the Duke takes in a mistress Bess Foster(Hayley Atwell). Georgiana, much loved by a nation felt nothing but betrayal from her husband. She allowed herself to fall in love with an ambitious young politician Charles Gray(Dominic Cooper). The Duchess and ""Empress of Fashion"" became subject of vicious rumors in London and would end up facing a heartbreaking choice between love and responsibility for appearance sake.<br/><br/>Cinematography is extravagant. Knightley is vibrant and smoldering as the Duchess. Her eyes and facial expressions speak volumes. Fiennes is strong and stoic as the emotionless Duke.

","A historical costume drama with some powerful performances, THE DUCHESS is the study of The Duchess of Devonshire and her battles with The Duke during their strained marriage.<br/><br/>Little known director Saul Dibb gets a dream cast in Keira Knightley (ATONEMENT) as The Duchess and Ralph Fiennes (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) as The Duke. Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.<br/><br/>By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.<br/><br/>When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, MAMMA MIA!) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.<br/><br/>The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, ""Look at them. To be that free."" His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.<br/><br/>The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.<br/><br/>The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight."

Georgiana eventually falls in love with her friend and politician ""Charles Grey"". They love each other and want to be together but The Duke forbids it telling Georgiana that if she does develop a relationship with Charles that he will basically make their lives miserable and that he will not let her see her children again.I can't believe he would do this to Georgiana since he's there carrying on and sleeping with her former best friend. He was a pig!! Georgiana decides that although she loves Charles, she cannot abandon her children. So she continues to live with The Duke and Georgiana and to proceed on with her life.<br/><br/>This is a very tragic story to me. I mean Georgiana was quite young when she was ""technically"" forced to get married to a fairly older man. She is forced to keep getting pregnant so that she can hopefully produce a male heir. Not to mention her husband was a perverted man who broke her heart and betrayed her by sleeping with and forming a relationship with he best friend. I admire Georgiana for being able to be so strong.

","Unfortunately, The Duchess appears to be quite an underrated film considering the gripping tragic true tale it offers. <br/><br/>The film tells the tale of Georgianna as an innocent young lady who's mother insists for her to be married to the Duke of Devonshire. Dragged into to this new world where she is pressured to produce a male heir by her new unloving husband, her personal life and political take a drastic turn.<br/><br/>Georgianna is portrayed convincingly enough by Keira Knightly, although perhaps begging for an Oscar at times, she manages to perform the full emotions the young Duchess experiences with enough heart. Ralph Fiennes portrays the Duke of Devonshire, although not required to do or say much, he possesses enough substance to bring a sense of presence to his character for the audience to feel angered by his callous behaviour. <br/><br/>Enter Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell playing Charles Grey and Bess Foster. Grey being an old acquaintance of Georgianna for whom she has always had a soft spot and Bess being Gerogianna's new best friend. Both actors play their part well, particularly look at for Atwell's portrayal as Bess to which she plays it with enough kindness in her heart and good intentions despite her devious streak.<br/><br/>The film offers convincing actors and beautiful costumes as well as a gripping plot that is clearly well paced for enough time for us to get to know he characters, relate to them and most of importantly care about Georgianna's life. The fact its a true story makes the film more saddening at times which adds to the human drama and emotion for the viewer. <br/><br/>Overall a excellent underrated period piece that will play with your emotions and leave you more than satisfied by the end."

","I had been meaning to watch this film for a while, but i just never got round to it until i found out my Nan had had it in her film cu board all along... Overall, i thoroughly enjoyed this film.... i thought it was really interesting and i loved the cast, i thought the actors fitted the characters were perfect for their roles...Although Keira Knightley is not my favourite actress, (dont get me wrong, she is fantastic) but Ralph Fiennes stood out, i hadn't seen him in allot of films before, but once i started getting interested more and more in film and the really memorable films in the industry e.g. Schindler's list. his name just kept popping up and up more and more, he is such a great actor as is his brother Joseph and during 'The Duchess'... Ralph really was fantastic, because as the film went on and you saw what really happened in that time period of the 18th century and the way is character is represented makes you realise how horrible men could/can be, he made his character have many sides though, and underneath all the anger and power that the duke has in the film, he is just a softy that is miserable and wants people to get off his back about things. this film has taught me a lot, how the fashion was, the politics and how the government was run, but most of all how badly women were treated and how selfish parents were back then, all because of money and rank. But as i said before, wonderful film, i will definitely be watching it again."

","Saul Dibb's 'The Duchess' is very much a typical English costume drama. The focus here is on the Duchess of Devonshire, Georgiana's marriage to the Duke and her affair with Charles Grey. Dibb's depiction of the marriage is what engages the viewer most. How this loveless marriage costs Georgina her friend, love and, in the end, her freedom is executed effectively on film. However, some of the subplots were underdeveloped, like the romance between Georgina and Charles and Georgina's political influence. The dialogues are well written with wit and sarcasm.<br/><br/>The art direction deserves special mention. The set designs, interior decorations, scenery, makeup and costumes are stunning. The background score, though pleasant to the ears, can be intrusive at times. The cinematography and lighting are brilliant.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley does a fine job. Even though I don't think she's physically the most suitable actress for the role (because of her extreme thinness), her acting here is much better than her usual performances. Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the quietly powerful duke who knows he has the marriage under his control and will do anything he can to keep Georgina within his confines. At the same time he does seem to feel some sadness for the damage he has caused her. Hayley Atwell too does a superb job as the manipulative yet sympathetic and loyal Bess. Dominic Cooper is the one who delivers a poor performance.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Duchess' is a decent costume drama that is stunning to look at. I would have liked it more had the focus of the main story also expanded on Georgina's political influence."

","Keira Knightley is the 18th century aristocrat Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was reviled for her extravagant political and personal life.

Whiles the story isn't the most engaging, it is well directed by Saul Dibb and is an entertaining piece that reflects the social works and aristocracy of the time.<br/><br/>There are other distinguished films set in the same time period, and while this isn't the best example, it's worth 110 minutes of your time, if only to see Ralph Fiennes performance as the bigoted sexist Duke."
"bob-rutzel-1","5","1","2","29 May 2009"," Of little historical importance
","The Duchess Georgiana (Knightley) cannot produce male heirs for the Duke (Fiennes), and takes lover Charles Grey (Cooper). The Duke has his mistress Bess (Atwell), but he still is not happy. Oh, these poor rich people. <br/><br/>One of the reasons I like these English Royalty stories is you get to see the castles and palaces and their gardens, the architecture, the landscapes, and the moats. As for the story, we all know what they are all about. The Duke wants heirs, the woman he marries can't produce, wife falls in love with a non-Royal, the Duke has his mistress and they all live together, sort of. (That's one version and another would be almost the same except they pride themselves on killing off each other to work their way up the Royalty chain. That is not the case here. The first scenario sticks.)<br/><br/>Now, where do you suppose we got all that information? How do we know what really happened back then? Remember all those servants standing around almost everywhere? Well, they got together and wrote tell-all books. All kept very hush-hush. Until now. And, I love this part: This is based upon a true story. See? How do we know? Indeed. <br/><br/>The overall production is good, but very slow and very little T&A (the royalty stories are sometimes good for that too. But not this one). The acting is good, but no surprises and as such the whole thing could have been cut down quite a bit. Too much emphasis on what the women wore, the parties, the wigs and, of course, proper manners. The music was too subdued for this kind of a production. It should have been more prominent. Sometimes I wonder why these movies are made in the first place. Here practically nothing happens from a historical aspect. (But, remember that Charles Grey did become Prime Minister later on). Yes, then the story should have been about him. <br/><br/>But, all that aside, seeing the palaces, the gardens, the architecture, the landscapes and the moats were all worth the price of admission. Didn't I mention that was the reason I liked these English Royalty stories?<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: Yes. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"JoeB131","7","1","2","20 January 2009"," Not a bad movie
","Kind of an overdrawn costume drama.<br/><br/>The problem with most historical films or books is that they impose a modern sensibility to the character's plight. In our modern, post-feminist world, the plight of Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire, seems quite absurd. Her husband can have a mistress, openly display her in front of all to see, but if she takes a lover in secret, it is a great scandal for which she is severely penalized. To us, this seems quite unreasonable, but at the time, people dealt with it.<br/><br/>This takes place in the period of revolution in America and France, but it seems (much like Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antonnete"", history is something that happens to other people. These folks are too busy with their own soap operas.<br/><br/>The costumes and sets are very nice, and BBC productions have come a long way in production values since the 1970's, where shows like ""I Claudius"" or ""The Wives of Henry the Eigth"" were clearly shot on sound stages on the cheap. It's not the ""British Broadcasting Charity"" anymore."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","1 January 2009"," Family and politics in early 19th century England.
","After I saw this movie I did a bit of research to find that the characters are real historical figures and the story told is apparently very accurate.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley stars as Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire. She gained that title when at 17 she married the Duke of Devonshire. At first I thought maybe Knightley was not the best choice for the role, as she is very attractive, but the original Georgiana apparently was a beauty in her own right. In light of all that it may be harder to understand why her husband was so indifferent to her. <br/><br/>Veteran Ralph Fiennes is amazingly good as her husband, Duke of Devonshire. It become clear from the beginning that he only wants two things from her, loyalty and a son as an heir. He seems to have no interest in her, no passion for her, except for what she might provide for him. When she has several miscarriages and then 2 daughters he becomes very impatient.<br/><br/>Charlotte Rampling is good as Georgiana's mother Lady Spencer. And, if that name sounds familiar, that is the same Spencer family that are ancestors of Lady Diana Spencer who became Princess of Wales when she married Prince Charles, and who died in the unfortunate accident in France in 1997.<br/><br/>A key character is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who went into politics at a young age and eventually became Prime Minister in 1830. His role here is important in that he and Georgiana had an affair and a love child after her own marriage crumbled when her husband took up with her good friend Bess Foster. <br/><br/>All in all a very good period piece, and a real slice of English history. It is interesting to see the family and political dynamics and how powerful the wealthy were. Probably still are."

","I must say, I've expected more from this movie. Yes, I've read all the reviews and the connection with Diana & all, but still, I expected something to shine. It did, but it could have been seen from farther, if you know what I mean. Talking about the technical aspects, I couldn't but connect it to Barry Lyndon, though with more action and less playing time, of course. The pictorial scenes, the contrasts and the use of lights truly reminds me of Kubrick's picture. Especially in the couch scene near the end of the movie, where the duchess is seated on the left side of the long couch and lights coming from the window, it is kind of a rip-off from the similar scene where Barry Lyndon is seated in quite a similar manned reading to his son.

","This movie reminded me a great deal of ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" in so many ways. As always, Keira Knightley portrays another perfect performance in her latest film. It is a story about life in the 18th century and a young woman, Georgiana, caught in the middle of a treacherous and debauched society. At only eighteen years of age she is given in marriage to the Duke of Devonshire, making her the new Duchess of Devonshire. Her innocence and lust for life were taken away at such an early age, leaving her trapped in a loveless marriage to a pig of a man! She is forced to compromise her beliefs along with all of her dreams, her constant occupation being her husband's obsession to produce a male heir. When she finally does find love with Charles Grey the Duke sees to it that if she abandons her responsibilities she will be parted from her children forever. In the end, she sacrificed everything for her place in a society that gave nothing in return, and instead lost her chance at love, her child, her identity and even her own husband whom she was forced to share with another woman. It was heartbreaking to see how Georgiana Spencer was made to live her life and how unhappy she must have been. Women were treated like manufacturing machines instead of wives and were dealt with such cruelty and disrespect, especially in a time considered to be noble and of the highest stature. All in all, the movie really helped me to appreciate being a woman today with the rights and freedoms that so many never had in times past. It was a look into one woman's fight to just be herself in a world where propriety forced her to be so many things that she wasn't. An excellent portrayal of one woman's place in history."

","Java Man Reviews ""The Duchess"" (Rated PG-13). Directed by Saul Dibb. Written by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and Dibb, based on the book by Amanda Foreman. Starring Keira Knightley, Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper, Hayley Atwell, Simon McBurney and Aiden McArdle. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com November, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>As the movie opens, 17-year-old Georgiana Spenser (Knightley) is playfully teasing Charles Grey (Cooper), the budding politician who is smitten with her and remains so for the rest of the film. In the meantime, her status-conscious mother (Rampling) is arranging her marriage to William Cavendish, The Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes), a boorish nabob whose only obsessions are his dogs and his desire to produce a male heir. Once married, the young Duchess is treated like chattel and only receives husbandly attention as it relates to acquiring a son. Nevertheless, her irrepressible spirit and inherent wit propel her to notoriety among London's liberal elite. She supports the American and French Revolutions and is an ardent campaigner for Whig politicians such as future Prime Minister Charles Fox (McBurney). She also turns out to be a gifted fashion designer, one who wears dresses today that others will wear tomorrow. But she lives in an age where women have few rights, and this sets the stage for the kinds of conflicts that are a playwright's delight.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>From a leather-clad warrior-queen in King Arthur to a skinny soccer star in Bend it Like Beckham, Keira Knightley has dazzled her way through centuries of British history. And she is only 23. With her recent period pieces Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, one might declare: ""Oh no, not another costumer with Keira!""<br/><br/>But this one is different (and just as good), because the compelling story involves real people, including the title character who is an ancestor of Diana Spenser, the late Princess of Wales. In fact, the plight of the 18th century Georgiana echoes that of 20th century Diana: a young girl marries a much older blue-blood with disastrous results. And, remember that play you read in English class, The School for Scandal? The marriage satirized by Richard Brinsley Sheridan is that of his contemporaries, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.<br/><br/>The casting is dead-on. In addition to Knightley, who is near-perfect, Atwell is beguiling as the Duke's ""other wife,"" while Fiennes manages to maintain interest in a character with few redeeming qualities. The supporting roles provide additional richness, including Rampling's ambitious matron, McBurney's insinuating Fox, and McArdle's subversive Sheridan. Least satisfying is Cooper as Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister (who had a tea named after him). Inspired costuming along with Britain's best castles and estates are put to good use to take the audience back in time.<br/><br/>Princess Diana may bring in the audiences, but they will stay for Georgiana."

","A brilliant ensemble highlights this period drama about one of history's most interesting members of royalty. Director Saul Dibb does an excellent job of creating this extensive, intricate universe and the cinematography and score are the best of the year, but it's really Keira Knightley's performance that drives the film to the level of greatness it has achieved. She is absolutely phenomenal. She's never had a performance with this much fury, both external and internal, and she nails the delicacies of this without a second of hesitation. She knows exactly when to bottle up the pain and express it through her eyes and when to let all of the pent-up aggression out without ever going over the top. A shatteringly emotional performance that remains impressive all the way to the end. I'm tempted to call it her best performance, but I can't manage to say it's better than her work in Pride & Prejudice. Still, it's a close number two in her career. Of course she's not the only member of the cast, and the rest of the ensemble all does a great job of supporting her. The most impressive of that supporting cast would be Ralph Fiennes, whose piercing eyes shook me to the core whenever he came on screen. Two perfect performances in the best period film about royalty in quite some time."

This movie originates from a very touchy story, in which one of the participants was the prime minister of England, and I think the director and storyboarding people are not doing everything they can to present it.<br/><br/>First of all, Dominic Cooper is hideous-looking. His being an actor is a very encouraging example for young people, telling them that being an actor has nothing to do with one's appearance. His presence sure bereaves the movie of any romantic air it can possibly have. That is why I watched the movie with wistful agony.<br/><br/>Good movies convey emotions through the way they shoot them. But I can not detect such techniques in this movie. The camera work was the most tedious and uncreative I've seen in years, therefore when Charles Grey dashed into the house and demanded for Georgiana to elope with him, I felt nothing but pathetic.<br/><br/>Elizabeth's actor is that of Agent Carter, whom I admire ardently. Therefore I would love to give them an extra point for her.<br/><br/>If it weren't for Keira Knightly's exceeding acting, this movie would've got a 3.

","Not having read Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, I'm left wondering whether the obvious parallels with the story of Princess Diana were as pronounced in reality as they are in this film. Georgiana, splendidly acted by Keira Knightly, was herself a Spencer, like Diana -- and like Diana, she is married off to a high ranking personage, the Duke of Devonshire, played by the formidable Ralph Fiennes, who doesn't love her in the least and has only acquired her to produce a male heir. There is also a menage a trois -- inside the house -- involving a woman who initially wins Georgiana's heart and then betrays her with the Duke because that's the only way she can regain the children she lost to a husband less powerful than the Duke. And, of course, there's an illicit love affair between Georgiana and a rising Whig politician by whom she has a daughter that she must surrender to the father's family so as not to bring disgrace on the Duke or her own family. I guess I'll have to read the book to discover how much is true and how much is contrived.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to wonder whether Keira Knightly regrets having earned all that money in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Why? Because it has caused many critics to overlook her very real skills as an actor. From the moment she came to widespread attention as a teenage soccer enthusiast in Bend It like Beckham, Knightly's talent, as well as her remarkable physical beauty, have been obvious. She proved it in Pride and Prejudice, again in Atonement and once more in The Duchess. I trust that she will begin receiving the credit she is due -- even if she did enjoy commercial success in several quite forgettable films."

Keira Knightly is superb, but so is Ralph Finnes -- even though he's required to play a person you'll most likely hold in contempt.<br/><br/>I met Ralph Finnes (fine) briefly in New York. Most screen actors appearing on Broadway are taken to their hotels or homes in a Mercedes or a limo; but not Finnes. He comes out dressed like an ordinary guy, with a shoulder-bag, and jogs down to the Subway.

Keira had some moments that made you say ""this is definitely Oscar worthy"" although from seeing the previews for ""The Changeling"" Angelina Jolie may walk away with the trophy. Ralph Fiennes was very demented and believable in his character yet had moments that you saw he was not happy with himself and made you feel bad for him and the pressure that must also be upon him in producing an heir. Dominic Cooper's emotions were real and when him and Knightley are in a scene together at times your heart may drop.

Ralph Fiennes is getting older. This is more of a supporting role for him, as evidenced by his supporting nomination for a Golden Globe award in the drama category. In the scenes that he is in, Fiennes is engaging. He still has that mean stare after all these years. Cold, calculated, brooding are the best words to describe his performance here.<br/><br/>The picture is uneven at points where Knightley's mother rallies to the support of the Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes). I guess that's just the subordinate instinct that women felt in the 18th century that the writer was trying to depict.

","Normally, I'm not a huge fan of biopics, but I took a gander at this one because of the presence of my all time favorite actor, Ralph Fiennes, and the most talented young actress of her generation in Keira Knightley. Featuring two very strong leads, outstanding tech, and a gripping script, The Duchess is a spellbinding film that showcases a ton of talent and really knows how to show off.<br/><br/>Following the incredibly emotional and true story of Georgiana Spencer Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire and distant relative of Princess Diana of Wales. Georgiana's struggle through betrayal, lies, deception, and her careful walking the line between ""loyalty and personal gratitude"" is chronicled over the course of ten years from her life.<br/><br/>Our main actors here are no strangers to the roles they are playing. Knightley returns to the powerful period piece genre that gave her an Oscar nomination a few years back and even more acclaim in last year's ""Atonement"", while Fiennes is at his best playing yet another memorable villain. Knightley's gripping, powerful, and incredibly strong portrayal of one of the strongest characters ever depicted on film is spellbinding. I knew Knightley was a sight to behold in the looks department, but her ability to almost 'seduce' her audience into loving her character is uncanny and unrivaled right now in the business. The conviction and strength of her performance and character is worth the price of admission alone. Fiennes, known as one of the best villainous actors of all time, throws away the mantles of Amon Goeth, Francis Dolarhyde, and Lord Voldemort for his newest masterpiece, the calm, silent, mysterious, and ultimately disturbing Duke of Devonshire. I don't want to say he is frightening, but at the same time, I couldn't help but become frightened as to what he might do when events in the film didn't go in his favor. His deadly quiet delivery of some of the most cruel lines you've heard will leave your blood cold in your veins.<br/><br/>The supporting cast features Dominic Cooper as future UK prime minister Charles Grey, Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's mother, and Haley Atwell in a role that can be best described as cruel. Cooper's likability as Grey is a key component in the film, despite Cooper being absent for half of the movie, while Rampling is a strong force as well.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about the film is the fact that I felt like I was in the late 1700's while watching. Everything from the lighting (it seemed as if all the light in the film was provided by the sun and/or candles), to simple things like Georgiana drinking while she was pregnant (because they didn't know the consequences of this at that time in history) made the atmosphere of the film perfect. The actions of Fiennes' character are heavily influenced by the time period. Georgiana is portrayed, to me, as a wonderful woman ready to change the world, but she was born in the wrong time period. A victim of circumstance, if you will.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the elaborate sets and costumes, as well as the make-up. It's all Oscar worthy, and if all three don't get Oscar nominations, there's no dignity left in the world. Knightley's extravagant wardrobe, along with picture perfect wigs and hairstyles, coupled with incredibly realistic and terrific sets, add even more to the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>The Duchess may have a ton of very strong points, but it is not without its weaknesses, such as the pacing of the film, which wasn't the best. Though running well below two hours, the film felt much longer because of repetitive party scenes that only serve to make us hate Fiennes more and further build other relationships in the film. I also found the score to be lacking in some parts, but it was still relatively strong.<br/><br/>I don't see the film gaining a Best Picture nomination, but it should threaten in numerous other categories. If you respect the art of film-making, especially acting and the other technical areas, The Duchess will be a shining example for you. It's a gripping story of depression, loyalty, and ultimately, the choices people make. If you like Knightley or Fiennes, or period pieces in general, you'll love it."
"PWNYCNY","10","1","5","11 October 2008"," Beautiful, charming movie. Bravo to Keira Knightley.
","Move over Scarlet O' Hara. Here comes Georgina Cavendish, bringing with her enough emotional baggage to overload a convoy of ships, in an intriguing and engaging period piece movie. Keira Knightley is superb as the heroine Georgina and Ralph Fiennes gives a commanding performance as Georgina's emotionally frigid husband, Lord Devonshire, who must have a son. This movie grabs and keeps the audience's attention and provides a glimpse of what life must have been like for the English aristocracy in the late 18th century. But the central character of this movie is always Georgina as she negotiates the rough waters of a loveless marriage and the infidelity that follows. Georgina is wonderful, she is heroic, she is persevering, she is of nobility yet is a champion of the people and a character who the audience can like and even love. Keira Knightley's performance does full justice to the life and times of Georgina Cavendish, and the story reminds us that despite their wealth and titles, the English nobility were people too."

","Pros:
Well shot
Noce locations a d set design, I'm sure most of the wardrobe and locations were historically accurate<br/><br/>Cons:
Very unlikable characters, our hero is clever, funny, attractive and of good moral fiber and lacks anything resembling a flaw
Full of rich people
No interesting scenes
No interesting conflicts
Pretty wooden a ting from most of the cast<br/><br/>Best part: hair on fire scene, I'm sure theres an interesting historical factoid behind that
Worst part: any scene where people are eating, you know nothing cool is happening when they are eating"

","I thoroughly enjoyed this period drama. Keira Knightley's performance is brilliant, the costumes (her extreme hair) and sets are gorgeous, the true (ish) story involving and Ralph Fiennes is perfect as Georgina's callus, indifferent husband.<br/><br/>This really is Keira Knightley's movie though and she does a fantastic job capturing the charm, intrigue, frustration and (often) scandalous exploits of Georgina Spencer, the duchess of Devonshire in 18th century England.<br/><br/>""G"" was the original ""it girl"" with uncanny parallels to her direct descendant Princess Diana. She was glamorous, popular and adored by an entire country but also haunted by the fact that the only man in England she could not seduce was her very own husband, the Duke. When she tried to find her own way the resulting controversies and liaisons left all of London talking.<br/><br/>I especially liked the multilayered take we get from all the characters here. Ralph Fiennes wasn't just the ""evil husband"", he was a man of his times, giving a complex and sympathetic edge to his character.<br/><br/>I wasn't overly impressed with Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, a flat forgettable sort, for such a heart wrenching love affair. I did like the introduction of Bess Foster as the other woman or other wife as the case may be and definitely felt G's frustration as her husband continued his adulterous liaison right in front of her while at the same time refusing to allow her to have her own, threatening to take the children.<br/><br/>What an involving soap opera-ish storyline with the servants standing and listening in to all the arguments and scandal, forgotten by the players like they aren't even there. 10/12/15"
"love_for_nails","8","0","1","8 September 2012"," Heartbreaking, but brilliant!
","First I have to say that this is very heartbreaking. I can't help myself not to feel sad about women in that period. I really don't know how could they could lived such a life. Rich, but very poor in a way and pitiful. The story was heartbreaking and tragic. But, the actors did a fantastic job. Keira Knightley is a wonderful and brilliant actress, she is just made for these period roles, she nails them in an outstanding way. And she is a perfect ""on screen"" mother. Although she doesn't have a child on her own, she acts like a truly mother when required. I'm a very though person but I must admit that the scene, where little Eliza is token away from her arms, I feel like my heart was ripping apart, even though I don't know that feeling, but the hole point is....amazingly acted and done. Ralph Fiennes, I must be forgiven for this, but I won't praise him much. He is great actor, he did a great job, but I totally hate his character, which is more tragic given the fact that that person existed. And persons like him still exists somewhere in this world. The cast did a wonderful job. It deserved it's Oscar and even much more if it could receive, no doubt! I love the movie, but I can't give it a 10 because the story it's cruel. And it's nobody's fault, it's just a fact and I feel sorry for this.<br/><br/>Worth watching! <br/><br/>8/10"
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","18 January 2012"," The most underrated film of 2008 ...
","I've always appreciated movies set in the eighteenth century for their aesthetic value on the surface and in the content, for their depiction of a world disguising under a mask of elegant sophistication the hideous face of decadence. This kind of ambivalence is so appealing that the odds of me enjoying a period film are generally very high. And Saul Dibb's ""The Duchess"" didn't disappoint me.<br/><br/>I remember the first time I saw it in 2008, in a French movie theater during a very rainy day; I left up the place with delighted eyes and a broken heart. ""The Duchess"" is a dazzling celebration of the weirdest and fascinating world of the eighteenth century's European aristocracy, through a lead, Georgiana Kavendish who, beyond her Duchess of Devonshire title was a real Queen of fashion, and the story manages to betray the very feeling provided by the art and costume design by depicting this world as a golden prison endured by the heroine, played by Keira Knightley in a performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I still wonder why the film was overlooked by the Academy, except for a lousy art direction and costume design nomination (a deserved win) when the epic ""Benjamin Button"" bore garnered much more accolades, I guess the film didn't have much more a drama except for the constant evolution in the relationship between the Duchess and the Duke of Devonshire. ""The Duchess"" might have disappointed the aficionados of the genre who were waiting for suicide attempts, duels, war, anything but bloodshed! But sincerely, even this relative peacefulness is handled with the sincere poignancy of a Bergmanian character study minus the philosophical undertones.<br/><br/>""The Duchess"" never falls in the melodramatic trap because Georgiana is indeed a strong character. In the beginning, while she's playing with boys and girls of her age, her domineering personality leaves no doubts, she outshines everyone. Ironically, at the same time, she's seen through a window by her to-be husband, William, Duke of Devonshire, an affable ad quite-sinister looking Ralph Fiennes and the other girls all appear out of focus, literally. Georgiana's mother, Charlotte Rampling is praising both the physical and intellectual merits of her daughter, promising that she would be a credit to the Duke, as she already is to her, and we do believe her. The core of the story is foreshadowed when what preoccupies the Duke's mind the most is mentioned: having a son, the happiness of the couple would only rely on Georgiana's capability to give a son to the Duke, and history can be very capricious.<br/><br/>""The Duchess"" works on the Fiennes – Knightley total opposition, he's reserved with a seriousness so icy it confines to indifference, while she's elegant, flamboyant with a level of wit that matches her style. During a dinner, she admirably retorts to one politician's pompous rhetoric in one of these particular scenes full of ambiguity, especially when the Duke leaves the party, is he upset by her behavior? No, he simply doesn't fancy these displays of political smartness, he's a practical man, who enjoys the company of his dogs, manly pleasures and more than anything wants to have a son. ""The Duchess"" would eventually overshadow her husband until he'd become the only one not in love with his wife, and the constant irony of ""The Duchess"" is that her popularity would always stop in the walls of her own house.<br/><br/>The tense relation with her husband made of hypocrisy, cheating, and sterile conventions, constitute the golden cage in which she's condemned. One of the merits of the film is to portray not just the hellish marital existence of a woman, but the constant need of love, of friendship consequent to that privation. The nuptial scene is a demonstration of how unaffectionate and careless of the Duchess' nervousness, and in a way, it represents her marriage lifestyle in microcosm, something that invites the Duchess to find other ways to compensate a cruel lack of affection, popularity, fashion, parties, politics, and a heart-warming friendship with Bess Foster, the woman who'd ultimately become her rival, she obviously has some appeal for the Duke, or is it because she had three sons? Ralph Fiennes beautifully portrays the antagonism, pushing the degree of vileness to historical standards that almost make him look vulnerable. Totally, incapable of having sons, his harshness is like the awkward demonstration of his own weakness.<br/><br/>The film doesn't portray the Duke in a harsh way either, in one scene, he's having some time with Bess' sons, teaching the older on the way to use a gun. We feel sorry for a man who can't fulfill his own dreams and by extent, for a couple who seems miserable in its incomparable wealth, both imprisoned by a poisoned dream that never seem to happen. The script manages to detach itself from the 'having a boy' plot by exploiting the real core of the film, which is simply the need of love. When the Duchess lives her first moments of pleasure with Bess and when she makes love with her real lover, the scenes are graphic as to illustrate the real contrast with the nuptial scene. The Duchess feels that this world is capable of love after all. The film evolves into the crucial conflict between what is done in the name of love and in the name of those we love, two elements that sometimes doesn't match.<br/><br/>The film works as beautiful display of real human relationships trapped in a world of conventions and obligations, even more pitiful that they could have been avoided. I wish I'd find something that the movie lacked or that could have justified its overlook by critics and Academy, but I can't  I for one, think it's one of the best of 2008."
"Pedro_H","7","0","1","29 August 2011"," Spirited and stylish costume drama with heart and soul.
","A girl of nineteen (Georgiana Spencer Cavendish played by Keira Knightley) is to be married-off to an older titled man (The Duke of Devonshire played by Ralph Fiennes) as a form of provider-of-male-heir business arrangement (brokered by her mother - played by veteran Charlotte Rampling), rather than as a union based on true mutual love.<br/><br/>Based - loosely - on a true historical story.<br/><br/>(Parallels to the doomed marriage of Diane and Charles being played upon in the marketing and - in my opinion - in some of the acting on-screen!)<br/><br/>I am a bit hesitant over costume drama. Too often the thing plays out like a fashion parade with too little moving central drama to keep my eyes from my watch. This isn't too bad, even though the mounting and costumes ARE still the only real prize winners on display. You feel that you are really going back in time. The well preserved mansions of England doing sterling service to the cause.<br/><br/>To date this is KK's biggest - and most taxing - dramatic role and she handles it very well. A solid and polished performance without needing to clear her mantelpiece for awards. Although hard to believe that she is - later in the piece - a multiple-times-mother. She would have put on weight to play a rickets victim.<br/><br/>Fiennes is better at playing not-very-nice than most actors and here he plays a man with little to no moral fibre. Indeed by today's standards someone for the Sex Offenders Register. Blame his over-privileged background and parents as much as him! <br/><br/>Two previous films came to mind while watching: Barry Lyndon and Amadeus. Films with more money to spend and more plot to follow. This does not give the social context of these films although this might diminish sympathy for The Duchess. Who is - at worst - a frustrated and loveless bird kept in a gilded silver cage, rather than living in the disease, filth and poverty that the vast majority of the population had to endure way back then."
"saadgkhan","9","0","2","8 August 2010"," Another brilliant movie of Keira Knightley. Must watch it!
","THE DUCHESS – CATCH IT ( A ) The Duchess hooked me up from the first scene. It is based upon the true story of Duchess of Devonshire. The whole period era is brilliantly portrayed in the movie. The best part about the movie is that it never lets you bore because the story is so intriguing that you are completely hooked to it. Keira Knightley is truly The Best young Actress around, in every movie she has proved how great and legendary she actually is no-wonder why the whole world is crazy about her. She looked stunning, nailed of the corsets and acted marvelously. Dominic Cooper is a Darling! He is charming and you want them so badly to be together but unfortunately they never did in History. Ralph Fiennes played his part with utmost easiness and grace, which required for the role. Hayley Atwell played her part which such decency that you can't hate her. Charlotte Rampling as Keira's mother did a fine job. Overall this movie is perfect for period drama lovers, another brilliant movie of Keira Knightley. Must watch it!"
"kosmasp","7","0","1","6 August 2010"," Queen Keira
","Although another movie with Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland, which was a period piece, was something I didn't like that much. Especially because I thought that the only saving grace of the movie was Donald S., with Keira not being up to the (acting) challenge. Well this movie proves me wrong (to myself).<br/><br/>Keira is really great in this movie. She pulls off her role quite well. And it doesn't even matter who her screen-""partner"" is, she is always on top of her game. The story is told quite nicely and even the bit players are great. If you are into period dramas, you will love this anyway, but even for people who haven't watched that many, are going to have an eventful watch. As an extra bonus (if you want to call it that), the movie is based on real events."
"newatt-2","8","0","1","22 April 2009"," Costume and Physical Beauty
","I despise the idiots who think that Keira Knightley can play a beautiful woman of any time period before 1980, so despite the fact that I have read a number of books about Georgiana and despite the fact that the time period is one of abiding interest to me, I was not going to watch this film. However, I could not resist the lure of the costumes and so finally I capitulated.<br/><br/>The costumes are often very wonderful and although KK looks like a badly-put-together praying mantis in some of the outfits and hairstyles (particularly the early ones and the taller hairstyles, less so in the hedgehog variations which she quite suits to a 21st century eye) and although she does not resemble Lady Georgiana in the slightest, she does a very credible job of portraying the characteristics of Georgiana as most historians understand her to have been.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, even when she looks divine in an outfit, she still looks nothing like the person whom she is portraying nor like someone who would not be pitied for her face in the time period in which she is supposed to be representing a great beauty."

","Every girl wants to be a princess. They think princesses have many beautiful dresses, a charming prince to dance with and a huge castle to live in. And they do not need to do anything...<br/><br/>The Duchess is a interesting costume drama that shows the real life of Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). When she was 18, she decided to marry much older prince (Ralph Fiennes) whom she has seen only two times before the marriage. She knew that she has only one task: to give him a masculine child, but she hoped that the love come with time. She was wrong...<br/><br/>The movie is rather slow-paced, very sad, but interesting. It proofs that the reality behind the palace's walls is not as beautiful as it seems and the real prince not always is a prince from the tales. Sad is that the movie portraits the duchess only as a unhappy wife. She was also a trend- setter and a politician figure. We see some scenes about it but they are too rare..."

","I saw quite a few comments about this movie being a bit boring and even hard to get into?<br/><br/>The duchess is a wonderful movie, and i would only recommend anything but seeing it, if you are not able to set yourself into a world of emotions. The Duchess clearly isn't made to be explosive but exciting for a person who can feel how the oppression of a woman was at that time, and how this Duchess, who is in the heart of the people. She is so passionate and so emotional, which was acceptable for a woman in that time, that she had to end up falling, but in the end its about how she rise again and get the best out of her life.<br/><br/>""A have to see for every one who are in touch with just a grain of their own emotions"" 10/10 :)"
